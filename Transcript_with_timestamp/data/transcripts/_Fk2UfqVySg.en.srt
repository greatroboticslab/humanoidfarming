[Music]

3
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,779
hi welcome to another episode on this

4
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,180
Frosty morning we're already on year

5
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:34,559
four of pruning my apple trees my three

6
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,239
apple trees

7
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,440
now there's a few things I want to

8
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,540
mention before we get going because

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,760
these videos do tend to be fairly long

10
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,879
one is you don't have to watch the other

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,079
three episodes or parts necessarily it's

12
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,280
just that there's more examples there

13
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,539
plus you get to see the natural

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,340
progression over the years which is

15
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,020
pretty fun or if you want like I said

16
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,059
more examples then they're there for you

17
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,760
I'll put them up in the cards here

18
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:58,620
second is it's going to be pruned to all

19
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,260
of my trees are going to be pruned to a

20
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,940
modified central leader now I have a

21
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,220
video separately for that as well put it

22
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,960
up in the cards and I just go into much

23
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,580
more detail if I had to include that

24
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,280
here the video would just be far too

25
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,560
long and number three

26
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,479
if you mess up if you feel like you made

27
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,799
a wrong cut or whatever don't worry too

28
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,479
much about that it's a good thing about

29
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,400
trees and shrubs and things is that

30
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,799
they're alive and they keep growing so

31
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,000
you can always correct your mistake next

32
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,220
year as long as you don't completely

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,259
butcher it to death then you know have

34
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,420
it die on you as long as that doesn't

35
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:32,880
happen I think you'll be okay so that

36
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,500
said let's get to the first three all

37
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,640
right so this is the first tree that I'm

38
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,579
gonna be pruning

39
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,040
and you can start at one of two

40
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:42,299
places either you start in your main

41
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,840
scaffold

42
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:47,340
where you start at your top scaffold I'm

43
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,979
not too concerned with the top scaffold

44
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,299
I mean I have to select out some

45
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:53,399
branches

46
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:54,479
but overall I don't have to reduce a

47
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,399
height or anything

48
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,020
I'm pretty happy with it

49
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,299
so I'm going to start with the main

50
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,340
scaffold because that is just way too

51
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:04,500
many branches here I've definitely got

52
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,500
to simplify this down quite a bit

53
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,479
I also like to try and keep my bottom

54
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,120
branch

55
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,879
and the topmost branch which in this

56
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,940
case I would consider it to be this one

57
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:20,640
just so that there's plenty of space in

58
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:23,220
between each branch in the middle there

59
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,480
you get the only other consideration is

60
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,819
that with the lowest Branch you want to

61
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,140
make sure that you have plenty of trunk

62
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:30,660
you don't want it to be like all the way

63
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,040
on the bottom maybe like a third of the

64
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,599
way up or something

65
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,700
that should be good

66
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,319
so that spot right there is actually

67
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:41,340
quite nice

68
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:42,840
so this right here is my topmost branch

69
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,040
which is fine there's nothing really

70
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,980
wrong with it

71
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,800
this one however is not as great I just

72
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:52,500
don't like this weird vertical Branch

73
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,239
coming up so quickly after it starts

74
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,120
going because ideally you have it kind

75
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,260
of come out like a 45 degree angle and

76
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,599
then slowly

77
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,340
kind of arch up which this one isn't

78
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:04,560
really doing that either

79
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,620
kind of comes out kind of weird and then

80
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,080
it kind of goes down a little bit which

81
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:14,459
a lot of my branch on the street do that

82
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,200
but overall it just doesn't look as good

83
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,400
there's also this weird Jordan Branch

84
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,840
coming out

85
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,000
so I might as well just prune that off

86
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,360
first because it's

87
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,680
sticking your right in your eye

88
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,680
and then I'm going to prune this off

89
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:33,780
that Crow really wants to be heard

90
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:37,620
he'd like to ideally have a branch space

91
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,900
or Bud space in between each branch

92
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,879
and what I mean by that is essentially

93
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,280
just either if the if there was a bud

94
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:46,200
right here and it wasn't a branch I'd

95
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,780
like to have that in between

96
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,299
the next Branch down below or above it

97
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,620
so if I remove this one then I'd achieve

98
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:54,480
that goal

99
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:57,599
because I know be this space in between

100
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,659
these two main branches that I'm keeping

101
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,220
so start with that

102
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:04,200
when you're pruning you want to leave a

103
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:07,700
bit of your branch collar which is where

104
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,700
the branch thickens

105
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,420
don't damage that

106
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:17,220
leaving the branch collar will allow it

107
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:18,600
to heal over better so I'm going to

108
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,699
break my own rule pretty early on

109
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,680
already I'm gonna make an exception for

110
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:24,540
this one because I quite like it the

111
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,919
only thing I'm going to take off is the

112
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,380
part right here that's rubbing up

113
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,540
against the house and leave this

114
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:33,020
vertical one since it's at the tip I

115
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,020
don't mind it

116
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:37,380
on the next set of branches I already

117
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:38,759
pruned a branch off over here you can

118
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,979
just see the little

119
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:43,020
the little swelling the branch collar

120
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:44,820
right here so that's good there's

121
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,800
already space in between this one and

122
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,240
that one here there's only one thing I

123
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,979
want to change on this Branch here so

124
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,280
let me show you that this Branch it's

125
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:55,500
got this fairly weird Fork thing going

126
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,139
on I don't particularly like that I want

127
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,120
it to be focusing its growth on the

128
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:02,340
upper portion so I'm just going to

129
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,900
remove this lower portion and that's

130
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,660
pretty much all I'm going to do to that

131
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:08,100
again leave a little Branch the bench

132
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,800
collar there

133
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:13,020
just like so

134
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,680
and that'll do it for that Branch see

135
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,680
the guy up there

136
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,979
it's been there for hours

137
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,580
I think he's here to stay

138
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,720
it has been several hours now

139
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,740
because there were just far too many

140
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,240
interruptions

141
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,000
but it looks like it's died down a

142
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,759
little bit so uh let's keep going back

143
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,560
here is a branch node that I or a branch

144
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:36,720
that I removed last year but the note is

145
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,880
still there so there's a good spacing in

146
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,560
between these two branches here but as

147
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,259
you can already tell these two branches

148
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,360
are directly competing and so one of

149
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:47,639
them has to go I'd like to keep my

150
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,940
lowest Branch it's flowing out fairly

151
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:52,400
decently so I'm just gonna go with this

152
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:54,840
Branch here

153
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,699
uh that'll also free up this little area

154
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,139
in the middle here as well so let's just

155
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:03,139
remove that now

156
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:03,139
leaving that Branch caller intact

157
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,580
like that there's only a couple things

158
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,979
left to do so the first thing is you can

159
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:13,560
see that this branch is really long way

160
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:16,740
too long in fact

161
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,539
it's also kind of a fork I guess because

162
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:21,780
you got another one coming off here this

163
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:22,979
Branch this branch is fine curls up

164
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:25,440
quite nicely

165
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:27,720
well with this one I just wanna

166
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,660
bend it over so it effectively comes out

167
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,280
straight from the trunk

168
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:35,520
and I also want to prune it back because

169
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:37,380
it is so long to a breath to a bud at

170
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,940
least but in this case it looks like

171
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:42,180
it's a little fruit bud

172
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:44,100
that grows more upright so I can start

173
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:46,500
start to curve up

174
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:49,020
kind of like what's happened here but it

175
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,000
just happened too far down

176
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,319
and it also ended up drooping quite a

177
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,500
bit so I'm just going to tie it up for

178
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:58,500
this time around so first thing

179
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:01,380
pruning it to this butt here a fruit

180
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:03,479
spur it's not a vegetative bud so there

181
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:05,880
goes

182
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:08,280
the next two cuts are just to bring it

183
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,900
back in a little bit more and also just

184
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,280
to kind of remove weird branches because

185
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:14,100
you look at this one

186
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,380
so bizarre but it has a branch that kind

187
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,759
of grows up it's vegetative which is

188
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:20,400
good

189
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,560
like the fact that this is a fruit Bud

190
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,240
means it's not going to start curving up

191
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,740
as as much but we'll see what happens

192
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,720
with that

193
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,759
but this one is vegetative

194
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,639
so I'm just going to remove this lower

195
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:35,039
weird branch

196
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,900
all the way back

197
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:40,139
to that one there

198
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:42,000
and then the other one has a weird Fork

199
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:43,919
coming out if you remember a lot if

200
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,840
you've watched last year's video I

201
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,940
removed several of these another one

202
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,520
formed so I'm just going to remove this

203
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:52,380
one as well and it'll end up in a fruit

204
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,840
Bud which is not ideal I'd rather have

205
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:59,479
this be a vegetative bud but for now

206
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,479
this will do coming in on an angle there

207
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:05,940
and snip it off so that's looking

208
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:08,460
much more manageable now

209
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:10,259
the next thing I'm going to do is just

210
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,819
remove

211
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:13,620
kind of what I did down below but just

212
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:17,280
leave essentially a

213
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:19,500
Branch note or butt space in between so

214
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,479
like I'm going to remove this one is

215
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,000
this is the top right here

216
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:27,240
so I'm going to remove that one

217
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,240
to give the one back there space

218
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,099
I'm going to remove this one to give

219
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,680
this one up here space

220
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:36,419
because these are all fruit buds I'm not

221
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,740
really worried about leaving those

222
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:39,180
so I'm just going to leave those where

223
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:42,380
they're at

224
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:42,380
that Branch caller

225
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,260
the next one

226
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:50,700
I will just remove this one as well

227
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:52,380
because I have plenty of branches down

228
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,959
below if I ever need to replace it so

229
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,100
that's looking a lot better I am very

230
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,560
pleased with that

231
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:02,220
before we move on

232
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:04,080
there's a fruit Bud down below here

233
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,060
but there's a branch that comes out

234
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,459
right here that's trying to compete with

235
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:10,920
the main leader I don't want that so I'm

236
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:13,440
just going to remove that branch and try

237
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:16,680
not to damage the fruit bud that's right

238
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,440
beside it which is actually

239
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,420
a separate Branch so see if I can do

240
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,959
this without damaging up fruit Bud

241
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,959
beside it

242
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,820
all right there we go free Bud's still

243
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,959
intact

244
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,959
that looks a lot better

245
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,760
with the next treat there really isn't

246
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,100
that much that I've got to do

247
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,720
as far as the lower scaffold goes

248
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,040
because it's pretty much all done in

249
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,720
previous years

250
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,580
like for instance

251
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,620
this Branch here was removed last year

252
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,000
and then these two branches now have

253
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,740
plenty of space

254
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,540
there's a butt over here so this one has

255
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,980
plenty of space same thing with this one

256
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,540
and then there's a fruit bud I'm just

257
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,580
gonna let that do its thing

258
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:16,140
so nothing too crazy

259
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,580
honestly in the main scaffold the only

260
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:21,000
thing I want to do

261
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:23,160
is just pruning back this long squiggly

262
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,899
part it's just way too long

263
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,820
honestly I would like to remove it even

264
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:29,160
further than what I'm going to but for

265
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:31,019
now I'm just going to prune it back

266
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:34,140
probably

267
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:35,880
to this fruit butt over here

268
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,080
and we have a lot of other options I

269
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,060
thought about going back to this one

270
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,040
because this is also fruit bud so I will

271
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:43,200
lose a couple fruit buds

272
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:47,060
but that's okay I'm gonna prune it back

273
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,060
to here for now so here we go

274
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,880
that really just leaves the top scaffold

275
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,160
here and as you can see there's a lot of

276
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,440
branches so one of the first things that

277
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,240
I like to do is just identify which

278
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,160
branches you like the most

279
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,800
for instance for me

280
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,660
this Branch here I really like

281
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,100
it competes with the top which is that

282
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,839
Branch there that leader that's the

283
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,940
leader there

284
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:12,540
so getting branch that compete with it

285
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,620
will help keep it small or manageable I

286
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,660
suppose

287
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:17,940
same thing with this one I like that one

288
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:20,700
a lot as well

289
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:23,040
and then the one in the back it comes

290
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:25,440
out a little weird which I don't like

291
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,000
but of all the branches this one is a

292
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,800
pretty good one as well

293
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,160
and they all go their own

294
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:34,320
Direction I also really like this one

295
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,120
but um I'm probably gonna have to remove

296
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,220
it unfortunately because you can see

297
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,019
it's either this one or that one and I

298
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,040
like them both so that way you got to

299
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:43,860
make choices

300
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:47,640
the top scaffolds all that's left

301
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:49,560
and I'm going to first remove fairly

302
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,779
obvious branches that I know I want to

303
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:54,180
remove so for instance I have this

304
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:55,860
branch that is essentially the same as

305
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:58,980
this one but this one is just far

306
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:01,140
stronger and I like it a lot better

307
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,060
so I'm just going to remove that one

308
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:06,600
small one

309
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:09,540
leave the little Branch collar there

310
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:12,360
that can come off

311
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,140
so that leaves space for this larger one

312
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,579
here

313
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,600
and then I'm going to remove this small

314
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:17,760
one here because I don't need that

315
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,040
either

316
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,899
like so

317
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:25,079
which leaves space

318
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:28,560
for this one back here the next is that

319
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:31,800
fairly major Branch here

320
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:34,920
leave the branch collar intact

321
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:37,079
and snip now the other one I want to do

322
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,480
is this one here it's a vegetative

323
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:41,100
branch

324
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,660
so I'm just gonna

325
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,300
open that off and I'll leave this one

326
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:49,200
for now I'll leave

327
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:51,420
uh this one and that one it's not really

328
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,399
hurting anything so

329
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:55,019
those branches can stay

330
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:57,959
all right so the last thing on the

331
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:59,639
agenda for this tree is to Simply remove

332
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:02,100
the height a little bit on it because

333
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:03,660
it's it's fairly tall a little bit too

334
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,700
tall even for me

335
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,779
and this branch in particular kept

336
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,579
getting caught underneath the garage

337
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:09,600
door here so I'd really like to reduce

338
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:11,339
that

339
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,860
so let's start with that

340
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:17,519
now I'm going to remove them or prune

341
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:19,440
them down to these fruit buds here

342
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,660
so first

343
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,120
take it out of that

344
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:26,279
that means it probably won't get too

345
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:29,339
much taller than what they are

346
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:32,820
but it's all right and on here I kind of

347
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:34,620
want to keep them fairly equal so I've

348
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,540
got a bud

349
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:38,100
just right there which means I'm

350
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,000
essentially pruning off last year's

351
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,579
growth

352
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,980
and the whole Branch here is loaded with

353
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:45,660
fruit buds so that's kind of nice

354
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,940
just like that

355
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,839
I'm gonna prune it back to that one

356
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,880
there

357
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:52,880
I don't mind this being still the

358
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,860
tallest

359
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,860
and then lastly this one doesn't look

360
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:01,639
like it has fruit buds on it until quite

361
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,639
a bit lower down

362
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,399
um

363
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:07,200
I mean I kind of want to remove at least

364
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:10,320
a tip of it

365
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:12,540
so bring it down to the same Heights

366
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,839
maybe down to there

367
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:17,519
just a tip mostly all right so it's the

368
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,720
next day now yesterday I was just doing

369
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,459
the interruptions between the kids

370
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,440
playing it ended up riding for a while

371
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:23,940
and then there was also landscapers out

372
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,880
there with leaf blowers and things like

373
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:28,200
that just making way too much noise so I

374
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,700
had to count it yesterday but we're

375
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:33,600
gonna go back out there and finish up

376
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:35,700
that last tree all right so there it is

377
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,920
it is raining currently looks like it's

378
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:40,620
picking up a little bit actually

379
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:43,740
we should still be fine to finish it up

380
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:45,300
but we probably shouldn't dildo too long

381
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,339
all right so as far as the lower

382
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,139
scaffold there really isn't a whole lot

383
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:52,740
that I would change the only thing that

384
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:55,139
I did do is to the branch that I like is

385
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:57,360
I tied it up

386
00:14:55,139 --> 00:15:00,839
so that

387
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,880
it comes up a little bit more and it

388
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:05,399
doesn't stick out so much

389
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:08,399
I may end up removing

390
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:09,300
this vertical Branch here maybe both not

391
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,519
sure yet

392
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,660
but yeah that's really the only thing I

393
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,760
would do to it

394
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:16,800
the other Branch I like as well

395
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:19,680
the only thing I don't like is how there

396
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,839
isn't a butt space or Branch note in

397
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,220
between these two branches that's a

398
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,540
little unfortunate but there isn't much

399
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,980
I can do about it yet I don't really

400
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,720
have a lot of options

401
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:30,720
so maybe a future years when some of

402
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:32,760
these develop I would change that out

403
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,740
and there's a lot of

404
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,480
fruit buds on here so I just kind of

405
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,100
want to leave that this year

406
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,560
yeah like I said next year that might

407
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:43,320
change so you're looking at the main

408
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:46,079
scaffold right now the top scaffold to

409
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:48,720
be exact and this right here that's my

410
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:52,199
leader which I like

411
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,760
this one beside it I also like

412
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:55,740
but then you notice

413
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,660
I kind of want to remove this one right

414
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:00,480
because you want to keep a space in

415
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:01,920
between every single Branch or butt

416
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,240
space Branch note in between every

417
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,040
single branch

418
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:08,880
but this one also happens to be

419
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,980
essentially the same as this one here

420
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,680
however this one has fruit buds all over

421
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:15,060
it and um it's just a better more

422
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,820
developed Branch than this one is

423
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:19,079
obviously this one is a lot smaller so

424
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:21,899
this one is definitely going to be

425
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:23,459
removed in favor of that one so let's

426
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:27,180
start with that

427
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:29,839
let's come in leaving our Branch collar

428
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,839
like so

429
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,940
and then the one below it

430
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:37,440
it's not bad

431
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,120
probably leave it the one that I don't

432
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,759
like however

433
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,680
is this main one it has a lot of fruit

434
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,079
buds you can see it has fruit buds all

435
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,940
over it it's kind of unfortunate but as

436
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,680
you can also see there is not really a

437
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,959
lot of space these branches are

438
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:55,139
extremely close together which I don't

439
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:56,579
really want so I'm going to remove this

440
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:58,560
one here gave you a little bit of a

441
00:16:56,579 --> 00:17:00,899
better view of it but yeah as you can

442
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,000
see it's way too close together it

443
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:04,679
doesn't make sense to keep them both I

444
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,660
was going back and forth between keeping

445
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:08,640
this one or that one but I just really

446
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:10,319
like the way that this Branch arches as

447
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,000
compared to this one this one is kind of

448
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:14,100
weird and wonky you can't quite see it

449
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,959
it's just out of frame but it doesn't

450
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:17,760
flow as well

451
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:20,959
so I'm just going to remove that leaving

452
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,959
a branch collar again

453
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,959
now the next one you can see quite clear

454
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:30,000
clearly already is that these two

455
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:31,919
branches are essentially growing the

456
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,380
exact same way which means you just want

457
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,600
to ideally pick one or the other

458
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:39,120
so I'm just gonna pick this one here I

459
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:41,220
like that one better

460
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:44,299
so I'm just going to remove that right

461
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:44,299
at the branch collar again

462
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,960
there are a lot of branches that are

463
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:50,520
growing left as you can see here all

464
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,720
these Branch are growing left and that's

465
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,460
really one of the reasons why I was

466
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,020
trying to hold on to this one here

467
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,340
just because it's one of the few that

468
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,140
was going right

469
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,820
so hopefully in future something will

470
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,860
develop I do have this small little

471
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:04,200
Branch here that may end up becoming

472
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:06,179
that Branch I also like this one here

473
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,400
that's coming towards you but I really

474
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:10,620
just don't need these two here so I'm

475
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,460
going to remove those two in favor of

476
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,460
this larger one here

477
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:19,039
turn that off

478
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,039
prune the one beside it

479
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:23,340
so really the last thing that I would

480
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:25,440
like to do this tree I should just

481
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:27,960
reduce the height a little bit

482
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,039
now this to take this branch is an

483
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,620
example

484
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:34,919
this branch is two years old

485
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:37,020
uh the first year grew up to about here

486
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:40,200
and then the second year it grew the

487
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:42,480
remaining of that Branch there so all

488
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:45,299
these buds over here that you see are

489
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,340
fruit buds so this was two years ago

490
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:49,200
this was first Year's growth and then

491
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,520
the last little big group last year I'm

492
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,740
essentially just going to remove last

493
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,900
year's growth so if I take this Branch

494
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:57,480
as a guide

495
00:18:54,900 --> 00:19:02,059
go to remove this to

496
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,059
right above that first food butt there

497
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,140
and then I'm gonna prune

498
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:09,059
the other ones to be kind of similar to

499
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:11,940
that size

500
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:14,039
so prune that one off

501
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:16,500
to a favorable

502
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:18,720
node there

503
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,460
same thing

504
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,160
with one beside it

505
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:25,380
it's gonna take the tip off

506
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:28,220
just like so so

507
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,220
and that will do it

508
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:33,780
all right so I'm happy with that

509
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:36,480
and this next growing season we'll see

510
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:38,820
what develops and see if I can maybe get

511
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,640
a branch growing that way somewhere

512
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:43,620
that'd be nice to kind of fill it out

513
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,240
although I guess that main scaffold

514
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:47,280
branch is actually filling that space

515
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,780
pretty well right now

516
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,799
but that'll be something that I'm going

517
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:52,020
to look for

518
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:55,080
next year

519
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:56,700
we'll get there when we get there

520
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,799
I feel like all these other buds in here

521
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,780
they're fine most of these are fruit

522
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,580
buds there are some vegetative ones I

523
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:05,039
may end up removing that you can

524
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:07,799
certainly if you want to

525
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,840
so anyway with that said

526
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:12,000
thank you all for watching

527
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:15,000
and I'll see you in the next one

528
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
foreign
