00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:17,630
hi my name is not Raylan I'm the owner

3
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:19,670
of Serrano creepazoid Limits during my

4
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:21,680
day I receive a wide range of phone

5
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:25,340
calls from folks about how to use

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,259
compost in their gardens and it seems in

7
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:29,779
the last few years as we've been

8
00:00:27,259 --> 00:00:32,899
transitioning to irrigation systems that

9
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:35,060
conserve more water at the same time

10
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:37,310
more folks are just not getting the

11
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:40,220
results with our product that they

12
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:42,380
historically have been getting so I've

13
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:44,750
made this video as a way of trying to

14
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:48,050
explain the role between water

15
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:52,220
conservation irrigation systems compost

16
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:55,550
soil health and plant vitality the

17
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:57,260
answers for this video come from my own

18
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,510
experience here in my own yard

19
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:02,990
where I use a variety of irrigation

20
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:05,720
systems as well as visiting many of your

21
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:08,360
gardens and seeing how you irrigate do

22
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,799
you stay to the end of this video you'll

23
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,320
definitely have a much better

24
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:15,469
understanding of what goes on

25
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,359
underground how that underground is

26
00:01:15,469 --> 00:01:20,569
affected by the type of irrigation you

27
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:24,590
use and ultimately the vitality of your

28
00:01:20,569 --> 00:01:26,990
garden so let's get started if you think

29
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:29,810
dirt is only made up of rock and sand

30
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:31,789
and clay how wrong you are living in

31
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:34,399
that dirt are literally trillions of

32
00:01:31,789 --> 00:01:36,079
organisms and it is their presence that

33
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:38,329
converts the organic matter on the

34
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,520
surface those leaves that bison manure

35
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:42,649
into food that feeds your plants and the

36
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,840
amount of life that exists underground

37
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:46,819
is orders of magnitude much more dense

38
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,499
that would exist above ground but

39
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:50,270
because we live above ground we give

40
00:01:48,499 --> 00:01:52,009
little thought what happens below ground

41
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:54,649
so I'm gonna change your terminology

42
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:57,469
going forward dirt is what stains your

43
00:01:54,649 --> 00:02:00,020
genes of plants live in soil so soil is

44
00:01:57,469 --> 00:02:02,359
the dirt portion the rock the sand the

45
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:04,700
Clay's but it's also the water organic

46
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:06,859
matter in the organisms and we use that

47
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,690
term soil understanding this

48
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:10,250
relationship is so important that you

49
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:12,290
may want to stop this video right now

50
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:14,360
and watch one of the two videos I've

51
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:16,550
shown on the screen that's possible that

52
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,320
video may expire when you actually watch

53
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:21,020
this but no doubt you'll find other

54
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:23,100
videos by dr. Langham and Jeffrey Lewin

55
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:25,320
fellows they really give you a true

56
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,910
appreciation of how complex and how

57
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,620
important the organisms that live in

58
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:30,560
your soil are to the success of your

59
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,190
plants so let's look at an actual

60
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,080
cross-section of Sol

61
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:36,000
we start with dirt and on top of that

62
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,980
dirt is somewhere on organic matter

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,080
meaning some set of carbon-based matter

64
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,330
it could be from fallen leaves buffalo

65
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,850
manure or maybe compost we made from our

66
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:47,280
kitchen scraps into that a few seedlings

67
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:49,260
have sprouted there's a large fungal

68
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,550
mass associated with the roots of our

69
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,650
little seedling so we're going to put

70
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,180
those in that there are billions of

71
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:56,040
bacteria that break down the organic

72
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,320
matter that helps feed the soil

73
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,610
organisms and just for graphic purposes

74
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,890
we're gonna add some amoebas and

75
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:04,020
earthworms and centipedes and pull bugs

76
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:06,060
just the name of you in all these

77
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:07,710
organisms either feed from the organic

78
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,930
matter that's on the surface or

79
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:12,660
secondarily feed from those who bring it

80
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:14,850
into the soil and very important these

81
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:17,520
organisms just like you and I require

82
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:19,710
water to survive as well as to move

83
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,630
about so let's see what happens in our

84
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:23,550
simple graphic it rains and that rain

85
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:25,620
travels through the surface organic

86
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:27,930
matter into the soil below and while

87
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,030
this may seem very elementary when this

88
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,190
organic matter is wet enough a few of

89
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:34,290
our worms and pill bugs etc will move

90
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:36,270
into it consume it and then bring it

91
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:38,280
into the soil also very important

92
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:40,140
remember that soil must have moisture

93
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,360
for those organisms that live in the

94
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:44,610
soil who remain alive when there's a dry

95
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,500
area the organisms either die move away

96
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:48,300
from there if you think to an earlier

97
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,740
time in our lives our home irrigation

98
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,960
systems were pretty close to natural

99
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:54,000
rainfall looking at our graphic we can

100
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,650
see that while it is not truly rainfall

101
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,270
coming from the sky these robust

102
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,070
wrinkler systems were able to wet

103
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:01,260
everything and provide the moisture

104
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:03,780
content the soil organisms needed to

105
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:05,700
continue on so in the first step towards

106
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,980
water conservation we took the same

107
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,930
concept of these overhead sprinklers and

108
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,640
reduce them to much smaller versions of

109
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:13,050
the larger ones so if we look at our

110
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,790
graphic we see what happens when we

111
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:17,040
start using these sort of micro spray

112
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:18,989
systems so how does that soil change

113
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,660
when we go from the old standard

114
00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:24,030
above-ground water everything method to

115
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,860
these new micro systems what we see is

116
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:28,080
that we start to get dry spots in

117
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,670
between the various sprinklers as these

118
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,340
become more pronounced the soil

119
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:34,560
organisms leave these dry areas total

120
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:36,390
population Falls and hence eventually

121
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,820
less nutrients are available for the

122
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:39,100
plan

123
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:41,320
while we may change our sprinkler system

124
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,300
all in one day the drawing of these

125
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,400
areas could take months maybe more if

126
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,900
you go through a few rainstorms we will

127
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,060
likely go through a honeymoon period

128
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,340
where the plants are thriving that was

129
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:53,770
so much less water how wonderful a new

130
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,630
irrigation system is that's a false

131
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:57,010
economy because eventually those dry

132
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,750
spots will start to form

133
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:01,030
you also notice that portions of the

134
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,800
surface organic matter are no longer wet

135
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:04,780
and without this moisture the very

136
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,880
organisms that were consuming it will

137
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:09,010
leave for wet areas their numbers will

138
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,230
dwindle as the amount of damn compost is

139
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:13,240
reduced the dry organic matter will no

140
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:15,280
longer support a vibrant soil it will

141
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,570
become hard and brittle and it makes

142
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,070
sense that you would think hey the

143
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:20,260
reason my yard is not doing well because

144
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:22,960
this compost is terrible let's look at a

145
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:25,210
simple chart comparing damp areas versus

146
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,430
dry areas so first we begin with a

147
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:29,320
natural setting or old-fashioned

148
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:31,360
thoroughly irrigated area and with

149
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:33,370
plenty of water the bacteria and fungi

150
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,770
flourish they're bright products open up

151
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:37,780
the soil allowing oxygen and water to

152
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:39,880
easily get to those organisms that live

153
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,140
in the soil and hence those produce more

154
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,670
nutrients for our plants and

155
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,260
everything's looking good now let's look

156
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:47,080
what happens when we turn off the water

157
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:49,240
the bacteria and fungi die off and soil

158
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,790
structure begins to collapse as it

159
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,830
collapses becomes more compacted oxygen

160
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:56,140
and water cannot get to the organisms

161
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:58,240
and soon anaerobic organisms colonize

162
00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:00,130
the soil their byproducts don't create

163
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,810
plant food but instead create poisons

164
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:04,120
such as alcohols and acids which

165
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:06,280
eventually either stress or kill our

166
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,350
above-ground plants remember all this

167
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,840
takes time months or years after an

168
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:14,350
irrigation system has changed in soil

169
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:16,510
dry means dead back to our irrigation

170
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:18,730
story in an effort to save more water

171
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:20,650
we've moved from these micro spraying

172
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:22,600
systems to drip systems by now you

173
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:24,460
realize that the volume of soil that

174
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,350
supports a plant can be hundreds of

175
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:28,600
times larger than the above-ground plant

176
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:30,640
yet somehow we believe that a sink or a

177
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,250
few prepping emitters can support a

178
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:35,470
thriving soil does not make sense as we

179
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:37,120
see with these systems the dry zone is

180
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:38,620
further increased so how do these

181
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,660
systems get installed they don't make

182
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:42,340
sense I think it's because we view the

183
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,990
world through our own experiences and

184
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,730
when we're thirsty we can meet all our

185
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:47,919
water needs through a very small pore

186
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:49,350
called our mouth but as we know plants

187
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,690
do not absorb water this

188
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:53,640
they require a very large diffuse area

189
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:55,110
if you took time to watch either of

190
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,420
those two videos you've come to

191
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:59,520
understand it takes a lot of soil to

192
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:01,650
support a plant in an area far far

193
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,420
larger and what we see above-ground I

194
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,950
have visited struggling Gardens where

195
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:06,660
the homeowner is baffled at what is

196
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:08,670
going on that's because they have

197
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,710
reverted from traditional systems that

198
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:12,720
watered all the soil to maybe one or two

199
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:15,000
emitters placed at the base of a very

200
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,530
mature tree and as we see this cannot

201
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,500
possibly work continuing with our

202
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:21,480
irrigation story inline drip systems by

203
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,550
these few photos we can clean these wet

204
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,230
versus dry areas and these systems

205
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:27,150
suffer from the same problem as

206
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:29,670
conventional existence at large dry

207
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:32,460
areas here's another effect we need to

208
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:34,650
look at changing soil composition so we

209
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:36,780
may have installed an over designed drip

210
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:38,580
system that did in fact water all of our

211
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:40,530
soil but recently it seems like our

212
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,270
plants are really struggling as we saw

213
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:44,310
earlier it could be that there was

214
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:46,230
leftover soil moisture from the old

215
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:47,910
system that took a while to be used up

216
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:49,950
but another explanation could be that

217
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:52,620
we've worked hard to improve the organic

218
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:54,150
levels in the soil and that very action

219
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,010
has damaged the efficiency of this

220
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:58,080
system so let's see how that happens if

221
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:59,940
we compare clay in sandy soil they're

222
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,800
very different place oils tend to be

223
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,970
very compacted so that water is very

224
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,100
slow to sink in

225
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:07,320
hence water will tend to spread over a

226
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:09,600
greater area before it soaks into the

227
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,310
soil on the other hand sandy soils are

228
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,020
very porous meaning that there's a lot

229
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:14,970
of space between the particles a lot of

230
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,980
room for water to go in and these soils

231
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:18,420
water soaks in very quickly if you look

232
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:20,040
at a cross-section you will see two

233
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:21,930
different lighting patterns from these

234
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,730
two types of soil another factor is

235
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:26,070
capillary action because of the skin

236
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:28,350
effect of a water molecule in clay water

237
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:31,230
can travel sideways as well as upwards

238
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:33,150
to find gravity in very porous soils

239
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:35,669
that skin effect is greatly diminished

240
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:37,080
so water moves down so now let's look at

241
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:39,330
a drip system that was built for yard

242
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,620
that was all clay this year worked very

243
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:42,890
well in terms of distributing water

244
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:45,810
that's because it had capillary action

245
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:47,850
over time either organic matter is added

246
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:49,710
from falling leaves we've begun adding

247
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:51,480
compost to the surface whatever the

248
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:53,340
reason is the soil has become more

249
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,720
porous which is great for the organisms

250
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:57,360
that live there because now they can get

251
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,520
water and oxygen but unfortunately drip

252
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,530
systems water distribution narrows as

253
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,130
the soils porosity increases in

254
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:04,410
capillary

255
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:06,150
action is reduced as our soil improves

256
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:08,550
ironically we strive to see those

257
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:10,860
dreaded dry zones begin to form over

258
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:12,960
time as more organic matter into the

259
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,460
soil the drip system becomes less and

260
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,890
less capable providing the needed

261
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,750
moisture now we know that pure clay soil

262
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:21,180
is a little value that we must add

263
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:26,400
organic matter so keeping our soil

264
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:28,260
sterilization these systems the answer

265
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,510
is using only synthetic fertilizers

266
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:32,670
injected into the irrigation water any

267
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:35,190
and all organic matter must be avoided

268
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:37,080
to maximize the clay content in foster

269
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:39,060
this spreading of water so how can we

270
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,940
have both how can we have lush healthy

271
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:43,620
gardens as well as conserve water

272
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:46,140
hopefully by now you see that watering

273
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:48,000
the entire garden soil and that just a

274
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,800
base of the plant is the key to a

275
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,810
healthy underground soil and that

276
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,280
healthy soils foster healthy plants

277
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:55,050
that's something we cannot get around

278
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:57,810
the easiest and most cost effective

279
00:09:55,050 --> 00:10:00,150
solution to conserving water is to mulch

280
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:02,790
over the entire surface this as much as

281
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:04,380
50% of that soil moisture can be lost to

282
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:06,630
evaporation from the Sun and the wind

283
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:08,700
this is especially true with clay soils

284
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:10,500
or that dawn capillary action will draw

285
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,300
moisture from deep down bring it to the

286
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,060
surface where it is then lost to

287
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:17,250
evaporation a layer of compost ops that

288
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:19,440
capillary draw by shading the soil from

289
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,490
the Sun as well as blocking the drying

290
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,770
effects of wind

291
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:25,050
so either mulch for three to four inches

292
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:28,440
of compost or just leave any fallen

293
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:30,480
organic matter where it fell second if

294
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,790
you have a drip system buried raise

295
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,830
those emitters up onto the surface the

296
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:36,960
reason we do this is we want our organic

297
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:38,970
matter on the surface could be wet

298
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,890
enough for the organisms will consume it

299
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:42,720
and integrate it into the soil if we

300
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,790
bury that line the compost will become

301
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,380
extremely dry and never get into the

302
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:48,480
soil to feed the organisms that

303
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:50,250
eventually feed the plants again

304
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,170
remember that all the soil needs to have

305
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,910
moisture putting water or there no

306
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:56,190
plants does not mean you are wasting

307
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:58,980
water shake yourself of that drinking

308
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:00,960
glass analogy if you have an inline drip

309
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,910
system consider adding additional lines

310
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,770
in my vegetable garden I initially

311
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:06,780
installed this system exactly as

312
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:08,550
detailed in the manual I've since come

313
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,110
back and have added twice to recommend a

314
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:12,180
number of lines with these additional

315
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:14,550
lines I also chose an emitter with a

316
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:16,649
much higher flow rate so the water would

317
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:18,720
spread rather than soak in just below

318
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:19,529
the emitter the results have been

319
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,690
spectacular

320
00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:23,220
in my bumper crops are back another

321
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:25,529
feature I've added is a weather-based

322
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,420
irrigation timer now before Warren needs

323
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:29,250
to be pretty expensive in a quite

324
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,690
complicated to program but the water

325
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,940
savings can be worth the price

326
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,709
hey watering when it rains is the pure

327
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,540
waste but who remembers to run out and

328
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:38,490
turn off our irrigation system when that

329
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:40,170
happens then there the cases when

330
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:42,149
there's a heat spell and we see our

331
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:44,130
plants wilting so we do adjust the time

332
00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:46,290
upwards the heats out passes but we

333
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:48,510
forget to reset our timing schedule and

334
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:49,890
as a result we over water so that

335
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:51,329
concludes a few of my thoughts about

336
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:52,649
watering and compost

337
00:11:51,329 --> 00:11:54,180
I hope you've gotten a little bit better

338
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:56,550
understanding and can make more informed

339
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:58,320
decisions going forward your patience

340
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:02,040
has been most appreciated and of course

341
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:12,630
your calls are always welcome thank you
