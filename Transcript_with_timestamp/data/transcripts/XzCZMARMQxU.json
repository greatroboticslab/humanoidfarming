  "text": "hello to everyone so just for you to know that the ultimate G community of practice of the CJ a platform for big data and agriculture started the webinar series about the ontology product of the members of our community of practice we want to know about the content and their current use in key applications of platform so the objective is to increase the knowledge about what's the current statutes of ontologies in agriculture how they are developed what is their content and also they up stimulate some collaborative creation and additional uses so today Maeda maja Angelique and the Saleen will present the agronomy Orochi about management practices and why it was necessary to develop this ontology and how it is currently developed and how it is used in the context of the global economy shall be cool ago Pheebs great Thank You Elizabeth first we're gonna start off with Maeda Davari she's gonna present she is representing if pre she's a senior fellow research fellow and module lead at the CGI our Big Data Platform for agriculture over to you Maeda Thank You Man so I leave the the organize module of CG ARS Big Data Platform and the module is all about as you might guess organizing data and getting data to be both open as well as useable by other people so what are some of the questions that that we might encounter I mean it's always good to start from what the what the issues really are so some of the real real life questions that we've encountered or you know something like this what does variation in crop response to fertilizer look like for sub-saharan Africa I need data for my crop model where am I going to find that I want to predict land-use change between 2030 and 2050 at both national and sub-national level in South Asia or anywhere in the world really where do I go for that data well now we have through the big platform we have a data portal called Guardian which looks across all of CGI our centers as well as several other entities in the agricultural domain including USAID USDA the World Bank some a portion of the world bank's data assets the the government of India's open data portal the agricultural part of that and a few other entities as well so when you do a search like this in Guardian what you'll see is a bunch of hits on publications and data sets I've clicked on the data sets link here so you can see some of the data sets that are coming from you know a bunch of the CGI our centers as well as USDA here but you'll also see data depending on the searches that you're doing as prevention from from the World Bank from the government of India's open data portal and for agricultural research that data is coming from ICA are the Indian Council for agricultural research u.s. aid did USDA and that list is growing as we develop Guardian more and more so the the issue about finding data is a little bit better in hand now you can go to a one-stop shop you can find data we're still working on Guardian we continue to improve it so we're getting to that point where we're creating a knowledge base for the data now when you find the data what does it look like this is data a very very well described data set of that I I found from Guardian and even if it's well described what you see is you know some some questions about what these gaps are in these in these cells some of the notations that keep changing and some of these are described in the data there are data variables there's a tab a metadata tab for this particular data set and you see that for most data sets that is still sort of a mystery you know if you're an agronomist you might be able to guess what these things are but not always you continue on down the data set these two four columns the fifth or sixth column are still you know question marks the rotation is continuing to change and as you keep moving down the data said this is about 8,000 rows of data for multiple countries in Africa again now you see the notations changing so here it looks like there's intercropping with pigeon pea that was intercropping up above in the data set that wasn't noted the the treatments or what seemed to be treatments are also changing and they're all noted very differently even where there are commonalities and this is just one dataset across different countries presumably with different people collecting that data what's interesting is the language changes as well within the data set so while a lot of this as I said is well described the notations are well described even for this data set not all of it is so even though you can find the data can you actually reuse it can you actually understand what that data is telling you so the question is how do I collect or find well-described data for model simulations that won't involve months of pain in terms of trying to contact the owners trying to understand what that data is trying you know saying what those variables are trying to tell you you might need standardized data to recommend your best bet intensive sustainable intensification possibilities you might be told as as CGI our scientists are increasingly told it's great to make your data agronomic data fair fair meaning make it findable accessible interoperable and reusable that means adhering to the fair principles well how do I do this just give me the tools to do it tell me how to do it and maybe I will so these are the kinds of issues that we're trying to address through the project that we're going to describe the three of us are going to describe today I've already shown you Guardian we're trying to get semantically enabled data that's where the ontologies come in that you'll be hearing about today to be able to query the vast data pool that is represented in the knowledge base that Guardian is in addition to that we're building Fair workflows into the Guardian data ecosystem so that whether or not you choose to put your to make your data available to us we would like to make available tools that allow you to more easily make historical data fair or data that's not collected use it using any fuel books so that's part of that cog there but what we're going to be talking about today and what I'm going to be describing in a minute is how to generate data that's already semantically enabled so this is a standardized data collection tools part of it which in for the agronomy domain is called Agri films or the agronomy field information management system I'm an agronomist myself and so this is very near to my heart because I faced a lot of these issues that that I'm that I've just described what a graph ins does is it allows you to standardize standardize your data at the collection point so you're not having to monkey with it after you collect after you publish trying to struggle with it in those terms we have enabled digital data collection and as well as quality checks preliminary quality checks of the data and statistical reports and I realized that through all of this I did not include a link to Agri films but I see that Saleem has been putting it in the chat Thank You Saleem for that and apologies for missing that again the whole thing that the the collection the ability to collect data is reliant on the fact that it's based on the agronomy ontology and other ontology x' and aligns with the cg core metadata schema which has a generalized or a customized instance of an industry-standard the Dublin core metadata schema which is what we use across all of our repositories right so just diving into the field book I'm gonna show you some quick screens of what that looks like you'll have to play with it yourself we hope that it's we think it's quite user friendly but we're always happy Selene and I to to meet with you individually and walk you through it in more detail so the field book is organized essentially based on kind of the suite of things that you would do in the EAL is an agronomist the first thing you want to do is to describe your experiment so here are some of the screen the the fields that I've taken from the screen that allows you to put in your experiment details and I've just shown you that that when you click on any one of these drop-down things like type of experiment there you see a list of choices so it's wherever possible we've included pick lists and all of the content of those pick lists is part of the ontology now the other things I'm going to describe to you here there's a number of different screens that you step through in Agri films I'll just focus on the site the crop the the design part of this and the crop measurement part of it just to give you a flavor of what this looks like now when you go to site the first thing you're gonna do is try to identify where your trials are set up so this is kind of a drop down menu that's that's organized by first level second level third level fourth level fifth level admin divisions wherever the data is available we go down to the fifth level admin where it's not we stop at whatever's the authoritative source allows us to get to so once you start zooming in on your on your on your location the what you see is is the the tool fills in your lap' long information so that's kind of helpful as well one of the things that we probably will want to do is to be able to take your pin and drop it on your your site and hone in further that way rather than having to know the names that you you you you are doing so that's that that'll be coming soon that's how you choose your site and once you've done that you go on to to the other parts if you're of the screen that I showed you earlier so here's the crop oops here's the crop part the crop screens that you can see you can choose monocrop into crop real a crop those choices will can be modified as we get more input from users we have a number of crops already pre-loaded into the system and more will be being made available as we as continue to work on a graphics it's completely usable usable right now by the way version one is already up and available for you to play with so you choose your crop this is all again part of the ontology all of these choices that you see and once you do that you can go in and specify an experimental design so we've got some commonly used experimental designs in the agronomy for the agronomy domain already there and again they're part of the ontology so that when I specify an AR CBD and somebody else specifies the same design and I'm you know a user who's looking for for whatever reason I'm using for I'm looking for certain experiments with that have to do with weeds and bean into crops a which is a little unusual but it exists and a better that are set up as are CBDs now because all of this is already standardized I can I can get at those at those experiments those trials I specify my experimental unit we have the choices of plot field and pot I can specify the units the dimensions of that experimental unit and I go on and describe my design as part of the experimental design I also want to specify what my what the factors are that I'm bearing so here again it's a huge pick list with an autocomplete to make your life a little easier so I can choose a nutrient element type and amount I can choose my crop in case of an intra crop I'll choose you know I may I may be fertilizing the crops differently so I want to do it that way here I've said okay I'm going to vary nitrogen and I have two levels 100 kilograms per hectare and 50 kilograms per hectare that I'm testing I'm applying for each of those levels I'm applying to applications or to split so I'm applying the fertilizer into splits essentially and then I can click on the fertilizer application details or I can add more nutrients I may have NPK sulfur copper whatever it is we have all of that possible for you to to add once I click on the fertilizer application details I get taken to another screen that looks like this that is actually something we're very proud of it took a lot of work for us to get to this stage and this is kudos to the to the SIP development team because a lot of this develop all of this development really is done at sip except for the ontology development work which has done a diversity or the Alliance Bioversity see at now so I'm now at the screen where the the tool is helping me calculate the amount of product that I would need to add so I specify okay I want to add 70 kilograms I've had a 70 kilograms per hectare of nitrogen and my first split I can specify timing days after planting the technique and the traction as well by using these pick lists and therefore most of these there is an other when we have pick lists so that I can also we try to give you flexibility so that if your choice is not part of the choices we have in the ontology you can add that and at some point we will try to build that into the ontology that's the thinking behind this behind the flexibility part of this so I'm adding 70/30 split for my hundred kilograms per hectare and I'm adding a forty ten split for my 50 kilogram per hectare treatment off of nitrogen I'm adding it all as ammonium nitrate in this case I can also specify using this little table that you see here NPK calcium magnesium sulfur bla bla I can specify the the the product content so the content of these different of these different elements in a particular formulation that I'm choosing to use so we've tried to give you flexibility there once I do all of this the the tool will give me how much of the amount to add and then of course it's not going down to the level of saying okay you you this is the amount per hectare now you have to sort of figure out you know how much for your plot the amount for the plot that's coming in next generation trying to get much more useful information to the user per crop measurement you want to specify what are the different things you want to be measuring in the field so here I'm going to say ok this is I've clicked on the wheat tab this is an inter crop that I'm showing you for being in wheat and I and for wheat I'm going to choose these different measurements there's a number of parameters when I choose fresh weight and I say here I want the total above-ground biomass including spikes I you know I want the grain all of that is possible as I go down through this this screen for crop measurements I can I can specify the units here in again we've tried to get flexibility for people who might have other units you know if you're if you're working as I did in Nepal you might have local specifications of unit you might want to add those at least for the time being so we've we've tried to include some flexibility there to encourage use for people again drop lists wherever possible pick lists wherever possible with the potential to specify something bespoke if it doesn't exist right so what is this all of this give you once I go through and walk my way through the field book through the through the system I end up with a field book that looks like this which which has randomized all the different treatments that I've specified it gives me the the plot number of the block number the row number depending on the design I choose it will lay this out for me it'll lay out my treatments and then it will also give me the the things that I've specified for measurement so I'm showing you here the tab that that says okay for common being here the measurements have specified for crop measurement for wheat here the crop measurements are specified these other tabs here are our specifications through sort of the general practices that I want my team in the field to follow for irrigation for weeding for planting etc so all of those directions are essentially already coded ontology and given to my to my team right so once I've done this what we've done is to work with the Katie smart application so the Katie smart tool which allows you to go out in the in the in the field and collect data digitally using either an Android telephone or or a tablet so I can katie smart will now accept this field book that I've created and it will allow me to step through the field and actually collect the data it'll it'll give me what measurements I have specified or or give to my field crew if I'm not the person collecting that the data it'll it'll give them an indication of what needs to be collected and when and and how many of those samples need to be taken it'll it'll give them an idea also of the management scenario you know when do i or gate how do i irrigate etc so all of that is is codified because the field book has that information katie smart collects it and and you can use that in the field once you've collected your data what you want to do is send it back actually to a griffons for analysis because you can do preliminary analysis now you've chosen your statistical design you said it's our CBD you select your the treatments you've specified and then you can go through and and what you get up get out of it is a criminal preliminary very simple sort of statistical analysis which you may choose to use it's a nice word document you may choose to use parts of that in a publication or at at you know it works really it's a very quick way of getting a sense of what your data actually looks like so this is the soup to nuts that that we've envisioned we try to build value in for our users by already giving them metadata by already making this data conformant with with the ontology and this was really the use case for the development off the agronomy ontology we realized that we needed a field book we need it's a way of standardizing field information so that now we can operate over large pools of data that are described in the same way we cannot use our big data and machine learning techniques to do this and to gain more insight from the vast amounts of data that we're producing as agronomy community really this is a soup to nuts approach of a griffin's and I am almost done but not without thanking the many many folks who have contributed to this the the people who are in bold are the ones who have done a lot of the work the lion's share of the work but there have been a lot of others who have contributed quite significantly to this so I want to acknowledge that and with that I'll stop and hand over to the next speaker Aman over to you yeah thank you so much made up for that comprehensive overview so yeah we'll pass it now on to marry Angelique lepre associate scientist at the Alliance of Bioversity international and see at over to you thank you I'm an you know if we weren't so in my presentation today I'm saving and I I mean it's not my presentation you shared with 13 we are going to present like the agronomy ontology so I'm gonna present more on the ergonomy structure and content and how we build it and sitting is gonna explain how to use it to annotate like your data so just read context or domain Amira gave a good overview of what we wanted to do really we wanted to have like an ontology that will be that could be used to harmonize like economic data and when we started like this project there was there were a lot of ontology that was already existing that were relevant to the agronomy domain Feinstein's some cover like the cod Museum and thoughts on the environment but really there was a big gap in terms of how to describe like treatments that are really important and also experimental protocol and this information is really important particularly in the context of using the data because if you don't have this information maybe you can misinterprets part of the data so for instance if you look at yield maize yield data and you don't know that some of the he had been collecting and already be like stress conditions then maybe when you use a data set I mean you can you can that can miss to some mistake so that's really what we wanted to do with the economy ontology and the economy ontology now provides like all the semantics needed to describe like agricultural trials that's really what we focused on from the experimental condition to economic parties to the implements used for this practiced fertilizer and also to code measurements so as I said when we started a lot of ontology were already out there and that were and were covering part of the agronomy domain so what we wanted to do is not start from from scratch of course but what we want wanted to do is reuse terms that were directly relevant to to an agronomy ontology into like the economy ontology and being only the classes and the terms or add only the classes and the terms that were really like specific to the economy domain so how did we so when we started we started from this basic form an ontology that is really like the glue to to to murder and to align together all the pieces and all this different domain into the economy ontology because the BFO is providing like the common semantics that all these anthologies are are using some we also have used like the chemical ontology KB for everything all the chemical entities that we needed like some fertilizer or chemical that I applied during an experiment we reused like the environment on Karrueche for everything related to environment where I used like the full ontology because sometimes some food that derived of food products can be used at 30 right so as well we'll use the OB ontology for everything related to studio designs and protocols really use the pet ontology for like qualities what we call qualities that are really like components that are like the main component of like the variables that are coding in the fields so that's gonna give like semantics to describe these variables we use like the plant experimental and condition ontology because it lists like at least a lot of biotic treatments and going conditions we reuse of course like the unit ontology because as Mira said we want to to annotate like datasets and so the unit's exam is a big part of that and finally because we focused like the ontology at least for now more unlike the plants we reuse like the plant ontology for everything to get a question like the prom part that obviously do a thing like that from the peel and we reuse like the chihwan a cop ontology for the phenotypic traits and and enviable that I can be recorded during the experiment and so all of these domain yeah integrated nicely in the economy ontology and then we focused our efforts on describing terms that were really specific to the economy ontology so now I'm gonna explain a bit like the different types of terms that you're gonna find in the ontology and also how they how these terms are linked to each other so first the main element 3d of the economy ontology is this notion of magnitude to agricultural experiment our plot so this is in the plot or that can be like an entire feed that can be like a product like in the in when you have a specific design that can be so really this notion of of plot is where you're gonna have like all the things happening and this brought in the ontology so this term or class in the ontology is linked to different concepts so this plot is thing it's an object and is linked of close to the agricultural experiment it is also linked as you can see here two things that can be measured on that plot like like the lands or the area so and then on that plot something happened so you plant a cob and then you have a certain type of of terms that we have any ontology that are going to be processes so you know I represent it like a planting process and a new process is really like everything that is time-bound so he has a start it has an end and then you can see on the the the schema here that the element that are linked to a process are defined from the element that are linked to like objects or entities so here for each process you're going to find find like a list of what we call participants so this participant can be like tools like you can see it or it can be like the seed that is used like that you use all the cop like the seed of the cob that you use during your grunting process and then this way you can use the ontology to describe what is happening like during over time in your plot then you can have like for instance an ergonomic fertilization process happening so this is the the two types of terms so the processes and then the object that we redefine in the ontology and her all of this is linked together so now I'm going to get a little bit on in the economy like the ontology structure so as I said at the beginning our goal was to describe agricultural experiment so this agricultural experiment photos like a design soil it's completely randomized design and this economy experimental curves and in this cycle could draw an experimental plot so that's gonna be like the the main element as I said before and then something happen also in this product like this fertilization process and and this fertilization process I started to say before it cannot like participant that are likely that is really the two that you are using during your 30-day the fertilization process so here you're going to use like a manual spreader for instance this process is also like a different type of participants so it's gonna be like the fertilizer itself that you are using and here you can see that is that this limestone is not coming from the economy ontology but is coming from the environment ontology so this is how we link like the different domain together and then what is really important in when we do like this fertilization process is to know like the the amount of fertilizer that we're gonna apply in the field and so we have like this you know the night you know then fertilizer amount class in the ontology and then that is linked also to an external term and then to a unit so this is like a simplified view I mean I just created one process and even like partially one describe one process but this is how like how the deontology is built an athenian is gonna explain later how you use like the the classes to tell your data but really once you you tell your data what you get is really like this entire graph thanks to the ontology and or the semantics that is really even between like all these these terms so now i'm just going to give you like a quick overview of things that you can find in in the economy ontology so as i said you're gonna find like different types of agricultural experiments that are like describe you're going to find like different agricultural processes so we've seen like the branching process 30 different process but also irrigation Arvest like you know long levering everything then you're going to find these stuff like our actual implement that can be used like during these processes and finally you can you can also find like a list of of fertilizer like organic and inorganic fertilizer that that can be used during like a fertilization process and so that's just a quick overview of things that we have in agronomy ontology and I really invite you to to look at more into details of of the content because I mean I couldn't of course like yeah make a screenshot of everything so in terms of maintenance so we followed like the open zipper that are good very good practice to follow when you build ontology and so the ontology is open it's like open to everyone to contribute it's like version control and everything so yeah all of that is listed in the over family point seeker that we are we followed for the ontology building itself we use like the Protege tool in addition of like the ontology development kit for dealing with all like the ontology development kit is like a suite of tools that we use for instance to deal with like reusing terms coming from external ontology in a very like in a very easy way so we don't have to maintain all of that like this ontology development kit take care of everything so make it's very easy to to to reduce external authorities and also to make release of the ontology and anything like that and finally the ontology ontology is to be shown on github you can find the link here and and we use github so for the publishing but also we have the issue tracker on github and Cellini's gonna explain that a bit more later and then in terms of next steps or an ontology is never really finished so we are still looking at adding more content so it can be used like Bodley and so the one of the big tasks that we want to continue is like to to add more units of measurement that I released specific to the economy domain because sovereign the unique that that I use are currently missing so that's really like something that would like to address and also we want to continue working with like the different external ontology and contribute to them in terms of terms that are like 11 for the economy domain for instance in terms of fertilizer we are diligently we I mean we we made the request to 2 KB to add some new fertilizer but also we are going to do that for involve we cannot like more so related terms or fertilizer even that can be be imported than in the economy ontology and finally we would like to to map I go with the cassava a bar so the cassava a birds are like variables that are widely used by caught murderers so we started looking at the Casa viable when viable when we started like the agronomy ontology but so we have some of them but now we would like to to like have a more comprehensive list of of this viable in in the ontology and be sure that everything can be map easily so then when the data are notated using the ontology the code module can directly take the data and then use them more easily without spending time cleaning the data and all of that so yes so that's that's all for me great thank you so much Mary so yes we have made it has given us a comprehensive overview of the agro themes and you have given us the overview and insights into a girl and now Selene is going to give us kind of the link and in some of those more specific ideas and concepts that you referred to both in your in your presentation so now Alberta Cellino that who is an agro curator a guru of beams coordinator and consultant at if pre-high I think you a man hello everyone so yeah as Mary told you she has presented in detail what is a grew and what is its content and so now I will tell you a bit more where to find a group first and then how it uses so to browse over download a grow you have different options but the first one is to go on the agro web page so in the web page you will find all the information about the ontology you have also the contact and you have the possibility to browse or download agro you can also go on the ontology lookup service of EBI I have to mention that maybe the OLS is going through maintenance and sever migration so by a consequent the ontology has not been updated there because they stopped doing updates during mint but everything should be back to normal by Aprill twenties you can also use a group bottle it's a platform the blood by the Liam and it's gathering a different origin in agriculture and agro is also available in on Toby and finally you can also go to github and download aggro on your laptop so you can choose the tool you are the more familiar with and so now I will show you how you can use OLS EBI that is well available directly on the website of the OLS or you can also find it on a grower web page on the OLS you can use the search box to directly type the term you are looking for and so then the others will give you a list of available terms if you are a bit more adventurous and you want to explore your year key you can directly type into the ontology tree and look at their different classes and subclasses so here you can see the different tillage process we have so you don't only see the rich tool but you can still see mulch the strip till and to differentiate aki and on the right side you can also see the different relation between the classes so once you serve like the term that you are interested in you will have a definition of the term with the reference to this definition you as I say you have also the the relation of this term with the other classes of the anthology and you will find a UI I so this URI is an identifier that is unique for each ontology term and so this is what you will use to annotate your document your data so basically what you will do is copy paste this URL in your file in your excel file or database to link your data with the ontology and so you will have to follow the same schema looking in the ontology for each term and copy pasting them in your file for each of your term so this is quite cumbersome and time-consuming exercise but luckily there are some tools to help you in this task so the first tool I will talk about is capo you might have heard about it already it's a portal link to ontology that is the description of the data of with ontologies so when you go to capo first you upload your file so here i've uploaded an excel file and capo this is displaying the different columns of my file you can see them here so i've selected your first column the root fresh weight and then i go to the search box type the name of my term and then capo will look into the difference oncologist what is the closest term to the one i'm looking so you can look at the different terms and the definition and then you select the one that you are interested in it will be saved here and capo might directly make the link between this term and your column in your file and so you do this for all the different column of your file and at the end you can export all the different annotation as a JSON file so this is a great tool to help you annotate data file that are already created because cocoa create the links between your file and the ontologies directly if you have not yet collected your data there is a great tool that I can recommend to use directly at the start of your agronomic experiment and it's well a griffin's so midde already demonstrated the different step to follow to create a fill book ready to collect agronomic data using mobile device and so once you have collected your data with your mobile device you will get a file like this one with annotation in the column headers like here you can see you have the UI of a group and so the annotation are automatically done without any additional additional work from you so you don't need to look for each term in the ontology this feature is currently under development with maje we are adding the last missing term in a grow to be able to create this automatic link between a graphemes and the ontology it should be completed by the rider or in the coming months and so this will be an easy way to create data file that well annotated for the data but also for the metadata and without additional work for you are looking in the different anthologies so I hope our presentation gets you motivated to use aggro you can find a group we have the different platforms that I shared with you in the chat box and so once you use a group please feel free to send us your feedback and ontology is a collaborative tool that is always evolving so if you are looking for a term and you don't find it or maybe you'd like to discuss the new Yaqui or provide any type of feedback feel free to open an issue on github issue tracker and we'll get into contact with you so if you never use github you can well follow the link that I shared with you and then you go to the issues and you will find you don't see it in the picture but you will find here like new issues and so then you just say in the comment whatever you whatever your feedback is and then we'd get in contact with you so finally I would like to thank the people that I have contributed to I grow by giving us super hoods and feedback the ontology would not be so strong without the advice so thank you very much for your attention and I hope I grow and Agri films will be useful for your research please feel free to contact us if you like to get some supports when you are using them Thank You Celine and just just for clarification if people want to get in contact should they get in contact with you Celine or would it be any three of you if it's a question more related to deontology they can get in contact with Marie angelic and myself and if the question is related to a Griffins it's better to get in contact with Smita and myself okay great thank you so much Celine and and so now we are at our question and answer and comments session for the webinar today so maybe we go to Elizabeth for your first question yeah thank you for the demonstration of ago themes and my question was people they need to create parameters or new variables on the priced at lots we know that so how how do you make sure that those new parameters and variables created in a graphing by the users can be feedback to the ergonomic Raji what would be the process at currently and what could be done in the future to make the submission more seamless thank you so right now the the way you submit things that are not in that you cannot find in in the ontology is first of all you you try to describe something you're doing in the field if it's not there and you can't sort of compromise and use what whatever is there that doesn't meet your needs then you would choose the other part the other the other sort of feature of the of most of these pick lists and add what it is that you want now once that's added we will we will hopefully be able to see it we haven't actually engineered the links right now that that provides a little alert for us or that put that term as an automatic sort of issue into the into the github but we're gonna have to wait we're gonna have to see what what is possible with the developers if that's possible and that would be one way that we catch what the issue is and can get in touch with whoever has wants it to make sure that we understand correctly before we create a new concept and an integral for it or we look for a matching concept in another ontology that we might have missed so the short answer I guess is that we don't have the processes already available but we have some thoughts as to as to how that can work and within the next year or so we hope to to build all of that out there are other things that that we we we also are trying to do that we see is kind of very high priority in terms of more improvements to the to the user interface the accommodation of survey type trials because that's something that our users have asked of us very large survey type trials multi locational trials with thousands of farmers right now Agri firms cannot handle that very well so that we're working on those bits first but hopefully we will also be able to address this issue of the feedback as we go forward we also want to make sure that we're not just enabling KT smart as the digital collection tool we want to also make sure that people can use ODK open data kit and the field will gap as well so that those are two pieces of high priority development that will happen in 2020 great think you made that we have several more questions coming in you can start off with a lantern bassoon my question is from agrifim with respects to using the KD smart data collection tool Hadid it has been connected with this hub how is the data obligated ready start so the data is collected with your KT smart application on your phone say or your or your tablet once you've finished collecting the data you ship it back in the form of the field book essentially an excel field book back to algorithms you can do your statistical analysis and you can either download the data and store it locally or you can it's stored in the server and you can you can play with it there one of the things that we want to also enable is the the ability to to try and enable sort of people to share the data and now with the implementation of Globus across CGR I would like to see whether we can bring somehow tie algorithms to to Guardian more tightly so that the Guardian now has CG labs collaborative Guardian labs which allow not only searching of the data but but secure sharing and and transferring of data as well as collaborative analysis of the data and the development of scripts and all of that so it's it's a kind of a full-service solution and so if we can tie a graph ends and and CG labs closely together then that data can be stored on the CG lab server and it'll be a secure transfer or insecure sharing that's that's behind that with Globus putting the stamp on it and Globus is HIPAA certified so that it's it it conforms to the very very high levels of privacy private data sharing secure data sharing that's required in the medical domain HIPPA has an Americans but it basically allows you it tells you that that data sharing will be secure does that answer your question Busan yes I mean yes I say have some little concern in the sense that I know that some scientists on some projects all right I want to have the data exclusive to themselves during the life span I mean they'd like the active life of the project until when I said we do not mandate that the data should be open they can do that they can download the data and and that that will be fine you know then it's residing on their laptop until they choose to make it until the choose to upload it to the institutional repository for example but if they choose to work in CG labs that is a secure environment so just just CG labs is something you know CGIAR has not heard very much about because it's very hot off the presses but that'll be coming as well that webinar on that will be coming soon great think you made that thank you for for that question as well though the next question is from Khaled presentation my question is about is there any kind of integration currently done between your team and the breeding management system from IPP in terms of unify the ontology and and something like that yeah that's a good question as well so so we started out actually looking at the BMS to see if there was a way in which we could modify the BMS in some way to make it available also for agronomist and and confer or not confirmed but but you know appropriate for agronomist but the issue there was that the breeders are very much focused on germ plasm whereas agronomists I won't say they don't care about the germ plasm but that's not the focus of what they do it's it's more the the management and so we couldn't find a way to sort of make it appropriate for both and and where the integration now is is the fact that the ontology provides that ability to to crosswalk across the tooth so there's there's the potential for once you have the data actually then you can sort of start to do some more seamless integration between breeding data and agronomic data because they're both reliant on ontologies that's that's the level of integration there is right now yeah and also I would add to on that I mean we have been discussing with the technical team of the BMS to see how the cue implement also the economy ontology terms particularly on the experimental conditioning treatments into the systems I mean for the cop on the part on the cop measurement they are using like the the cop ontology so that's fine I mean these two part are going to be more or less harmonized between like the economy system and and the gradient management system so that that's good although as me I said I mean there are some differences but like most of the terms that are in comment would be implement so that's already something good but yeah we are in discussion with the technical team also the BMS we are the meeting recently to to show them like the last advancement of of the economy ontology to see how they could integrate that in in that system we have a question from Eddie and so the question is on a grow what is the percentage of terms reused from other ontology x' how many new entries were added into a grow and how do you deal with updates when other ontology x' sources of terms change percentage rostrum is about like 75 percent of the terms coming from external anthologies and 25 percent of jumps coming from from from ago directly that we we created and so yeah there there's about like 500 something terms that we created like but only under the economy ontology namespace and how do we deal with the update in external ontology that's why we are using like the ontology development kit suite of tools because that make that very easy so every time we update the economy ontology we just make sure to unlike the script that's gonna check that everything is still in place sometime we find like you know that some update might cause issues in the economy ontology but then we work on fixing that but yeah at the end by using the tools that are very like standards and while using the Oba community we can do that like pretty easily so so yeah so that's how we do like to particularly true to build like this this list of reuse Xterra where we want to reuse external ontology terms and one we are one add like terms that we we don't have so that's also very easy we just have a list of terms that that we want so if someone make a request and say oh I want to add this fertilizer for instance and but we don't maintain really fertilizer in not gone and it's like the inorganic one so we will ask heavy to do it and then one Skippy I'd like the term then we are gonna import it in in a go and really I mean we did it like recently and that's really yeah that works what well to do like that because we cannot maintain everything so it's easier to maintain what is really directly relevant to the economy domain and to let like the other like expert to maintain like you know list of chemicals or list of different like by own so things like that great thank you Mary we have another question that came in actually through LinkedIn chat platform and it's from Kathy sled from data Co and the question is I think specifically for Marie does a grill include soil properties we are working on a global soil information system for file I think soil properties is where we meet yes so we import some so we have a few properties in ago that are mainly imported from the environment ontology and I know that currently they are working like they have a project to work on that how to add like more muscle properties into the the environment ontology so that's not something that we are going to maintain ourselves but that's something that we are going to be used from this environment ontology and and I mean be happy to two years with that the environment ontology develop go to two year to provide like this feedback and and say that sometimes might be needed and then we can like import them or yeah we use them in the economy ontology so so so we have them but yeah we we don't want to maintain mokopuna stop so properties ourselves great Thank You Mari I don't see any more questions coming in a lot of thank yous thank you again for participating and thank you again to the presenters I think what will now do is wrap up and again thank you to the three presenters and those who have logged in today I'm going to hand it back over to Elizabeth to just let us know what's coming next thank you a man so thank you for three speakers for the very interesting and informative presentation I think it was super useful and it was a successful webinar given the number of attendees this was the second webinar of the series about the community of practice products we have an agenda in fact already so we hope to get you online for the next webinars thank you very much thank you a man and Celine who had me organizing this webinar and thanks again to our speakers",
