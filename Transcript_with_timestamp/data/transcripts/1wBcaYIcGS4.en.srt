1
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:07,359
hi this is Stephanie Dale from the home

2
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:11,400
front today I'm going to be taking you

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:13,360
on a tour of our drip system I'm going

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,000
to show you what a well planned out drip

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,359
system can

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,480
do for your

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:24,439
Farmstead and what exactly you can do

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:28,960
with it right off the bat as you can

9
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:31,080
see there is no PVC pipe in the strip

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,800
system

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:37,600
it's all done with drip

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,960
tubing the great thing about drip

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,719
systems is that it saves water saves you

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,719
money it saves you

15
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:51,879
time and it's low pressure and um if we

16
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,640
had to we could tear it apart and

17
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:56,680
reassemble it to work with our rain

18
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,440
barrels this is the beginning of our

19
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:01,879
drip system this should be the beginning

20
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:05,280
of a any good drip

21
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:07,320
system ours is connect connected up to

22
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,280
this outdoor spet the spet has a

23
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,320
built-in back pressure valve so we don't

24
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,000
have to um buy a separate piece and

25
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,840
connect that up but if you did you would

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,040
connect it up right

27
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,439
here most low pressure drip systems

28
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,040
should be connected after a timer or a

29
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,520
shut off valve this is because the

30
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,479
components of a low pressure drip system

31
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,399
like the screen filter will not hold up

32
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:34,119
under constant pressure so you shouldn't

33
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:35,799
connect it directly up to a faucet you

34
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:38,079
should connect it up you know after

35
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:39,560
timer after a shut off valve the nice

36
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,960
thing about having a timer on your drip

37
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,960
system is that it prevents you from

38
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,360
overwatering it prevents you from

39
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,399
forgetting about the system and leaving

40
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,640
it on overnight or leaving it on for an

41
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,759
hour longer than you should um it's just

42
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,719
one more tool you have that saves you

43
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:58,079
time and increases the efficiency of

44
00:01:55,719 --> 00:02:00,600
your system you can set this to come on

45
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,320
every day every other day you can set it

46
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,640
to come on for an hour or for two hours

47
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:08,840
um they're just really really handy

48
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:12,319
inexpensive tools for your

49
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:15,800
garden what you're looking at right here

50
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:17,319
is a 200 mesh screen filter that's

51
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,760
keeping all the water clean before it

52
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:23,640
hits your system stuff gets in your

53
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,720
system algae debris other stuff like

54
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,200
that it clogs it up and and it doesn't

55
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,319
work right and you want your system to

56
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,200
be as low maintenance as possible also

57
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:36,200
you'll see here is a pressure

58
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,599
reducer or a pressure regulator that's

59
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:41,120
bringing the pressure down to 10 psi for

60
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:43,840
our system and this is an adapter what

61
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,920
this is doing this is bringing the size

62
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:51,400
down to where our half in drip tubing

63
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:54,040
plugs right into it coming off here is a

64
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,280
little qu in line and that goes in these

65
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,560
are raspberries this is our Mainline

66
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,519
tubing if you follow it for long enough

67
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,280
it it will hit our garden here's the

68
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,599
mainline tubing in the garden this goes

69
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,599
off

70
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:12,319
to all my beans peas which are done for

71
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:14,240
the for the year Dale it's all taking

72
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,000
off from the mainline tubing right

73
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:18,480
[Applause]

74
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,360
here and these are

75
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:26,280
just drip tape takeoff adapters that are

76
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,920
plugged into the main tubing is all that

77
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,720
is and we've used drip tape known as has

78
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,200
tea

79
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:39,799
tape and that runs up each one of these

80
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:42,080
rows and Waters it see right here you

81
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:48,239
can see it working a little

82
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:48,239
bit at the end of a drip tape we have it

83
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:56,200
crimped it's not a plug it's a crimp

84
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:58,680
however at the end of a of a Mainline

85
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:01,040
tube you can see there's the

86
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,400
plug

87
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:07,159
this is still my upper

88
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,360
garden lettuce is mostly done and been

89
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:11,159
harvested and

90
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,920
uh each

91
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:18,320
row I have going is being watered at

92
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:21,359
this point in time by a line of drip

93
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,359
tape of tea

94
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:27,400
tape this drip tape is pretty cool stuff

95
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,120
it will operate just as efficiently as

96
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,320
you're seeing right now under as low as

97
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,840
4 PSI right now everything's running on

98
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:39,000
T 10 psi it will work just the same with

99
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,280
four which you can accomplish through a

100
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,919
gravity fed

101
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:49,639
system it's also watering my beans P

102
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:51,479
beans some sunflowers back there

103
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:53,960
beets

104
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:55,880
onions good stuff another thing that we

105
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:59,039
do with our drip system is we use it to

106
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:01,400
water our chickens so we we just get

107
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:05,080
tired of falling water to the chicken so

108
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,840
we've taken um a tea we've installed a

109
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,720
tea right here we have more this is

110
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:13,560
Mainline tubing it runs off of here up

111
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,360
and around and we've installed a little

112
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,080
valve right

113
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,440
here and if I were to open

114
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,919
that well if I would lower it and then

115
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,720
open it um water would come out and here

116
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:27,520
I have my

117
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,680
container containers and and rais beds

118
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,680
and they're all on the drip system too

119
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,400
there's my uh Mainline tubing right

120
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,800
there I have

121
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:40,199
little um quarter inch lines with

122
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:44,880
emitters running off of each one let me

123
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:44,880
see if I can grab one this is an inline

124
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,080
emitter right there you can see it

125
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,639
that's the emitter that's the inline

126
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:56,319
emitter right there and it's giving this

127
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:58,479
uh couple squash plants a half a gallon

128
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:01,479
an hour I

129
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,479
believe

130
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:15,720
and in this bed you can kind of see

131
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:18,560
it it comes up we have a line coming off

132
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:23,720
the mainline you come over here and you

133
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:25,240
can see two lines of drip tape and

134
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,520
that's our

135
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:30,880
cucumbers you come over here and we have

136
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:34,440
potatoes and these are also connected to

137
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,720
the drip system if I can find the line

138
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,720
right

139
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,440
here goes

140
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,919
in

141
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,599
and right there's an

142
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,039
emitter

143
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:50,520
and right there is an emitter you can

144
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:54,000
see the red

145
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:57,639
thing the red thing is an

146
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,639
emitter when you want to increase the

147
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:03,520
amount of water a plant is getting you

148
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,800
can add another emitter um rather than

149
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,680
getting one of those variable rate

150
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,199
emitters which I think are garbage and

151
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,560
messing with it all the time you can

152
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:15,479
just add another emitter it's not that

153
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:18,440
hard okay if you follow our main line

154
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:20,599
tubing by the

155
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:23,400
Cucumbers you can see how it goes into

156
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:25,960
the garden that way you can there's also

157
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,960
a te we installed a te here and we're

158
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,000
going to follow it this way oh there's

159
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,560
another line right there coming off

160
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,560
little Quin line and that is feeding

161
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:39,319
another rhar plant and you follow this

162
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:41,960
tubing line right here it was feeding my

163
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:44,000
my apple tree but it doesn't need it's

164
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,039
on its thir deer now so it does not need

165
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,120
to be on the drip system but you can put

166
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:52,000
a fruit tree on a drip system you follow

167
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:55,159
this tube around there it is and it goes

168
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,159
around to another

169
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:01,319
Garden so here we have the other Garden

170
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,319
still no PVC pipe

171
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,319
and we have corn growing this is again

172
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,080
these are um I

173
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:11,919
used

174
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:15,560
row

175
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,560
takeoffs and drip

176
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,039
tape see and there are the tomatoes the

177
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,960
tomatoes are also on drip tape you can

178
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:29,759
get drip tape to emit different amounts

179
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:32,639
of water um it just depends on

180
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,639
on on what you're

181
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,039
growing and you can hit the end of the

182
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,039
line

183
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:45,039
here right there the drip tape ends like

184
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,039
the other ones

185
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:55,000
do it works really

186
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,920
efficiently weeds don't like to grow in

187
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,320
between the rows photo bomb by the dog
