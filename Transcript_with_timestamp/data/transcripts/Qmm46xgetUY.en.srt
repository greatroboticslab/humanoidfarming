00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,940

the chickens are interested in the

96
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,360
walnuts and i think that's because of

97
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,800
the whole maggots

98
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,680
or whole worms is a nicer way to call it

99
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:27,680
there's little bugs that parasitize the

outer hell of the black walnut

101
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,520

148
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,840

into the electric net fence without her

232
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,399
and now the dog house goes back

233
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,680
to its original use

234
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:57,760
move titus over here

235
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:01,040
so that the cows can use the original

236
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,800
use of that shelter which was for cows

237
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,199
so the cows have a shelter

238
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,000
the dog has a shelter

239
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,839
and

240
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,600
we will be building a

241
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:14,240
pallet wall and ceiling for these guys

242
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,519
shortly they're fighting over a pumpkin

243
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,639
bill is running around with a little

244
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,639
mini pumpkin in his mouth

245
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,760
you like those pumpkins

246
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,760
they're yummy huh

247
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,760
so

248
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,959
we have lashes back in the buckpin

249
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,360
she's just

250
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,360
in there in the buck shelter eating some

251
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,320
of his hay

252
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,880
and she's in here again because she got

253
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:47,040
out again she found a new spot

254
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:50,320
and she broke through a new area so

255
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,320
man i just wish we could just fence the

256
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,040
entire back side of the property with

257
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:59,279
regular fence instead of barbed wire but

258
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:02,320
it's just not in the budget or the time

259
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,920
limits that we have right now

260
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,680
so

261
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:10,880
she is in timeout pen

262
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:13,600
meanwhile the koonies are

263
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,760
loving their area they're doing a good

264
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,959
job

265
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,480
and staying in

266
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:23,680
they have a couple of ducks in there

267
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,680
visiting them right now

268
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:29,360
mama friendship

269
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,120

270
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,720

271
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,720
woods

272
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,720
she stays nice and close

273
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:42,399
but the kuni kuni rotational fence is

274
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,320
up and functioning

275
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:47,040
so that was a good thing for us to be

276
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,600
able to accomplish this weekend

277
00:15:47,040 --> 00:16:35,499
