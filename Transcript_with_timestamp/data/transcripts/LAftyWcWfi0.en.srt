1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,359
easy to grow a Wonder in the kitchen

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:08,519
tender fruits are nearly round mildly

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:11,040
sweet flavor creamy texture plump and

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:13,440
variably ribbed there's a nice poetry to

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,280
Seed Catalog descriptions but there's

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,520
also a lot of technical terms in there

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,960
so we're going to talk about the meaning

8
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,720
of some of those words and how they

9
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,240
relate to your garden there's a few

10
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,519
different types of seeds that you'll see

11
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,439
advertised organic is one so organic

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,599
seeds have been grown in organic

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,279
conditions on a farm so that means no

14
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,399
chemical fertilizers pesticides or

15
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:34,320
herbicides as well as a whole host of

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,120
other variables this one's listed as

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,559
USDA organic certified whereas this one

18
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,920
just says organic lettuce seed another

19
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:45,640
thing you'll see is non-GMO project you

20
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:49,000
are not going to accidentally buy any

21
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,960
genetically modified or GMO seeds those

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,440
are highly regulated they're very

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,440
expensive and they're for agricultural

24
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,840
producers if you find something that

25
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,000
doesn't say non-GMO project certified

26
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,680
doesn't mean it's GMO it's not something

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,360
that you have to worry about hairloom

28
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,400
seeds is another thing you see listed

29
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,920
hairloom generally refers to plants

30
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,840
different types of cultivars that have

31
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,920
been grown for a long time some people

32
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,720
say before the 1950s some people say 50

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,119
years I'm not sure that there's an

34
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,000
actual rule but often they have a

35
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,720
historical or cultural significance to

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,079
an area which is why they still are

37
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,400
grown you'll see some seeds listed as

38
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:28,479
treated seeds I actually have some here

39
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,640
that I ordered by accident you can see

40
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,880
these PE seeds are pink so these are

41
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,200
treated with a fungicide this will just

42
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,079
keep them from rotting when they go in

43
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,560
the ground pelleted seeds are not the

44
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,280
same as treated seeds for smaller seeds

45
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,720
like lettuce seeds what they are is

46
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,040
they're actually a small clay coating

47
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,040
that turns it into a seed that is about

48
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,960
the size of a radish seeds so you end up

49
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,759
with something that's easier to handle

50
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,840
that's easier to plant out it's not

51
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:56,880
necessary if you're not planting out a

52
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,520
whole ton of plants but if you're

53
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,719
planning to save seeds from your garden

54
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,360
it's important to know if the plant is

55
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,560
open-pollinated or if it's a hybrid so

56
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,920
open-pollinated plants you could save

57
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,840
the seeds from and then they will

58
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,280
produce the same seeds the next year

59
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,000
they pollinate naturally in whatever

60
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,080
mechanism the plant uses it's different

61
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,640
for all different types if it's a hybrid

62
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,760
plant it's been more specifically

63
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,680
crossbreed by agronomists who have

64
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,200
picked out certain traits from A couple

65
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,319
of different cultivars and put them

66
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,599
together that plant will not produce

67
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,760
seed that will produce a new plant the

68
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:30,519
seeds may be sterile or they may just

69
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,239
produce something totally different than

70
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:34,239
the plant that you started with so you

71
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,519
don't want to save seeds from hybrids

72
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,480
hybrids are also often more expensive

73
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:40,239
because of the technology that goes into

74
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,280
them and you want to just make sure you

75
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,959
notice how many seeds you're getting in

76
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,879
the past I've ordered pepper seeds that

77
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:48,280
were hybrids and then realized I only

78
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:50,760
got 10 seeds in my envelope another word

79
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,840
that's related to that is parthenocarpic

80
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,000
or self fertile you're going to see that

81
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,080
listed in association with growing in

82
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
green houses if you're growing cucumbers

83
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,519
or tomato in a greenhouse there may not

84
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,879
be as many pollinating insects around

85
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,799
and so something that's parthenocarpic

86
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:08,400
is self fertile they'll often grow

87
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:11,319
without seeds and they don't need to be

88
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,519
fertilized by another plant in order to

89
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:15,480
produce fruit seed cataloges will give

90
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,799
you a lot of information about timing as

91
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:20,680
well DTM days to maturity how many days

92
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:24,560
it will take between when the plant is

93
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:27,360
either directly seated in the ground or

94
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,400
a transplant is put in the ground so I

95
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,680
use them as a comparison point just to

96
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,680
understand if I'm looking for something

97
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,599
that's fast or something that's slow

98
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,360
otherwise I'm not going to really take

99
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:38,599
that information and assume that it's

100
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,159
going to be true in my garden any

101
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:44,959
perennial plants that you're ordering

102
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:47,799
will also say Hardy till Zone 2 to 4 or

103
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,920
Hardy to zone six it'll list them in

104
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:51,720
there note that the USDA zones are

105
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,159
different than the Canadian zones so

106
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,000
check which zone you're in and then

107
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:57,519
check which country your catalog comes

108
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,920
from so that's how cold the plant can

109
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,280
get over the winter so you'll also see a

110
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,319
lot of growth habits listed on here so

111
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,959
these are different ways that the plant

112
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,519
grows and it's good to match these to

113
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,840
the conditions that you want in your

114
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:13,840
garden you'll see different things like

115
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,640
spicy Bush basil is does well in

116
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,079
containers as well as the garden the

117
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:21,199
plants are small and Dome shaped so

118
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,960
they're small dwarf semi- dwarf climbing

119
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,639
those are words that will be used

120
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,400
another big distinction here is between

121
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,120
determinant and indeterminant those

122
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,199
terms are usually used when talking

123
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:33,400
about tomatoes Det perent means that the

124
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,000
plant will grow to a certain size and it

125
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,479
will produce fruit and seeds but then

126
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,639
when it's produced enough seeds that

127
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,880
it's sort of finished its life cycle and

128
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,639
thinks that it's passed that on it will

129
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,280
stop and it will die indeterminate they

130
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:49,560
will continue to grow fruit and they

131
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,360
will continue to produce seeds until the

132
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,840
weather conditions change around them it

133
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,400
gets too cold they dry out then they

134
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,240
will die the days get too short

135
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,520
something like that word you'll see a

136
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,600
lot is resistance so there's a few

137
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,960
different types of resistance you'll see

138
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,520
these parlees say that it has

139
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:11,240
intermediate resistance to dowy mildew

140
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:13,520
resistance to uh diseases is very common

141
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,360
you'll see that a lot in tomatoes

142
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,880
sometimes it will say something specific

143
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,759
like resistant to Tomato tobacco mosaic

144
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,080
virus sometimes it will be General it

145
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,880
will say good resistance package that's

146
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:28,319
bolt resistance is another one that you

147
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:31,560
see often something that can grow as the

148
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:33,600
weather gets warm without going to seed

149
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,800
if you've ever grown cilantro I find is

150
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,319
an especially common one it'll grow

151
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,360
really well in the cooler weather but as

152
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:41,759
soon as you get a hot spell it'll just

153
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,520
send up a giant amount of flowers and

154
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,360
the leaves are not as good to eat also

155
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,520
crack resistant Tomatoes uh will often

156
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,479
crack especially if they get too much

157
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,440
water if it's a wet year at a certain

158
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:55,800
point in time when the fruit are forming

159
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,199
the skin will actually crack so crack

160
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,199
resistance just means that it's less

161
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:02,280
likely to happen um they've been bred to

162
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:05,400
have a thicker skin and more of an

163
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,880
ability to to take on that excess water

164
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:10,039
field holding how long something can sit

165
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,280
in the field without needing to be

166
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:14,039
picked maybe that's important if you

167
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,919
want to grow you know a whole bunch of

168
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:18,280
head lettuces and sort of leave them and

169
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,919
pick them one at a time growth rate is

170
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:23,039
often said Slow versus Fast growth rate

171
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:25,479
intermediate growth rate grows well

172
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,319
early grows well late likes heat likes

173
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:30,360
cold you'll see all of these descriptive

174
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:32,639
terms uniformity I often see so that's

175
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,280
good if you're doing some preserving

176
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,240
projects where you want beets that are

177
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,120
all the same size or if you're selling

178
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,880
them in a market and you want them to be

179
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,039
a similar size and shape and then

180
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:45,520
there's all the other

181
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:49,120
words perfectly compliments strong

182
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:51,400
handles holds color unique coloration

183
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,880
weight speed and crunch these are the

184
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,960
