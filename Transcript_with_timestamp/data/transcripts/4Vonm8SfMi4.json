  "text": "hey folks this is Josh Tony rich farmer welcome to the farm blog today beautiful beautiful day here on the farm I've been out working in the garden and as I started working out in the garden this morning something disturbing has happened what's going on right now is there is an airplane flying about a hundred feet above the tree line here on the farm and it's spraying some sort of pesticide on my farm this is a government mandated pesticide spray going on on my farm I can smell it in the air I was out working in the garden we're gonna take you down and show you the garden we're gonna show you this plain here in just a minute it's been flying back and forth back and forth over my farm all morning long and I'm afraid to go outside I'm afraid to breathe this stuff in I don't want to breathe it in so I'll show you guys so come along today we'll give you a little garden update and I'm gonna show you this plane that's flying over spraying pesticide across my farm it's something something's not right about that I had no choice no choice in this matter at all [Music] guys before we get started I want to show you some cool new additions to the farm family check them out guys we ended up getting six little baby ducks for the farm here and this is our little mobile coop idea basically it's just a rope right here and we just move this coop basically every day or every other day and the back of it is on snow skis so pretty cool little setup you just lift up on the front and you pull this coop from different paddock to different paddock little squares and that's so the baby ducks get fresh grass every day cool basically every morning my routine when I'm not working is to get up go out in the garden do a little bit of work in the garden for an hour or so and I'll take you through and I'll show you what we're doing I've got some interesting concepts on weed control and chicken coops down here - guys please click that like button this is your first time - Stern your Ridge Farm channel please subscribe to the channel and follow us on our farm journey I'll show you what I was doing this morning when I walked outside I'll just walk over here in the garden show you so these are our tomato plants these are beef eater tomato plants and this is our trellis system posted a video about that a couple days ago and these are more Tomatoes I've got a nice decent little line of gourds out here more Tomatoes out there squash different squashes and corn over here you know just a simple garden guys I've doing a lot of weed control as you can tell look at how nice that is just no weeds whatsoever all natural so I'll show you what we're doing on weed control this area here looked like that right there that's how many weeds were growing up through all of my squash plants so we went through with a hoe and just hold them out and cleaned up the weeds all natural no sprays no nothing like that now my corn it's another story I haven't been in there and weeded yet but we'll get in there in the next day or so now we've got a beautiful row of green beans going right here and this is again the trellis system that we're using and we've got some cucumbers and that's our orchard that you can see out there I think we have about sixty fruit trees growing and our honeybees these are our cucumbers here and we have a little trellis system and we have a couple rose that we're just gonna weed and we'll be planting some okra right here so we're leaving a few extra rows just in case we want to plant some extra goodies in the garden this year so everything here in the garden is symbiotic symbiotic meaning everything works on everything else the honeybees are right back there they are there for fertilizing our fruit trees which are there and for our garden and we also have our chickens closeby so we can spread chicken manure here on the garden too now once the garden Peters out at the end of the season well fence this whole area in and leave the chickens in here and let them munch down all the goodies and put down some good but fertilizer for us manure that good old but fertilizer this will be a wonderful garden for us to feed our family on most of the time when we plant stuff like green beans we'll do a lot of canning so there'll be a lot of canning videos to come soon but I really just want to come out here show you the garden to show you what's going on and talk to you about this government mandated spraying that I'm just not comfortable with I'm just not comfortable with it guys post a comment down there tell me what you think soon as this plane flies over again he must have went and reloaded with spray but I mean I can taste it in the air I can taste it on the back of my teeth and when I was out here working this morning I actually had to go back into the house shut all the windows and you know I was just afraid that breathing that stuff was gonna make me sick not cool not cool let's get you a shot of this plane when it flies over it's literally skimming the top of the trees so here on the farm channel we use a drone sometimes when we fly the drone around and we have to stay below 400 feet now this plane is clearly below 400 feet that's my airspace that's the air that I breathe I don't know again I asked you post a comment down there should I have to go inside for fear of this chemical spray that's being released into the air over my farm are 200 acre farm here it comes here comes the plane [Music] I don't want to breathe this that's flying right over my field over there [Music] I shouldn't have to breathe that I shouldn't have to breathe this man I shouldn't have to breathe this in a free country I didn't vote for that I didn't vote for some airplane to be flying over my farm spraying for a gypsy moth now it might be for the best if any of you guys know about this stuff leave a comment down there we're gonna actually hop on the Gator here and we're gonna run over and I'll show you one of these little gypsy moth traps okay it's a big orange trap all right so I'm over here on the other side of my farm and this chemical spray it just feels like it's coating my body so right here is one of the gypsy moth traps so you can see a little flag from the road and right here is one of the traps it's like a corrugated plastic trap that's set up for these gypsy moths now the whole area here just has a foul smell of spring going on I don't know exactly what the what the spray is but we all received a letter from the government saying that the spray was safe and then it wouldn't harm you I smell it if I smell it they can harm me I don't know I'm gonna I'm gonna get over here in the middle of my field and get a shot of this plane coming over here I mean I could so bad it's so bad that I'm underneath where the plane is flying and my neighbor's kids are outside playing and I just want to tell them to go inside the basic gist of this is that the government can come in and do whatever they want to do I guess guys I really hesitated to make this video I stood about it and I've stood about it enough to where I think it's probably just about quitting time for this spray crew that's flying over I don't know tell me what you think they're dropping pesticide on my land on my trees on my honeybees on my garden I don't know what this pesticide is it's supposed to kill the gypsy moth or the gypsy moth larvae I don't know a whole lot of history on the gypsy moth I hear that they attack the ash tree and we have ash trees around here but not very many of them there's just a smell there's just a chemical smell in the air you can feel it in your in your mouth you can field in your nose you can feel it on your skin and to me something's not right about that I couldn't work in my garden this morning for fear of being sprayed by government-mandated airplane there's just something not right about that if any of you guys know anything about the gypsy moth or if anything like this has ever happened to you post me a comment down there and just tell me what you think even if this hasn't happened to you tell me what you think I don't know whether they're organic farms around here I do know that they're organic tobacco farms around here and they're flying over them spraying them too so I don't know does that ruin the organic miss of of your garden of your tobacco farm I don't know I was torn about doing a video about this because I guess it's for the best I guess it's for the greater good but to me I should be able to work out in my garden in the morning and not worry about an airplane flying over spraying me with pesticide from the government guys thanks a lot for watching the farm vlog today I just wanted to show you one of the concerns one of the things that's going on on the farm give you a little garden update and you know just tell you what I'm concerned about here so this is your first time Pamela like button click that little bell down there don't notify when I post a new video and we'll see you next time on Stoney Ridge farm Channel [Music] Pierce we had some ways opposed to me stone Tyrion [Music]",
