00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:14,700
to take you along for my morning chores

3
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:19,279
it's gonna grab some breakfast my go-to

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,279
breakfast cereal is many processed foods

5
00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:29,189
it's the best of both worlds

6
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:32,630
you got your sweet side and you got your

7
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:32,630
regular side

8
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:46,590

11
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:10,959
the pair of the meat birds a bag of food

12
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,959
[Applause]

13
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:38,380
on the farm here let's measure feed out

14
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:41,259
by this new gallon bucket most common

15
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:45,689
what a Mexican water bucket I hate the

16
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:50,380
gallon version that works well we're

17
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:52,030
measuring out the feed I usually tell

18
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:59,200
myself is this a one bucket or two

19
00:01:52,030 --> 00:02:01,890
bucket operation and go ahead and move

20
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:10,960
this chicken tractor

21
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:10,960
[Applause]

22
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:18,719
[Applause]

23
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:31,639
[Applause]

24
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:47,080
[Applause]

25
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,279
[Applause]

26
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,680
now unto the other chicken tractor

27
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,279
[Applause]

28
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:39,200
now right behind me is the main flaw now

29
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:40,640
they are taking care of is they have the

30
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,410
automatic chicken water bucket right

31
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:48,799
there and then they have a lot of feed

32
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:52,579
in the inside that I only have to fill

33
00:03:48,799 --> 00:04:00,379
it up like maybe every two weeks then

34
00:03:52,579 --> 00:04:02,000
over here I have some juveniles that are

35
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:07,459
growing up and they're taken care of

36
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:12,069
with the automatic chicken water then up

37
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:12,069
in here either feeder

38
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:21,430
and then I just gotta finish put in the

39
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:24,129
other water and that front chicken

40
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:29,169
tractor and I almost forgot to show you
