  "text": "uh first of all I want to just say that I am not a PhD I am a PhD candidate so hopefully I'll have that done uh here within the next year year and a half so uh one of the things that um I'd like to uh talk about is um how we can mimic mother nature and I'm having a little bit of difficulty doesn't seem like I can move so I'm going to let you guys move it let's go to the next slide so we want to mimic Mother Nature with the application of manure and when I talked to Regulators I'd like to remind them that you know in the early 1800s we had over 60 million buffalo in the United States and and the question I like to often ask is did they stop eating or pooping in the winter time and of of course they didn't and and did we have a water quality problem so um as far as we know we had pretty good water quality back then I think there's a few lessons we can learn from uh the Buffalo first you need to apply the manure to a live crop second if we apply low rates and we've already heard many of our speakers talk about that and then really third is proper uh management of that grass uh uh those those Buffalo rotational gray so if we go to the next slide and if you look at uh This Grass uh you can see that uh in in one case we have a lot of roots and in another case so we have very few so I'm reminded uh several years ago uh there there was a report that came out that said 45% of the osor is coming off of graze land and that confused me until I saw this slide in a lot of cases where we have uh very little top growth we'll get about 50% top growth 50% uh below ground growth and if you have the grass is over Grace you're not going to have very many roots there uh we we need to think about how we manage not only the cover crops but all all of our plants so the more Roots we have you have to remember live Roots absorb soluble nitrogen soluble phosphorus next slide so if we look at uh some Concepts on eco-farming where we're using notil and cover crops we hear a lot about notel how the macropores move that water through the soil very quickly so I like to think of them as super highways but if we can move that water from a macropore to a micropore to a biopore uh we can actually use the roots there where we have the cover crops and they can actually absorb a lot of this nitrogen and they can slow down uh the the the water so that we have time for that minerology the soil Act is a a very good filter of these nutrients so between the minerology and live plants we can absorb a lot of soluble nutrients especially nitrogen and phosphorus next next slide so as we look at um uh what we've done when we do intensive tillage we tend to get these hard pans or a plow pan there uh here we're going down uh 20 cm or about 8 in and uh that gives us less soil volume to work with where we have continuous noil and of course my goal is to have uh continuous living cover out there we have this network of biopores uh that uh will slow that water down and give it time that we can actually absorb uh some of that nitrogen and phosphorus so it's it's a retention time the longer we can retain that water in uh in the soil the the better U we can uh absorb some of that nitrogen phosphorus next slide so uh as we look at some of the data soil organic matter is extremely important on average we' lost about 50 to 60% of our soil organic matter uh from our soils uh if you look at a sandy soil um it may have anywhere from 1 to 2 and a half um uh store 1 to 2 and A2 Ines of water but it really depends on the amount of soil organic matter so the higher the soil organic matter what this slide shows is that so organic matter and available water holding capacity per inch uh inches of water per one foot of soil so a sand will go from 1 to 2 and2 a silt Loom can go from uh almost 2 to four uh and a silly clay LOM can go from 1.4 to three again as you increase that so organic matter you can uh really store more water and have more chance to treat it next slide it's also related though to how fast the water is moving So the faster the water is moving it's actually exponential so it goes up 2 to the six t uh Power so uh if I double the speed of water I can actually uh uh carry 64 times more nutrients so going from 1 to 2 mph is 64 times more nutrients uh that uh uh that water can hold some of our streams are actually moving now at 16 to to close to 30 m hour we see a lot of flashiness there and so that's over a thousand times more nutrients the good thing about the cover crops and the plants as they slow that water down and then they'll drop their load next slide if we look at where nutrients are extracted majority of them are extracted in that top couple of inches so that's where we want to put the manure as much as possible uh and uh the deeper we get that manure in the soil if we inject it too deep uh the closer we are to some of our subsurface drain so again over 40% generally at least on corn 40% of it's be taken up within that top 6 in so we want to think about root structure and where that manure needs to be applied next next slide so what what cover crops to use uh there's a there's a number of different ones we have grasses versus brassas versus legumes the nice thing about the grasses they tie up uh nitrogen and phosphorus they have very fibrous root systems um most of them live year round one of the best cover crops we have to tie up uh manure is oats but the problem with oats are they they generally die uh in the winter brascas uh also take up uh a lot of manure they they can take up a very high concentration of nitrogen uh but again some of those brascas especially the r radishes will die when it gets to be about 15\u00b0 fah legumes already make their own nitrogen but they will readily absorb uh uh free nitrogen if it's out there so in in many cases we may decide to put out a uh a mixture but if we are going to put out a mixture we would really heavily lean towards some of the grasses cuz they they tend to do maybe just a little bit better job Force so again as we look at some of the different types of cover crops next slide um we're looking at the grasses some of the ones that that uh we like to use Are cereal Rye TR annual Ry grass barley uh wheat uh again oats is probably one of the best ones but it depends on what time of the year if you're going into the winter uh the oats can die off the Sorghum both the Sorghum and most of the millets are summer annuals so they will die with the first frost on brasas radishes are commonly used however those radishes get a very big root and they uh can cause almost like preferential flow they're going to move that uh nutrients when they Decay uh could move those nutrients lose them very quickly so you have turn-ups uh some of the ones that will survive the winter are kale and rape and then the legumes there's a number of different legumes uh again we probably want those to be a fairly small amount of the mixture because they do make their own nitrogen uh and they do tend to have tap roots that will will move that manure uh down uh quite deep next slide uh you can see some of the nitrogen uptake uh this was a study we did at Ohio State Annual Ride grass had uh anywhere from 5 to 5.3% nitrogen in the tissue we had four 4550 lbs of of nitrogen being recycled serial Rye had 4 to 42% nitrogen the tissue or about 350 to 400 lounds of nitrogen and of course the daycon radish they had the highest uptake but again they also had the fastest release because uh they can uh uh they will decompose once it gets cold next slide shows uh uh probably what we'd like to say is an award-winning uh uh radish this is Dave brand uh who who raises a lot of radish again the problem with the radishes uh they take up a tremendous amount of nutrients uh very efficient but uh since they don't survive the winter uh in most cases uh they they can release it so on the next slide we're looking at the amount of fall soil nitrate after manure application uh this was an average of 24 test over seven field sites you can see where we had no cover we had 21.3 parts for million nitrogen compared to where we had the oil seed radish uh we had 6.5 in in the in the soil so those radishes take up a lot of of nutrients however again they can be an issue uh going into the winter if if when they die what are the best cover crops next slide for manure uptake uh again oats and radish are probably the best ones if you're applying in the uh in the summer uh early fall but if you're going to if you want those nutrients toh tie over into uh the winter and through the spring months you can see the ones that we have starred that means that they generally survive the winter seral Rye annual Ry grass are uh have some of the the best root structures and take up a lot of of nutrients uh wheat and barley can also take up nutrients but they're not don't have near the root structure that Cal Rye or anual Ry grass for the brasas we have kale and rape uh you can see the turnips and the radish they generally will die out and then all the uh the legumes we have winter peeas crimson clover red clover sweet clover hay vetch uh cow peas is one that is a an annual summer annual and that will die out next crop uh as you can see here uh this is a slide where we had annual Ry grass and we can get tremendous growth uh these grasses take up a uh a lot of nor her where we plied 6,000 gallons of swine manure and we got some tremendous growth just within 45 days so again the grasses have more of a fibrous root system and are very efficient at taking up manure nutrients next next slide cover crops for winter application of manure what do we want in a good cover crop we want a live plant to absorb both nitrogen and phosphorus I prefer to see fibrous root systems versus a Tap Root not that we can't do some mixtures but you want to make sure that you have some that are going to survive that winter uh and uh have some of the fibers more fibrous root systems we want something that will hold up the equipment in wet weather uh in a lot of cases uh especially on livestock Farms there's the forage possibilities of getting something out of that cover crop it needs to be easy to kill and then we don't want to have too many carryover problems for the next crop either with insects weeds or uh tying up those nutrients too long so if we let those grasses grow too long in the spring sometimes we can get some apathic effects uh or uh they'll uh tie up that nitrogen and won't make it available to the next crop if they get too high of a carbon and nitrogen ratio next C next slide cover crops again for manure winter manure application uh these are probably the the five best ones kind of in order seral Ry annual Ry grass sometimes with Annual Ride grass can be a little tough to kill uh and it can become a weed problem the tral The Barley the wheat uh if you're looking at mixtures uh don't want to put out too many of the radish probably no more than a pound per acre at the most oats can be part of that mixture and then uh obviously we can put a few of the legumes in but we don't want them to make up too much last issue is uh uh some things that we might want to be a little bit concerned about is on very short pastures because we don't have the the root growth there uh we can get uh a lot of uh uh either running off the surface or even through preferential flow we can get cracks in those those pastures it's all about root growth and then where we have alphalpha hay because it has such a long tap route uh and especially on a mature alphaalpha hay field uh they tend to be very leaky and sometimes those can uh get into uh uh the tile line so you have to be a little bit concerned you have to pick your cover crops uh in order to avoid some of these issues so I think cover crops can really help us uh uh by adding that extra organic matter and tying up some of these soluble nutrients",
