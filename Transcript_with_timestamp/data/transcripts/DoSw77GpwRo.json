  "text": "[Music] We're doing something a little bit different today. We're working over 300 goats. Got our hands full. We're going to dive into some details of goat ranching with the Pokeet family. Joe Poke and his wife and their two daughters doing something that's very important. We're going to work their goats today. Babies, Billies, nannies, all of them. And they're going back out in the pasture. [Music] Okay. Yeah. [Music] [Applause] [Music] This kid right [Music] here. This kid's already been working together. You got you running the gate. Okay. So Kevin, my stepdad, and Joe Pokeet work together for the Noble Foundation. If you don't know a little about Kevin, Kevin is the goat and sheep guy. Always has been. been into the sheep and goats business for uh probably ever since he was a kid. Um and then Kevin does some stuff with goats at the Noble Foundation and works with Joe Poke. But this is Joe and his wife's little side hustle about a pound. Yeah. They eat her up at cell. If she If she's lame, I'll catch her. She's just struggling with her horns. Okay. Now, we know obviously there's a huge difference between working goats and bison. Definitely a lot more hands-on experience when you're working the goats, but honestly, it's not that much different other than you're dealing with a,000 lb animal versus anywhere from 60 to 100 lb animal. It's same sort of process. So once we kind of corral the goats and get them from one big pin to a smaller pin and even into another smaller pin from there is where you have to sort the nannies away from the kids. All of these goats today are getting proper vaccinations just like we would when we're working the bison. So, if we've got calves, they're going to get a couple of different vaccinations that those are one time vaccinations for their whole life, such as black leg. Oh, I can handle that. Yeah, we got we got these baby goats are getting the same thing. So that's why they're kind of separated. And also most of the mills um are going to get banded. And this is part of the meat industry in goats. And so this is pretty standard uh when you have when you're working females and males. The boys, if you're not selling them for a breeding goat, then they're going to be used on the meat side of things. obviously for grazing and stuff which is what the pes are doing in this but in order to make a profit off your animals you've got to either sell some for breeding or meat and in this case this area of the United States the goat meat and hair sheep meat is becoming very popular and is a growing industry. So, just as a farmer raising crops or a bison rancher raising bison, you've got to be able to pay your bills, pay for your fencing or feed or any of that. You've got to be able to sell some animals to make a profit to pay those bills. And it doesn't matter how many animals you have, whether it's 300 or you have 10. Okay. So, I don't know anything about the ear cutting. It's just male. Female. Oh boy. I wasn't sure either. Male, female. I don't have a I didn't get my tags in time. I would have tagged them, but then I know cuz we're going to have another flock of them here. Yeah. So then I know which way we work these ones. Yeah. And so what? Left ears. Left ear. Left ear is female and right ear is male. Okay. Is that right? It's a thing. It's a thing. That's the way the doies. You want to pet this? Okay. Nice to meet you. What do you think, Brooks? They work good. They're cute, aren't they? So cute. Don't touch that. It's a owie. Two or three times. So cute. How old? Oh gosh. Probably like a couple weeks. Okay. Yeah. Or wait, is this the umbilical part? Oh, yeah. Probably a week. A week. I was going to say they're small. They're so tiny. No, I like this one. I just They don't like This is more wormer. It's a It's a different worm than what we're given before. Okay. I get a different class of worms in them. Gotcha. That's Is it targeting one specific? Probably, but I don't know. Well, I wouldn't either. So, Feisty little sister here. Yeah. Might do hurt too. And yeah. black or that big do. It's the big black. No, I think it's the big dough. This one right here. Yeah, it's that big. Just her feet are pretty. You want to look at her feet or No, just her [Music] Yeah, I go ahead. Yeah, let's just put a little I This one doesn't work. Third time down here. He's like Yeah, I don't think it's going to get out. But that's a we need that other So, what did you just give her, Kevin? Sore mouth vaccine. Sore mouth. And then that's just a dewormer. No, no, no, no, no, no. That from here is a great angle. You can see the sorting of the nannies versus the kids. As you can see here, it's very important to have good equipment, a good handling facility so you're able to sort out your animals in a efficient way. Nannies, Billies, kids, and you can work them properly and then let them back out into the pasture. These animals are not in here for very long and they're being handled in a short amount of time. Just like in the bison industry, you've got to have good equipment. And Joe here set up the pins perfectly and I think everything went great. C and D, which is for clustial peripheres. C and D. This one actually does B and tetanas. Mhm. All the above. All the above. Okay. B is like overeating disease. Okay. C is like uh what's type C? I can't remember. Oh, it's like a like a sour gut thing, I think. I can't. Yeah, it has. I can't I know D knee is like overeating. Yeah, D is overeating and then the tea is just straight. Used to everybody give straight. Now they mix. You can still buy. Oh, you're good. I was just listening to straight kill. So, they will get that now in the spring. Will you redo it like in the fall? Probably not. Just depends like so we do it now. So hopefully they pass a little bit immunity to the bread ones. Okay. Cuz a lot of these hopefully are bred to kid here in another two months. So we want to give it to them now. That way the kids can get it and then when we vaccinate the kids it's they're a little more protected against it. Sure. Unless claustrdia isn't everything like it's everywhere. And so I don't know is that's like a that's that's what we're vaccinating for is the claustrdia peripheres and there's different strains of it and it's like just lives in the soil. It's everywhere. It's not everybody has it. It's in your gut microb, you know, microfllora and stuff, but when you get stressed or if you have a inflammation of some kind, then it'll take it's a bacteria. It'll take over and cause problems. Gotcha. Gotcha. Did you do this one already, Jesse? Yes, sir. [Music] Golly. Kevin lease pokeet some of these billies and they can spread their love. It just be like Big Joe being rented and going to somebody else's property. Same thing. This is just another way to make a profit off your animals. You can actually rent or lease out your billies and other producers can use those billies. Different genetics, different breeds for their own benefit. Needs a little WD40, I'd say. [Music] Oh, here [Music] he goes inside. [Music] by the door. I got [Music] ready. Isa, you want to let them out? Did you give them this? The two little ones. Little ones. Were those worked? Yeah, they already had 10. I think they got worked already. Okay. They're the They're the escape artists, I think. Right. [Music] Open it up. Open it up. Open it up. Okay. She's so funny. She says well. [Music] Mom. Mom. Help me. No. All right, here it is. The last big group of goats that are going to work today. Kind of takes a team effort on something like this. Instead of using a pusher like we would for the bison, obviously way more dangerous situation when working bison. But as far as the goats, just kind of coring them and pushing them and funneling down into a smaller pin and obviously into another smaller pin. Same thing that we would do with bison. Goats will be goats. And if there's one animal I would compare bison to. I compare them to goats all the time. As far as behavior goes, they're just so curious. They're so nosy. Just like a goat. I think bison are just as nosy. [Music] trying to find his little turn the whole way and then straightened up in the I'll just ask. Okay. So, Joe's here and one of the questions that I think is important uh for me, people have talked to me about using, you know, we have our bison and they're after the grasses. One of the things that people always mention is using goats for cleanup that the bison don't eat. Can you talk about multiecies grazing? Joe does this full-time already for the Noble Foundation and then as a side hustle, too. So, I mean, he's got a lot of experience. So, what what's your opinion of of the using the goats? So, I'm fairly new to goats, too, only in the last 3 or 4 years, but you can see pretty quickly the impact they have on the land. And the good thing is a lot of this land hasn't had goat impact, so it's really primed for it. and they they would prefer to eat the brows and the forbes and you know leave the grass. So when we mix that with a large room like bison or cattle or something it the symbiosis the nature symbiosis is apparent. You know it's it's pretty obvious. So at this place here we've got at least we there's a lot of a lot of brush that we're trying to beat it back a little bit. So we're stocked pretty aggressively but that's on purpose to help open some of this up and then of course we let everything have adequate rest to grow back. So the way it's split now, this is kind of the open half and then the wooded half is over there. So we graze them over here in the winter. And then what's been really cool and we should go I go take you around and look at it. But what's really cool here is in the winter we just had this rested for an entire summer. So there's a lot of dead native grass. But the little three and fourt tall cedars, there's nothing left of them. They destroyed every one of them. Yeah. Well, you can even look right here behind you. Oh yeah. And you can see what four or five feet tall. There's no green underneath those trees. And it's not because I mean we're pretty early into spring too, but this is that's the browse line. Yeah. And right now I usually have them a little more fenced in. Right now we're just trying to get around everything very fast. So they have a big area which is not how we manage it normally, but just the kind of context we're right now. So they kind of get this and they get to pick at the brush over there and there's not enough just to lock them on it. So yep. But they're getting all this really emerging stuff. And you're absolutely right. They're there. Definitely a browse line here. And that's only from, you know, the 30 days the brush has been growing. That's crazy. Yeah. And the cedar tree thing, too, is like bison will they're not going to eat it, but they're going to whip it so bad and they can break it and it eventually die. But a goat's going to come through and gnaw on those those things. And once they lose their needles, they're I mean, they're dead. They're going to die. And and and they the goats really prefer that in the winter time. It compliments their diet. You know, there's a lot of tannins in cedar, too, and that helps kind of with the parasites, keeping them clean and, you know, healthy. So, you we can I can Let's go over my truck and I'll show you some stuff. Show you. Yeah. And there's definitely some cedar trees that they've killed just from eating all the needles. But, too, some of the bigger ones, they've rung the run the bark and done the cadium cadmium or cad can't remember, but they get in that layer of the bark and that that's going to kill that tree. Kills it too. Yeah, absolutely. And we're not trying to kill all the trees, but no, this is a a jungle. It's kind of unmanageable. So goats can open that up and we can, you know, we might have to do some mechanical intervention to open the canopy up to get some more native grasses growing because, you know, ideally we're in the cross timbers eco region, right? So we want this to be a cross timber savannah. Yes. Scattered trees and lots of grass. And they're going to help you get they're going to help you clean it up enough where you can see, okay, we need to get in here with maybe a skid steer. That's right. You know, and and do that. So, so the other thing is to me I think the goat thing is becoming a more approachable side hustle and maybe full-time for some people. Um, not only if it's multiecies species grazing, but it they're just they're they can be difficult like keeping them in your fence, but no different than bison. Keep them happy and fed, watered, all those things. But just you know, like it's a business. It's a little side business now. And I think it's more approachable um now because I think more people are saying, \"Hey, you can use these animals to clean up your property.\" And as long as you got good fencing and all those things, keep them happy, you can run a business off of it. That's right. And you know, the way things are today with the barrier to entry to getting started in agriculture is really, really high. Right. Yep. Mostly capital. But you know, we're we're first generation ranchers and we've been doing this professionally. I've been doing it professionally for somebody else for over 20 years. So, we're not new by any means, but we're still first generation trying to make our make our run at it. And I always get always thinking saying like you got to be willing to do what other people aren't willing to do. Yep. And lots of people would rather just have cows and I want to have a ranging business. Yeah. So, if the goats are going to help us do that and it wasn't without it work, you know, somebody told me that you get paid to learn how to keep goats in. And I always thought that was funny because I' I've spent more time working on the fence here. Yeah. I mean, there was four or five months of just working on the fence even bothering us and but knowing just from my experience at work, too. Just knowing that that was important. Yeah. Don't have to be chasing them around. Absolutely. I want to show you a couple. Yeah. I want to Well, I want to get some. Of course, cedars. They all know that. They all know that I hate cedar trees. Yeah. Let's go. Let's get my truck and I'll go show you. Okay. Let's go look at them. that has just been gobbled up. Like there's nothing left of those cedars. Nothing left. And now that tree instead of having I don't know 8 n 10 cedar trees taking water, you've got a big one big oak tree oak tree that can can get some more water and it creates a better habitat for whether turkeys want to roost there or not. Yep. Haven't got up there high enough. But if they need to, they could stand up, push that thing over, and eat it. I've watched them do that if they have to. That's pretty cool. Little one in the back. They were barking that one. Yeah. So, they are knocking the bark off of it. That is so cool. Yeah, that's good stuff. So, this is something that a bison will not do. They do not won't browse off these type of trees, but what a bison will do is rub and rub and rub it. Rub until they're all broke and then they snap and then they're dead. Yeah, it looks ugly for a while until it rots away, but yeah, all of those right here under this big old oak tree. Pretty cool. Yep, there is. All them cedars. Look at all those cedars. Yeah. And they're ripping the bark off that one over there. Yeah. Yeah. So, and that was really good feed this winter for them. Absolutely. Balances the gut and they're getting what they need. And then I guarantee you before you put these goats in there, you couldn't see that green grass on the other side. Oh, for sure you could. This was all completely covered and now wildlife can go in and out of there 100%. Yep. We're big on on deer habitat, too. And Yep. You can go over here on stuff that doesn't have a goat in So here, this is what we'd call more than likely field fence. Starts out low or it starts out small here and it gets bigger as you get to the top. And this one is only going to be 36 in tall, 3 ft up here on the side of my hip. This is your typical goat fence. And As long as you got plenty of forge, you keep them happy. They don't need to jump over anything. Could also keep predators out as well, I think. You think this helps uh keep coyotes out? Yeah, you can find them. So, like here, little crawl spaces. This was a this is just a wash, but I put a log in there, you know. Yeah. But goats will get out there, too. So, yeah, they will. across the fence. You can see the Yeah, that's a good way to look at it. So, this is obviously Joe's. Look at this. All of the growth, all the underbrush. You I mean, you can't see through there at all. And then you come over here and I you can see 30 40 yards in there to the other side. You can see the browse line and this is only 4 months having them in here. Four months, you know. Yeah. Not continuously. They they grazed this in December and then they've had access access to it now for probably the last two weeks. So, it's had a little bit of rest, but yeah, definitely definitely a major difference between the two sides. Absolutely. Yeah, you can see all the way through there. That's so cool. Yeah, we just saw a goat and deer can see that. And yeah, pigs and or whatever else, you know, whatever wildlife you want. Turkeys, quail. I mean, they're more determined to run through some of this stuff now. Yeah. And forage and Well, they have a chance to. I mean, they can pick their way through that, but it's just kind of a a jungle. Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't want to go through that. Yeah. Me either. So, yeah. This looks awesome. Looks really good. Something I've learned about the bison, too, in places like this. I was like worried, do I need goats? Do I need to put goats in some of our um brushy areas or our tree lines? You know, thought about doing that. But what the bison have done is they're just big and broad and don't care. They just bulldoze. They just bulldo through there and you you'd be surprised they'll go through and nip at stuff for sure, but they'll just blow through there and create and open it up. It's kind of surprising. So So the next issue we have is we can see what's going on here now, but there's still not very much sunlight getting through the canopy. So, like all these little trees, we're just gonna have to come in here mechanically and open open the canopy up. Yeah. You know, you leave the big and Yeah. Leave the big oaks and pecans and stuff like that. But Yeah. And so, traditionally, all the unullet would have handled that way back when. That's right. But when you put a fence up and then you don't manage it, you take away from, you know, what nature would have been doing hundreds of years ago. take the unullet away and then all the shrubby stuff that a a deer or an analopee that were here back in the day or elk and y bison would have wouldn't have let any of this stuff happen and then you don't manage it and then here's what happens or fire too or fire. Yeah, that's I was fixing to say like these big these are big honey locust and stuff and yeah, they're they're good they can be good fodder for wildlife too but they'll take over an area pretty easy too. fast. They'll do it fast. They can be invasive. Yeah. So, you when you put a fence up, all that changes if you don't manage it. But I would almost guarantee you that this was all peanuts or cotton at some time. Oh, I mean, look how big these oak trees are. Yeah. There's not big oak trees like that out in the middle. And then there's a lot of there's old wheel line wheels here and all aluminum pipe. So, you know, this wasn't always a forest. Like, that's the main argument is like, well, you're letting nature go back to what nature wants to do. This was probably plowed in the 30s and 40s. It was peanuts. Yep. You know. Yep. Yeah. There are some big trees in here. And then over time it can happen. Yep. This is what this is how it goes. And so you just got the deer or whether the hogs too that we have now, but all the analopee are gone, all the bison are gone, all the elk are gone. And so you can kind of follow up or add in the goats and this is what you get. That's right. I like it. Thanks, Joe. Yeah, it's good stuff. That is a big old tree in there. Is that a pecan? Is it? I've never looked very close at it. Look at her. Little fresh set right there. Little bitty Brooks. Well, Brooks, Marissa, and I want to personally thank the Poke family for inviting us out to do a little goat ranching today. I hope you guys learned something new about goat ranching. I know it's a little bit different than biceing, but it's great to compare those species and you can kind of imagine the same thing the goats can do and what the bison can do and what those type of animals were doing historically on the great plains. You can thank all the unullet, goats and bison, deer, elk, and all of them that kept the great plains wide open and full of native grasses. I want to thank them for letting us a video today and showing their operation and what they do. Great people, great little family. I love what they're doing. Thank you guys for watching us. We'll see you guys soon. and rankable boss ranchion.",
