  "text": "if the weather man is to be believed we got a big ice and snow event coming so we got a lot to do today to get ready for it so let's get to work got to do a little work on my uh gate up here at the entrance to our place cows have rubbed the toost loosened it up got to drive it in a little farther uh then I need to grease the gate this gate the hinges need to be greased every few months doesn't take much this TST that the gate comes up against during the night time when the gaug is closed the cow's rub on it you can see it's all loose needs to be driven in a little farther got this automatic gate opener it's really handy but it's gotten a little bit out of adjustment doesn't quite close liks about 3 or 4 in so so I'm going to make a couple of rounds adjustment there and hopefully that'll do [Music] it this Gate's been really handy because the Cales don't respect the cattle guard so I have to close this at night time still needs a little bit more adjustment got to give it a couple more turns didn't quite get it enough there that's no better I guess we're just going to have to leave it that way or till I read the owner's manual and figure out another way to do it we also got the gate down here at the Creek Place it needs to be greased as well a little cold today so that grease is a tad stiff watch out pigs watch out it's only the second day of captivity and Roger has already learned to eat and getting right in there with the big boys good back girls lots of things to do today before the expected winter storm arrives but extra feeding is the order of the day at every place I have several cows that are really fat but this one right in front of us right now 578 one of the reasons she's so fat is ever since I've had she has sucked other cows after they've had a calf and most people would get rid of her but she doesn't seem to get enough to hurt the Cales so I just keep her but that's why she's so fat I'm feeding these cows hay every other day till the weather gets bad it's supposed to get bad this weekend and stay bad for a week so it's pretty soon I'll have to start feeding them hay every day but I'm trying to stretch that out as long as I can and as you can see the cows are in really good shape so they don't need a lot of extra feed right now but probably as the weather gets bad next week they'll start getting hay every day just to give them enough [Music] energy counted these cows and I'm missing one so we got to go find one and as I suspected it's The Loner one with a dot in her face off barell before I start feeding hay every day I usually try to spread out cubes right beside the hay that I fed yesterday so that when they finish the cubes hopefully they'll go clean up that hay that they haven't quite cleaned up got to wrap up this water Outlet out here in the yard before the singled digit temperatures occur these old insulated coveralls were worned by both of my sons when they were back on the Farm but that's been 25 years ago I'm pretty sure they won't fit either one of them now so we'll just use them for insulation now that really cold weather's here I have to plug this little feeding tractor in every morning for an hour or two before it starts it doesn't have glow plugs like my big tractor so this helps it start a lot easier on these cold mornings winter used to be my favorite season of the year on the farm I enjoy feeding the cattle hay and watching the the new baby be born I still like it but the older I get the better I seem to like spring and fall we're expecting a big ice storm starting uh this afternoon or tonight so the wind is out of the East I'm going to spread this bail out on the west side of this Timber so it's a little bit warmer for them and then I got to go up to the pond and check out where I'm going to have to chop ice I don't know since we've cleaned the pond out so I got to take a look at it and see what where I'm going to chop ice cuz we're going to need to chop ice either tomorrow morning or the morning after Winter's here you can tell a lot about what kind of weather is in store by observing livestock and as hungry as these cattle seem today I believe that we're in for falling weather and I'm not looking forward to it but if the cattle and the weather forecasters are right at least it does give me a chance today to get some of the things set up for the Colder Weather with the bail rings and Waters and things like that with this freezing rain and snow coming I wanted to get the bail rings out and get them set up because probably if it gets really bad we'll have to put some hay in the bail Rings instead of unrolling it got to find a place where it's going to be deep enough to chop ice and the cows look like they're used to coming here but that doesn't look very deep there I think that'll work right here though maybe today before the storm arrives I'm trying to unroll hay in places that'll maybe be sheltered from the winter weather a little bit the blowing uh wind and snow and ice that we're expected to get try to put the hay along these tree lines and maybe protect it from the weather a little bit more well Lou and I both agree it's time to call it a day [Music]",
