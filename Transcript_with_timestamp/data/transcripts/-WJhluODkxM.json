  "text": "well i hope you can hear me over this wind because the wind doesn't stop here on the prairies and uh here i am standing in the middle of an iconic prairie field a wheat field except this isn't a wheat field and i wouldn't have known that last week this is a barley field and you can tell because barley flops over and has this these strands called a beard whereas wheat stands straight up and i couldn't tell the difference until i got here and got a little bit of a reminder of how to recognize okay that's a barley field this is a wheat field they are not identical so prairie agriculture is a completely different type of agriculture than the gardens that i left behind in bc we don't have fields like this in bc we don't have field crops this is just a complete field there's no rows and it's acres and acres of the same thing seeded we didn't see that in bc in bc it's vegetables and they're grown in rows and it's irrigated that's not the way that things work here on the prairies what's good on the prairies they have lots of land it's cold it's not very wet none of these things are good for vegetables so what they grow in the prairies is fields like this grasses that produce seeds or legumes these are some of the most energy and protein-rich plants you can grow and they're not the kind of thing that you grow in a garden they're field crops i think the biggest difference that i've noticed so far between this kind of farming and the kind of farming that i left behind nbc is just how important machines are on this farm you know i remember making a comment back in i don't know may about how so little of what we did at amara farm was mechanized we were doing so much we were healing potatoes by hand we were weeding by hand we were doing almost all of it by hand here it's almost the complete opposite here almost nothing is done by hand it's all about machines and so i've discovered that nathan who's the farmer here for him being a mechanic is not just a useful skill it's an essential skill you cannot be a farmer without knowing about machines and in fact that might be his major skill set is that he's a mechanic he takes care of all these machines that he uses to farm and that's a really different approach he's not spending all of his time on his knees planting things weeding things harvesting things all of those things here are done with machines so i wanted to give you a tour of some of the machinery that nathan keeps around on the farm because he's literally got a different machine for every single possible task he's got on the farm so this is a swather and its role is to cut the crop off the ground and pile it into neat little rows where it can be dried and picked up by the combine the combine combine harvester picks the crop off off the ground threshes it separates it spits out grain at one end and all the chaff and the straw at the other this is a dump truck yes a dump truck is an agricultural tool because on a field of this size it's the only way you're getting the crop off the field and then how do you get it out of the dump truck well this is an aqua the dump truck dumps the grain into the auger the auger transports it up and pours it into those storage bins which are i don't know 25 feet high we just didn't have things like this in bc we were carrying crops off the field in rubbermaid bins that doesn't happen here anyway trying to film all these machines presents some pretty serious challenges to try and film them and i'm scrambling to keep up cause i'm on foot and they're driving around in these big machines so this is what's left of my microphone for me after i dropped in the field and it went through the combine harvester and uh honestly i'm kind of surprised that i found a piece this large i just figured it would have been turned into little pea-sized dust but i guess it got treated as chaff anyway those are my adventures this week it's a very different experience from the garden i've only scratched the surface here you can subscribe to the youtube channel to keep watching every week if you want to know more about what i'm filming that's a documentary called the hands that feed us and you can subscribe to that at the hands that fetus.ca or you can follow me on facebook and instagram and i'll see you next week",
