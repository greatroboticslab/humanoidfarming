  "text": "uh my name is Tim Taylor I operate Crossroad Farm in post Mills Vermont and I farm approximately 50 acres of mixed vegetables we have um Greenhouse Tomatoes we grow approximately 15 16,000 pounds of those uh uh quite a big bedding plant business now and in the field crops Out Here We Grow just a uh about everything uh one time we even tried artichokes one year uh we have um as far as weed strategies uh I think probably the one I focus on the most is to keep my corn crop the cleanest I can I use that as a way to come into my next Fields because it in my operation it takes up a great deal of the uh acreage I like to let no weeds go to seed there so we'll actually but we use no herbicide there I want to stress that right from the start we never have I've always cultivated it uh I use a single row cultiv Ator I use a a two row cultivator the rolling Liston type cultivators and I use some blind cultivation with rotary hose this is a rotary hoe which we use in uh corn comes in all different lengths this is actually a very small one it's been cut down so it does two rows of corn we use it for blind cultivation uh after we've sewed the corn approximately anywhere from 4 to 5 to oh perhaps a week to 10 days later depending upon the soil temperature and the time of the year we'll come in and we just run this right across the top of the crop blindly uh this is usually pre-emergent or just as it's spiking up I use this in corn I've used it in peas and in beans uh it will get about approximately 50 to 60 % of the weeds uh it will get approximately oh maybe 2 to 3% of the corn or the crop you're trying to actually grow uh depending upon that your timing uh you can actually come in when the crop is uh not so much corn but peas and beans when the crop is actually up and starting to Leaf out uh it's one of the pros and the cons of of this it allows you a little more time for more finer cultivation because it does reduce the uh pressure the weed pressure for a period of time and yet it doesn't get them all and you still need to do cultivation I find I still need to do uh single row cultivation as well uh each sprocket here is spring-loaded it'll bear the full weight of the unit uh you can get a little nervous sometimes when you use it because it does sink into the ground quite a ways I find that I'm quite safe as long as I keep my corn planted at 2in level corn planted up a little in the 1-in zone will tend to be dug up a little more often and one of the problems with this tool is that it picks up all my loose plastic from my crops like melons and zucchini and squash I don't know if it's exactly a downsize it gets it out of the field which I do want to get it out the other primary cultivation tool I use is a slightly modern version of 2in shovels we call these the curbco bat wings and they're for single row cultivation although I have seen them used in in other applications in two and three and four cultivation what they consist of is a series of old car bumpers that have been fashioned into these bat wings for throwing dirt uh some of the things I I really like about it are if I have some very mature weeds and then come in quite late uh it will it cuts under them and cuts them quite effectively and rips them up uh it's quite effective where I do have some witch grass CU again it rips it up well here we have the budding basket weeder and what we do here is we plant all our lettuce is grown from and is transplanted we do do nothing from seed into the field it's all transplanted and it's a two row bed system and a week after transplanting approximately we'll come in with a budding basket here which is ground driven off of this chain here and we we can go approximately oh just about as fast as you'd want to drive it on the open field uh 5 mil an hour or so uh it doesn't its Advantage is that it won't throw dirt into the lettuce it'll just it moves in this manner and kicks up the weed seeds cultivating at about 1 in depending upon where I set it in the ground wait about a week because we get a little bit of germination but we don't want to wait too long because we don't want the weeds to be too big the advantage of the belly Mount is that it does not wander the cul the cultivating tool doesn't wander in the field as it would behind the tractor if it was placed behind the tractor I'm able to view straight down at the at the uh single row I can't see both rows but I can see one row and I just uh can see exactly where I'm placing the tool tool absolutely exactly if I daydream a little bit and it wanders off I can catch it real quick whereas when it's behind me in the case of some of the three-point hitch tools that I use for cultivation it it tends to wander a little more and I tend not to have quite the same control that I would have wanted to stress this I own two of these cotas and this is mounted here all year long I don't take this off it's not difficult to mount it's just has four bolts here and four bolts on the other side but I have set just perfectly the way I want it and I honestly believe you should have a tractor for each piece of cultivating equipment you have uh because the downside on all cultivation is the setup time what we do is the the basket is spaced 6 Ines apart and I'll do two passes here the first pass I'll be nursed right up next to the radishes down one side I'll turn around and come back in the same bed up against the other side as close as I can go in that that way I get within usually an inch to 2 in of the crop even though I have 6in spacing on the basket here's the profecta field cultivator this is something new for me that I'm just experimenting this year with I hope it's going to be uh reduce my Reliance upon a rator uh in my field bed preparation normally what are my present practice is to uh subsoil in the spring put the subsoil on a two shank subsoiler run around the entire 30 40 Acre Farm subsoiling and then gradually manure and rivate and make beds as I need them uh and then in the fall once again use the rator to incorporate the residue and I have some concerns about soil structure and I'm trying to uh look for alternatives to that uh and especially the bed preparation in the spring and also in again in for witch grass control",
