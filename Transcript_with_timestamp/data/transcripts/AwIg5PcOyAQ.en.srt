00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,909
everyone this is Ross in today's video

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:05,520
we're gonna be doing a nice little

3
00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:07,950
potato harvest for you guys what's nice

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,139
about harvesting potatoes now it's Jill

5
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,300
its July 20th we've actually been having

6
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:14,880
a really crazy crazy heatwave here in

7
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:18,000
Pennsylvania is that I want to focus on

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:21,240
my fall vegetables so one crop comes out

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,470
and another crop goes in and this is

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,210
kind of really the time to be thinking

11
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,369
about this stuff so if you're in my area

12
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,680
this is really when you need to get

13
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:31,019
something in the ground otherwise you

14
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,730
know it's gonna get too cold the

15
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:35,040
daylight hours are gonna really shorten

16
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:37,469
and you're not gonna reach that maturity

17
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,600
on different things that need a longer

18
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:41,280
season you know things like Brussels

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,930
sprouts as an example or even maybe

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,480
things like broccoli it could be quite

21
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:49,500
difficult for you to get things like

22
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:52,440
that or cabbages so what I'm doing here

23
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,610
is I'm actually gonna be taking all

24
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,680
these potatoes out we're gonna do the

25
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,090
harvest we're gonna clear this out and

26
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,010
then I'm gonna throw over top of this

27
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,260
compost and then I'm gonna direct seed

28
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,850
into this bed and then we're gonna throw

29
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,350
a row cover over top of it and the

30
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,369
reason for the row cover here I want to

31
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:10,140
show you this it's a good example is

32
00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:12,570
that it really helps with white fly or

33
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,090
other insects any pests that are coming

34
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:18,119
in here and potentially attacking our

35
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:20,970
brassicas or other annuals that we put

36
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:23,070
in it's really important because in

37
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:25,380
order to grow brassicas at this time of

38
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:27,930
the year first off you need a heat

39
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:30,900
tolerant brassicas today the heat index

40
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,549
is over a hundred right so if it's

41
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,920
really really warm outside you need

42
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:37,200
something that's gonna not bolt but also

43
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,509
because it's so warm there's certain

44
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,780
insects around that are not normally

45
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:44,880
around in the fall or in the spring so

46
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,939
there's something called white fly at

47
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,829
least where I live and it comes in here

48
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:52,079
and really decimates a lot of the larger

49
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:54,960
brassicas if it really can proliferate

50
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,360
and it also really affects the seedlings

51
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,430
if you direct seed some stuff it gets

52
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,770
those really young seedlings and you're

53
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,750
kind of really off to a horrible start

54
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,509
because if you're damaging those first

55
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:09,060
few leaves on a seedling it really puts

56
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:10,920
that seedling far behind so it's

57
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,569
important I think to really have this

58
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,060
row cover on here so again we're gonna

59
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:16,230
clear this whole thing out

60
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:18,900
we're gonna stick to mostly in this

61
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:20,460
video just the potato harvest we can

62
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,100
talk about the variety here as we go

63
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:25,470
along and then we're gonna cover this

64
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:28,140
again with compost create ourselves a

65
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:29,550
nice little no dig bed even though we're

66
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,900
digging in this right now and then we

67
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,300
can really start thinking about either

68
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,430
direct seeding now or actually adding in

69
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,170
some different things like maybe some

70
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:40,830
garlic we can plant some garlic in here

71
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:43,290
we can plant some potatoes in here you

72
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,820
know we can plant onions as well so it's

73
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,560
all really up in the air but I want to

74
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:49,860
get some certain things in the ground

75
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,200
now get the row cover on and I think

76
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:55,650
this is a nice little transition from

77
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,720
one crop to the other so let me put you

78
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:03,330
guys down right now and then we can kind

79
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:06,210
of get into this potato harvest so what

80
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:08,400
I've been using actually is this this

81
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:11,460
betting fork I want to show you guys

82
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,420
this now I just got this at the store

83
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,950
and I probably could have found

84
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,290
something maybe a little cheaper and a

85
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:20,070
little better but this is really nice

86
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:22,170
for picking up material like hay and and

87
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:23,989
mulch and and wood chips so I got it

88
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:26,250
mostly for that but it's pretty good for

89
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:29,610
getting these potatoes out of the ground

90
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:32,910
which I didn't really expect them to be

91
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:36,450
that deep as they are but it seems like

92
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:38,780
they are and I got to get something in

93
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:42,540
the ground that's not gonna hopefully

94
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:45,780
decimate too much of the potatoes not

95
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,820
gonna damage the potatoes it's not gonna

96
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,280
we're gonna be able to get into the

97
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:52,709
ground it's really hard soil right here

98
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,390
this was not soil that I amended this

99
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:56,640
was not soil that I really have taken

100
00:03:54,390 --> 00:04:00,300
care of at all this is this was grass

101
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:03,030
you know four or five months ago and

102
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:05,270
underneath it is this really heavy clay

103
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:08,220
so getting through this has been

104
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:12,060
definitely a challenge you can see

105
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:15,120
here's the remnants of the potato we

106
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:19,400
planted this is a variety by the way

107
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,400
called German butterball and

108
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:26,080
it is supposed to be the tastiest potato

109
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:27,970
there is it's supposed to be even

110
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,000
tastier than Yukon Gold so what I'm

111
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:32,950
doing is that we're gonna do a nice

112
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,250
little taste test I think later on I

113
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:40,180
don't have any Yukon Gold to compare but

114
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:44,410
we will know for sure based off of what

115
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:47,350
potatoes tasted like last year let's

116
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:49,330
pull this one up this harvest doesn't

117
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:50,470
look this one doesn't look too bad this

118
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:54,340
one looks a bit better than the other

119
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:57,520
one some much larger potatoes here

120
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:59,920
that's good to see oh they're nice and

121
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,920
what's nice about growing your own

122
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:06,100
potatoes guys one you can choose the

123
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:07,390
variety okay I mean that's that should

124
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,490
be obvious to us all

125
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:13,600
there's better varieties in every single

126
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:17,789
thing that we grow but also they're

127
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:21,539
really soft buttery

128
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:23,759
creamy potatoes with a skin that isn't

129
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:28,109
hard it hasn't been cured yet the skins

130
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:32,129
really really smooth so this is a really

131
00:05:28,109 --> 00:05:33,869
good eating potato you know that's

132
00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:37,199
really what it's all about is getting a

133
00:05:33,869 --> 00:05:40,139
higher quality product then we can get

134
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:43,319
at the store and if we can't then what's

135
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:45,449
the point in my opinion now you can get

136
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:48,059
these potatoes like this you know you

137
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:50,489
can get them those really small potatoes

138
00:05:48,059 --> 00:05:52,229
at the store they're usually like

139
00:05:50,489 --> 00:05:53,189
multicolored they have like a blue one a

140
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:57,719
red one a yellow one

141
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:59,309
so that exists but yeah they're really

142
00:05:57,719 --> 00:06:01,289
expensive and you can just get yourself

143
00:05:59,309 --> 00:06:04,319
some seed potatoes and it's probably

144
00:06:01,289 --> 00:06:06,719
more worth it at least so far we're

145
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:11,849
gonna really find out from this harvest

146
00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:14,669
to see if it is indeed worth it but this

147
00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:18,539
may take me quite a bit of time to get

148
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:21,329
through this entire harvest and I don't

149
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:22,619
really have the battery for it so let's

150
00:06:21,329 --> 00:06:25,919
see here's some of the potatoes from

151
00:06:22,619 --> 00:06:29,759
that particular plant as I get in by the

152
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:33,209
way deeper into the bed they're gonna be

153
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,729
more potatoes that's just gonna be a

154
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:39,749
fact because the potatoes on the edge of

155
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:43,679
the bed didn't perform well because of

156
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:45,179
our lawn guys and yeah you're probably

157
00:06:43,679 --> 00:06:49,139
shaking your head long guys but they

158
00:06:45,179 --> 00:06:51,259
really do more damage then they really

159
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:53,639
hurt more than they help from my opinion

160
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:56,519
I'm gonna bring you guys over now to a

161
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:59,849
different planting we had done some in

162
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:01,889
compost but what we had done has really

163
00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:04,589
stuck the potato just on the top of the

164
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:07,110
soil like this and then cover that with

165
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:08,219
so much straw and that was it that's all

166
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:11,279
we did you can see actually this

167
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:12,929
potato's quite green so that's not good

168
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:16,499
this may be something we have to plant

169
00:07:12,929 --> 00:07:19,289
rather than eat but uh let me take you

170
00:07:16,499 --> 00:07:22,499
guys over here instead of putting some

171
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:26,009
of these guys on our hard clay I put

172
00:07:22,499 --> 00:07:27,959
some in compost and I did the same

173
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:31,639
method where it's just directly on top

174
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:31,639
of this

175
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:41,889
however in fact I Madden even need this

176
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:43,870
fork because of how loose the soil is

177
00:07:41,889 --> 00:07:47,169
right here so the soil should be looser

178
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:51,280
more nutritious etc etc everything

179
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:57,219
should be better ok well I still I'm

180
00:07:51,280 --> 00:08:01,960
gonna need it because we pulled up the

181
00:07:57,219 --> 00:08:03,639
plant but that's all we got and maybe we

182
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:10,120
could have waited a bit longer with some

183
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:12,460
of these alright here's some decent

184
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,379
potatoes most of them are like right on

185
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:16,539
the surface of the compost you can get

186
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:18,879
in here with your hands this is not bad

187
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:22,500
at all so you can see the difference

188
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:24,849
here you know look at this nice soil

189
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,469
compared to the other soil that I was

190
00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:30,069
dealing with so I'm just digging around

191
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:32,940
in here seeing if there's anything else

192
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:35,079
in here and I bet you there is but I

193
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:37,390
don't know if I have the most time to

194
00:08:35,079 --> 00:08:39,399
come in here and just start messing

195
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:41,560
around with that hi everyone so I want

196
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:43,599
to show you guys the harvest now we're

197
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,880
really like a few days after what we did

198
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,949
and kind of what we talked about earlier

199
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,260
in the video is getting this whole thing

200
00:08:47,949 --> 00:08:52,209
set up you know the way we want it so

201
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:54,519
that we can direct seed some brassicas

202
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:57,010
in here so what we did is just very

203
00:08:54,519 --> 00:09:00,540
simple we took out all the potatoes

204
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:03,010
really gave this a nice little bed prep

205
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:05,290
took out all the mulch all that straw

206
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:07,019
all the tops the potatoes we put that

207
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:09,550
underneath some of these grapevines here

208
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:11,649
then also we stuck it over here in a

209
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:13,300
pile for now because what we're gonna do

210
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:14,769
is take a lot of woodchips a lot of

211
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,410
mulch and we're gonna put down some

212
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:19,300
cardboard first underneath these apple

213
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:21,149
trees clear out a lot of these weeds man

214
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:23,790
we had just have so many weeds in here

215
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:27,730
it's been an area that I've neglected

216
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:29,680
all spring all summer and these apple

217
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:31,300
trees need it they need more MIDI more

218
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,339
assistance some of these guys don't look

219
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,930
really that great they're on dwarf fruit

220
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:37,990
stalks they just don't grow very quickly

221
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:39,339
I think they have weak root systems some

222
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:42,370
of them have been more susceptible to

223
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:43,970
things like aphids and other different

224
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:46,549
things and to be honest with you

225
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:48,349
I don't really want to grow many things

226
00:09:46,549 --> 00:09:50,389
underneath these trees I think they're

227
00:09:48,349 --> 00:09:52,039
very shallow rooted so we'll put down a

228
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:55,309
lot of mulch put down a lot of organic

229
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:57,049
material and that's gonna break down in

230
00:09:55,309 --> 00:09:58,970
the compost over time and we're gonna

231
00:09:57,049 --> 00:10:00,949
have healthier apple trees because of it

232
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:03,470
but unfortunately it's gonna take a few

233
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:05,479
years for that to happen but you can see

234
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:07,429
this is all really planned well and came

235
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:11,029
out well like this is really nice

236
00:10:07,429 --> 00:10:12,889
soil we've down the just natural soil

237
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:15,139
conditioner I love this stuff this is

238
00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:17,449
great for growing anything guys it's

239
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:20,239
half compost and the other half is a

240
00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:21,559
pine bark and that stuff really helps

241
00:10:20,239 --> 00:10:24,979
break down I think it gives a nice

242
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:27,470
little breakdown of nutrients a bit more

243
00:10:24,979 --> 00:10:30,769
over time whereas you do have some

244
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:32,929
pieces now which if the soil is broken

245
00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:37,609
down enough which sometimes it's not but

246
00:10:32,929 --> 00:10:40,069
in most cases it is is that it is broken

247
00:10:37,609 --> 00:10:42,879
down enough to really give a good result

248
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:45,679
in the first year that you use the soil

249
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:47,569
so for me it's a great for seeding into

250
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:49,939
it holds lots of water it looks a bit

251
00:10:47,569 --> 00:10:52,869
dry on the surface but underneath it is

252
00:10:49,939 --> 00:10:55,339
completely wet and then later today

253
00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:56,389
because we've already seated this I've

254
00:10:55,339 --> 00:10:58,669
seeded a whole bunch of different

255
00:10:56,389 --> 00:11:00,709
brassicas some carrots different things

256
00:10:58,669 --> 00:11:02,629
like that it's gonna rain about an inch

257
00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:05,269
and a half this is gonna germinate so

258
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:07,099
well I have this other really about

259
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:09,470
sixty seventy percent of the bed I

260
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:11,199
haven't put anything in yet so we're

261
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:13,399
gonna think about what we can do inside

262
00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:15,769
start some things indoors and then also

263
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:17,779
think about kind of what I want to do

264
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:19,849
with garlic next year maybe onions next

265
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:21,799
year even potatoes next year I'm kind of

266
00:11:19,849 --> 00:11:25,549
debating here's our little potato

267
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:28,879
harvest by the way and it really is a

268
00:11:25,549 --> 00:11:31,599
bit little I mean it's it's deathly more

269
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:35,059
potatoes than what I started out with

270
00:11:31,599 --> 00:11:37,939
but not many of them are that big this

271
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:39,619
one's actually green right here but the

272
00:11:37,939 --> 00:11:42,109
green ones and the larger ones I'm just

273
00:11:39,619 --> 00:11:44,449
gonna replant them probably somewhere

274
00:11:42,109 --> 00:11:46,369
and grow some potatoes next year

275
00:11:44,449 --> 00:11:50,089
probably in a better location this area

276
00:11:46,369 --> 00:11:51,769
doesn't get a whole lot of light also

277
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:53,659
this is not really the biggest area I

278
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:56,389
mean I started out with probably around

279
00:11:53,659 --> 00:11:57,640
8 pounds of potatoes

280
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:59,130
I ordered 10

281
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:03,850
but I probably only used about eight and

282
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:06,850
this is a three foot but maybe I don't

283
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:08,500
know ten foot or twelve foot something

284
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:09,790
like that if it gets about twelve or

285
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,680
fourteen feet long

286
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:13,210
then you've got some areas in here

287
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,800
underneath the grapevines which really

288
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:17,110
don't get a whole lot of light I mean

289
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:20,050
the fact that I was able to get this

290
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:21,760
amount of potatoes this is definitely if

291
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:27,040
I had a guess I would say it's probably

292
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:29,380
close to 15 pounds maybe 20 pounds so we

293
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,440
maybe doubled what we originally put

294
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:35,380
into this but to be honest with you it's

295
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:38,080
probably not the best success and I have

296
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:40,810
to attribute that probably due to the

297
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:43,810
fact that this bed there's probably some

298
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:45,520
potatoes by the way still in here that

299
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:48,850
are gonna come up as volunteers next

300
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:50,470
year but I have a feeling that was

301
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:52,000
largely due to the fact that we probably

302
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:55,540
should have put down some nice compost

303
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,270
first some well draining soil nutritious

304
00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:01,210
soil yeah that's gonna hold a lot of

305
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:03,100
water and then bury the potato just just

306
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:05,710
enough you know we don't have to bury it

307
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:07,810
too deep and then throw over even more

308
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:10,380
strong than we did I think the technique

309
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:12,910
in what I did was a lot less work than

310
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:14,770
what some people do with their potatoes

311
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:16,090
I mean potatoes are so easy in general

312
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:18,270
you literally just put them in the

313
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:21,970
ground and forget about them come back

314
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:23,680
90 120 days later and you dig them up I

315
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:26,110
mean it's so so simple

316
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,330
there's no care involved at all at least

317
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:29,830
where I live I mean you may have some

318
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:32,230
pests you may have to water them where

319
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:35,020
you guys live but for me I did nothing

320
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:38,590
so for me you know a completely carefree

321
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:40,060
crop I think it was worth it but would I

322
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:42,520
do this again for the amount of space

323
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:44,320
that these took up probably not it's

324
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,690
gonna largely depend on how good these

325
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,640
potatoes are and we talked about the

326
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:50,560
German butterball and how good German

327
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:55,150
butter balls supposed to be supposed to

328
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:57,340
be better than Yukon Gold like we said

329
00:13:55,150 --> 00:14:01,180
earlier in this video when I filmed this

330
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:02,890
a couple days ago we'll see and also

331
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,630
we'll see you know when I talked about

332
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:07,420
the skin is that these are probably not

333
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:08,950
going to be the best baked potato but

334
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:10,860
they are gonna be the best for cooking

335
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:13,290
for frying them up in the pan

336
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:14,550
they're gonna be incredible you know we

337
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:16,739
could even make probably really good

338
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:19,439
ships out of them

339
00:14:16,739 --> 00:14:21,480
I really recommend guys for those of you

340
00:14:19,439 --> 00:14:22,709
don't know what Old Bay is invest in

341
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,800
some Old Bay okay

342
00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:28,379
get yourself some potatoes slice them up

343
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:32,160
real nice and thin cover them with some

344
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:33,989
old bay a little bit of olive oil put

345
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,149
them in the oven for a really short time

346
00:14:33,989 --> 00:14:38,610
you don't even have the temperature to

347
00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:40,619
hot I think maybe I don't know the exact

348
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:44,040
temperature but I'm gonna say 300 350

349
00:14:40,619 --> 00:14:45,509
something like that and then put them in

350
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,949
there for about 10 minutes see how they

351
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:49,769
come out they should start browning a

352
00:14:46,949 --> 00:14:52,350
bit you want them really crispy you

353
00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:53,939
don't want them burnt take them out you

354
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:57,059
can even sprinkle some more old bay on

355
00:14:53,939 --> 00:14:59,939
at that point oh my god they're so good

356
00:14:57,059 --> 00:15:01,519
so that's kind of it for this video guys

357
00:14:59,939 --> 00:15:04,350
the last thing I want to mention is that

358
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:06,389
we did talk about I think this covering

359
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:08,220
here and maybe a different video maybe

360
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:10,470
we did it in this potato video I'm not

361
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:12,600
sure but this is really important for

362
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:14,869
this time of the year especially for

363
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,459
what we've seated a bunch of brassicas

364
00:15:14,869 --> 00:15:19,170
not necessarily the carrots but we want

365
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:21,869
to protect these young seedlings from

366
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:23,549
insects some insects you can't really

367
00:15:21,869 --> 00:15:27,600
even see them so it's really important I

368
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:29,459
think to get this this mesh on and you

369
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,740
know whatever else that I it that it is

370
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:34,019
that I put in this bed is certainly

371
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:36,720
excuse me certainly going to be covered

372
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:39,449
with mesh I have another mesh covering

373
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,829
that I have used on another bed earlier

374
00:15:39,449 --> 00:15:42,839
in the year and we're gonna put this

375
00:15:40,829 --> 00:15:45,199
down here on this one because these

376
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:48,480
seedlings guys if I get you a nice

377
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:50,490
closer look you know here's some of the

378
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,720
Brassica seedlings right in here and

379
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:53,699
they already got some holes in them

380
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,069
they've got some damage on them some

381
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:59,339
white little marks there that is from

382
00:15:56,069 --> 00:16:03,299
the white fly so certainly on a large

383
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:05,549
variety of these you know crops that you

384
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:08,459
guys grow they're gonna have some insect

385
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:10,850
pressure largely some of them you can't

386
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:13,279
even most of them you can't even see so

387
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:15,629
you know I think it's a really good idea

388
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,160
but that is kind of the video here guys

389
00:16:15,629 --> 00:16:21,089
I hope you enjoyed this little harvest

390
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:23,939
of the potatoes yeah I mean seriously

391
00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:25,949
very easy to grow again I

392
00:16:23,939 --> 00:16:28,319
have to depend on how good they are and

393
00:16:25,949 --> 00:16:31,439
you know how much space I have next year

394
00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:33,809
I'd rather grow a lot more melons I

395
00:16:31,439 --> 00:16:35,939
think next year you know really let them

396
00:16:33,809 --> 00:16:38,179
sprawl along the ground some of the

397
00:16:35,939 --> 00:16:40,289
melons that I have over here doing

398
00:16:38,179 --> 00:16:43,379
decent but a lot of them have been

399
00:16:40,289 --> 00:16:45,779
killed off by the will and if I could

400
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:48,619
grow them on the ground and cover them

401
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:52,339
with mesh keep that cucumber beetle out

402
00:16:48,619 --> 00:16:55,379
it's gonna be a phenomenal phenomenal

403
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:57,449
crop of melons so you know growing them

404
00:16:55,379 --> 00:16:59,939
vertically I think really works but you

405
00:16:57,449 --> 00:17:03,119
have to be on top of surround and

406
00:16:59,939 --> 00:17:04,919
keeping that cucumber beetle away it

407
00:17:03,119 --> 00:17:07,519
just can get a bit tricky here unless

408
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:10,049
you're growing them in a greenhouse so

409
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:12,899
anyway guys I want to thank you all for
