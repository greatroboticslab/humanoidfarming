  "text": "today's scenario what is the relevance of organic food yeah yeah see uh whether you call it as organic there are different names to organic you know the organic biodynamic parma culture sahaja rishi natural agriculture all lot of names under various you know name categories it is being practiced but you ask me whether what is the relevance of organic why are we talking today the relevance of organic we know today that there are large scale problems with current agricultural practices they everybody knows that they simply cannot sustain that we cannot live with toxic residues both into our body out there in the rivers and oceans and the large scale input that agriculture today consumes take for example no if i have to say the relevance of organic or natural forming or more eco-friendly forming then we should know what is the problem with the current system the current system today we have is take for example energy now in order to get one calorie we are talk today talking about consuming spending 10 calories to produce one calorie of food if you take a frozen green peas they talk something like 15 calorie to deliver one calorie this is unsustainable system and you say for example this this is it's like uh burning the house to get rid of a mouse you know it just cannot sustain you cannot be spending your body we know the second law of thermodynamics that energy can neither be created nor destroyed okay but it can it can be but at the same time you can convert this one good form into another bad form that's the problem so whether the current system is sustainable is a serious serious question take for example shrimp today to produce one kg of shrimp and to export it to united states of america we have to feed 4 kg of sea fish is that the way to do it should you be you know why not eat the seafish itself why produce this exotic variety and sell it to the united states of america on foreign exchange at the cost or the capital cost of natural resources and then you see in our production system today we have large number of pesticides large number of fungicides okay and herbicide so large number of them you know in order to produce this food we have you know we have to dump large quantity of chemicals does it really help does it really today if you talk about india we are almost using 20 000 crore worth of pesticides and harvard is exported of course there people use also pesticides within the household but the system is riddled with all these toxicities take for example antibiotics why are antibiotics floating antibiotics are not supposed to be given for weight gain you know meat production they are supposed to be used for treating diseases but today we have they say you have antibiotic resistant genes even in antarctica see when you use antibiotic in the animal farming in the current system so what happens you you okay you get the residues of it the beet milk and egg and all that but then this waste goes as manure to form to grow fruits and vegetables so you have problem of antibiotic resistance going across and bacterias they are very clever they also transfer their antibiotic resistant gene horizontally across others other other microbes so you have a serious problem of anti antibiotic resistant genes emerging across the world so i would say that today organic holds water and is relevant because in organic you have to do polyculture you can't do monoculture there may be wrong kind of organic agriculture in the poly houses and all kinds of things not that you shouldn't do it in the poly house but organic is embedded in polyculture organic mean that you will have to bring back the number of a sturdy and hardy variety of seeds and breeds that have gone into the oblivion bring them back into the system they have the natural immunity some of them can grow without seed take for example a hybrid cow and a native breeds of cow and what kind of input you need for the hybrid varieties where yield alone is the criteria look at the natural you see typically they talk about the natural farming in the chicken farming in the rural countryside second farming is you use a chicken sorry the kitchen waste and feed the chicken and get the chicken back into the kitchen that's a natural farming that's a sustainable system you don't build a house a concrete house for the chicken and feed the corn and soya grown in the amazon forest so how do you do what you're conforming you know this just defeats the common sense that animal form if you take animal farming was always a part and parcel of the human farming they were complementing each other you get the grain grass goes to animals today you grow the grain for animals and the leftover oil comes to human beings so today the byproducts of animal feeding comes to human beings so this is not you know sustainable this is not very healthy today we talked about global warming today we talk about ecological damage we talk about sixth mass extinction we talk about islands of dead dead oceans in the in this in the in the ocean dead oceans is where nothing grows because too much of nitrates from the aggregate fertilizers leeching into the ocean and then algal growth and then there is no oxygen available so the fishes die the marine life you know is that great it's a threat to marine life so you have you know it's not farming is not within the four walls it's done in the open environment it is done in the open ecology and what kind of impact it has as as a sensible human beings we know that we share this world with other beings and the catalogued species on this earth are just about 10 million but they say uncatalogued could be 100 million that is why it is said that we need to preserve this world in whatever you do particularly agriculture because it is done in the open environment so that you preserve the nature so one day you will start appreciating how ignorant foods we want but ragu they say that organic food is very expensive which middle class can't afford like what do you have to say about this but you see in my opinion they always ask this question counter question what is the real cost of cheap food if you consume large quantities of sugars and fat and the refined foods that we all consume and we end up spending our money for the diabetes and sugar and and heart health today you know who says that once diabetic strikes at the age of 40 it costs you 10 lakh rupees so are you so it's very good but you do because it treats the economy and all that pharmaceutical companies grow hospitals grow and all that so what is the cost of the real food if you had to eat healthy food i know unfortunately organic today is expensive almost 30 percent more but i would say if you are cold saving water preserving ecology insect population or the microbial population if your production system has not eliminated and decimated those systems until you produce a cheap food then you ask further questions they see the typically current practices produce heap and sell cheap you know that's the kind of agriculture production system you have but what is the real cost of your food if you produce nutritious food if you prod or diverse food if you have varieties of food if it is production is slightly less then you if you pay more because you have saved water because you see for cleaning environment how much are we spending today see the government of india last year sanctioned 3000 crore to clean pesticide in river waters is that the way can we clean up the air water soil can you clean up all that we cannot clean up this is a very dynamic emerging ecosystem you cannot clean it up but you must eliminate how can you prevent so in my opinion see organic farming is a is a thought intensive science in chemical forming in my opinion you have a narrow constructor called causative you have a pest problem use a pesticide you have a soil problem you use a fertilizer you use a problem use this you are not getting slave take a sleeping tablet so this is a kind of a problem and solution called you know kind of a match but i find problem with that match so i i would say that the organic farming can definitely feed the world if you follow the nutrition per acre and you know maintain the ecology environment and all that all said and done today we produce something like 2600 million tons of food which if you calculate is more than enough to be feed seven billion people why are hung one one billion people hundred core people are hungry and malnourished why are 125 crore people are overfed and obese so it is not the production that the product we have problem with but the distribution but the diversity and all that and all said and done today you take for example government across the world they subsidize chemical forming if you put poison you are subsidized if you don't put you save the nature and give you a healthy food there is no incentive and people ask why is it more costly people don't understand the hidden cost of food production do you know there is one connection many well-known people are saying that when you subsidize wrong food you end up being obese you don't see the link apparently you don't see the link but let's say i subsidize urea and i subsidize one single variety of rice i subsidize processing i give you white rice and you eat it and you become sick so i'm saying and then i subsidize hospital care i subsidize insurance look at the economy we run our own diseases should we not think of you know how to how to be preventive in diseases how to be proactive so there is enough food and food can be take for example india which is 60 is dry land you can't use fertilizers pesticide in dry land but india has forgotten dry land and we import 60 000 crore worth of oil from south america and malaysia is a massive quantity of oil we don't grow oil seeds in this country and if we can tackle the dry landforming which is possible to do in organically you know the echo divers you know ecologically fragile regions so i see if you see what we have done is in the current economic system we exclude ecology and social cost they say what is the cost of pollination by bees the fao says about 300 billion dollar there's a cost of pollination but we don't account for it that is why you always miss the wood for trees people ask that is why it is sad that you know people we have great answers but unfortunately for wrong questions in our production you know system today so ragu now tell me how difficult is it in india to do organic farming is it easy or is very difficult right now at this situation i would say there are a lot of community knowledge when it comes to human health when it comes to agriculture when it comes to animal husbandry how do todas you know the tribes in nilgiris take care of buffalos they know better than a doctor there do they not have do don't they know how to take care of animal health they know i have a book called wild health by cindy she stole how do animals take care of their health no i'm not saying you know you don't want science and technology but you also see that something is working already something is already working you see the natural forming and you know without see if i can grow food in a complementary way typically it is like this why does a pest emerge when there is monoculture when there is water logging when i have used when soil fertility is connected to pest emergence suppose i have a beautiful manure of microbe in the soil and the good humus in the soil higher carbon content in the soil then the best emergence is very less so the deeper connection in nature see don't you have a narrow construct deeper connection in nature then you say the pest is not because the by pest itself but because you provided a conducive environment for the best to emerge and first to become more potent you use pesticides and more pesticides and they become more potent then you had to genetically modified food in order to resist the uh pest so it is typically you know it is said that it's a treadmill technology where you know you you keep moving but you don't move at all it's like a sea waves they move but they don't move away they're there but you always make to made to feel that it is progress is happening development is happening but all said and done i don't want to eat food written riddled with poisons and you know pesticides and antibiotics i want to eat a healthy food i don't want to subject myself i'm not a guinea pig i want to be healthy i want to be happy or eat natural food i want to tear diverse variety of food so that is what i think you whether you call it organic biodynamic at all i think the science ecology was never considered as a science unfortunately even evo wilson the man who popularized you know the ecological concept within the in the harvard his department was shut down where they simply did this is not science science is show me you produce something you give me a plus b is equal to c plus d do you show me something but in ecology you can't show like that there are complex connections so that is why in order to preserve ecology and you know diversity health and without all these toxic residues that come to us and that's a threat to other beings also so that is where i feel when you give any name to organic you give biodynamics any name you call it but it is high time we thought that can our food be safe see they see the current world revolves around three things insecurity uncertainty and unsafety what uh sigmund bowman will known sociologist calls as the trinity of the modern world treaty of honor is unsafety insecurity and uncertainty that's the problem and in the production system he also says that we create waste and one of the waste is human beings themselves there are waste products out of the economic system so i think we need to go back to eco technology sustainable farming less input take for example urea today in the beginning we gave one kg of urea for 25 kg of food grain today 1 kg of area urea yields only 7 kg of grain imagine 30 million tons of area urea for 250 million tons of food grain and it is you see the ratio is declining year over year i think you will land up using uh one kg of fertilizer for half kg of grain is that sustainable serious question or i must also tell you that the phosphorus for example that we make dap and phosphorous compounds to feed the agriculture the phosphorus is mind and the nature and many of the best science journals peer review journals say that at the current rate of phosphorus mining it would last about 125 years and you don't want the agriculture to continue after that what do you do if you exhaust your minds is there no other way we can grow food so the input dependent intensive input dependent uh you know technological fixes do not help us in the long run you need science you need deeper science larger science to understand all this understand the human nutrition requirement biodiversity requirement ecological requirement and you all forming today for example wes jackson a brilliant guy in the us the land institute he talks about perennial crops you need not even plow every day every year and plant and replant and transplant and all that can you have perennial agriculture without the imports i mean that's something seriously we should but of course when you when you do something when you do an agriculture without the input it doesn't help the pharmaceutical industry it doesn't help the chemical industry it doesn't help the government it doesn't help the subsidy it doesn't help anybody so raghu one last question how healthy healthy is organic food yeah see if you ask how healthy i should ask you is if you think that the little bit of pesticide and antibiotics are okay then it is not so healthy uh if you think that um you know more nutrients and phytochemicals and antioxidants are not all that important then it's no different there is no difference so you see where you should look at this see if you look if you do the comparison based on this narrow nutrition concept of carbohydrate protein fat and all that you will know you may not see much difference but if you look at the amino acids if you look at the phytonutrient profile if you look at the harm the pesticides and antibiotic residues can do to your human health you see a world of difference but you see the problem you see matt ridley who wrote this famous book called rational optimus where he says that in the high yield era we have produced large quantity of starch which is sugary which he says that there is more amylopectin and lesser formylose which means that it floods your blood quickly what you eat floats your blood quickly and you don't spend the energy it lands up being stored as fat so there is a serious problem you see the very production system you have agriculture scientists are disconnected from nutritional aspect nutritional scientists are disconnected from something else that is always a disconnected but if you see the to to see the real value you should be able to connect this way that when i give see we all have to derive 60 of starch for our energy because the blood and brain uses only starches the energy source but what kind of starch are you eating high in you know this sugary starch or complex star starch then you see the difference a cow that walks a lot and eats diversity of plant you will have better nutrition in the milk you will have higher omega-3 fatty acid than a cow that is always tied to its shed and you know just change from one shed to another shed you will see a difference in the milk milk quality so i would say that the the difference that you will have to see uh you know if you really see they say that's why you know oscar wilde's famous statement that we today the modern a knows the price of everything but the value of nothing so you will have to discriminate this way then you see the real change as i said you know that there are all large number of unknown compounds unknown compound don't take the current yardstick and judge and decide you know that's why see we have one lakh variety of rice but if you see the nutrition value of indian foods or the nutrition table of the us fda and many of the fao tables you give you get one table for rice are they all same no they are not same you have different varieties of rice different they they speak in different colors size shape yield whole lot of difference you see but nutritionally they are same how can they be same that's why you know rumi the great sufi saint said if you call me a shia sunni hindu muslim christian and putting me put me into any box that will be your coughing yeah so you must be able it's not that you know you this it's not that that the world changes but you need to develop a new eye to see this because our current scientific eye with which we see there is a flaw in it there's a fundamental flaw in it because you simply look at the protein fat and all that you don't care what kind of starch you don't care whether it is sugary you don't care whether there are phytochemicals whether antioxidant forget this is a good part of it the nutrition part of it what about the bad part of it bad part of it am i okay with antibiotic residue am i okay with pesticide residue am i okay with growth hormones in the animal farming and the agriculture farming am i okay with early flowering chemicals am i okay with artificial ripeness am i okay with all that i want my fruit to be natural and good so that i really enjoy my food you",
