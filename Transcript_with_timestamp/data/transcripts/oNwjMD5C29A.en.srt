what you need to know about foot and

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,080
mouth disease

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,799
foot and mouth disease is a very

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:18,160
contagious viral disease which affects

5
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:20,080
cows sheep goats pigs and other animals

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,320
such as wild boar

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,519
the disease causes serious production

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,119
losses even if not all animals die from

9
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,920
the virus

10
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,880
an outbreak in a country can result in a

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,719
major block to international trade

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,719
humans cannot become ill from the

13
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,800
disease but they can play an important

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,200
role in spreading it to animals through

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,559
dirty clothes vehicles and other

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,760
equipment

17
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:47,200
the signs of fmd are variable and depend

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,399
on the animals

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,960
in cattle the disease can be severe and

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,559
you may notice depression

21
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,520
high fever

22
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:59,920
not eating or difficulty eating

23
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,000
decrease in milk production

24
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,799
increased salivation

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,920
blisters followed by lesions on the

26
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,200
muzzle inside the mouth on the feet and

27

teats

28
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,799
occasionally it can cause sudden death

29
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,520
in young calves

30
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:20,320
in pigs the disease can be severe and

31
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,280
you may notice an inability to stand

32
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,280
with some animals in a sitting position

33
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,320
lesions on the feet

34
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,640
sudden death in piglets

35
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,520
in sheep and goats the disease is not

36
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,479
that evident and you may notice small

37
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:40,400

sudden death in young sheep and goats

39
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,320
fmd can be found in all fluids from

40
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,040
infected animals

41
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,280
the virus can spread very easily through

42
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,200
any of the following ways

43
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,600
the most common is through direct

44
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,119
contact between an infected animal and a

45
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,320
healthy one

46
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:02,159
contaminated materials such as hay feed

47
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:05,920
water milk urine and others

48
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,560
dirty clothing footwear or equipment

49
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:12,000
contaminated pens buildings or

contaminated animal transport vehicles

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,640
meat or other products which come from

52
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,360
diseased animals if fed to animals when

53
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,680
raw or improperly cooked

54
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,520
and in certain weather conditions it can

55
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,040
spread through the wind from a nearby

56
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,200
farm

57
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,680
contact your veterinarian or local

58
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,560
authority immediately if you suspect

59
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,959
your herd is infected with fmd

60
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,160
do not move any animals from the farm

61
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,599
and limit any movement of people to and

62
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,360
from the farm

63
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,519
a veterinarian will come and look at the

64
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,120
animals and take samples to send to the

65
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,360
laboratory

66
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,599
the laboratory will examine the samples

67
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,040
and confirm the presence or absence of

68
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,720
the virus once fmd has been confirmed

69
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,040
measures will be put in place to stop

70
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,120
the disease spreading to other farms

71
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,800
farmers whose farms or animals have been

72
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,959
in contact with the farm where the

73
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,040
disease is present will also be

74
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,640
contacted by the local authority or

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,599
that your community and country remain

78
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,319
free from the virus

79
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:20,480
by staying alert and reporting suspected

80
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:24,360
cases of fmd you can make a difference

81
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,360
thank you for your attention
