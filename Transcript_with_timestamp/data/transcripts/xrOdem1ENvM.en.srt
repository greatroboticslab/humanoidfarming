bringing to you lot of great content on

9
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,840
several other agricultural Venture well

10
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,519
in this video we want to talk about uh

11
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,880
the best breed for commercial Peak

12
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:29,039
farming what are the best breed you need

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,000
on your farm if you're going to run a

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,040
commercial Peak Farm this is a question

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,480
on the mind of several individuals and

16
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:39,399
uh because honestly I can tell you that

17
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:42,079
um if you can get it right with your

18
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:44,399
genetics with the right breed you are

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,640
50% good to go in your of course there

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,760
are other things to still pay attention

21
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:52,640
to but at least having uh the right

22
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:55,680
genetics plays a very big role in uh in

23
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,320
getting uh a good and a profitable pig

24
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,600
farm now uh first of all let me start

25
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,719
with saying that ensure that you don't

26
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,840
buy breeds that you don't know what they

27
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,080
are or what type of breeds they are make

28
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,479
sure any breed you get on your farm you

29
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,680
know exactly what they have I see that

30
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:15,520
how there lots of people just see pigs

31
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,040
and all that matters to them is just

32
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,200
that these are pigs and uh pigs are just

33
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,720
pigs and uh if pigs are pigs then we can

34
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,119
just get them I think that's the mindset

35
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,680
of of some people obviously because you

36
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,000
see that they just see p somewhere they

37
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,920
don't know their origin they don't know

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,320
their genetics and they just get them

39
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,479
that's a very poor way to start Peak

40
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,600
farming I would never advise you to

41
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,680
start your Peak farm with any breed you

42
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:43,000
don't know what they have what type of

43
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,799
breed they have don't get diminished

44
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,680
breed I've often said this on the farm

45
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,000
on sorry on this channel don't get

46
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,399
diminished breeds on your farm you are

47
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,320
starting with on the on the wrong tone

48
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:55,320
because those breeds will not convert

49
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:58,560
well for you make sure you get good

50
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:01,360
breits now this right on this video I'm

51
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,039
sure you can you can remember if you

52
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,759
have been watching this channel you can

53
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:10,000
remember uh certain uh time when we

54
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:12,000
release vide on these uh animals if I

55
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,680
want you to look at their sizes you'll

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,040
be so surprised this is less than a

57
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:21,319
month on this farm and you can see how

58
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:23,200
uh robust these guys are are so their

59
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:25,319
their conversion is so much is so

60
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,480
massive you know I've always told you

61
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:29,440
that the key to Pig farming is feeding

62
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,920
them right you need to feed your pigs

63
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,200
right these guys they they feing on the

64
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,000
what we more like the feeds that's

65
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,319
what they are on right here and I've

66
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,800
told you already that when you are

67
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,560
feeding your piglets especially your

68
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,760
piglets you want to feed them at libidum

69
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,159
and I explain to you that that means you

70
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,319
want to ensure that they always have

71
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:50,000
feet in their troughs that you can see

72
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,159
they just they keep eating and eating

73
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,120
when they want to drink water they get

74
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:55,400
to the nipple Drinker to drink water

75
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,319
they they go back there they they heat

76
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,599
as much as they need to heat this is

77
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:01,519
less than a month about less than a

78
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:04,519
month and they are so they have they've

79
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:08,000
grown so massive so to my own surprise

80
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:10,280
personally so this is the African uh

81
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,480
South African large white right here and

82
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,840
we got them from a very reputable Source

83
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,640
the woman is extremely diligent when it

84
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,280
comes to uh uh Pig farming you can if

85
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,840
you get to a farm you would love it so

86
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,680
much she did it very well she

87
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,480
constructed the pens very well and she's

88
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,440
not really growing pigs for fattening

89
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,560
she's doing them for she sells the

90
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:32,640
piglets majorly so these pigs were

91
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:36,040
gotten from the F so uh types of the

92
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,480
best breeds for you to use on for in

93
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:42,640

95
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,799
common not just in Africa in this in the

96
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:51,000

commercial pig farm the land R uh and

123
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,360
the large white I would make a video to

124
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:59,120
tell you the difference between them and

125
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:01,320
which one you should prefer on in in in

126
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,000
stocking In Stocking them to your farm

127
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,840
so the large white number one the land

128
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,840
race number two the land R also is very

129
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:10,680
prolific and has uh it also Hardy that

130
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,000
means it's as good resistant so it's uh

131
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:16,560
it's very uh advised you can get the

132
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,720
large rise on your farm now another uh

133
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,639
breed that uh you can also get is the

134
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,800
Hamshire the Hamshire breed is also a

135
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:26,600
common breed that you can get now uh I'm

136
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,319
I'm seeing more of what I'm talking

137
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:32,960
about here is for the African

138
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:36,759
because uh you need to understand that

139
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,600
these breeds are majorly uh sometimes

140
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:40,280
suitable based on location there are

141
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,880
some of them that can work in almost any

142
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,319
location but not all of them there

143
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,479
certain breits you don't want to bring

144
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:47,120
to certain climates so but I'm talking

145
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:49,039
from the African side of things and

146
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,800
these are uh that's where I'm making

147
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,039
this video from but obviously we have

148
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,039
other different types of pig breed that

149
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:58,400
some may do very well in certain other

150
00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:00,639
areas that uh may not do well in the

151
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,840
African side so so the large white the

152
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,600
land R the amsh that's uh those are

153
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,360
three breeds that I would really advise

154
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,599
you to think about if you want to get

155
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:14,720
into U Pig farming now there's a there's

156
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:17,759
one that uh I would really really advise

157
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:21,520
you should consider and that's the

158
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:23,720
tn70 the tn70 is one of the latest uh

159
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,440
Pig breed out there and when I say

160
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,440
latest I don't mean like yesterday but

161
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,000
you know it's one of the recent uh

162
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,520
modifications that occurred recently in

163
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,479
the Pak farming world and it's a cross

164
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:38,919
of both the large white and the L that's

165
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:41,199
the tn70 and uh you can imagine taking

166
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:43,919
the C of both the large white and the

167
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,680
land and see how great that breed will

168
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:50,759
be the tn70 is so massive it's so

169
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:53,599
beautiful and uh very prolific so uh I

170
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:55,240
would really advise that if you want to

171
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,400
get your hand on PE farming and you're

172
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:01,520

the large white the land R the am the t7

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:27,879
Peak Farm now I'm not sure I would

208
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:30,000
advise you to have uh to to go for the

209
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:31,479
Pure Line of the Dr bre

210
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,959
and just be breeding just a Pure Line

211
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:36,360
alone well if you want to be selling uh

212
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:40,240
to other Farmers that mean if you want

213
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:42,080
to run a breeding Farm a a more like a

214
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,360
just yeah like a breeding Farm where you

215
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,640
you you more interested in just selling

216
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,640
the piglets to other Farm well you can

217
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,360
go for the Duro line and just be wearing

218
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:54,519
the dck alone of course there is a

219
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,800
demand for the Duro B majorly the dur

220
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:59,200
bra in this side of the world because

221
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,040
the D bra are very very uh excellent

222
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,880
when it comes to um cross breeding they

223
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,079
they they put in their genetics so much

224
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,120
on other breeds that and you know one

225
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:10,079
important characteristic you need to

226
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:13,680
know about drug breed Pig breed is that

227
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:16,120
they grow fast and large you know he one

228
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,600
thing to grow large but take time but

229
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:23,040
these guys grow large and they grow fast

230
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,480
so they attain that level of largess in

231
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,360
record time so is the reason why you may

232
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,640
want to get them on your farm because

233
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,279
they will pass on trait to your

234
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:34,600
crossbreed animals so on the hybrid

235
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:37,360
animals you produce from maybe the Duro

236
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,480
and the tn70 or the large white they

237
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,959
would have that characteristic of

238
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,320
growing very fast which is what you want

239
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:42,760
if you are running a cross breing

240
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,920
program because you want to be able to

241
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:47,320
fatten those animals in record time also

242
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,880
latest 6 months you want to send them

243
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,120
out of your farm so the Duro breed is an

244
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,800
excellent um B that you should have you

245
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,040
can have on your farm but it's on the

246
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,560
high side is very expensive so if you

247
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,399
but if you don't want to use a durug bre

248
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:03,560
you can use any other um Pig you can use

249
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:06,480
a tn70 b to make your other this thing

250
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:08,680
or any other U maybe the large white b

251
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,240
or any you want to do it so it's uh

252
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:14,720
these are the uh best breeds I would

253
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,640
recommend for commercial pig farm in

254
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,200
this side of the world now there's one

255
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,360
last breed I will mention which is

256
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:24,160
Uprising and that's the patrian breed

257
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:26,839
the patrian breed is uh is also a fast

258
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:30,079
growing Pig it's uh it's more it's not

259
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:32,040
so new but it's getting the Limelight

260
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,360
newly that means it's just coming into

261
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:37,079
the Lamplight newly and not so many

262
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:40,560
farms have the pan breed but a breed

263
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:43,399
that it's getting increasingly common in

264
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,720
this side of the world so uh um very

265
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:47,440
soon I'm sure it will it will become

266
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,680
much more common and people will be able

267
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,880
to get them easily so this are this will

268
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,279
be all for the video best Peak bridge

269
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,800
for commercial purposes if you want to

270
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:59,519
start a pig farm commercial pig farm you

271
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:01,480
should look out for uh this breed I've

272
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,000
talked about to either run a pure

273
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,959
breeding line or a cross breeding line

274
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
any whichever one the program you want

275
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:10,079
to make you are free to use any of these

276
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,519
breed to do them all the breeds I

277
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,800
mentioned are very excellent when it

278
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:17,600
comes to uh reproduction they give birth

279
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,680
to a lot of piglet and they are very

280
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,839
Hardy they are resistant they have the

281
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,600
right characteristics they convert well

282
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,839
and um all these Bri I mention are the

283
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,040
pure breeds obviously I'm not talking

284
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:28,959
about a diminished breed the pure breeds

285
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,240
are the ones I'm referring to here and

286
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,920
uh would not advise you to run a dck

287
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,200
Pure Line uh because obviously you if

288
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,600
you are going to be fattening for the

289
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,839
market because if you're not going to be

290
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:43,480
selling The Offspring to the

291
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:45,600
to to the uh other Farmers you don't

292
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:50,279
want to because you may not be able to

293
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:53,760
sell at the price that the uh the matur

294
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:55,959
Duro will come out with you may not be

295
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,600
able to get buyers for that in the

296
00:11:55,959 --> 00:12:00,320
market you know I mean in the slaughter

297
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,800
house so I'm not saying everywhere in

298
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,800
the world I'm talking about this side of

299
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,639
the world because other sides of the

300
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:08,320
world the the Dr breed is more common

301
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,160
that means you can easily get the Duro

302
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,600
breed but in this side of the world is

303
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,839
not yet as common so it's still more

304
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,240
like a very expensive animal so if you

305
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:19,519
are raring the Duro bre for Market

306
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:21,959
purpose it may not pay you so much

307
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,800
because you may not be able to sustain

308
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:27,079
that uh uh the the price it to be going

309
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,519
out with but again if you desire that

310
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:30,839
it's still up to you thank you very much
