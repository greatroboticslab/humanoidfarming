00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:14,190
hello my name is Kent Mullenix I am the

3
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:16,500
director of the Institute for

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:20,130
sustainable food systems at Kwantlen

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:23,070
Polytechnic University the Institute is

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:26,119
an applied research and extension unit

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,550
at the University focused exclusively on

8
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:33,260
small-scale regenerative community

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:36,540
focused agriculture and farming systems

10
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:40,800
it's a pleasure to be here with you and

11
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:42,809
to share my experiences and thinking

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,100
about extension and the potential of

13
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:51,390
extension services to serve BC's

14
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:53,850
agriculture and food system sector as I

15
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,610
know you are aware agriculture in our

16
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:59,449
food system faces many sustainability

17
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:02,239
challenges as we move into the 21st

18
00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:06,150
century and it now and acknowledge that

19
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:08,340
sustainability is our supreme challenge

20
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:11,100
not the least of which and that

21
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:14,610
challenge is adapting to and mitigating

22
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:17,970
climate change and there's a great deal

23
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:22,740
of interest in applied research and

24
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:26,490
extension however there is a great deal

25
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:30,689
of uncertainty and and lack of clarity

26
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:33,299
around what extension is and what it can

27
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:37,970
do and that's the objective of our

28
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:40,829
webinar today we're going to discuss

29
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:44,670
agriculture extension and how it

30
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:46,799
operates and how it can serve VC's

31
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:50,780
agriculture and food systems sector

32
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:54,869
going forward so the objective of

33
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:57,299
tonight's presentation is to clarify and

34
00:01:54,869 --> 00:02:00,600
convey the power and the potential and

35
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:04,380
the necessity of agricultural extension

36
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:08,250
I hope to bring clarity to what

37
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:12,030
extension is how its configured and how

38
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:13,350
it can operate effectively who can and

39
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:18,110
should

40
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:20,670
deliver extension programming and

41
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:25,490
finally how extension can advance

42
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:28,650
climate change mitigation and adaptation

43
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:33,840
so the place to begin I think is to

44
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:37,770
discuss what extension is it is

45
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:41,780
practiced around the world and there is

46
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:47,910
no universally accepted definition of

47
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:52,460
extension its variably adapted to places

48
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:55,640
and challenges but regardless it is

49
00:02:52,460 --> 00:03:00,320
constructed around us a central

50
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:04,830
methodology a widely accepted central

51
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:08,610
construct certainly extension can focus

52
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:11,250
on many different social and economic

53
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:14,100
elements for example there can be youth

54
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:17,180
development extension economic

55
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:21,900
development extension community

56
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:26,570
extension home horticulture extension so

57
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:29,610
any dimension of social or economic

58
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:32,510
development can be the focus of

59
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:36,150
extension programming probably

60
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:40,320
agricultural extension is the oldest and

61
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:43,260
best developed extension focus and

62
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:45,660
that's what we're going to focus on in

63
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:48,660
our discussions today Agricultural

64
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:51,870
Extension so agricultural extension is

65
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:55,110
the application of new knowledge that is

66
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:58,500
derived from applied scientific research

67
00:03:55,110 --> 00:04:01,440
to agricultural practices through farmer

68
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:04,280
engagement and education programming

69
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:09,690
it's a pretty simple and straightforward

70
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:11,460
concept the purpose of agricultural

71
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:18,049
extension of any extension for that

72
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:21,270
matter is to transfer new knowledge and

73
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:24,330
facilitate its adoption by the sector in

74
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:26,000
our case agriculture in the food system

75
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:29,360
to affect change

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,180
and improvement it can focus on any

77
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:35,810
aspect of agriculture agriculture

78
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:39,050
mechanization rural sociology pest

79
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:42,680

management agricultural economics farm

81
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:50,800
business planning and and business

82
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:54,470
management to name a few

83
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:57,680
regardless of its focus Agricultural

84
00:04:54,470 --> 00:05:01,490
Extension is inextricably linked to

85
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:04,940
Applied Research leading to knowledge

86
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:08,360
creation method creation or tool

87
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:12,820
creation so the important message here

88
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:15,050
is that it's about new knowledge

89
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:17,810
transferring that knowledge to the folks

90
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:23,390
that will use it and effecting change in

91
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:26,000
the sector extension also constitutes a

92
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:29,210
very effective communication conduit

93
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,940
between researchers and farmers or those

94
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:35,240
who are going to use the new knowledge

95
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:36,740
the methods or tools it's important to

96
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:43,490
emphasize that this communication

97
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:46,070
conduit is is a two-way mechanism and is

98
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:48,800
ongoing so farmers communicating to

99
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:53,450
researchers researchers communicating to

100
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:57,100
farmers and envision a busy two-way

101
00:05:53,450 --> 00:06:00,020
street with cars going back and forth

102
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:04,340
constantly that's what the kind of

103
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:08,950
communication what extension facilitates

104
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:11,419
that kind of communication is absolutely

105
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:12,880
predicated on effective relationships

106
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:19,550
and we're going to talk more about

107
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:23,419
relationships cooperation is also key to

108
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:26,690
effective extension service delivery in

109
00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:29,240
fact I'd say it's essential there must

110
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:32,770
be cooperation between farmers and

111
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:35,930
extension professionals and researchers

112
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:38,750
and it's that cooperation that supports

113
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,980
the whole extension knowledge

114
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:44,350
mobilization

115
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:47,540
and sector change in the u.s.

116
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:49,900
cooperation is exhibited between three

117
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:52,930
levels of government the federal

118
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:55,520
government the state government and

119
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:58,430
county government or local government

120
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:02,060
and land-grant universities that are

121
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:04,760
located in each state of the United

122
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:07,670
States and we'll talk about this model a

123
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:10,370
little bit going forward but we'll leave

124
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:12,620
it there for now but suffice it to say

125
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:15,200
because of this high level of

126
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:18,250
cooperation between farmers extension

127
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:21,200
personnel and researchers and between

128
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:24,080
levels of government and land-grant

129
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,960
university colleges of Agriculture in

130
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:29,480
the u.s. Agricultural Extension is

131
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:35,890
called cooperative the Cooperative

132
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:39,950
Extension Service ultimately I think

133
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:44,570
extension functions as the fulcrum and

134
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:47,240
cement for sector advancement and change

135
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:50,810
in this partnership and this high level

136
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:53,210
of cooperation and I think this is an

137
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:55,520
important thing to note because many of

138
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:59,000
the challenges that agriculture and our

139
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:04,000
food system face today and will face

140
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:07,250
going into the 21st century to become

141
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,550
more sustainable like climate change

142
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:13,880
adaptation and mitigation are highly

143
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:16,970
complex problems that involve multiple

144
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:18,740
actors and have many moving parts and

145
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:21,980
take a great deal of effort to

146
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:25,640
effectively address and so it's

147
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:28,790
extension that can facilitate that it's

148
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:31,790
extension in my estimation that can

149
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:36,320
effectively bring all of that together

150
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:41,169
and keep it all together and and make

151
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,169
change happen more effectively so

152
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:49,120
ultimately a extension effective

153
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,530
agricultural extension is predicated on

154
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,840
relationships and I want to emphasize

155
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:57,220
this and it's not just

156
00:08:53,840 --> 00:09:00,680
casual relationship it's a very deep

157
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:03,770
functional relationship I describe it as

158
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:06,290
genuine mutually respectable very

159
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:09,730
durable and and and a roll up the

160
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:13,940
sleeves make it happen kind of

161
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:17,230
relationship and and really researchers

162
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:23,470
and farmers and extension personnel

163
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:27,530
function as a close knit team so

164
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:34,450
extension creates a team mentality

165
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:34,450
