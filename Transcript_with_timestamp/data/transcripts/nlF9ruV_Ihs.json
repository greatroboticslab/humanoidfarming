  "text": "Here is my Shirou plum tree. And after a few years of patience, it's finally bearing fruit for the first time. Shirou plums are a Japanese variety known for their sweet, juicy yellow flesh and mild flavor. They're also one of the earliest plums to ripen in the summer, usually ready around July, depending on where you live. These trees grow best in USDA zones 5 through 9. Mine's here in zone 8b and it's been thriving with full sun, good drainage, and regular watering. Shirro plum trees can grow to about 15 to 20 ft tall. However, with pruning, you can easily keep them smaller and more manageable. I'm keeping mine between 6 and 8 ft tall. I do a bit of light pruning in late winter to shape it and let more light into the canopy. I planted this tree about 3 years ago and Chirro plums usually start producing fruit in their third to fifth year after planting. This one is just starting now and it's a great reminder that sometimes you just have to wait for the good stuff. These are partially self-pollinating, but they'll produce much better with a compatible pollinator nearby. Something like a Burbank or Santa Rosa plum can really boost the yield. The fruit starts off green and gradually turns a soft yellow as it ripens. You'll know it's ready when the skin turns golden and the fruit gives slightly to the touch. They come off with a gentle twist and are best picked just before they're fully soft for the sweetest flavor. Shirro plums are great for fresh eating, but they also make amazing jams and desserts. It's really been rewarding to watch this tree grow and now finally see the results. I can't wait to try these plums and see what next year brings.",
