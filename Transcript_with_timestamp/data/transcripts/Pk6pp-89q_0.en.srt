1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:06,240
it's a tr rehab

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,720
just kind of introducing you all to my

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,880
new hobby that i have here

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,320
besides my little sports cars that i

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,920
like tinkering with i

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,160
find myself back to the gardening thing

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,400
2020

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,439
we started late on everything of course

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,960
that was due to the

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,720
covic crisis maybe june july we decided

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,000
to put something in the ground

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,640
uh started off with some tomatoes three

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,519
plants

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,719
then we went to some string beans that

15
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,520
did very well

16
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,600
we had plenty of cucumbers what i did

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,960
learn about the cucumbers is worms love

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,120
them just as much as we do

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,320
for every 10 that i picked i probably

20
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,160
was able to keep three

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,640
but this year we're better prepared for

22
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,480
that because uh the experience was uh

23
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,640
worth every bit of it

24
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,000
these were the first two beds that that

25
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,039
we did

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,399
i planted these late also everything i

27
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,879
did last year was just

28
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,920
late but a lot of people told me that

29
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,120
during winter

30
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,479
uh greens wouldn't work well my buddy

31
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,920
mike reynolds

32
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,520
told me something a little different so

33
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,280
i decided to try it

34
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,159
and this is what i have now and this is

35
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,320
january 2nd 2021

36
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,799
these have been covered up for probably

37
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,880
the last two weeks or so because we had

38
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,680
some really hard coal

39
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,479
got down to 20 degrees but look at these

40
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,759
babies

41
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:28,640
talk about proud now what i am going do

42
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,920
uh maybe let these get up to about six

43
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,000
to eight inches

44
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,960
and then i'll thin them out hopefully i

45
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,159
can get

46
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,320
uh maybe 12 in this bed here this bed

47
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,400
here was my wife's idea

48
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,759
not really what i wanted to do but you

49
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,600
know how it is when the

50
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,119
wifey says this is what she wants she

51
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,439
don't really care what you think about

52
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,840
it

53
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,360
she just wanted to do it i'm glad she

54
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,840
did that

55
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,600
because as with pretty much everything

56
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,079
that i do

57
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,159
it's a trial and error thing look at

58
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:01,680
what we have here

59
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,880
see those little babies this is a winter

60
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,119
crop

61
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,079
best thing that i'm told you can grow in

62
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,160
the wintertime

63
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,160
spinach eat them babies

64
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:18,000
but uh at last count i think i had

65
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,040
close to 60 plants i'ma thin those out

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,400
when they get

67
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,720
probably about six inches high or maybe

68
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,800
just

69
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,879
let them stay where they are it's my

70
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,720
first time ever doing this

71
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,560
i used to watch my grandfather do it

72
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,280
when we were growing up so

73
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,959
in theory i've seen it done before

74
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,800
didn't really know what he was doing

75
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,480
but um sometimes just putting your eye

76
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,760
on something and watching it and then

77
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,640
later on in life

78
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,920
it tends to come back around my broccoli

79
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,640
here

80
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,959
i just let them stay out now i did have

81
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,080
to go and pluck a few leaves off because

82
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,280
that cold did

83
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,599
a little damage to them

84
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,000
this is my first year and all of these

85
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:02,000
were grown from seeds

86
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,560
this one i don't know this must be a

87
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,040
child of another mother because i think

88
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,280
it has

89
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,280
uh there's one

90
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:18,640
there's two there's three

91
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,599
and there's four like i said i did have

92
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,840
to uh

93
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,800
take a couple of leaves off because the

94
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,640
coal

95
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,640
did a little damage to them but for the

96
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,879
most part they made it

97
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,560
i may cover these up the next time we

98
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,360
get down into the 20s

99
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,519
because i thought they could handle it

100
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,239
and this is some spearmint

101
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,239
i got a bucket of that and these two

102
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,200
here is where i grew my tomatoes last

103
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,680
year

104
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,200
this raised bed here was the last one

105
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,239
that i did

106
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,680
basically some roof tin put me a little

107
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,640
bevel on it

108
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,159
and then a little light stain beds are

109
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,200
lined with some plastic

110
00:03:54,159 --> 00:04:00,000
so the soil is actually not touching

111
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,760
the metal this is absolutely my favorite

112
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,640
this is what i want my entire garden to

113
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,360
look like

114
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,319
because when the springtime hits all of

115
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,200
this is green

116
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,519
back here but uh i want this thing to

117
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,920
look

118
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,200
really pretty i dedicate this to my wife

119
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,799
because had she not

120
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,720
going out and actually bought the

121
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,160
material i would have never started this

122
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,199
this is something that we talked about

123
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,600
for years

124
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,680
but we never got to it she went up to

125
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,360
lowe's or home depot and came back with

126
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,560
some wood and some bricks and said come

127
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,960
and do the garden

128
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,639
i just thank you for tuning in and

129
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,960
watching me as i grow

130
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,960
because uh not only am i growing plants

131
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,520
but i'm hopefully growing in spirit

132
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,040
growing in knowledge and growing healthy

133
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,759
that's what this is all about

134
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,120
give a man a fish he could feed his

135
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,040
family for a day

136
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,040
teach a man to fish he could feed his

137
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:53,840
family for a lifetime

138
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:53,840
