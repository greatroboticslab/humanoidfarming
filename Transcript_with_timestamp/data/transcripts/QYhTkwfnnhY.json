  "text": "[Music] all right i've got the seed what's the seeding rate how deep do i need to plant this there's a lot of questions around how to plant cover crop seeds so this one i do want to spend a decent amount of time on so maybe we'll just piece this up but um how do you find the seeding rate or the bushel weight on the cover crop seed that we send out hey you want me to handle that keith or well i'll handle that first part there when you get and i don't know i'll throw one out and hold it up here as dale's talking but when you get the seat analysis sheet it's going to save the seating rate right on there and and that will tell you 30 pounds an acre 40 pounds an acre and if you can't find that all you got to do is is take the number of acres that you're doing the number of pounds of seed that you have and just do the math and you'll be able to tell very quickly what your seeding rate needs to be setting the drill is going to be a little bit different deal we are working on and probably won't be this year but next year um on those analysis reports it's going to tell you what the bushel weight of your overall mix is going to be and again that's not going to tell you how to set your drill but it's going to be one factor involved in helping you get close and get started so that's what we're printing out and providing on the papers that we send you and then once you get that then you have to actually get that applied to your drill so dale go ahead and talk about several different ways that the customer can do that yeah i mean obviously there's there's no drill setting for uh you know a mixture of oats peas veg radishes uh you know there just isn't one and so a lot of people are confused well how do i set my grill well um box grills meter out seed not based on weight but on volume and the way we you know the the english system and that and american agriculture of measuring volume is in bushels so it becomes important to determine what is your bushel weight well one way of doing that um is to have one of these handy dandy little bushel weight apparatus and you know you put seed in here and then you just move this little balance and it'll tell you your your bushel weight and then you basically find something you know similar on your chart of that bushel weight and set your drill that way and another way of doing it is to mathematically calculate go ahead no how much are those i mean where do you get those i we sell them but how do people get a hold of those well i said yeah you said it we sell them so how much are they they're like 65 so they're you know they're they're a nice investment because you can use those for planting wheat or oats or peas they'll work for anything and they're really easy to use uh they're made out of plastic they're fairly tough but i mean don't run over them so you know if you have a toolbox or something on your drill we we just carry we have a big plastic toolbox bolted on the back of our drill and and that just rides back there all the time and it'll hold up for many many years if as long as you're not stepping on it or dropping it stuff like that so 65 bucks uh you just have to request it and we can send it out with the seed yeah you can also uh kind of do a mathematical calculation of about what your bushel weight is and noah can i share my screen i can kind of run through i put about six seven slides together that kind of through the process uh okay so basically i i just put an example here of an op blend and so you want to convert this to bushels so let's just say we have a mix it's 94 pounds of seed per acre 64 pounds of oats and 30 pounds of peas how do you set the drill so let's go through the procedure so we want to convert that into bushels because drills don't plant pounds they plant bushels they plant a certain volume when you set them so oats are 32 pounds of bushel so the 64 pounds of oats is two bushels the peas are 60 pounds of bushels so 30 pounds is half bushel so the is two total a half bushels and so you just set the drill to the approximate number of bushels uh two and a half bushels would be 80 pounds of oats or 150 pounds of peas two and a half times 32 is 80 for the oats two and a half times 60 is 150 obviously two completely different numbers but if you do both those settings you'll find out they're almost exactly the same drill setting even though they're dramatically different numbers because of the density the but the completely different busheling now i want to stress this does not replace calibration and so i'll go through a quick calibration procedure for a box drill and the things you need something to catch the seed in scales and of course the drill and a means of raising the drill up if you've got a pole type drill um you'll want to have some jacks a couple jacks to raise it up so that you can spin the drive wheel freely and so here's your procedure um put the seed in the drill measure the circumference of your driveway i i probably should have put a a tape measure measuring tape on there as well whatever your drive will if it's an end wheel or you know measure that driveway the distance around it then raise the drill off the ground whether it's three-point or jacks uh whatever it takes to get that drill off the ground so you can spin the drive wheel place the tarp underneath the drill in the drive wheel i like to do it a hundred times because it makes the math easier um weigh the seed that's in the tarp [Music] and then you just do the math your pounds per acre is you just plug it into this equation your pounds collected on the tarp and the area is going to be your drill width that's a 10 foot drill 30 foot drill times your tire circumference your length your width is of course the drill width and the length that you travel during that calibration is going to be your tire circumference times the number of times you spun and there's 43 560 square feet of an acre so you just convert that area that you planted to acres and that gives you your pounds break so if if anybody you know that this is going to be posted um so you can review this later if you need to yeah and i'll note too dale and i have a plan here we're going to try and get a drill calibration video made so that it'll be more in depth and we'll actually probably do that on our drill so that you'll be able to see that and dale very likely probably just sold about 50 of those little drill calibrators because if you want to want to go do all that math just by submit 65 bucks and yeah for those little deals it's really quick and simple to use yeah and and uh i i used to teach math and people say well i'll just pay somebody to do this for me in the future that's that's what you're doing right there that that's what we're doing right there so yeah um i i found that nobody has time to calibrate a drill but everybody has time to drive 400 miles to get two more bags of seed yes so it's better to calibrate than to run out and be scrambling and scraping for seed later it's on the paper and when you get your especially if you're getting a tote bag if we are shipping that and you look in the little plastic holder on the tote it's going to have your address the shipping label in there you have to look behind it to get the seed analysis sheet and that's where the pounds per acre and eventually the bushel wait for for the overall mix is going to be as well most of those bags do not have multiple plastic holders so we have to put both those pieces of paper in that one little ziploc bag holder thing on the toe
