3
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,519
this particular lecture is going to be

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,199
about subsistence strategies and now

5
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,560
while this is a part of the economic

6
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,960
system we're talking about it separately

7
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,760
because because it conditions virtually

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,079
every other social institution it's

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,160
incredibly influential hopefully by the

10
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,879
end of this lecture you'll understand

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,360
why and particularly by the end of the

12
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:44,360
quarter that will be totally clear to

13
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,600
you there are four types of subsistance

14
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,840
strategies there's foraging pastoralism

15
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,120
horiculture and intensive agriculture

16
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,760
we're going to break them down and look

17
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:57,239
at them one by one fore is basically

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,039
Hunting Fishing and Gathering so 85% of

19
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:01,719
the food for foragers comes from

20
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,199
resources that are available in nature

21
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:06,840
for 90% of human history people were

22
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,159
foragers today we only have about a quar

23
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,159
of a million

24
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,920
people forgers make their own tools now

25
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,960
in anthropology we kind of refer to this

26
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,920
as simple technology that's not a

27
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,520
qualitative statement we're not trying

28
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,680
to say that making your tools by hand is

29
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,439
a bad thing it's just that there's not

30
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,439
complex Machinery with all these various

31
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,200
parts and so forth that you have to use

32
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,960
to actually make the

33
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,320
tools the reason for production is that

34
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,600
we're going to share the

35
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:38,040
resources in addition to using them for

36
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:41,040
ourselves so it's a very communal

37
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,880
mindset groups are egalitarian and what

38
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,119
we mean by this in anthropology is not

39
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,680
that everybody's totally equal when we

40
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,680
do see any kind of status as a ranking

41
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,600
in egalitarian societies it's usually

42
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,560
based on age but egalitarian in an

43
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:58,759
anthropological sense means that each

44
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:01,399
individual has access to resources that

45
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:02,960
they need to survive and additionally

46
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:05,280
everybody's going to have the skills

47
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,920
that they need to

48
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,959
survive we see relatively small

49
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:14,599
communities and that's so they

50
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:17,440
don't take away or reduce all of the

51
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:19,720
resources in a particular area Hunter

52
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,879
hunters and gatherers foragers are

53
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,800
highly mobile you will occasionally see

54
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,640
foraging societies that are relatively

55
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,519
sedentary or they stay in one place for

56
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,560
long periods of time but the resources

57
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:33,519
have to be incredibly rich for them to

58
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,400
stay in one place for a long period of

59
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:40,680
time we see high infant mortality and

60
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:43,400
again this is because of the mobility

61
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,920
Factor we have overlapping gender roles

62
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,959
and what we mean here is that the

63
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,640
division of labor often falls out by

64
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,800
gender but again everybody has those

65
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,200
skills they need to survive so if we

66
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,920
have a group where men are predominantly

67
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:59,959
the hunters women can also hunt if need

68
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:02,280
be men can gather women can gather

69
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:04,159
everybody can make tools everybody can

70
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,720
make the appropriate clothing for their

71
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,400
culture and the appropriate shelters so

72
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,000
again it gets back to that equalitarian

73
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,720
nature where everybody has the skills

74
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,720
that they need to

75
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,720
survive high degree of

76
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,599
sustainability hunters and gatherers or

77
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,200
again foragers could really go on for

78
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,920
very very long periods of time if

79
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,840
they're left alone unfortunately what's

80
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,799
happening in the modern world world is

81
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,599
that they're being relegated to Marginal

82
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:34,360
areas so it's much much harder for them

83
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,200
to survive so high but it is a high

84
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,000
degree of

85
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,720
sustainability we're going to use the

86
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,760
Kung as an

87
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,040
example and the Kung live in the

88
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:49,519
Kalahari Desert they don't have a big

89
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:52,480
migratory territory um vegetation is

90
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,879
scattered um but they do move around to

91
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,360
wherever they can find resources they

92
00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:00,000
use about a 100 species of animals with

93
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,760
50 of which they eat and they use over

94
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,439
150 species of plants where they eat

95
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,319
over a 100 now if we look at the

96
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:09,000
Kalahari Desert we just don't see a lot

97
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:11,879
of plants but the Kung who live in it on

98
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,680
a daily basis can really differentiate

99
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:16,320
between different kinds of

100
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,680
plants their favorite food is the m

101
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,880
mongongo nut and it's very high in

102
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,199
protein so in the times when they can't

103
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,840
get a lot of meat that particular nut

104
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,960
really serves them well the Kung eat

105
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,680
their way out of areas so what we're

106
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,680
talking about here that they eat all of

107
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,560
the food they like first then they eat

108
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,600
their less desirable food and once

109
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,080
that's done then they leave so that the

110
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,960
resources have time to

111
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:44,320
regenerate so they're mobile when

112
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:47,639
resources get low or sometimes they move

113
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:50,560
seasonally so in dry season we see large

114
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:53,120
camps of 20 to 40 people and they gather

115
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,199
around permanent water sources so makes

116
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,840
sense in the dry season in the rainy

117
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,560
season we see much smaller camps maybe

118
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,840
two to three families and they're

119
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,440
scattered all over the landscape more

120
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,280
resources around so they don't need to

121
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,199
be bunched up

122
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,639
together again High degree of mobility

123
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:12,080
in foraging societies we see a low

124
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,400
number of possessions because if you're

125
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,520
Mo on the move a lot you don't want to

126
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:18,160
haul a bunch of stuff around and again

127
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,720
limited population growth division of

128
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,199
labor in the Kong everybody gathers

129
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,560
everybody hunts food is shared with all

130
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,240
of the members of the group if there are

131
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:31,400
any possessions those are shared among

132
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,039
the group and there's very very little

133
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:36,039
inequality the Kong reckon their kin

134
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:38,400
relations on both sides which in

135
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:40,400
anthropology we refer to as a bilateral

136
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,880
system and when we get to family

137
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,280
marriage and kinship we're going to go

138
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,080
into that in more detail um one of the

139
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,639
things about the Kung they do have

140
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,720
contact with the quote modern world

141
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,400
unquote so they're very quick to

142
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,680
incorporate new technology and most of

143
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,759
their contact with the more modern world

144
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,520
comes with contact with agriculturalist

145
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:07,000
um governmental officials and also

146
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,000
Traders so that's basically a foraging

147
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:17,039
Society
