1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,199
well i hope you can hear me over this

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,640
wind because the wind doesn't stop here

3
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,640
on the prairies

4
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,919
and uh here i am standing in the middle

5
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,440
of an iconic

6
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:14,639
prairie field a wheat field

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,880
except this isn't a wheat field and i

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:20,080
wouldn't have known that last week

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,640
this is a barley field

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,080
and you can tell because barley flops

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,480
over and has this

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,880
these strands called a beard whereas

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,720
wheat stands straight up

14
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,320
and i couldn't tell the difference until

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,000
i got here and

16
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,520
got a little bit of a reminder of how to

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,480
recognize okay that's a barley field

18
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,360
this is a wheat field

19
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,040
they are not identical so prairie

20
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,559
agriculture is

21
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,239
a completely different type of

22
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,800
agriculture than the gardens that i left

23
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,000
behind

24
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,160
in bc we don't have fields

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,120
like this in bc we don't have field

26
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,600
crops

27
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,480
this is just a complete field there's no

28
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,239
rows

29
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,239
and it's acres and acres of the same

30
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,719
thing seeded we didn't see that in bc

31
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,440
in bc it's vegetables and they're grown

32
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,600
in rows

33
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,080
and it's irrigated that's not the way

34
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,200
that things work here on the prairies

35
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,439
what's good on the prairies they have

36
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,600
lots of land it's cold

37
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,720
it's not very wet none of these things

38
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,799
are good for vegetables

39
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,240
so what they grow in the prairies is

40
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,119
fields like this

41
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,479
grasses that produce seeds or legumes

42
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,799
these are some of the most

43
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,600
energy and protein-rich plants you can

44
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,720
grow

45
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,040
and they're not the kind of thing that

46
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,040
you grow in a garden they're field crops

47
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,920
i think the biggest difference that i've

48
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,000
noticed so far between

49
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,920
this kind of farming and the kind of

50
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,159
farming that i left behind nbc

51
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,840
is just how important machines are on

52
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,240
this farm

53
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,960
you know i remember making a comment

54
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,000
back in

55
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,960
i don't know may about how

56
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,079
so little of what we did at amara farm

57
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,759
was mechanized

58
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,159
we were doing so much we were healing

59
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,399
potatoes by hand we were weeding by hand

60
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,320
we were doing almost all of it by hand

61
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,640
here it's almost the complete opposite

62
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,399
here almost nothing is done by hand it's

63
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,079
all about machines

64
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,080
and so i've discovered that nathan who's

65
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,599
the farmer here for him

66
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,680
being a mechanic is not just a useful

67
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,120
skill it's an essential skill you cannot

68
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,200
be a farmer without knowing about

69
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,200
machines

70
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,959
and in fact that might be his major

71
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,640
skill set is that he's a mechanic he

72
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,160
takes care of all these machines that he

73
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,840
uses to farm

74
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,239
and that's a really different approach

75
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,400
he's not spending all of his time

76
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,720
on his knees planting things weeding

77
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,319
things harvesting things

78
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,560
all of those things here are done with

79
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,239
machines so i wanted to give you a tour

80
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,599
of some of the machinery that

81
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,040
nathan keeps around on the farm because

82
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,120
he's literally got a different machine

83
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,879
for every single possible task he's got

84
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,200
on the farm

85
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,120
so this is a swather and its role is to

86
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,480
cut the crop off the ground and pile it

87
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,120
into neat little rows where it can be

88
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,160
dried

89
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:55,200
and picked up by the combine the combine

90
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,720
combine harvester picks the crop off off

91
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,680
the ground

92
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,519
threshes it separates it spits out grain

93
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,000
at one end and all the chaff and the

94
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,760
straw at the other

95
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,519
this is a dump truck yes a dump truck is

96
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,519
an agricultural tool because

97
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,800
on a field of this size it's the only

98
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,440
way you're getting the crop off the

99
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,640
field

100
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,599
and then how do you get it out of the

101
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,120
dump truck well this is an aqua

102
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,280
the dump truck dumps the grain into the

103
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,040
auger the auger transports it up and

104
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,400
pours it into those storage bins which

105
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:27,200
are i don't know 25 feet high we just

106
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,879
didn't have things like this in bc we

107
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,239
were carrying crops off the

108
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,200
field in rubbermaid bins that doesn't

109
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,360
happen here

110
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,879
anyway trying to film all these machines

111
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,760
presents some pretty

112
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,519
serious challenges to try and film them

113
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,560
and i'm scrambling to keep up cause i'm

114
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,360
on foot and they're

115
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,159
driving around in these big machines so

116
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,920
this is

117
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,360
what's left of my microphone for me

118
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,720
after i dropped in the field

119
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,599
and it went through the combine

120
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,480
harvester and uh honestly i'm kind of

121
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,159
surprised that i

122
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,680
found a piece this large i just figured

123
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,560
it would have been turned into little

124
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,280
pea-sized dust but i guess it got

125
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,239
treated as chaff

126
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,080
anyway those are my adventures this week

127
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,519
it's a very different experience from

128
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,680
the garden

129
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,280
i've only scratched the surface here you

130
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,360
can subscribe to the youtube channel to

131
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,639
keep watching every week

132
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,160
if you want to know more about what i'm

133
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,759
filming that's a documentary called the

134
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,400
hands that feed us and you can subscribe

135
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,840
to that at the hands that fetus.ca

136
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:28,000
or you can follow me on facebook and

137
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,000
