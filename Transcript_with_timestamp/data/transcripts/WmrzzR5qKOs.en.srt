1
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:31,390
first of all let's get the matter of
introductions out of the way if you

2
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:38,290
don't Bob garstin Charlie Thomas here
goes this is Bob Bart

3
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:42,430
if you see them again this winter you
won't be wearing a hat stand either

4
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:47,050
and here's cha Thomas whose constant
attention to growing and processing seed

5
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:52,960
corn is your crop insurance for next
year the result of this partnership is

6
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,800
an institution dedicated to the
production of superior seed corn the

7
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,850
largest and most modern plant in
existence more than a hundred thousand

8
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:05,740
bushels of pioneer hybrid seed were
dried sorted graded and back here this

9
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:11,470
year the warehouse 300 feet long and
with a capacity of more than 40,000

10
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:19,540
bushels was recently built to
accommodate the increasing volume when I

11
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:25,000
met you a moment ago I knew you were
here to find out the house why of hybrid

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,450
car and how and why issues will put more
money in your pocket but before we see

13
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:36,640
what has been done with hybrid corn
let's take a look at a field of open

14
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,319
pollinated corn
I think you'll recognize maybe we can

15
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:48,240
refresh your memory about the false and
the flaws of open pollinated torn

16
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:57,930
anywhere in the Corn Belt fields of open
pollinated corn greet the eye this one

17
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:05,150
isn't a bad feel in fact it's pretty
good but it won't bear close inspection

18
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:09,360
garstin Thomas have thousands of
visitors every fall to insist upon

19
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,350
seeing the difference between open
pollinated corns and pioneer hi-bred

20
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:20,010
corn no worse than the average field yet
there's a decided lack of stiffness here

21
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:24,900
which is notably present in the hybrid
field your to visit later you will

22
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,940
observe a general lack of stiffness and
style looks like the cows have been in

23
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,330
the corn

24
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:41,510
there's an appearance of sagginess due
mostly to fall in stocks stocks that

25
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:46,970
break before the ears mature cause
chappy and rotten ears not sound corn

26
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:51,430
and not conducive to large yields

27
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:00,989
the stocks upon which these ears were
produced went down early with resultant

28
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:05,549
rottenness of the ear limber stocks are
easily blown down that are difficult to

29
00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:11,129
pick either by hand or by machine
when the wind is accompanied by rain the

30
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:16,519
fallen stock attempts to come up again
and in so doing forms a gooseneck

31
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:21,959
another reason for stocks falling is a
poor weak root system a typical fault of

32
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:27,359
open pollinated corn later you will
contrast this root with the heavy

33
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:35,310
pioneer hi-bred root the lack of
uniformity in plaintive ears of open

34
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:40,379
pollinated form slows down picking
materially for this reason corn picking

35
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:45,329
contests are practically always held in
high bred fields where the contestants

36
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:50,819
show to the greatest advantage the
uneven position of ears seen here does

37
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:57,120
not permit rapid or efficient Huskie
another fault of open pollinated corn is

38
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,810
the fact that the ears themselves drop
off so easily on windy days

39
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:09,180
a mechanical corn picker can't pick up
these ears a human corn pickers doesn't

40
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,720
like to

41
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:17,910
after the corn picker has been through
the open-pollinated field the job of

42
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:23,490
picking up volunteers yet remains this
extra task is wholly unnecessary in the

43
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:30,060
pioneer hi-bred fields which you'll soon
see 10% of the corn was left on the

44
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,590
ground too much to leave but a lot of
work to get and here's what you finally

45
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:41,039
do get on you know form size shape and
quality reason for the lack of

46
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:46,770
uniformity and figure in the field that
we've just looked at is that you don't

47
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:53,280
know which pollen grains pollinated each
separate pound in other words you don't

48
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:59,130
know who the daddy was no one would be
so foolish as to try to improve

49
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:04,080
livestock without selecting the finest
sire the we didn't you get a

50
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:10,500
prize-winning bull or a good boar is
because some breeder has selected his

51
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,910
grandparents with the greatest of care
now let's take a look at a field of

52
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:21,479
Pioneer hybrid corn where we do know the
father from the grandfather in fact we

53
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:30,000
know all of the ancestry for ten
generations back the cloud gets larger

54
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:39,419
you know what they say about building a
better mousetrap this is daily routine

55
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:43,620
during harvest time at the garstin
Thomas plant in Coon Rapids where

56
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:49,530
visitors are welcome seeing is believing
here's an example of what plan Deere

57
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,210
hybrid seed corn will do for you

58
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,839
there's an ear on every stock the ears
are at a uniform height and the stops

59
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:04,829
are standing up stiff straight and
strong and the ears will bear plenty of

60
00:06:04,829 --> 00:06:12,629
inspection to again the uniformity of
height is extremely noticeable product

61
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:17,669
of two adjacent hills three emphasizes
the uniformity of the ears for size type

62
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:23,939
and quality they're a noonday meal for
any horse pioneer produces corn of real

63
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:29,639
quality it's good feed and it markets at
top prices what all of you who've

64
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:35,459
marveled at 100 bushels per acre yields
you're now seeing 110 bushels to the

65
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:39,299
acre what do you think of this
neighborhood of healthy ears called the

66
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:45,569
gold coast by one visitor 110 bushels to
the acre means eighty eight hundred

67
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:50,909
pounds of ear corn it takes sturdy stops
to hold up this kind of a crop how

68
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:55,979
beautifully they stand we can even see
angle wise or crosswise through the corn

69
00:06:55,979 --> 00:07:01,639
field take a look down that aisle a
pathway to prosperity

70
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:07,130
and what's more the ears don't fall off
when the wind blows

71
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:11,930
remember how easily they fill in the
other fields smoke that one in your pipe

72
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:20,210
mr. corn can't stand up without a root
system either go ahead pull it out it

73
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:24,820
can be done but it takes plenty of help

74
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:30,850
these roots go down where the plants
grooving Morse your arms

75
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:35,600
they oughta produce coins they've had
plenty of opportunity to absorb a lot of

76
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:42,470
nourishment from the soil and they did
produce a lot of corn roots tell a lot

77
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:46,670
of the story of pioneer hi-bred corn
which one of these two roots do you

78
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:49,730
think has the best chance to get down
where the moisture in plant food are

79
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:57,260
which one will hold the stock the
straightest a pioneer hi-bred root is

80
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:04,940
four times as large the mechanical
quantico also gets a real chance to do a

81
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:12,080
good job in hybrid corn sooner or later
all farmers will be using the corn

82
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,390
thicker the heavy root system sturdy
straight stops and strong shanks of

83
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:23,690
Pioneer hybrids are well adapted to
mechanical for kicking this is corn

84
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:29,180
raising reduced to a science in a few
minutes that wagon will be back full of

85
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:33,970
corn from four rows seventy rods long

86
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,830
when picking corn by hands or
mechanically how convenient it is to

87
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:46,840
find the ear at a uniform height on
every stop there aren't two inches

88
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:53,650
difference in the height of ears just to
show that these individual hills aren't

89
00:08:53,650 --> 00:09:00,730
unusual for this pioneer field
let's pick three consecutive hills how

90
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:06,410
uniform they are in height found nicely
they break out

91
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:16,230
and what fun to pick these golden ears
and man what a profit three adjacent

92
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:22,350
Hills nine big fine quality ears harder
to hold them to husk over here the

93
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:28,040
convict has already made one round 70
rods long and here's the tape

94
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:33,750
hold on there old boy over then we can't
blame you at that they'd never believe

95
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:39,750
you're back home if you didn't have some
corn to back it up and over in the

96
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:43,200
corner of the field the loaded wagons
are done the coin elevated on the

97
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:49,260
waiting trucks and headed for the
processing plant in one day three men

98
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:54,390
with a corn picker have picked two
thousand bushels from 19 acres of land

99
00:09:54,390 --> 00:10:01,760
and loaded it onto the trucks again we
repeat barn-raising reduced to a science

100
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,000
and so to town it goes while we spring
along behind

101
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,810
let's glance at the field that was
picked with the sturdy straight pollen

102
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:15,900
rows left standing the corn from these
pollen rows is never used for seed but

103
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:19,490
is later picked and fed

104
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,810
you
