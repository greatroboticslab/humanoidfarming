2
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,280
the migration phenomenon is quite

3
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,960
huge here in kenya there are many people

4
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,680
moving from the rural areas

5
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,160
to the urban areas and a lot of these

6
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,800
people

7
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,879
are young and why are they moving

8
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,120
they're looking for better employment

9
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,000
and education opportunities but we

10
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,239
forget that

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,600
as more people move from the rural areas

12
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,640
we are putting more pressure in the

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,559
urban areas

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,800
so that's why we see that there's a lot

15
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,280
of informal settlements that are coming

16
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,320
up

17
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,120
but also we have a rather large informal

18
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,039
economy

19
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,640
meaning that they're not going to access

20
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,439
the decent jobs

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,880
so they access more precarious jobs and

22
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:07,920
that's why we're saying that through

23
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,080
this project

24
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,600
we are trying to address the advanced

25
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,840
drivers of migration

26
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,880
through local value chain development

27
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,759
that means

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,040
how can we provide better and more

29
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,720
improved

30
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,640
employment opportunities and

31
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,759
entrepreneurship opportunities in the

32
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,840
rural areas

33
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,840
through agribusiness

34
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,920
cambodia is a hot band for migration

35
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,799
because first of all the proximity to

36
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,720
nairobi

37
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,000
that is the capital city where people

38
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,400
perceive that there are

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,680
many job opportunities here but then we

40
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,439
also have to encourage them to stay

41
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,280
within the rural areas because

42
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,960
kenya means farmers are there at the end

43
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,799
of the day the the

44
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,479
the farmers that we have are a quiet

45
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,560
engine and we need a future bunch

46
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:55,360
that can be able to carry on the angry

47
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:57,280
culture to fill this nation

48
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,960
the youth believe that maybe farming is

49
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,560
not for them this is what they have

50
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,399
seen their parents doing from thai

51
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,399
memorial and they want to do something

52
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,399
different

53
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,000
agriculture has been linked to poverty

54
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,800
and business for the

55
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,720
people who have not gone to school but

56
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,599
then we see that our youth are quite

57
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,440
educated

58
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,879
and they want the the what they call

59
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,560
them decent jobs

60
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,760
because to them farming is not a job so

61
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,879
they are going to the capital to look

62
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,560
for employment

63
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,959
so what we're doing in this project is

64
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,640
we're trying to to help the youth they

65
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,160
play their role in the angry business so

66
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,440
that we can create opportunities for

67
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,200
them

68
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,480
first of all is to train the men to

69
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,239
empower them say

70
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,400
that in angry culture so there is that

71
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,200
then business they can still make a lot

72
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,959
of money

73
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,239
through the the angry business they

74
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,760
don't have to go to towns

75
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,480
to look for jobs that are not there in

76
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,480
the first place

77
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,239
what we've seen is that agriculture was

78
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,879
considered not

79
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,560
cool or fashionable that is what the

80
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,080
mindset has always been but we are

81
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,720
seeing a new crop

82
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,200
of youth who are taking up agriculture

83
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,200
those who have known what the secret is

84
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,720
many of them who are graduates who have

85
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,560
gone to schools gotten their

86
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,840
their degrees and having seen the

87
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,200
benefits that have come

88
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,239
out of it and not only agriculture but

89
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,640
we're talking about

90
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,519
agri-business bringing in the business

91
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,840
perspective

92
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,840
into agriculture

93
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:25,360
[Music]

94
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:28,080
these are the mothers these are my seeds

95
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,319
first of all going to breed them

96
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,840
it's four months old now you're doing

97
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,560
well

98
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,360
at the end if i have a hundred plus

99
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,570
others

100
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,080
then i start marketing them

101
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:42,239
[Music]

102
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,519
one of the beneficiaries we support is

103
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,959
youth a

104
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:50,239
unique young lady who studied

105
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:53,040
for a job in the hotel industry but

106
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,239
following three years in the industry

107
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,560
she decided to

108
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,640
resign from her job and get into

109
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,200
agribusiness

110
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,400
she is currently undertaking a poultry

111
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,120
project

112
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,840
which she got support from the fao and

113
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,959
county

114
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,319
government and this is a lady who is

115
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,760
quite ambitious

116
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:16,720
she sees herself as the next millionaire

117
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,840
having a whole range of chicken and been

118
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,479
able to supply

119
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,680
the major hotels and supermarkets in

120
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:23,919
kenya

121
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,840
so for me that is a story that has stood

122
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,919
out a young person

123
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,919
who could easily have worked in a white

124
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:32,639
collar job but has opted

125
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,840
or her choice of work or business is in

126
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,240
the agriculture

127
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,240
sector

128
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,479
there's no need of going to other

129
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,400
countries you have seen some youth going

130
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,199
to even to dubai catch out to look for

131
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,240
jobs

132
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,720
then they come back frustrated at the

133
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,639
end

134
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,479
they're like oh i wish i stayed in my

135
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,960
country this is our home

136
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,919
god drops kenya we can do it the market

137
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,080
is with us

138
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,759
wake up and go for it whatever is in

139
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,120
your mind you perceive it and

140
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,120
later on you receive it

141
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,479
plural to urban migration is very common

142
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,280
especially

143
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,520
with the youth that is because of lack

144
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,880
of

145
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,479
employment but right now i have come to

146
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,840
london agriculture

147
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:18,639
has the potential to create many jobs

148
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,039
because currently in africa we still

149
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,240
have

150
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:24,639
an opportunity to come up with business

151
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,440
agree businesses

152
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:30,160
which can sustain our economy and

153
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,160
improve our life

154
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,080
as a county we have been trying to make

155
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,360
angry business cool so that we can

156
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,720
attract more youth

157
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,880
and one of the things that we are doing

158
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,479
is to introduce technology

159
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,160
and when we bring technologies within

160
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,160
the sector like the

161
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,160
the mechanization part like the value

162
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,759
addition then they are now interested

163
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,280
then they can be able to come in

164
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,800
and again now we are also trying to

165
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,000
change the mindset that they don't have

166
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,520
to be farmers

167
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,360
they couldn't be transporters they can

168
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,440
get into the value addition

169
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:01,120
they can be the marketers they can be

170
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,120
there the input suppliers

171
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,240
now we see a change a change of

172
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,680
perception

173
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,600
and we see now the youth the young

174
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,000
people are they are really proud to be

175
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,639
farmers yeah especially now that they

176
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,840
realize

177
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,840
in cambo county there's so much

178
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,680
opportunities for us being close to

179
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,960
nairobi there's a lot of market

180
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,039
and there are opportunities that are

181
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,280
coming in now the youth are

182
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:24,720
more outgoing they are now going back to

183
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,720
the farm to make the money

184
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,319
the girl the purpose you know that's why

185
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,199
you find me having this

186
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,360
feeding them like my babies you know you

187
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,680
must laugh whatever you're doing

188
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,600
once you change the mindset and and you

189
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,560
know you love whatever you're doing

190
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,560
you achieve a lot

191
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,720
having visited our youth over the past

192
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,840
few days

193
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,599
i would say we have changed a lot

194
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,680
a few years back even when we were

195
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:58,720
starting this project in itself

196
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,639
many of them were quite skeptical

197
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,880
but having gone through the trainings

198
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,720
having been supported to

199
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,000
to have linkages with the market and

200
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,199
even to access

201
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,840
finance we're seeing them open up their

202
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,520
eyes

203
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,880
and their minds to the opportunities

204
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,840
that are out there

205
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,800
but one thing that we have really seen

206
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,880
stand out

207
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,479
for us is that many of these youth are

208
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,400
people who've gone to school

209
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,520
who could easily have gone to look for a

210
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,400
white collar job

211
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,880
and many who have wanted to migrate to

212
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,280
the urban areas and also internationally

213
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,120
to look for some of this employment and

214
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,160
education opportunities

215
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,960
but many of them have chosen to stay

216
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,440
back home

217
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,639
in the rural economy and see how they

218
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,879
can build their agri businesses

219
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,240
and the key message that i pass out to

220
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,919
youth when we are out there

221
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,919
is that it does not only have to be

222
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,280
production there are very many

223
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,879
opportunities that are in the

224
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,400
agriculture sector and in

225
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:58,319
agribusiness because

226
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,639
the future is there as we're the future

227
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,680
leaders we're the zero hunger generation

228
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:06,240
and of course we have our population

229
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,879
gradually increasing over the next few

230
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,280
years

231
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,039
with the food demands also growing

232
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,680
therefore it is important that

233
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,639
youth are brought on board and engaged

234
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,280
in the sector

235
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:24,840
to be able to produce for future

236
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:27,840
[Music]

237
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,840
