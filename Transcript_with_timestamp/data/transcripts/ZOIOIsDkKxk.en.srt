1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,460
in 2013 the USDA Natural Resources

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,990
Conservation Service entered into a

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,300
cooperative agreement with the South

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,910
Dakota no-till Association and I grow

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,769
SDSU Extension for delivering the latest

6
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,260
soil health and productivity technology

7
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,420
to South Dakota farmers and ranchers a

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:21,080
series of two local events were held in

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:24,810
South Dakota in lemon and Fort Pierre

10
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:26,970
ok thanks Ruth when I pass these out I

11
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,500
have a handout if you already have it

12
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,300
don't worry about it but I want to make

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,679
sure everyone has that because I'm going

14
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,860
to refer to it a little bit in my

15
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,090
presentation now I'm going to be talking

16
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,649
about cover crops oh yeah I remember

17
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,790
that cover crops are just going to be

18
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:44,000
one component of that soil health system

19
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:49,050
do we talked about crop rotation

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,239
diversity no-till we have cover crops in

21
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,559
there as one component nutrient

22
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,570
management and integrated pest

23
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,170
management are the other two components

24
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:01,410
are that five component cropping system

25
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:04,110
designed for soil health we talked a

26
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:06,210
little bit about the Saline areas okay I

27
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,970
do have some soil test results from a

28
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:12,390
saline area right in that Lantry area

29
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:15,119
right around Ridge view east of RIT are

30
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:17,909
west of Eagle Butte zone ten is going to

31
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,979
be a very high saline area it's going to

32
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:23,430
be weight on the surface look how much

33
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:25,409
nitrogen is in the top two feet 1342

34
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,869
pounds I think that's enough to last for

35
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:29,430
a while I was kind of surprised with the

36
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:33,360
phosphorous they're not quite as high as

37
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:36,600
I thought it's 37 per per million down

38
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,689
below down here sodium 50 400 parts per

39
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:42,060
million sodium so yeah there's a lot of

40
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:43,189
a lot of different things in and those

41
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,619
those

42
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:51,210
saline areas sulfur maxed out on the

43
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:52,619
scale 120 and in 360 okay how you

44
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,530
mentioned before I mean just be talking

45
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:58,259
about one small component of the soil

46
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,450
health management system and just to

47
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:01,920
give you a quick definition of cover

48
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:05,130
crops to make sure we're all on the same

49
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,689
page any crop does plan between periods

50
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,030
of regular crop production to prevent

51
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:11,310
soil erosion provide organic matter

52
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,800
provide nitrogen the list goes on and on

53
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:16,200
and on and on and we'll cover more

54
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,210
here in a little bit but it's mainly

55
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,130
looking at that for you guys is going to

56
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:23,360
be looking at that intercrop period

57
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:25,950
where where it's gonna be wheat

58
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,410
harvested and then prior to the corn

59
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:31,050
planting time for the most part or oat

60
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:33,360
piece taken off for hay and then prior

61
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:35,160
to the following year's cash crop if

62
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,380
you're at all interested in cover crops

63
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,720
you need to go to this website either

64
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:42,840
order this book it's like 25 bucks or

65
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:46,080
you can download it in a PDF format it

66
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:48,320
is very valuable and it discusses a lot

67
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,360
of these species in great detail that

68
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:53,730
I'm going to be talking about throughout

69
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,680
the this presentation another

70
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:58,410
publication is overview of cover crops

71
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:03,030
and green manures you can access that at

72
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:04,740
this website there anywhere I give this

73
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,900
presentation of something similar we

74
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:09,900
talked about rainfall while you guys say

75
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,210
I'm way to go to plant cover crops and

76
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,610
we look at different periods throughout

77
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:17,370
the year as far as your your rainfall

78
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:19,680
goal is to determine that and I was kind

79
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:22,830
of shocked I mean again growing up just

80
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,890
south of Morristown I was shocked lemons

81
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:27,959
30 year average from 1971 to 2000 is a

82
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:32,010
little bit over 18 inches that shocked

83
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:34,680
me I I'm used to 1516 and if you look at

84
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:37,980
Macintoshes 30 year period it is an

85
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,690
exactly an inch eighty less than lemon

86
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,700
but eighteen point two four inches so

87
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:44,190
let's look at a couple of these inter

88
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:46,500
crop periods where the cover crops may

89
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:49,739
fit in and look at that rainfall period

90
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:52,680
or amount of moisture that is a received

91
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:54,600
in that period so when spring wheat

92
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,120
would stop using an appreciable amount

93
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,370
of water around August first again I

94
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,230
realize that could they could shift

95
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:04,350
anywhere from two weeks depending on the

96
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:07,050
year to win corn would start using an

97
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:09,000
appreciable amount of water twelve point

98
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:11,880
four inches or twelve point twelve and a

99
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,459
half inches of precip August 1st to July

100
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:16,650
1st for for spring wheat to sunflower a

101
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:21,269
little bit over 15 and a half

102
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:23,430
winter wheat to corn 13.8 16.9 for

103
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:27,210
winter wheat to sunflower so what's that

104
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:29,100
telling me is I think you do have a

105
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:30,630
decent amount of moisture be able to get

106
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,820
a cover crop growing in in that

107
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:35,580
situation now you got to remember when

108
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:38,010
you look at these preset values how much

109
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:40,260
does it show a hole how much can in the

110
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:44,310
top 5 feet how much water can that soil

111
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:46,320
hold plant-available water usually no

112
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:49,790
more than 11 inches and a lot of that's

113
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,229
going to be dictated by soil textures so

114
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,970
you're saying you're going to hold a lot

115
00:04:52,229 --> 00:04:55,560
less of plants available water it's

116
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:58,350
going to be way less than that 11 inches

117
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:01,020
it's going to be around that 8 7 or 8

118
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:03,389
inches compared to the heavier soils you

119
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:05,400
you can't approach that 11 inches so

120
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:07,860
what I'm saying is your cup is

121
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,510
overfilled and you can you can spare a

122
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,389
little bit of wire to to grow a cover

123
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:15,600
crop and the reason the central part

124
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:17,520
state was was gung-ho on cover crops was

125
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,860
we were having a lot of trouble gaining

126
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,500
corn planted in the wheat stubble and

127
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:25,260
this is actually on Cronus farm this is

128
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,510
a field north west of Gettysburg it's on

129
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:29,130
really heavy clay soils it's actually

130
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:31,260
cells promise oils which would be

131
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:33,360
similar to Stanley County that they have

132
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,620
some ground up there and the one on the

133
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,389
right is where there was no cover crop

134
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,310
planted in there after the previous

135
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:41,010
year's wheat harvest compared to the one

136
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:43,139
on the left now they ran on a seed raid

137
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:44,880
in this area and they actually had to

138
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:47,250
quit planting this corn the spring of

139
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,690
2008 because it was just balling up the

140
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,610
planner they came back about ten days

141
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:54,530
later looking straight north and the

142
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:56,250
exact same spot through a little area

143
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:57,599
very little stand

144
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,190
corn stand there compared to where there

145
00:05:57,599 --> 00:06:01,680
was cover crops so it allowed them the

146
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:04,770
traffic ability to get across that that

147
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:09,419
field timely another concern is well

148
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:11,910
okay it's using too much water and it

149
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:14,580
does it will use an inch to inch and a

150
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:16,260
half of water in the fall but by spring

151
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:18,990
when you're planting your next year's

152
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:21,180
crop what is it then and this is a

153
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:24,060
subsidy from North Dakota near Bismarck

154
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,650
this is on some fine sandy loam soils

155
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,110
where they had cover crop plants

156
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:30,330
available water was three inches no

157
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:32,760
cover crop 3.11

158
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:36,719
so very little difference when it comes

159
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:41,420
to planting corn difference for what

160
00:06:36,719 --> 00:06:44,790
that cover crop used the fall before

161
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:46,080
so when we're selecting species you need

162
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:48,060
to know that your objectives are for

163
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,470
that cover crop on that particular field

164
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,830
what do you want it accomplished we'll

165
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:54,900
talk more about various objectives what

166
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:57,870
will the following years cash crop be

167
00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:00,270
will it be corn will be sunflower that

168
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:01,530
was going to dictate of what kind of

169
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:03,960
mixtures you're going to want to be

170
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:06,720
planting or what species are going to

171
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,300
want to be planting for that for that

172
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,830
cover crop big one herbicide applied to

173
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,410
currents here's cash crop what did you

174
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:15,990
put on that wheat crop that may carry

175
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:19,680
over and damage that cover crop that's

176
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:22,020
another huge concern so again a big list

177
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,800
of objectives provide nitrogen add

178
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:28,320
organic matter improve motivate sustain

179
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,320
soil biology is a huge one huge one as

180
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:33,150
you learned earlier today review soil

181
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,340
erosion reduce compaction there's some

182
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:37,020
species four that are going to be better

183
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:39,990
that deeper compaction compared to

184
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:41,790
surface compaction manage nutrients

185
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:43,980
basically basically sequestered

186
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:45,360
nutrients bring up those ones that are

187
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,760
down in the root zone bring them up

188
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,560
closer to the surface provide weed

189
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,920
control that's a big one provide

190
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,960
livestock grazing is a huge one and

191
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:57,240
reducing soil salinity there's not a lot

192
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,780
of species though to be able to plant

193
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:06,180
and grow in those really white areas of

194
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:08,220
the field as I showed you earlier you're

195
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:11,700
going to basically be using that water

196
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:13,590
to keep that white area from growing any

197
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,810
larger but in the severe cases you're

198
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:18,000
better off with with perennials in that

199
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:20,850
in that situation just remember it

200
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,820
two-thirds of the organic matter comes

201
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:26,550
from the roots so don't get discouraged

202
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:29,520
if your cover crops four five six inches

203
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:31,260
tall you're still getting some some

204
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,360
benefit down below not only from that

205
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:36,690
sustaining that soil biology from moving

206
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,880
forward but also a little bit from some

207
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:42,510
organic matter that's being put into the

208
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:44,460
system and increasing soil how should be

209
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:46,860
the main focus for any crop plant system

210
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:49,380
sales have been mined for years under

211
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:51,690
tillage systems restoring soil

212
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:54,420
resilience is the key and dwyane hid a

213
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:57,360
lot about that on that earlier

214
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:59,940
why resource or resilience increase soil

215
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,980
organic matter again going back to that

216
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,139
biology keeping that thing sustained in

217
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,940
the live and movie improve water

218
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:08,730
infiltration decrease soil compaction

219
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:10,829
improve crop production or productivity

220
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:12,690
and just an impact we'll talk a little

221
00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:15,800
bit more on some of this water and

222
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:17,579
filtration some on some aggregates

223
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,430
stability and so forth

224
00:09:17,579 --> 00:09:22,649
I like showing these next three slides

225
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:25,410
here this is actually taken right south

226
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:28,790
of Isabel about ten twelve miles I

227
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:31,500
believe I took this on Labor Day of 2013

228
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:33,300
corn fuel bill as you can see or kind of

229
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,579
a poor cornfield but it was all burnt up

230
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:39,630
the history on this was and the field

231
00:09:35,579 --> 00:09:41,730
I'll show you next this one it was CLP

232
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:43,620
for 20-some years it was taken out with

233
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:46,170
tillage it was farmed conventionally

234
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:48,240
with tillage a wheat there was the way

235
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:51,480
like a wheat sunflower millet crop on

236
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:54,870
there again all done with tillage new

237
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:58,709
operator took it over and fall of 2012

238
00:09:54,870 --> 00:10:00,959
late fall 2013 he planted corn out there

239
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:03,540
you seen that very good cornfield and

240
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:07,110
very close by another cornfield was

241
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:09,120
taken out exact same time however it was

242
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:11,610
strictly done with no-till it was never

243
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,980
there was no disking or anything like

244
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:16,110
that going on a streak strictly Modi

245
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,000
servants no-till planting corn on both

246
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:22,440
of these fields and they're very close

247
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,050
together so he can't tell me that that

248
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,790
that CRP he didn't provide some some

249
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:29,130
benefit as far as long-term no tell

250
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:33,810
water infiltration and so forth of

251
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:36,420
what's taking place there so like

252
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:38,339
believe said carbon is is huge what we

253
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:41,010
need to do to mitigate mitigate drought

254
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:43,589
impacts your own up here we're always 5

255
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:45,660
to 7 days away from drought always don't

256
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:48,569
appear were about 14 days away from a

257
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,920
drought but here we're always very very

258
00:10:48,569 --> 00:10:51,930
close to seem like we're always on the

259
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,899
edge so that carbon is huge in this area

260
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:57,060
especially and we need to include make

261
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:59,819
sure we include obviously greater than

262
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:04,140
50% Dwayne once that 75 to 80 percent

263
00:10:59,819 --> 00:11:05,370
carbon into the system it's a fine line

264
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,720
there it just depends on your patch

265
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:09,310
nursery on a given field of

266
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,990
what's going to sustain you but greater

267
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:13,389
than two-thirds or greater would

268
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:15,399
probably be ideal alternate sequences

269
00:11:13,389 --> 00:11:17,500
corn behind wheat corn behind soybean

270
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:19,360
corn behind fuel P and I know you guys

271
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:23,290
could raise some really good field peas

272
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:25,120
up here like to see some some some more

273
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:26,949
of those growing up in here eliminate

274
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,069
crop residue removal if you got to take

275
00:11:26,949 --> 00:11:32,379
straw off of that for the livestock go

276
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:34,180
to the neighbors whatever neighbor isn't

277
00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:36,399
here see if he can get his next year's

278
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:39,009
corn stalks or wheat straw or whatever

279
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,420
oat straw and use that because that's

280
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:42,819
that's something that's extremely

281
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:45,879
critical and if you're trained or hoping

282
00:11:42,819 --> 00:11:48,189
to we have no more does that come in the

283
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:50,170
office that I always want to increase

284
00:11:48,189 --> 00:11:51,540
their main objective is the increased

285
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:54,519
organic matter with these cover crops

286
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:56,620
you are out there and the wheat field is

287
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:58,660
all baled up I'm sorry to tell you

288
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:01,779
there's no amount of cover crop out

289
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:04,180
there that's going to to replace of what

290
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:07,990
he removed with that wheat straw no-till

291
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:10,360
with low disturbance openers and cover

292
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:13,059
crop at cover crops were possible but

293
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,379
monitor the percent brassicas you want

294
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:18,939
to talk more about that in a little bit

295
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:21,009
here so on some of those sheets that I

296
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:22,990
gave you a lot was handed out there's

297
00:12:21,009 --> 00:12:24,459
some characteristics there but I try to

298
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:27,610
summarize some of these in these next

299
00:12:24,459 --> 00:12:29,949
two tables of what species will do what

300
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:32,889
as far as objectives and really it's

301
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:34,389
just kind of kind of a bad government's

302
00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:36,279
recommendation it's not it's nothing

303
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:38,680
science behind it but there's some

304
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:41,379
things that that we can observe there of

305
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:44,649
what what's good for what basically

306
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:48,100
compaction here a lot of guys see these

307
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:50,319
big radish ribs and they do do they do

308
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,689
do some good for some deep compaction a

309
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:54,370
lot of the surface compaction is better

310
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:56,709
off with some finer root systems and

311
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:58,329
that's where the rape is probably a

312
00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:01,329
better fit if you have more surface

313
00:12:58,329 --> 00:13:03,879
compaction and then some more the the

314
00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:06,339
very very fine species out there like

315
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:08,649
teff produces a lot of fine roots and

316
00:13:06,339 --> 00:13:11,579
they get into the real small areas that

317
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:13,420
break up mainly platy soil structure

318
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:14,980
moisture I'm not gonna worry about that

319
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:17,019
has more for over yeast where we try to

320
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:19,179
get try to plant some species that are

321
00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:21,250
going to survive the winter and grow the

322
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:23,680
following spring to use more and more

323
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:26,620
yet over east nitrogen fixation

324
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:29,459
basically any of the other legumes out

325
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:32,079
there are you going to fix some nitrogen

326
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:33,870
some of them are a warm season versus

327
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,189
cool you need to keep that in mind

328
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:37,720
there's a lot of these warm season ones

329
00:13:36,189 --> 00:13:39,040
if you're going to be planning after

330
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:42,040
spring wheat you're just wasting your

331
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,050
money they're going to die at 34 degrees

332
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:47,110
and not even get close to freezing at

333
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:49,420
all residue safety brassicas do a good

334
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:50,740
job of that and we'll talk more about

335
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:53,019
that in a minute nutrient cycling

336
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:56,230
anything to go down deep in that soil

337
00:13:53,019 --> 00:13:59,079
profile and set up whatever nitrogen the

338
00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:02,110
leftover salinity these species here the

339
00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:05,500
barley sugar beet rape canola all handle

340
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:08,949
some salts fairly well rice should also

341
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:11,560
be in there so that pand all they gave

342
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:13,300
you there that frontpage is just the

343
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:17,110
characteristics of each of those species

344
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:20,110
we have identified four for NRCS

345
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:22,120
purposes you'll see the first seeding

346
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:26,079
leader listed on there for each of the

347
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:29,050
species and that's just there for if you

348
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:31,120
wanted to design a system let's say you

349
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:33,309
only want 20% of a species you just take

350
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:37,540
point two times that full seeding rate

351
00:14:33,309 --> 00:14:40,750
to get 20% but the next two pages I put

352
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:42,850
together last year and I debated whether

353
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:44,079
or not to break it up into four

354
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:48,279
different regions or five different

355
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:49,779
regions across the state and I didn't it

356
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:52,180
was easier to do it this way but I

357
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:54,699
wanted I don't like to give you recipes

358
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:56,740
and our old standard our old way of

359
00:14:54,699 --> 00:14:58,449
doing it we used to have premix is

360
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:00,069
already built in there well the mixture

361
00:14:58,449 --> 00:15:02,050
I would recommend up here for a guy

362
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:04,259
would be completely different for the

363
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:06,730
guy down in the southeast part of state

364
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:08,550
but you could still use the similar

365
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:10,779
guide it's just going to have different

366
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:13,720
different percentages in there of each

367
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:15,040
of those types and I broke those species

368
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,329
into different types

369
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,240
you got the cool season broadleaf

370
00:15:16,329 --> 00:15:20,889
legumes the brassicas cool season broad

371
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,620
leaves that aren't too legumes cool

372
00:15:20,889 --> 00:15:27,189
season grasses etc there's a percent

373
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:28,930
range in there that I thought personally

374
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:31,179
I thought would be would be ideal for

375
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:33,750
meeting those objectives that you would

376
00:15:31,179 --> 00:15:33,750
want to select

377
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:40,600
okay the Wunder cover crop more than

378
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:42,400
likely doesn't exist it'd be awesome if

379
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,960
we could just plant one it's going to

380
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,000
grow it's going to accomplish everything

381
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:48,760
we want but they just don't do well

382
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,890
singly so we're going to be looking at

383
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,480
mixtures and cocktails and a number of

384
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:55,450
you guys are piping up to Bismarck I've

385
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,880
heard Jay and Gabe preach that over and

386
00:15:55,450 --> 00:16:03,250
over and we're seeing the same thing in

387
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:05,080
South Dakota now you need to look at

388
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:08,320
your crop rotation what are you missing

389
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:12,130
as far as a crop type is going to help

390
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:14,460
determine which species or which

391
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:17,440
dominant species are going to be planted

392
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:19,750
you always want to be planting even the

393
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,090
majority of your cover crop species need

394
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:25,180
to be an opposite crop type of next

395
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:28,420
year's cash crop so if you're planting

396
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:29,920
corn next year you want to have more the

397
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:34,590
majority of the species in this year's

398
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:38,590
cover crop be grasses no of course these

399
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:41,050
 and Rowdies and some cool season

400
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:44,080
grasses should be in the majority of the

401
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:46,090
mixture you really don't want to put a

402
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:48,700
lot of the one season grasses in there

403
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:50,800
so again cover crop to be planted should

404
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:53,620
be an opposite type of cash crop to be

405
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:56,140
planted falling here so let's talk about

406
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:58,180
some of these brassicas you always hear

407
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:01,270
the word brassicas these are non legumes

408
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:03,160
and there's a number of them brassicas

409
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:06,459
and mustards so let's go through these

410
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:08,680
canola if you do any canola oil make

411
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:10,510
sure it's a winter type got law problems

412
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:12,430
with spring types going to seed

413
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:15,250
producing viable seed and some of that

414
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:17,020
viable specie is actually from Roundup

415
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:20,500
Ready canola so make sure it's a winter

416
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:22,660
type I prefer to use rape it's very very

417
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,910
similar to canola but it's actually

418
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:27,010
better for grazing rate that's better

419
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:29,020
than grazing then compared to canola

420
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:31,090
just because it produces more leafy

421
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:33,730
material and there's other hybrids out

422
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:34,990
there with turnips and rape and so forth

423
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,290
and we'll cover a few of those in a

424
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:39,760
minute

425
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:41,110
turnips another Brassica most common

426
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,060
ones going to be the purple top kernel

427
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:44,260
you're going to produce that round bulb

428
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,700
and I have a picture of that here in a

429
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,200
minute but most of those are the wrong

430
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,360
ball

431
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:51,330
there are some turnip varieties like

432
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:54,690
Barkin that is more of a radish type

433
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:56,909
looking root system the market is going

434
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:59,639
to be more of Forge more valuable for

435
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:01,049
Forge radish two main types I'll see the

436
00:17:59,639 --> 00:18:03,659
Forge I have a picture on that in a

437
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:05,490
minute crabby kale Swede and then

438
00:18:03,659 --> 00:18:07,799
mustards and we haven't dealt a lot with

439
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:10,799
some mustards one year we did some lady

440
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:13,139
mustard that decor Lakes and in mich or

441
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,730
in here on and that's leftist scum

442
00:18:13,139 --> 00:18:18,240
bomber not to go and look really good it

443
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:19,980
produced a lot of biomass as I went to

444
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,600
see but I don't think it was viable seed

445
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,860
right you sprayed some of it because you

446
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,870
were concerned with that but you also

447
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:29,340
rolled some and then you left one strip

448
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:32,490
no I think yeah yeah I don't think you

449
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:34,440
sprayed much but you did do some my kale

450
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:36,179
is going to be the part of the cold

451
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,159
hardiest of Lamar's gonna tolerate

452
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:40,799
temperatures down in the single digits

453
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:42,840
for several nights in a row sweet is one

454
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,490
we really don't deal with unless it's

455
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,600
going to be a full season cover crop

456
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,639
something you're going to plant in the

457
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,919
spring it takes usually you don't want

458
00:18:47,639 --> 00:18:54,080
to start grazing it for about 180 days

459
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,080
so it's one of those longer season ones

460
00:18:56,659 --> 00:19:02,340
they're known for the rapid fall growth

461
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:04,799
great biomass production it produce a

462
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:07,919
lot of biomass but most of that's 85 to

463
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:10,649
90 percent water protein content on a

464
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:13,110
number of these brassicas are anywhere

465
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:14,580
from 12 to 18 percent depending on if

466
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:18,809
you're looking at the roots versus the

467
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:21,690
top growth so pretty decent protein

468
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:23,429
content they're assic excellent nutrient

469
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:25,260
scavengers you go deep and their

470
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:27,090
profiles suck up whatever nutrients are

471
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,950
left over pest management

472
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:31,559
characteristics most species release

473
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:33,779
chemical compounds that may be toxic to

474
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:36,330
soil borne pathogens and pests such as

475
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:38,190
nematodes fungi and some weeds mustards

476
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:41,580
usually have a higher concentration of

477
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:42,990
these chemicals here's 30 days after

478
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:45,510
growth left-hand sides

479
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:48,870
turnips these middle two are radishes

480
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:52,080
here then winter canola and then sugar

481
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:53,940
beet that's 30 days after planting sixty

482
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,750
days after planting here's your purple

483
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:58,529
top turnips

484
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:59,420
here's your radish dwarf s6 rape or

485
00:19:58,529 --> 00:20:02,150
winter canola I guess

486
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:03,530
listed there and then your sugar beet so

487
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:07,220
you see the different root architecture

488
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:08,990
and again going back to deep compaction

489
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:10,970
versus surface compaction this was

490
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:12,500
probably better at surface compaction

491
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:15,650
and this one is probably a little bit

492
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:17,990
better at deeper compaction just a

493
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:20,720
illustrate what it can do

494
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:23,390
what brassicas can do for nutrient

495
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:26,210
scavenging at s and Western so Lee

496
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:28,180
County west of Oneida the cover crop was

497
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:31,550
planted August 18th

498
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:33,050
we split the field the soil test on it

499
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:35,990
right after planting where the cover

500
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:38,390
crop was at 88 versus 19 the top two

501
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:39,950
feet you would expect them to be the

502
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:41,840
same you could hopefully be the same and

503
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:44,120
they were you compare that in late

504
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,520
October went back out back out there the

505
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:49,690
soil sample um 112 pounds where there

506
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:52,190
was no cover crop compared to 18 pounds

507
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:56,210
where there was a cover crop left over

508
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:59,480
so that nitrogen is in is in that and

509
00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:01,760
that cover crop biomass being protected

510
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,860
not able to leach down but it's going to

511
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,420
release throughout next year's growing

512
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:07,130
season and that's one of the questions

513
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:09,980
that a lot of the researchers are

514
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:11,840
working on for uni given area because

515
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:13,970
the soil moisture and temperature

516
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,920
dependent on how much of that nitrogen

517
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:18,080
is going to be released to next year's

518
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:21,740
cash crop we just can't come up with one

519
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:23,480
number it's going to be a range if

520
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:25,070
you're warm and wet it's going to be a

521
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,440
high percentage of that is going to be

522
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:31,250
released if you're too cold and dry it's

523
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:33,590
gonna be a very low amount looking at

524
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:36,470
manure they fit very well in a manure

525
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:39,100
application time setting or a period

526
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:42,620
these soil tests were taking in march

527
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:44,450
9th of or 2008 where there was cover

528
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:47,810
crop there was 49 pounds left over in

529
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:49,880
the top four feet compared to 233 pounds

530
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:52,490
in the top four feet where there was no

531
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:55,520
cover crop was that tell you they were

532
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:59,660
over applying to burner maybe a little

533
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:02,510
bit just to slide on fertilizing cover

534
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:04,790
crops a lot of guys you know we're

535
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:07,370
trying to minimize the input cost on a

536
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:08,930
lot of these species and the last thing

537
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:11,630
you want to do is throw more money yet

538
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:15,080
when your grant

539
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:17,600
however if you're planning on or hoping

540
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:19,190
to graze them you get that timing rain

541
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,650
right after planning you got an

542
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:24,410
excellent stand you're going behind

543
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:26,840
wheat you had a excellent wheat yield

544
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:30,049
your protein was less than 12 or lower

545
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:32,600
for low on the low side

546
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:33,620
you know you're short of nitrogen you're

547
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:37,730
probably going to want to throw a little

548
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:40,160
bit of urea or 28% out there to to get

549
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:42,410
some growth out there for biomass need

550
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:45,020
to be considering that as fertilizer for

551
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:47,240
next year's corn crop or whatever crop

552
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:48,770
you're going to the more you want out of

553
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,840
your cover crop the more it makes sense

554
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:52,789
to nurture the cover crop just some

555
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,919
examples on what cover crops can do for

556
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:57,530
weed control this is actually on North

557
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:59,780
Duane's north unit no cover crop on the

558
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:02,690
left the previous year this is in the

559
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:04,760
spring and the one on the right you see

560
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:09,320
how the eating weeds going out there

561
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:20,600
whatsoever no it's planted it was just

562
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:23,210
planted you know you said you had the

563
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:27,679
hard time hard slot to speak in to try

564
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:29,360
the one right after lunch this another

565
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,909
example we control of the guy was

566
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:34,490
planted a few cover crops over here on

567
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:35,900
the tree belt for hunting purposes went

568
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:38,360
across the field to empty out the drill

569
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:39,830
and and the rest of us didn't have it

570
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,570
you see the huge difference there for

571
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:43,520
weed control now a lot of guys get

572
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:44,990
intimidated we get guys will release

573
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,679
that do a lot of it just on prevent

574
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:49,880
plant acres and they see this big amount

575
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:51,320
of biomass out there and they're

576
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,000
wondering how in the heck am I going to

577
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:56,539
get out there next year the plant corner

578
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,740
of that stuff so they don't listen to us

579
00:23:56,539 --> 00:23:58,850
on 1st thing you still go out there with

580
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:00,470
their big discs and working under

581
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:02,659
because they're still concerned but if

582
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:04,070
you happen to leave that it just melts

583
00:24:02,659 --> 00:24:05,720
down especially if there's a lot of

584
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:07,940
brassicas in there and millstone -

585
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:10,370
absolutely nothing there's this nothing

586
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:12,799
leftist they said it's 85 to 90% water

587
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:18,280
even those big radish roots are just so

588
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:18,280
tender and mild and it really does it

589
00:24:18,429 --> 00:24:22,010
there's no interference that whatsoever

590
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:23,690
a lot of guys worried about their

591
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:25,250
residue managers plugging up with these

592
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:27,380
big rash roots or

593
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:32,210
puts there's no way she's gonna cross

594
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:35,180
that and we talked about those residue

595
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:38,000
decomposes very quickly very low carbon

596
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:39,560
and nitrogen ratio and I said before a

597
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,140
lot of these tolerate cold temperatures

598
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:44,840
LOM will handle in that mid to upper

599
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:47,150
teens for several nights in a row if not

600
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:49,400
weeks in a row and be just fine and keep

601
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:52,640
growing here's an example of oil steel

602
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:54,980
as compared to forge raddish Forge

603
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,380
radish obviously after the name better

604
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:59,570
for livestock grazing more leaf material

605
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:02,570
produce and then I said there were

606
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:05,780
hybrids hybrids a turnip and rape called

607
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:08,270
Pasha hybrid of turnip and winter canola

608
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:09,920
called T Raptor and hunter hybrid have

609
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:11,930
turned up and kale called Winfred and

610
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:14,080
this is going to be since there's kale

611
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:17,420
in there it's gonna be extremely winter

612
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,890
or tolerance of cold temperatures and if

613
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:20,150
you're doing some late season grazing I

614
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:22,130
would definitely include some of that in

615
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:25,040
there now with these hybrids are a

616
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:27,950
little bit higher in seed costs seed

617
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:30,680
size is just a little bit bigger but for

618
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:32,060
the most part it's it's it's we still

619
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:34,570
use the same seeding rate and maybe

620
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:37,490
maybe we need to change on those but

621
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:39,050
I'll work with your your seed supplier

622
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:41,690
on some of those as far as some of these

623
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:43,100
hybrids and they can give you a pretty

624
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:46,070
good figure in there to include in that

625
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:49,460
mixture now remember that one slide I

626
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:52,730
said monitor your percent Brassica why

627
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:55,820
is that at the coal lakes in 2008 this

628
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:58,070
is picture taken in July this is on the

629
00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:00,680
rotation on dry land when our wheat corn

630
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:03,500
fuel P rotation there was no cover crop

631
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:07,430
put in there there's actually corn grow

632
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:09,200
out there right now in 2008 but the

633
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:11,780
previous year after winter wheat there

634
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,400
was no cover crop planted Dwayne planted

635
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:15,500
several different treatments out there

636
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:17,600
some of them included a hard percent

637
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,070
Brassica and it would have been after

638
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,450
two years of wheat so this would have

639
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:23,300
been the cover crop would have been

640
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:26,750
placed right here two years a wheat look

641
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:29,270
at the bear gown July central South

642
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:33,440
Dakota you don't want that 25 to 30

643
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:35,980
bushel yield hit 100% brassicas not a

644
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,450
good plan so again as

645
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:40,390
West you're going to want to take this

646
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:41,980
sheet I gave you and monitor that

647
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:43,179
percent Brassica you don't want to go

648
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:44,919
over I don't think there's any of them

649
00:26:43,179 --> 00:26:47,049
over there maybe for the wildlife one

650
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:50,140
there might be one that's 50% where all

651
00:26:47,049 --> 00:26:52,000
the rest are at 40% it's zero to 40% so

652
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:55,929
throughout here you're gonna want to be

653
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:59,770
in that 25 to 30% at most four percent

654
00:26:55,929 --> 00:27:01,510
brassicas brassicas like sulfur so if

655
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:03,690
you're following corn behind that or

656
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:07,000
even spring wheat behind a certain

657
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:09,510
property had cover crops in I've seen

658
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,250
sulfur deficiency in both of those crops

659
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:13,630
you're going to want some salt sulfur

660
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:17,020
out there I don't care what your soil

661
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:19,240
test says just leg Anthony I don't rely

662
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:20,320
on sulfur soil tests at all I think

663
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,630
personally I think it's more of a

664
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,809
sampling error than it is testing the

665
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:26,919
air but maybe maybe I'm wrong there

666
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:29,020
you're gonna want some sulfur out there

667
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:31,059
depending on how you put it on that

668
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:34,270
surface supplied you're going to want to

669
00:27:31,059 --> 00:27:36,640
about 25 pounds 20 to 25 if it's banded

670
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:40,450
you can get by with that 8 to 10 maybe

671
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:42,250
12 pound range okay let's switch gears

672
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:46,510
the cool season broadleafs non legumes

673
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:48,790
sugar beet flax camelina sugar beets are

674
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:51,669
tolerate or tolerance to salinity

675
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:55,270
residue decomposes quickly good tap

676
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:57,280
right palm is germination is very very

677
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:59,770
poor at least we get the rejects from

678
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:02,590
the seed companies and I have yet to be

679
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:04,510
able to find a seed that you get a real

680
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:07,360
good establishment off of sugar beets so

681
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:09,250
I had quit recommending them but it's

682
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:12,070
still one out there that if you happen

683
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:14,470
to get a good seed supplier and the

684
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:16,299
quality is good that germ is good I

685
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:17,410
throw some in especially if you're

686
00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:21,520
looking at trying to address some

687
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:23,970
salinity and cows just love these they

688
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:28,390
love them

689
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:30,520
pardon she do - okay fact small seed

690
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:32,530
produced tap red does not tolerate

691
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:35,230
quality drain soils or those high in

692
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:39,340
soluble salts fairly tolerant to frost

693
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:40,360
once once established and it's one facts

694
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:43,270
is very mycorrhizal

695
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:47,440
I started including a little bit of flax

696
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:48,909
and ever and every mixture when in

697
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,330
camelina we did a little bit of work

698
00:28:48,909 --> 00:28:53,010
with us

699
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:55,660
in the Watertown area like its name says

700
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:57,520
it's winter we're hoping that to survive

701
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:59,890
the winter take off early in the spring

702
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:02,500
it's a broadleaf we're trying to look at

703
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:05,920
that opposite cover crop going to corn

704
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:07,630
and we had limited limited success we

705
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,310
had some come back but it was just I

706
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:10,990
don't know I just maybe we need to

707
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:13,840
revisit that again but we tried to work

708
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:17,190
with some guys on it and it didn't do

709
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:19,810
overly well it should but it didn't

710
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:22,840
Christi's and broadleaf legumes we've

711
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:24,220
got a whole host of them elfelfa sweet

712
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,840
clover could be probably in that warm

713
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:28,300
season one but we had red clover white

714
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:32,560
clover else eight clover hairy vetch

715
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:34,510
calm and veg notice two vetches very

716
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,230
very different very important to know

717
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:37,870
the difference

718
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:40,900
hairy vetch versus common veg crimson

719
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:44,830
clover chickling vetch third vetch feel

720
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:46,780
pea and lentils the clovers I'm not

721
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:49,660
going to talk a lot about these these

722
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:51,760
are more more over East the sweet clover

723
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:54,160
might have some fit here only thing I

724
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,800
don't like about sweet clover 50% or

725
00:29:54,160 --> 00:30:00,790
more hard seed a gift that keeps on it

726
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:03,430
keeps on giving hairy vetch a little bit

727
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:05,830
of hard seed in there but the seed size

728
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:09,040
is very similar to wheat so it's hard to

729
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:10,480
get separated out it's one live not

730
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,610
quite as bad sweet clover it's one of

731
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,230
those that will keep seem like you plant

732
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:17,410
at once and you have it for the next 15

733
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:19,300
years so I'm very hesitant I only

734
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:20,980
recommend this the guys that I really

735
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:23,050
really know well that they'll do a good

736
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:25,060
job and controlling that volunteer

737
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:27,490
because it will overwinter this one will

738
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:29,110
overwinter well almost all the other

739
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:31,390
ones I covered here for the most part

740
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:34,120
will not overwinter the frost will kill

741
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:36,190
them out for the most part we've had

742
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:40,600
some dwarf Essex rape overwinter and

743
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:43,270
very mild winters and if you're going to

744
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:45,190
corn you need to be mixing a

745
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:47,830
sulfonylurea in with your burn Dahl do

746
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:50,050
not do a roundup Banville roundup 2 4 d

747
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:53,380
it will not work it may look like it

748
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:55,000
will work for 14 days but it will not

749
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:59,530
work make sure you throw a little bit of

750
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,420
Express or Harmony SG in there to take

751
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:02,860
care of that but hairy vetch will

752
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:05,260
overwinter

753
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:07,929
just a picture of that crimson clover

754
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:10,110
again more for over east picture that

755
00:31:07,929 --> 00:31:13,540
chickling vetch i like this one a lot

756
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:15,250
produces a lot of nitrogen it's actually

757
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:19,330
one of that the organic farmers grow a

758
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:22,059
lot of it it it fixes a lot of nitrogen

759
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:24,730
very quickly it's draw parent only

760
00:31:22,059 --> 00:31:29,049
problem seed costs aside seventy five

761
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:31,750
cents a pound so if i know the guys not

762
00:31:29,049 --> 00:31:34,690
going to grieve because some of these

763
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:37,450
can be toxic to cattle and sheep and

764
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:39,370
it's mainly if it produces seed it's not

765
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:42,429
the vegetative portion that is toxic

766
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:44,110
it's mainly the seed but in some cases

767
00:31:42,429 --> 00:31:46,870
if you happen to plan it get it planted

768
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:48,520
early it doesn't take long for them the

769
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:50,260
flower and maybe produce a little bit of

770
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,690
seed so you got to be watching there so

771
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:54,429
if the guys don't raise graze that i

772
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:56,470
recommend a little bit in the mixture

773
00:31:54,429 --> 00:32:00,790
but i'll dilute it out with some other

774
00:31:56,470 --> 00:32:04,630
cheaper legume species like common vetch

775
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:06,669
like lentils those sorts of things and

776
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:10,750
and and there's a picture of chickling

777
00:32:06,669 --> 00:32:13,900
vetch also known as grass pea i don't

778
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:17,140
have a picture in here of in the end

779
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:18,910
chickling vetch tolerates or handles the

780
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:21,190
competition from these big leaf

781
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:22,600
brassicas very well so it does a really

782
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:24,400
good job in there that's just a picture

783
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,410
of the mixture there there's lentil in

784
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:29,620
there radish door 4-6 rape and chickling

785
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:32,260
vetch I don't have a picture of the few

786
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:35,320
peopie like few peas a lot but somewhat

787
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:36,400
similar to chicken and veg to see can

788
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,830
get kind of expensive because their

789
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,059
seeding rate for a few peas I believe

790
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:43,150
you look on the sheet I think it says

791
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:45,070
seventy pounds so even if you're doing

792
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:48,190
twenty thirty percent of that the seed

793
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:49,900
costs gets up in a hurry a lot of these

794
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:51,250
I'll do a small portion of the species

795
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:53,380
that are really light depending on what

796
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:55,360
cost is and then I'll do loot it out

797
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:56,950
with some cheaper ones but they're in

798
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:02,230
the same family there they're still a

799
00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:03,940
cool season legume lentils a lot of

800
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:06,400
rentals out there Indian has red berries

801
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:08,890
Rose town Morton's are some of the

802
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:11,980
common ones smaller seed results in

803
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:14,530
cheaper cost they're a little bit slower

804
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:15,370
growing and not as aggressive most of

805
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:16,720
these legumes

806
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:19,690
lively you won't really

807
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,340
see very robust early on depending on

808
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:23,559
how much free nitrogen you have left

809
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:25,570
remaining in the soil you we don't see

810
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:28,650
these coming on until mid mid-september

811
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:31,049
so before they really start taking off

812
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:33,539
it's a picture of Indian Head lentils in

813
00:33:31,049 --> 00:33:36,309
Gettysburg warm season broad leaves

814
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:38,919
legumes warm season broadleaf cow peas

815
00:33:36,309 --> 00:33:41,500
soybeans non legumes sunflowers and

816
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:44,380
buckwheat safflower should be listed

817
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:46,740
there also although safflower is kind of

818
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:49,870
on the edge of cool and warm

819
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:53,740
buckwheat short season crop residue

820
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:56,770
decomposes quickly excuse me not as well

821
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:59,590
tolerant scavengers nutrients phosphorus

822
00:33:56,770 --> 00:34:01,419
that are unavailable to other crops and

823
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:05,049
what Mike was alluding to earlier this

824
00:34:01,419 --> 00:34:09,220
morning it actually releases a slight

825
00:34:05,049 --> 00:34:12,340
mild acidic exudate from its root system

826
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:14,320
and anytime you throw an acid in the

827
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:15,760
soil is actually gonna release some some

828
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,129
phosphorus there so that's kind of where

829
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:22,929
that's gets that from cow peas warm

830
00:34:18,129 --> 00:34:25,720
season broadleaf not not frost tolerant

831
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:27,940
whatsoever but it likes it hot and dry

832
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:29,589
so you guys in August I mean if you

833
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:31,599
haven't planted timely you could throw

834
00:34:29,589 --> 00:34:34,780
some copies in if you don't get them

835
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:37,179
planted up here by July 15th I would be

836
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:41,859
very hesitant throwing throwing cow peas

837
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:43,810
in there clear season grasses so I won't

838
00:34:41,859 --> 00:34:47,440
spend a lot of time on these since we

839
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:52,060
grow a lot of them up here we know a lot

840
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:54,129
about rye barley very salt tolerant and

841
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:55,899
like that from that standpoint I do do

842
00:34:54,129 --> 00:34:58,720
some with some barley and oats is

843
00:34:55,899 --> 00:35:01,150
probably the biggest one that I add to

844
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:04,300
every mixture I always put 20% it's in

845
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:06,690
about 14 14 to 20 pounds depending if

846
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:10,089
you're going to be grazing it or not

847
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:12,970
fairly mycorrhizal does corn loves oats

848
00:35:10,089 --> 00:35:16,300
you plant corn and oats double does very

849
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:19,869
well Trey Kelly a cross between Ryan

850
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:22,270
durum wheat spring and winter types we

851
00:35:19,869 --> 00:35:26,260
got some guys messing with that that

852
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:27,940
sort of stuff anyway I guess I don't

853
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:30,040
think for the most part you and do a lot

854
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:30,550
of that just watch where you get your

855
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,920
seats

856
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:34,660
if you do try some of it just not one of

857
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:37,440
it's one of those cool season grasses

858
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:40,870
that I love the whoop system it's very

859
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:43,540
somewhat similar to test tough grass has

860
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:46,090
a very fine root system but it's just

861
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:49,090
very this is a very spindly plant in a

862
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:53,770
cover crop mixture and most of the guys

863
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:55,690
are using this over east and into Iowa

864
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:59,320
the other cover crop if you want to

865
00:35:55,690 --> 00:36:01,300
start growing some seed Rye suruli and

866
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:04,120
we've used to raise some cereal right

867
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:05,860
when I was growing up up here I will

868
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:08,080
take all your cereal rye you want I

869
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:11,200
guarantee you that they use a lot of

870
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:13,660
cereal right down there one of season

871
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:16,120
grasses green and for sorghum millet

872
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:20,470
Sedan grass sorghum hybrids corn TIFF

873
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:22,450
grass we do a lot of these up here I'm

874
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:24,040
not going to spend a lot of time tough

875
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:27,310
grass is one that you probably haven't

876
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:30,760
heard a lot of once these annual grass

877
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:32,650
is very very small seeds generally and

878
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:35,560
it comes coated or uncoated to help with

879
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:37,450
the seeding process but anywhere from

880
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:41,560
three to eight pounds depending on the

881
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:43,840
thickness of the coat again a good root

882
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:47,020
system as far as being very fine getting

883
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:49,090
into small areas to help develop soil

884
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:51,730
structure yeah it's very good hay

885
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:53,470
quality very very good hay quality and

886
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:56,710
there's a number of guys in the pier

887
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:58,210
area some guys raised it for seed some

888
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:59,920
guys have raised it for just strictly

889
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:02,800
for hay get two or three cuttings off of

890
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:05,980
it and done quite well with it

891
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:08,400
now magic bait at least where I am at I

892
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:12,300
want Covercraft planted by August 5th

893
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:15,040
produces the most growth consistently

894
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,460
this window we've studied this for three

895
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,520
years

896
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:21,760
that window was two weeks either side of

897
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:23,110
that all the time some years this year

898
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,570
probably would have been the year you

899
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:27,900
could have got by with August 20th 25th

900
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:31,660
and then just fine we just don't know

901
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:33,010
secret is is what October is gonna be if

902
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:34,120
I knew what October was gonna be every

903
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:37,810
year I sure wouldn't be working for the

904
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:39,790
government but for the most part earlier

905
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:42,010
the better I have to get those

906
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:44,200
established there's just a picture in

907
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:47,109
McPherson County over there by Leola

908
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:51,700
turnip radish German military own 6,500

909
00:37:47,109 --> 00:37:54,839
pounds of dry weight now other guys want

910
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:58,300
to bail these up so Ottoman bail them up

911
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:59,950
compared to dis grazing him North Dakota

912
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:03,760
study where they looked at grazing him

913
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:06,520
the following year raising him that fall

914
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:08,560
versus chopping him off looking at the

915
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:11,380
following year's cash crop impact on

916
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:13,900
yield grazing 91 bushel corn where they

917
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:20,770
chopped and remove the residue 68 bushel

918
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:24,880
corn removing that Armour is extremely

919
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:29,050
valuable now this is just like it's just

920
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:32,970
a quick study that I did on some corn

921
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:36,790
stalks I sampled the field November 1st

922
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:39,010
and it was graze this one field was

923
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:40,810
grazed right next to it about it less

924
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:42,400
than eighth mile away both of these

925
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:46,300
fields have been managed by the same guy

926
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:48,220
for the past 15 years and the soil tests

927
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:49,359
were taken unfortunately after grazing I

928
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:52,000
wish they would have had some so test

929
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:53,440
before the grazing period but the

930
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,670
producer was shocked looked at his own

931
00:38:53,440 --> 00:39:00,130
to here 24 parts per million Olson here

932
00:38:56,670 --> 00:39:04,480
compared to the ungrazed 11 again both

933
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:06,940
of these both of these were managed the

934
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,099
same way for the past 15 years that was

935
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:10,750
your one after Daisy your - after

936
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:13,300
grazing I thought that's a fluke never

937
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:14,740
going to happen again same thing again

938
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:17,609
they weren't graze that was sunflowers

939
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:22,020
this year the other field was grazed

940
00:39:17,609 --> 00:39:26,430
this current year 18 compared to nine

941
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:30,130
still holding steady I wasn't a fluke

942
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:31,839
and actually held off her I have slices

943
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:33,730
I forgot to add them in this one but I

944
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:35,170
do have slides further for year three

945
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:37,510
and they were still there they're

946
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:39,730
getting closer together but it's still

947
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:41,470
higher for where it was grazed the

948
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:44,859
challenges are trained to figure out how

949
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:46,690
to mix these together to see them most

950
00:39:44,859 --> 00:39:48,970
days with the air Cedars a lot easier if

951
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:51,160
you do happen to do maybe some larger

952
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:53,170
seat at fuel piece all of that chickling

953
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:55,660
vetch chickling vetch seed do you have

954
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:56,510
some of that here okay

955
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:58,580
the chick

956
00:39:56,510 --> 00:40:00,860
vej she looks like Pete Rock and it's

957
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:02,660
bigger so you probably need to keep that

958
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:05,120
separate and put in a different tank and

959
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:07,580
with air cuts easier to do with a 750

960
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:09,410
drill a lot more difficult if that's all

961
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:11,720
you have a 750 drill I'd still throw

962
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:13,100
them all together put in there only feel

963
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:15,020
about half ways for because you know by

964
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:18,950
the time you get it empty dollar is

965
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:20,060
going to be started to get separated but

966
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:22,910
most guys just throw them in together

967
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:25,100
and this has been by far our best way to

968
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:27,050
establish cover crops we've did this

969
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:30,710
with a beet turnip truck and standing

970
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:32,450
wheat back in 2008 and we did this six

971
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:34,670
weeks be hard before harvest and it was

972
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:37,310
way too early way too early we got cover

973
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:40,000
crops to come and that wheat was still

974
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:42,740
too green got shaded out and they died

975
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,660
too early if you like broadcast

976
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:46,700
understanding wheat I would not do it

977
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:51,020
any more than maybe three weeks

978
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:52,720
beforehand preferably two but the

979
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:55,580
drilling method has been the best the

980
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:58,310
main issue with the drilling that I see

981
00:40:55,580 --> 00:41:01,130
my part of the area with the biomass

982
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:05,090
that we have over there guys seed set

983
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:07,910
the drill to shallow most of time I tell

984
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:09,320
guys depending on how worn their discs

985
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:11,510
are is one notch less than wheat

986
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:13,430
possibly two notches less than wheat I

987
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:15,530
want you to cut through that residue

988
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:16,940
I've seen too many fields where the guys

989
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:21,470
started bright and early in the morning

990
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:23,450
a shitty stand nice nice stance starting

991
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:24,950
about 1/2 o'clock in the afternoon you

992
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:27,650
can tell right where is that lady

993
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:29,030
evening it goes back to crap again just

994
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:31,040
because they were not cutting through

995
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:32,870
this thick matter residue

996
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,070
I know these seeds are small but you

997
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:38,450
need to get them in the seed to soil

998
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:41,050
contact I'm not going to cover that but

999
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:45,700
we do have some termination guidelines

1000
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:49,250
and it does affect this area area if you

1001
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:50,960
do summer fallow and you try to put a

1002
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:52,460
cover crop on summer fallow it does

1003
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:56,150
affect this area because as of right now

1004
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:58,580
RMA insurance says that that cover crop

1005
00:41:56,150 --> 00:42:04,700
needs to be terminated in 90 days before

1006
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:06,500
planting that next crop okay so the guys

1007
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:08,810
with fellow with winter wheat definitely

1008
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:10,309
going to impact you the guys with fallow

1009
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:13,609
going to spring wheat and

1010
00:42:10,309 --> 00:42:16,459
you may be able to get by with that but

1011
00:42:13,609 --> 00:42:19,579
check with NRCS we have this part of a

1012
00:42:16,459 --> 00:42:21,439
it's attached to a practice standard if

1013
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:22,819
you're not familiar with it but one of

1014
00:42:21,439 --> 00:42:25,189
your offices know and they can get that

1015
00:42:22,819 --> 00:42:26,719
for you but in summary the benefits of

1016
00:42:25,189 --> 00:42:28,699
cover crops accrue over several years

1017
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:31,759
you will see improvements in crop yield

1018
00:42:28,699 --> 00:42:34,069
pest management and soil tilth

1019
00:42:31,759 --> 00:42:36,529
if you commit to cover crop use whenever

1020
00:42:34,069 --> 00:42:41,569
and wherever possible in your rotation

1021
00:42:36,529 --> 00:42:46,699
and that's all I have so with that do I

1022
00:42:41,569 --> 00:42:49,339
have any questions so let's write that

1023
00:42:46,699 --> 00:42:57,410
for lunch I know it's just as hard for

1024
00:42:49,339 --> 00:43:00,670
me as if for you guys great

1025
00:42:57,410 --> 00:43:00,670
I got off easy
