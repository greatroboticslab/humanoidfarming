00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:06,919
hi there and welcome to little Garden on

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:09,160
the Prairies so this afternoon I am just

3
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:11,320
got off work for the day and it's a

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,880
beautiful evening it's just about the

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:17,000
middle of May and I'm out planting my

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,920
onions that I started from seed I've got

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,800
them planted in containers I've been

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:24,279
doing that for a few years now and it

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,640
has been working out pretty good so um

10
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:26,880
I've got it started here and then I

11
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,279
thought you know I should be filming

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,560
this just maybe sharing a few things

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,120
that I've learned a few tips uh about

14
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,600
Planting onions I'm by no means an

15
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,440
expert on it um this is something that

16
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,879
I've just been doing for a couple years

17
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,160
doing them from seed so I'm just going

18
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:46,199
to show you how I plant up my onions

19
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:48,280
maybe give you a few tips so let's get

20
00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:50,879
started so one of the things I learned

21
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:54,399
about Planting onions is it is kind of a

22
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,600
slow and tedious process so if you're

23
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:00,000
doing it in containers like I am here

24
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,399
it's very hard on you back to bend over

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,079
you're doing it in the ground crawling

26
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:05,840
around on your hands and knees that can

27
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:10,799
also get a little strenuous so this is

28
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:13,799
why I'm got my handy dandy Garden kner

29
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,439
here I'm using it today to sit on so I

30
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:19,520
can be really comfortable while I am

31
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:21,280
slowly planting these onions so I highly

32
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,680
recommend one of these what no matter

33
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,799
how old you are this is such a wonderful

34
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,520
thing to have in the garden it just

35
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,479
makes everything so much more

36
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,759
comfortable your back back doesn't get

37
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,439
sore your knees don't get sore I was

38
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,560
using it indoors this winter crawling

39
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,840
around in my grow tent as a kneeler and

40
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,119
now I've been using it as something that

41
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,240
I can sit on comfortably right at the

42
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:47,360
level of my containers and really enjoy

43
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,240
you know the planting

44
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,479
process so this is what a container of

45
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,840
onions like I started looks like and as

46
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,479
you can see they're planted fairly thick

47
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,240
in here and that's not a problem at all

48
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:01,740
they're very easy to pull apart once it

49
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,680
comes time to

50
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,119
[Music]

51
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,599
plant so you can see here these are the

52
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,920
red onions that I've been planting in my

53
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:14,840
container and they can they come apart

54
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:17,760
really easily like this you can just

55
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,920
basically pull them apart The Roots come

56
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,200
up come apart from each other quite

57
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,400
easily just make sure your soil is you

58
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,760
know moistened pretty good when you're

59
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,080
doing this and they are very easy to to

60
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,720
pull apart you don't have to worry about

61
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,920
hurting the roots and then they are

62
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:38,040
ready to get planted

63
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,519
up so I started off by freshening up my

64
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:44,280
containers here with some some new

65
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:46,159
potting soil I mixed up some Pete Moss

66
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,760
and some potting soil here I'm just

67
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:51,519
going

68
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,040
to add that to my

69
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:57,200
container so I just like to loosen up

70
00:02:54,040 --> 00:03:00,420
last year's soil and mix in some of that

71
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:10,180
fresh stuff that I just added

72
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:10,180
[Music]

73
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,239
then I like to just top it up with a

74
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:18,840
little uh allpurpose

75
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,840
organic fertilizer here so I'll just

76
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,040
sprinkle some of that in and work it in

77
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,040
as well

78
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:40,720
[Music]

79
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,239
so I found some of this in my garden

80
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,519
shed this is granular bone meal which is

81
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:48,000
good for root growth stimulation so this

82
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:50,480
is something that will be good for

83
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,959
onions so I'm just going to add a

84
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,959
handful of that into here as well

85
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,470
[Music]

86
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,760
so once you got that all worked in you

87
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:11,920
got the soil all loosened up you're

88
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,560
ready to start putting your onions in so

89
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,879
the ones I'm going to start planting

90
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,919
here are their wala wala onions and

91
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:20,320
these are known as a long day onion

92
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:23,440
which is the kind of onion you want to

93
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:26,600
grow here in my growing zone 3 where we

94
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:30,479
have long days of sunlight starting now

95
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:34,199
until you know mid July so these like

96
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:37,440
about 12 to 16 hours of daylight so

97
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:40,360
these are a great onion to grow in this

98
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,039
area so I'm just going to grab a handful

99
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,560
here and start separating them not sure

100
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:45,840
if all of these are going to fit in this

101
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,639
container

102
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:53,199
so just kind of gently tease the roots

103
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:55,320
apart as I said they won't harm them you

104
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:59,520
can just kind of pull them apart and

105
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,520
they'll come apart fairly easy

106
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,880
then I just kind of slowly start pulling

107
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:08,880
a

108
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,880
few

109
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:14,240
out as you can see they have super long

110
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:17,919
roots right

111
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,919
now looking pretty

112
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,639
healthy and the thing is about Planting

113
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:26,600
onions is you don't want to plant them

114
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,280
too deep you want to just make sure you

115
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,319
are getting those roots under the soil

116
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,520
and just just covering up not too much

117
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:36,280
of what's going to be the bulb of the

118
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:39,520
onion you want that to grow basically on

119
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:41,280
top of the soil Not underneath so just

120
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,720
remember that when planting don't plant

121
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,280
these too

122
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,720
deep so just to dig a little bit of a

123
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,039
hole make sure those roots are all in

124
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,600
there and just kind of push the dirt

125
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:55,120
around

126
00:05:51,600 --> 00:06:00,639
that area that's going to ball Bo

127
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,639
eventually and Pat it down

128
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,120
so these will kind of look a little

129
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,840
floppy at first when you plant them up

130
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,240
but once those roots take hold and they

131
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,680
gain a little strength your onions will

132
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,680
start growing tall and

133
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:20,680
[Music]

134
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,880
strong so like I said it's a bit of a a

135
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:27,240
slow tedious process doing this can take

136
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,720
a little while so make sure you give

137
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,960
yourself enough time make sure sure

138
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,000
you're

139
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:36,360
comfortable cuz this can get a little

140
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,360
hard on the back after a

141
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:42,639
while and I don't really worry too much

142
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:45,919
about spacing just kind of keep in mind

143
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:48,360
how big you know an onion can get and

144
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:51,360
make sure you have space I will plant

145
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,000
them probably a little thicker than we

146
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,759
should but I will thin them out

147
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,120
throughout the summer you can pick the

148
00:06:54,759 --> 00:07:00,400
small ones and you know eat them cook

149
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,599
them with them and just use them in

150
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,639
salads or whatever and kind of thin them

151
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:08,039
out naturally throughout the season that

152
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:11,560
way so besides the wala wala I like

153
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:14,639
growing a red onion as well I do some

154
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,720
green onions also from seed I got some

155
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,319
started in my winter sewing

156
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,879
jugs and if I find I have some empty

157
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:24,400
containers or space in the garden once

158
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:26,879
everything's planted up I probably we'll

159
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:31,440
grow some more onions are something that

160
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:33,800
are so easy to store in the winter they

161
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,639
don't require a whole lot of preparation

162
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:40,080
just keeping them in a cool dark place

163
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:43,080
is all you need to do and we pretty much

164
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,460
cook with onions every day so can never

165
00:07:43,080 --> 00:08:02,280
have too many

166
00:07:44,460 --> 00:08:04,360
[Music]

167
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,639
and usually later on in the season when

168
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,280
those onions start to bulb you can do a

169
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,240
bit of a uh spooning around them just to

170
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,080
kind of keep that dirt clear and you

171
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,440
know give uh space for those onions to

172
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,520
really bulb

173
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,639
[Music]

174
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,440
out so after you get them all planted in

175
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,039
you know they they kind of don't look so

176
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,800
great they look like you know they're

177
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:29,080
all kind of flopped over and don't look

178
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:31,919
so healthy but like I said after a week

179
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:34,279
or so those roots will you know take

180
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,479
hold and they will start standing up a

181
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:38,000
little straighter so after I've got them

182
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,479
all planted here I'm just going to give

183
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,240
them a good watering sometimes you can

184
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,880
even buy these uh seedling onions

185
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:48,640
already planted in uh green houses you

186
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:52,480
can just bring them home separate them

187
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,480
like I showed you and plant them

188
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,399
up get everything well watered in

189
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,200
and then I like to kind of top it up

190
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:06,120
with a mulch of dried leaves I'm just

191
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:10,519
going to give it a day here just to kind

192
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:12,160
of let them take hold of the soil a

193
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:15,040
little bit before I cover them up with

194
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,920
some dried leaves which I still need to

195
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,640
uh collect I got a bunch around in the

196
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,200
hedges here I need to rake up and

197
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,640
collect so that I can start mulching

198
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,160
