  "text": "so it's that time of the year again things are starting to warm up it's past mother's day now and we want to get out in our yard and we want to plant a garden but like a lot of us we don't like watering those gardens so i have a great solution and alternative for you that's cheap and effective so let's get started [Music] so this is my backyard area we have three raised beds here in my backyard we started this about three years ago they're just made of out of two by sixes with a post in the corner and then we basically brought in a leaf compost uh you could call it topsoil if you want but it was a leaf basically i'd leave compost and filled them in and we started our garden like i said about three years ago so like i said we started this about three years ago um we have a bunch of vegetables in here we have tomatoes cucumbers we have asparagus we actually have some strawberries um so we really enjoy that um that's something that my family really likes to do some organic gardening um so basically what i'm gonna show you today is drip irrigation i know a lot of us out there think of drip irrigation i think it's a lot of work but it's not it's actually a lot of fun you can customize it so i'm going to show you how i did my raised garden beds back here and how you can do it at your home as well so basically what drip irrigation is it's basically tubing that runs throughout your yard and you have basically emitters that run off of it into your various plants this is a half inch pipe here they sell in a uh 100 feet at home depot and i believe they sell it at lowe's as well um this hundred foot pipe is less than 10 bucks um basically from here you would connect it to a water timer i'll show you that in a couple minutes um and then basically off of here you can run lines to your plants so like i said home depot sells this rain bird water timer i've had this for two seasons now i haven't had any problems with it it just hooks up to my faucet here basically what's really cool about this is it's battery operated you can turn the dial you can set the clock you can set the duration to how long you want you can have it come on two times a day if you would like you can have it come on any day the week every day a week however long as you want you can also have a manual turn on here as well and there's also a rain delay as well here like i said two seasons i haven't had a problem with this and it's only 35 bucks at home depot from there what you're gonna do is you're gonna connect your um water here basically you have your half inch line come down here you have a couple connections here that go into a backflow preventer here and then your half inch line is just going to go out underneath your ground and into where you want it out in your yard so like i said i have my half inch line here i just run it down in my mulch bed here and i just have it buried and it basically goes along my house here and it goes all along here and then i have a turn here they sell elbows that you can cut and easily put together and it goes all underground here we're going to go into my backyard and then basically what happens is it goes along here underground all the way back to my raised beds so once we come around my fence line here we come up here and then we connect in here again to another half inch and i have this just long run along the middle of the raised bed here and then basically what these uh brown ones are these are four inch emitters so they're spaced out four inches apart and basically they emit water out into your garden it's a really cool feature they're really easy to hook up to your half inch line here with the adapters that they bought you can buy at the store and i just have that run around my garden um and then also in the middle of my garden in certain areas i have these larger adapters here that they just plug in and they also emit water as well so what i'm going to do next is i'm going to turn on this section here so you guys can see what it looks like coming out of the water lines so like i said it's really easy to manually turn this on you're gonna hit the water nail you're gonna just set your duration um i have it already set here for 10 minutes and you just hit ok and then the water is going to start flowing out through your system and we're going to go back and check it out at the raised bed now so we're back out to our raised bed here um as you can see here our emitters they are dripping here every four inches um and what's really cool about this line is you can have it maneuver wherever you want you could have it run like a snake you could have it run it directly over your plants where they're at um this section of my garden right here is asparagus as you can see here you have these emitter as emitters as well these ones emit out more water than these ones um so they're really great for shrubs uh flowers plants whatever you can put these wherever you want so this section over here we just put these in this year these raised beds um we have some various vegetables throughout here um what's really cool about over here is we also have the emitters as well uh they're spaced out four inches um basically i'm just using these uh staples uh here to clamp them down and then from here they also sell these uh poly tube here these are a solid tube and what's really cool about these tubes are is you can pretty much run these tubes to out anywhere you want so for example this tube basically runs and connects all four or actually all three of these raised beds together and then this tube here runs underground and then it comes through this garden here and then my half inch poly tube is underground there and i have it just connected to there so that main water source is putting that water through that small tube here and it's coming through here and it's connecting these three raised beds together and they're all getting the drip irrigation together so you're probably wondering by now how easy is it to do it joe it's really easy anybody can do it my wife's done it um i've showed her how to do it she can do it uh anyone can do it so let's i'm gonna show you a couple examples of how to get connections off of your main water line here so let's just use this pipe here as an example let's just say that your timer is down here and then your end point is down here so what you're going to want to do is when you have various points where you want to connect off of it they sell this punch tool here it's a really cool tool all you do is basically put a little bit of pressure and you're going to just make a little hole here and then from there they sell these little barb here this is a straight one it has a connection on both ends all you're going to do is basically push that in there and once you hear that popping noise that you know that that's in there and then from there you can connect your four inch spacing emitters if you want but for this example what i'm going to show you is how to make an extension off of this so basically you have your smaller poly tube here and then you can just connect that to here it's really hard sometimes to connect these together so what i like to do is either get a blowtorch here i got this at harbor freight it's pretty inexpensive you just put a butane at the bottom you can also even use a lighter as well basically what you want to do is just heat up this section here a little bit it's a little windy today just a little bit and then from there you're just going to feed that onto your barb there and then it's connected and then at the other end you can connect these little emitters here um these come in a pack a 10 pack here i believe they're i think they're less than two dollars or three dollars something like that um you can find these at home depot or lowe's these put out two gallons per hour i don't get caught up in that too much i just look out at my plants if they need a little bit more water i adjust my timer that way i don't get too caught up in the gallons per hour but basically from here you're going to take your poly tube here and you're going to connect it together and again these poly tubes are a little bit hard to connect so what i like to do is just heat up the end a little bit here once i can get it to go [Applause] and then you can just connect the green end to here and again you can easily cut this tube um what i use to cut this is basically uh this knife here it's used for pecks um again you can find these pretty much at any hardware store as well um so if you have to cut this it's very easy to cut you just clamp that on and it cuts right off and then from there they also sell these adapters as well they sell straight ones they sell the elbows as i have here and all you got to do is basically just feed this on until it gets pretty tight and then you have your connections there another great thing they sell is these little goof plugs so basically what happens is if you make a mistake uh in your main water line here um or if you want to stop uh one of these lines as well which can be cut with a pair of scissors as well what basically what you do is say if i had a hole in my line here and i didn't want that line anymore or that hole there anymore you can just take one of these goof plugs and you can just snap those in there and you're good to go so here's a perfect example here of how to use that extension that i just showed you in your various plants in your yard i have here blueberry bushes we have them along a our fence line here they come from hamilton new jersey a lot of you don't know but hamilton's actually the blueberry capital of the world um there's more blueberry plants there than i've ever seen the blueberries are just the best so we went down there a couple years ago and we picked up some and we put them out in our yard so basically what i did was is i have my half inch line underground here that runs back to my garden bed but what's really great about the half inch line is you can just branch off of that to other various parts of your yard so that's basically what i did here um i have my tubing come out for my half inch with my straight barb connector like i just showed you um and then from there i've run my poly tubing to the drip uh emitter here and then what's really cool is they sell these stakes as well um and you can just connect these to the end here you can just place them to the base of the plant and you can just easily segregate basically what each plant is and you can easily segregate water into each plant so i have them go into each of the blueberry bushes and it's really easy to keep them ordered as well and basically i have that seeing concept along my flower beds as well each of these plants along my flower bed here has that same extension concept as the blueberries do so what's really great is you can keep your rose bushes you can keep any kind of shrub that you have watered and basically i just have that half inch line just keep running along my mulch line there along the edge of my house and i can easily just branch off of there and get each of these plants enough water to last out through the summertime so that's pretty much it today i just wanted to show you the drip irrigation in my yard um like i said i've had this for about three years now i love it it just runs so smoothly we can keep all of our plants nicely water throughout the spring and the summertime our garden loves it it's really easy to do you can probably do it less than a hundred bucks maybe even a less than 50 bucks depending on the size of your garden or your yard i think it's really inexpensive so you don't really have to worry about watering anymore you just set that timer and go if you found this content helpful today make sure you smash that like button it helps out with the channel helps out with the youtube algorithm so other people can find my channel if this is your first time watching the video please consider subscribing to my channel it's an all organic lawn channel i have no herbicides in my lawn that's what i strive for i have kids i don't want any kind of chemical in my lawn so please if you're new please consider subscribing to my channel just a quick note for the products that were used in today's video pretty much everything can be found at home depot or lowe's they pretty much have the same variation of the drip irrigation adapters at either store the only thing i didn't purchase at home depot or those was the brown uh garden adapter um the four inch spacing i couldn't get the four inch spacing at home depot or lowe's so i actually got that off of rain birds website so if you want a four inch spacing please check out the rain bird site i'll leave all the links to the products in the video description below if you have any questions or comments please comment below i will get back to you i tried to go as quickly as possible on the content today so please if you have any questions on what i did or how to do it please comment below and i'll see you in the next one [Music] you",
