  "text": "jeremiah jones pioneer field agronomist kelly robertson granular csa with precision crop services so kelly in your updates you talk about goal so what is go gold g-o-a-l that means get out and look get out of the cab of the tractor the sprayer get out the field look at what your tillage tool is doing look at what your planter is doing look at your seed depth you know all of those things don't rely on all those monitors and fancy gadgets we've got in the cab uh or or looking you know six feet above the ground from a glass bubble thinking you know that everything's okay you need to get out and look it also means get out of the pickup yeah so if you're driving by a field and something doesn't look right stop the pickup literally get out and walk across the field yes so planting depth i know you know everybody's got the old timer pocket knife they pull out and that's how deep they plant or you know the old knuckle method that's how we d deeply plant or we use our digging tool about our planting dev so what else can we do about checking planting down so if you want to look at your your planting depth and you want to look at sidewall compaction or how your row units are doing typically what we use is a is a measuring tool like this and you get out here and you start digging around well when you're doing this you're disturbing a lot of what has happened as a result of the planter or the tillage tool going through the field so you don't get a good idea of that so one of the things we are going to use today is just this leaf blower to just start kind of blowing the loose soil off of where the row unit went so that we can look at the the job the row unit was doing what the closing wheels were doing and how the seeds placed in the seed trench so [Applause] [Applause] so here's an instance where we could see several different things going on in the in the row unit so right here you notice after we blew the the this off that we noticed this line here and that's where his two by two uh nitrogen is going next to the uh next to the row uh here we have the seed trench as you can see so we've got a little bit maybe just a little bit of sidewall compaction but notice it is loose for the most part it didn't blow out with the with the leaf blower but it is loose the other thing that you can notice if you look really closely as you can see where the spike closing wheels have ran down through this unit so overall we've got about a two inch and a half two inch around two inch planting depth um not seeing a whole lot of information here or evidence that shows me that we've got much if any compaction happening but i mean this is a good way to look at what your role units are doing and the conditions that you planted into to determine what kind of compaction you might have that concludes this pioneer agronomy video podcast visit our page on pioneer.com and follow us on twitter and facebook for more agronomy insights",
