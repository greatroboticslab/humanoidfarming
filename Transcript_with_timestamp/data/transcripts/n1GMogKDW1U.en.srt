00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:25,180
away the attention from hi friends it's

15
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:27,939
Jen at sunshine farm I just went outside

16
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:30,459
I visited the animals even though it's

17
00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:33,220
super cold outside it made me feel a lot

18
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:34,510
more at peace and it reminded me why we

19
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:37,150
moved here in the first place

20
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:40,090
so I wanted to tell you the story of how

21
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:43,090
we were able to buy our farm at the ages

22
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:46,239
of 22 and Chris who was 23 at the time

23
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:48,730
we've had so many people come to our

24
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,489
house and think I'm the daughter of

25
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:53,680
somebody who lives here they'll say

26
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:56,530
where are your mom and dad not here very

27
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,209
California I've had somebody say you

28
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,829
look too young to live here I had

29
00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:01,569
someone asked me did you inherit the

30
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:03,909
farm and it's really interesting because

31
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:05,439
I wish they would just ask me how are

32
00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:06,040
you able to buy a farm at such a young

33
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,810
age

34
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,209
because that's a question I can answer

35
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:12,519
so I wanted to answer that for you today

36
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:14,919
just like talking about our debt free

37
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:16,630
journey this is a very personal journey

38
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:19,180
and it's going to look very different

39
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:20,799
depending on your circumstances which we

40
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,780
all have such different circumstances

41
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,030
but I want to encourage you that if you

42
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,889
have a dream that you can try to make it

43
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:29,260
happen and that there are in many ways

44
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:31,539
things you can do now to start preparing

45
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,260
for that dream to become a reality so in

46
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:34,270
2015

47
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:36,400
Chris and I had just gotten married and

48
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:39,430
we purchased a little home in the city

49
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,340
of Rochester the home was really cute it

50
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:44,530
was a perfect size for us had a lot of

51
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:46,750
character but it wasn't a very urban

52
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:48,479
environment so we were very limited in

53
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:51,070
what we could do in terms of

54
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:53,590
homesteading we did start a little 4 by

55
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:56,050
6 raised bed and we grew a couple tomato

56
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:58,240
plants a couple pepper plants and maybe

57
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:59,770
a cucumber plant but I wasn't interested

58
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,300
in gardening at that point the only

59
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:03,550
thing I was really interested in was

60
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,800
having my own horse around that time I

61
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,449
started horseback riding again a local

62
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,699
farm that actually isn't too far from

63
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:11,740
where we are now and I just found that

64
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:15,039
that experience was so peaceful for me

65
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:16,630
and I felt like I found myself when I

66
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,700
was on a horse near a

67
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:20,920
so we had only been in our house for

68
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,960
about eight or nine months when we

69
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,490
started talking about the possibility of

70
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,620
moving to a farm I have been

71
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:29,320
experiencing some weird health issues

72
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:31,600
that caused a lot of digestive problems

73
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:34,600
nerve issues and muscle aches and pains

74
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:37,120
headaches and just general depression

75
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,010
and anxiety about what was going on with

76
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,860
my body I started learning that the only

77
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:44,320
way in my body was responding to healing

78
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:46,690
was through my diet and through adopting

79
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,300
a really heavy plant-based diet with a

80
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:52,000
lot of natural foods fresh foods and

81
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:54,520
really avoiding things like oils alcohol

82
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,040
high levels of sugars and the biggest

83
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,870
trigger for me I found out was bread I

84
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,930
learned at that time that I actually

85
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:04,450
have an intolerance to bread and wheat

86
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:06,700
products so I unfortunately have to

87
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:08,560
adopt a gluten-free diet as I was

88
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:11,440
experiencing a lot of health issues I

89
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,300
thought what are we waiting for life is

90
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,610
so short I could have been diagnosed

91
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,470
with something much more serious and I

92
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:20,290
don't want to waste another minute

93
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:21,910
dreaming instead of trying to find a way

94
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:24,730
to make our dreams a reality

95
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:26,830
I felt like we could do it now the

96
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:28,360
reason I thought it was a possibility is

97
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:30,490
because when we bought our first little

98
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,770
house in the city we actually only knew

99
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:34,960
that Chris would be working at the time

100
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:37,090
he had a job lined up I wasn't sure what

101
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,040
I was going to do next so we knew we

102
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:40,750
could afford that little house on one

103
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,560
income once I started working a

104
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,760
full-time job

105
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,830
even though I wasn't making a lot of

106
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:47,470
money we were able to save almost my

107
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:49,330
entire salary and put that towards what

108
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:51,520
we used as a down payment and closing

109
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:53,110
costs for our farm while we didn't get

110
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,610
anything really back from our small

111
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:56,230
house in the city just because we only

112
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:58,690
lived there for a short period of time

113
00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:00,910
we were able to save really well because

114
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:03,010
we were only living according to that

115
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:06,010
one income that we had planned for so as

116
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:08,470
our income grew and the money coming in

117
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:10,660
grew we didn't up our cost of living we

118
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:12,190
kept it the same and even we're tight in

119
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:15,370
many instances so that we could save

120
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:18,340
really well for this firm now I know a

121
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:20,500
lot of people our age will spend their

122
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:23,080
extra income on things like travel and

123
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:25,360
going out to eat but I've always been a

124
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,340
very frugal person I don't like to spend

125
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,759
money and I really wanted my dream to

126
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:32,309
come true so I was very determined

127
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,650
to save well to save hard to make it

128
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:36,479
possible now we were able to do this

129
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:39,150
because we lived in a house where the

130
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,979
mortgage and taxes was under $800 a

131
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:42,960
month it was pretty low cost of living

132
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:44,819
where we were because of that low cost

133
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,800
of living and that unexpected extra

134
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:49,020
income that allowed us to save a lot

135
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,610
really in a short period of time to be

136
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,559
able to move where we are now where we

137
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:53,879
are now is more than double what we were

138
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:55,889
paying when we are in that little house

139
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:57,870
in the city it's a lot more expensive

140
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:59,849
we're able to live out our dream here

141
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:02,460
and to us it's worth it and over time

142
00:07:59,849 --> 00:08:05,099
through our debt free journey and as our

143
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:06,689
incomes grow we will do the same thing

144
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:08,969
we did when we lived in our previous

145
00:08:06,689 --> 00:08:10,439
home and we'll keep our expenses as

146
00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:13,349
close as possible to what they are now

147
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:15,389
and even lower them where we can so that

148
00:08:13,349 --> 00:08:17,729
way we can pay off more of our debt

149
00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:19,770
quicker and and be able to experience

150
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:22,139
that financial freedom it wasn't just

151
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:24,149
saving for a year to move here there's

152
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:26,009
that whole history of what allowed us to

153
00:08:24,149 --> 00:08:27,240
be able to buy our first home right

154
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:29,339
after we got married in the first place

155
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,379
I've actually saved my entire time

156
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:34,260
through college and even some of my high

157
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:36,269
school graduation money to be able to do

158
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,800
something with the money I didn't really

159
00:08:36,269 --> 00:08:40,500
know what I was going to use it for but

160
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,630
I I kept saving it wasn't until we got

161
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,219
engaged and Chris and I were looking at

162
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:46,649
rental properties that we just decided

163
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:47,190
hey why can't we just buy a house why

164
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:49,350
not

165
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,910
we haven't old kind of this is what your

166
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:52,589
life should look like you should rent an

167
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:55,079
apartment you should save you should buy

168
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:57,600
a house in a starter neighborhood I just

169
00:08:55,079 --> 00:08:59,940
didn't like that idea I don't like

170
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,920
living according to an expectation just

171
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,079
because it's an expectation for me if

172
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,060
something's possible and it's what we

173
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:06,990
want I'd like to try to find a way to

174
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,790
make it happen

175
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:10,889
at first my told Chris I wanted to move

176
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:12,779
to a farm he was very skeptical he did

177
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:14,699
not think we could afford it and he was

178
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:16,470
concerned that I was dreaming a little

179
00:09:14,699 --> 00:09:19,500
too big a little too soon and that's

180
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:22,079
fair but he let me dream and eventually

181
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:24,269
my dream became his dream and he was

182
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:26,130
willing to look a big reason we were

183
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:28,260
able to buy this property it dropped

184
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:29,850
down in price significantly before we

185
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:32,100
even looked at it so we knew it was in

186
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:33,329
our price range and then the second

187
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,310
thing was the sellers were willing to

188
00:09:33,329 --> 00:09:37,740
contribute to the closing costs which

189
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:39,449
they call seller concessions we had more

190
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:42,440
flexibility in what we could put down

191
00:09:39,449 --> 00:09:44,300
and that enabled us to have some will

192
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,639
for an emergency fund so we weren't

193
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:49,430
completely housebroke I will say we did

194
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:51,319
not put a lot down we only put 5% down

195
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:54,620
on this house which is what allowed us

196
00:09:51,319 --> 00:09:55,970
to buy this farm I'm in our early 20s it

197
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,440
takes a long time to save a good amount

198
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,540
of money and while we could have lived

199
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,360
in the city for a few more years and

200
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:05,750
saved better I just felt like I didn't

201
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:08,660
want to spend my years waiting for a

202
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:11,360
dream to become realized we decided that

203
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:13,040
we could financially do it and it meant

204
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,779
we didn't have as much equity in our

205
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,120
home right away but it was worth it to

206
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:18,949
us to be able to start this dream early

207
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,750
on what this means for us is that we

208
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:23,660
don't have the flexibility to leave our

209
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:25,550
jobs our cost of living with this farm

210
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:28,939
is more expensive than we're able to

211
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:30,860
take on with one income but we love love

212
00:10:28,939 --> 00:10:33,470
it here and we both enjoy our jobs

213
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:36,139
somebody asked me how we learn to save

214
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:39,230
well and my biggest tip would be just to

215
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:41,360
really cut any extra expenses as you can

216
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:42,980
and the second thing would be as your

217
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,959
income increases keep your cost of

218
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:47,300
living the same so that you can save

219
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,220
anything extra that's coming in and then

220
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:52,100
you'll end up with a lot more than you

221
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:54,069
expected someone also asked what we do

222
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:57,050
for a living that allows us to do this

223
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:59,839
Chris is an energy engineer I work at a

224
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:02,689
local university where I do project

225
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:05,209
coordination both of our jobs are not

226
00:11:02,689 --> 00:11:06,980
high high earning positions we're not

227
00:11:05,209 --> 00:11:10,130
you know taking in a ton of money each

228
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:12,589
month but we do have stable careers that

229
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:15,019
we were able to get into because we went

230
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:17,000
to four-year undergraduate institutions

231
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:19,189
there are three more questions I wanted

232
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,319
to answer in this video that my

233
00:11:19,189 --> 00:11:23,329
Instagram followers sent me the first

234
00:11:21,319 --> 00:11:25,910
one someone asked what our first project

235
00:11:23,329 --> 00:11:28,279
was here at the farm and that was adding

236
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:30,709
chickens we bought a chicken coop and

237
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:32,839
Chris built a chicken run and we added

238
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:36,319
the chickens about at the same time we

239
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:38,240
did add our miniature horse Justin and a

240
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:40,129
couple months later we added TJ our

241
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,769
Paint Horse I talked about this more in

242
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:44,720
the video titled two years the farm and

243
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:46,339
I will link this at the end another

244
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,620
question someone asked is how much space

245
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:52,040
we actually have we have 12 and a half

246
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:55,189
acres here about six to seven acres our

247
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:56,240
pasture a few acres our woods and then

248
00:11:55,189 --> 00:11:57,709
the rest is like

249
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,649
front yard side yard and things like

250
00:11:57,709 --> 00:12:03,140
that someone else asked if we make sell

251
00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:05,690
stuff or find another way to bring an

252
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:07,910
income for a farm no not at the moment

253
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:10,580
and we're not making anything from the

254
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:13,370
farm other than maybe four dollars here

255
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:15,560
and there for free-range organic eggs

256
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:17,690
but that's obviously not going to make a

257
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,490
dent in the mortgage all of our income

258
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:22,850
right now is coming from our two

259
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:25,220
full-time jobs we do have Airbnb in our

260
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:28,040
guest bedroom where we rent out our room

261
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:30,830
and a bathroom which is right near the

262
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,720
room on the weekends this is more

263
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:34,100
popular in the summertime but I'm

264
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,839
actually going to be having a

265
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:38,959
photographer renting out the space this

266
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,730
weekend so that brings in just a little

267
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,010
over a hundred dollars every weekend

268
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:45,830
that somebody rents it although we don't

269
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:48,980
have it 50 weekend's out of the year we

270
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:51,350
probably only have like 10 to 15 each

271
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:54,860
year and you do have to take into

272
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:56,690
account the cost of cleaning and we feed

273
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:58,399
them breakfast so there are some other

274
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:00,230
factors that go in there in that

275
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,060
equation as well we do possibly have

276
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:04,130
dreams of finding an old Airstream

277
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:05,870
trailer renovate evading it and renting

278
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:08,149
that out full-time I'm here on the

279
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:10,130
property maybe building a cabin or doing

280
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:12,500
something like that but those are lofty

281
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:13,940
dreams and not in the media future

282
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,880
another thing we took into consideration

283
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:18,740
when buying a farm property was we

284
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,899
didn't need a huge house our house is

285
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,310
only 1700s square feet we weren't

286
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:24,980
looking for something huge and that will

287
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:27,380
really change what you can afford on top

288
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:29,089
of that we were lucky with the timing of

289
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,709
the market and what was available in

290
00:13:29,089 --> 00:13:32,779
this place had dropped significantly in

291
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:35,000
price and so we did get a little bit

292
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:37,279
lucky the house also hasn't been fully

293
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,750
remodeled or anything like that we were

294
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,240
willing to put some sweat equity into

295
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:43,220
the home and make things our own we

296
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,290
actually preferred that and that also

297
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:48,770
allowed us to be able to buy this place

298
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:50,630
my husband just got home what contribute

299
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:52,940
to the conversation I'll ask you some

300
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:54,560
questions and see what he has to say so

301
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,930
that's the story of how we were able to

302
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,160
buy our farm in our early 20s and I hope

303
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:00,050
that can be helpful to you if you're

304
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,390
dreaming of buying a farm and you're

305
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:04,010
thinking it's so far off the future you

306
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,490
can't even imagine being able to do it

307
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,140
soon

308
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:08,720
I do realize there are some situations

309
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:09,920
in both of our lives that have given us

310
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,720
a step-up tour

311
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,509
making this dream come true and I don't

312
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,040
want to ignore those but we also did

313
00:14:14,509 --> 00:14:17,839
have to make a lot of steps towards that

314
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,819
on our own and those things are what

315
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,189
allowed us to pursue this dream and also

316
00:14:19,819 --> 00:14:24,619
just being able to sacrifice other

317
00:14:22,189 --> 00:14:26,989
things like travel going out to eat a

318
00:14:24,619 --> 00:14:29,209
lot or fancy clothing we do make those

319
00:14:26,989 --> 00:14:31,160
sacrifices so we can live this farm life

320
00:14:29,209 --> 00:14:32,710
that I've always wanted and that Chris

321
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:49,970
now really enjoys

322
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:52,440
[Music]

323
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:54,240
what did you think when I first told you

324
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:59,430
I wanted to look at farm properties

325
00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:02,160
I was definitely confused and hesitant I

326
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:04,200
think the confusion was because we had

327
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,210
only been in our previous house for

328
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,890
about a year and a half and then the

329
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:11,400
hesitation is just my own natural

330
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:12,930
reaction to any big idea or change it

331
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,570
takes me a long time to come around do

332
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:18,090
those things and to fully evaluate them

333
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:20,310
and be comfortable with them so anytime

334
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:22,320
I hear a big idea or a piece of news

335
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:25,230
it's always throws me off a little bit

336
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:28,710
how has this experience of living on a

337
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:31,950
homestead made you more willing to live

338
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:35,660
against the grain I think the wealth of

339
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:38,460
opportunities and new things that we are

340
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:40,860
somewhat forced to try but somewhat also

341
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:42,450
we just want to try it out here that's

342
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:44,610
kind of reshaped my worldview a little

343
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:48,030
bit I think the so I think getting used

344
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:49,710
to trying new things continuously it

345
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:52,560
grows my comfort zone I don't know if I

346
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:54,630
can point exactly to how things that my

347
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,390
environment has changed but I know

348
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:59,580
through this experience I have been much

349
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:02,610
more willing to embrace adventures and

350
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:04,470
great new experiences new projects I

351
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:07,230
think is a confidence within me that's

352
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:09,660
grown exponentially then from what it

353
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:11,910
was previously that's kind of come that

354
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:14,430
comes about in my confidence in my

355
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:16,500
abilities to do the projects that we

356
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:18,630
need together on the farm to build the

357
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:21,150
structures and shelters to do the

358
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:24,330
renovations in the house to take care of

359
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:26,160
the animals and to venture out and get

360
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:27,780
new animals we have a head before I'd

361
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,670
say that my confidence is probably just

362
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:31,470
growing a lot in the past two years that

363
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:34,020
we lived here what are three things that

364
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:37,800
helped us be able to purchase a farm in

365
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:40,800
early 20s I think willingness to both

366
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:43,050
the norm you saw that from the very

367
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:46,260
beginning when we got married right out

368
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:48,060
of college we also looked to purchase a

369
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:51,300
house right away so I think we kind of

370
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:54,390
have that mindset engrained into who we

371
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:56,490
are and who we are as a couple and I

372
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:58,650
think that was probably the biggest

373
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:02,529
instigator to allowing us to make this

374
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:04,629
jump I think really excuse me next day

375
00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:07,629
so by the second thing that helped us

376
00:17:04,629 --> 00:17:10,539
out the most was being able to save a

377
00:17:07,629 --> 00:17:12,819
lot when the first Hospital inning in so

378
00:17:10,539 --> 00:17:15,100
the first place we purchased it was not

379
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:17,439
a very expensive house at least compared

380
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:19,360
to you know the general market with

381
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,699
across the country that allowed us to

382
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,769
really save up a lot of our income and

383
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:24,610
that just the short span over there a

384
00:17:23,769 --> 00:17:25,899
year and a half

385
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:28,240
save up a lot of the income that both

386
00:17:25,899 --> 00:17:30,129
Jen and I were earning at the time and I

387
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,929
don't know if we had a really clear goal

388
00:17:30,129 --> 00:17:33,820
or plan and how we were doing that it

389
00:17:31,929 --> 00:17:35,259
was just somewhat arbitrary and we knew

390
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,940
that we were bringing in more than we

391
00:17:35,259 --> 00:17:37,960
actually needed to spend and so we were

392
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:40,059
able to put a lot of it under the

393
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,620
savings account and so as a result of

394
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:44,740
that we were able to take that savings

395
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:46,480
and jump into a new farm purchase just

396
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:48,970
about a year after we got married and

397
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,820
purchased the first house what is your

398
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:53,620
favorite part about living on a farm my

399
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:56,230
favorite part is the freedom that it

400
00:17:53,620 --> 00:18:00,460
brings about the freedom to make

401
00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:04,450
decisions to try new things to embrace

402
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:06,850
what you want and to the freedom to buck

403
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:09,220
the trends above the norms that society

404
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:11,889
and our culture really tries to put on

405
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:13,299
us and enforce us think the farm in that

406
00:18:11,889 --> 00:18:15,279
freedom it gives us a lot of flexibility

407
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:17,080
and it allows us to explore a lot of

408
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:19,899
things and there's something about that

409
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,580
freedom that I think opens up our our

410
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:24,119
lifestyle opens up our enjoyment of our

411
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:27,129
lives just increases our satisfaction of

412
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:29,840
our lives and of our marriage and the

413
00:18:27,129 --> 00:18:38,090
future as well raising kids

414
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:39,190
I have a t-shirt on - who inspired so

415
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:43,790

419
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,030
sorry the billeting got so crummy and

420
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:04,190
now it's like all yellow we'll work on

421
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:07,130
that but the last thing I wanted to say

422
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:10,310
is that neither Chris nor I had any

423
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:11,960
experience of farming going into this we

424
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:14,960
had never had chickens we didn't have

425
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:16,760
families that had farms I had ridden

426
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,620
horses but I'd never owned a horse and

427
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,750
cared for a horse we had never had goats

428
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:23,840
we didn't have a lot of experience

429
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:26,390
working with a barn or really any big

430
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,400
