  "text": "today's event is a joint effort of the South Dakota know until Association the Mitchell NRCS off field office SDSU Extension and NRCS and one of the first things I'd like to do is thank all our sponsors that helped us put together provide input and money for today's event and I'll just read through the list South Dakota wheat commission Farm Credit Services of America wheat growers Mustang Steve Monsanto Fergus Dane seeds next level an LLC Milbourne seeds lacrosse seeds Dakota best see a dramedy plus farmers Alliance Mitchell first Kona National Bank CMV operations and Davis of councilman Scott supply crop tech Ducks Unlimited Aurora County Conservation District Davidson County Conservation District Hansa County Conservation District South Dakota Hotel Association SDSU Extension USDA and NRCS and pioneer hi-bred to DuPont so let's give them all welcome so Ruth said you've got just a little bit of time to talk about a lot a lot of things we're gonna hit a few things real lightly today Dakota Lakes research farmers you probably know should know by now is located east appear along Missouri River we have both irrigated and dryland stuff I went back through all the talks that I've done over the years here and and kind of looked at those and and I summarized those real neatly if you're in this part of the world you want to take the eeet eeet is of Apple transpiration you want all the water to go through plants and and there's every one of the speakers so far today has talked about the idea is to get plants growing roots in the ground those kind of things we want to match my snow catch that's one of the things we want to do we want to get some vertical architecture up there you got to decide which information sources you can trust there's a lot of people try to tell you a lot of things especially when it comes to cover crops and stuff some of them don't really know what they're talking about so decide which one of those that you can trust and this are listening to them address the problem stead of treating the symptom you know we we talked about water hemp John bee I'd just shortly go or the reason they got a hot water hemp in the eastern part of the United States they don't have enough diversity and they don't have enough cover and whatever so they have water hemp they have resistant weeds let's go back and fix it I always like to pick on NRCS because they had you guys building a lot of terraces terraces don't make the water go in the ground so that water infiltration kit that they're handing out here that would have told you water doesn't go in the ground just putting a ditch up there to keep from running out of the field doesn't really make the crop grow better ideas make the water go in the ground and no-till does that cover crops can help us do that to a certain extent mother nature's an opportunist if you have a problem you've created the opportunity so if you've got a weed or disease or an insect or anything happening someplace in the way you designed your system you've created that opportunity because Mother Nature will come in and and fill that in I see Darrell's here so Darrell Dennehy is sitting back there but years and years ago we were when they first came out with at that kind of time they called it Emmy corn pursuit tolerant corn and I had a young producer in Sioux Falls tell me don't have to worry about crop rotation because I got pursuit corn and pursuit beans and I can just use pursuit and I won't have any reason any any problems and I said well you're gonna have resistant weeds in Cyanamid at the time took umbrage with me saying that because there was no proof that there was going to be resistant weeds I think also said they'd be cross resistance other ALS herbicides and they wanted to retraction and all we did is Leon and Darryl come out and put in a trial for me and I went up to my neighbors and found some I don't know if you knew I went and done that found some found some glean tolerant kocha weeds and shook it around overtop of that trial and voila we had our proof stripes Bruce a crop which is healthy not a crop that does not get sick so remember that too we we spent a lot of time trying to treat things that are getting sick land we should really just be trying to make sure we we keep it healthy so that really takes a whole system and you guys have all seen that if you can oh and the only one thing about a soil what parameter would you want to know and J furie hit this a bit today I'm going to hit it harder within all textural groups as organic matter increased from one to three percent available water holding capacity doubled on organic matter content increase to four percent have been accounted for more than 60% of available water holding capacity in the Red River Valley they have salinity and water logging problems because their water doesn't hold as much soil doesn't hold as much water as it should we have the same problem here our soils no longer hold as much water they used to hold this much water now they'll hold this much water so when we get a little bit of rain they're waterlogged then we get saline seats will get waterlogging whatever if we had deeper soils in terms of water holding capacity then we could hold more water we wouldn't get wet waterlogged early we wouldn't get dry late and we wouldn't have as much problem with salinity when organic matter contents increased four percent and then accounted for more than 60% of the available water holding capacity when soil water storage capacity is low much of the rain that falls during extended periods of precipitation is lost in contrast highest water storage capacity combined with effective capture of rain by making the water go on the ground and snowmelt over the fall winter and spring can support a crop to extend the dry periods and what we're trying to do with cover crops and they don't have as big a fit here as they do in Illinois where they have in Indiana where they have longer growing seasons and more rain but we have opportunities here what we're trying to do is take these cool periods of these of the year or these odd periods of the year and build organic matter and suppress weeds and do some of those things and and we only do that when we have the opportunity short term studies are not accurate and evaluating treatments I was impressed that John was showing us 20-some years of treatments that's very very rare anymore and we do that at Dakota lakes but not very many people do that a farmer manages ecosystems you take sunlight water and carbon dioxide and make them into products to be sold that's your business you're capturing sunlight and if you're only growing corn and soybeans you're capturing just a very small percentage of the sunlight every year let's capture more sunlight because what the energy from the sunlight that goes into the soil or whatever that's the stuff that drives that whole ecosystem crop rotations allow for time for natural enemies to destroy the pathogen the one crop well unrelated crops are growing and we spend our whole career working on crop rotation proper intensity adequate diversity and then we're stable in proper intensity is is matching that natural water cycle native vegetation is the best way to tell what you can do as I travel around the world the first thing I do is look at the native vegetation and Jake can tell you that that's one of the things he does too right you look at the native vegetation that integrates the soil characteristics the climate including rainfall and temperatures and those kind of things that integrates them all into one package people weigh how much rainfall you get it's air out it's relative Amarillo Texas Pierre South Dakota and Brandon Manitoba get exactly the same rainfall Amarillo Texas is a desert Pierre South Dakota is a Prairie Brandon Manitoba is what they call a parkland which is trees and tall grass prairie same amount of rainfall different temperatures different amounts of heat organic matter is important when we take off stuff somebody start talking about hey today and that was about ready to go crazy in the back of the room if you take off a 75 bushel a cur wheat crop or half of a 150 bushel acre corn crop you take off 100 pounds again I mean 50 pounds and five pounds of P 100 pounds of K and three thousand pounds of carbon your mining one unit train of soybeans these nice circle tracts 110 cars one unit training the soybeans has four hundred thousand pounds of phosphorus if we keep shipping that stuff out we're mining because the Chinese aren't sending it back okay so in what happened do we do that for a hundred years we won't have any soils left and JRE told you and they don't have any soils left in the Red River Valley so they're putting in drain tile to get rid of that excess water so we can get Lake Winnipeg and screw-up Lake Winnipeg right matching water used to the climate and soils is imperative okay matching water use to what you have most of the plant growth problems blamed with no tillers other than adequate diversity and proper intensity or errors in technique no reason for errors in technique anymore we've got good equipment so let's get our diversity intensity rate in you an environment Sawgrass Prairie or wetter the goal should be to have something growing at all times that's this area in East should have something growing at all times that's going to require the use of cover crops or forage double crops because you can't really do two grain crops in a year there's not enough time okay subhuman semi-arid Pierre South Dakota arid environments cover crops can be utilized to increase organic matter and biological activity we're going to use them less frequently because we don't have the moisture cover crops are like tillage in wet environments more and longer covered forage periods are needed in drier environments residue loss can be an issue if the wrong species are chosen lots of emphasis on some people using radishes turnips and and and rapeseed and those kind of things those are brassicas they get rid of residue you're going to be to bear to fast as you get drier you got to really limit how many of those you put in there okay number one decide what you want to do before trying to choose a cover crop John said this you know he said it several times guy right for me I wanted I want to tell you that John Pike seed company that family seed company went away the back seed company he mentioned is still there no damn relatives of mine mine all got hung for horse Steven but I thought I should throw that in there think of your cover crop of just another component of your rotation it's not separate you got to know what you're gonna do right using a mixture of cover crops allows meeting several goals simultaneously mixers add more diversity grow at different times better compete with weeds optimize nutrient cycling etc but be careful not to bridge diseases or insects choose your mix carefully got a call from a major cover crop seed suppliers and one of my growers said that his soybeans behind cover crop did not yield as good as his soybeans where he didn't have a cover crop because he had fight tatra I said what did you have in the cover crop map so who have just our normal 12 Way mix as well give me here's a list soybeans we're in that list ah don't do that but now in the old days the Jim River Valley here in north when when guys were gonna grow soybeans for the first time 25 30 years ago 25 years ago or more I'd say okay go after wheat and plant some soybeans as a cover crop after the wheat before you put the soybeans in the next spring because you need to prime that right so be a pump get some rhizobian ocula out there otherwise you'll never be as good that's first time don't do that again for again okay so think about what you're trying to do creating conditions beneficial for the next crop is one of the goals water and nutrient management another primary goal water use by a cover crop during the nine crop period can often be regained during the growing season because of better infiltration reduce runoff improve water relations more cover more cover if you do it right remember I talked about the brass here's the thing that Jason Miller and I did I had a this is back in 2008 I had a winter wheat cornfield P rotation there's a wheat stubble no cover crop this is on the 9th of July we still had this total cover to stop the e from the soil back up back up here's right next to it we had a rotation had actually more cover spring lee winter wheat corn but we put a Braska cover crop in there it's almost bare I think it was about 20 bushel difference because we lost the residue ok understand your rainfall patterns for your area and the water holding capacity of your soils in order to plan how you're going to do this and use web soil survey here's one of my soils we farmed some West River stuff we got Jim Finley used to be one of my board guys he can tell you about that we if I take a web soil survey there is my north unit ok this is five miles north of the farm this is a promised soil in opal soil the glacier went around here this is the old ocean bottom this is a West River pure shale derived soil that field right here is Jimmy corals bucking horse pasture you really never have lived until you have a rodeo contractor as a neighbor ok comes Cadillac windows down goes see any horses yep how many about 120 how long ago Oh about an hour-and-a-half hmm weird to go that way Thanks so what this means is this you can get all kinds of stuff off web soil survey and if you don't know how to use that you need to get it and get an app on your phone I can tell you what's oil used to be here before they built a building talk to your NRCS people what this says is this somewhere between five no three and six and a half inches of total available water on this spot that heavy soil does not hold very much available water I manage that soil is very heavy clay I manage that much different than I do my main farm here's a little gate glacial tongue that comes out there okay that one holds about seven inches okay these opals up in here hold less than three because they're only about this deep to shave here's the main farm here's my good Lowery's right those are more like you guys have you can see I got some of the red ones and those and whatever but these will hold about ten inches a lot I managed that differently than something that holds five so once I know how much my bucket holds then I go get my rainfall this is Mitchell and I've got a I've got a I've got an Excel spreadsheet that'll do this for you got every rainfall from every station in the state of South Dakota and you can do this type of thing for you so I start from October to October and you'll precip Mitchell twenty two point zero six or eight six this is from a few years ago so now everybody's going well we get more rainfall now okay well that's fine so we're going to look at what happens when you didn't get as much rainfall take the out of thee T from July to June from when you would harvest wheat until you would need water for your core corn defusing water before June you get nineteen point three four inches of rain how much is the soil hold seven ten maybe twelve if it was totally dry when you harvested the wheat which it normally isn't totally dried to four feet when you harvested the wheat you hold ten or twelve you got trying to put 19 inches of water in there and guys say I don't want a no-till hit too damn wet in the spring what a wonderful problem to have if you live in South Dakota hey come on so let's turn that into an opportunity and that's where you have a chance to do something if you go wheat to sunflowers it's 22 inches but that's the type of you plant peas and grow wheat that yeah at 22 inches if I'm backing up one if you get half a normal which we seldom do it's still 9 inches almost 10 inches if you get half a normal and you keep taking the EIT 80 and have it done tillage and you make the water go in the ground and do all those things you're supposed to do you're going to fill a soil up at half of normal so you're always going to be too wet okay that's why you grow good weed after peas okay and from October to June 1st of October 1st of June from corn to sunflowers 12.1 you're still going to fill the soil up if you've got good cover take the out eet that kind of stuff right so 1/2 a normal six point zero six when we first told guys at Gettysburg and Pierre they should put their sunflowers into corn they thought it was stark raving mad now if you drive from Blount to Gettysburg they're all got their sunflowers in the corn because you got to do the numbers July to November this is your opportunity fall cover crop July to November 8.34 that other one was 19 if you use that 8 you're still going to have enough to fill that soil by the time corn needs it if you're doing all the things we talked about and you keep the cover and you do that kind of stuff right even in half a normal yet four that's enough you can use that you'll see you're going to have enough to get your corn started the next year July to September when you harvest your wheat to when you appease it to where you do winter wheat there's not enough time there not enough water to try to do a cover crop on dry land we will do this with irrigation the old long fallow you guys all look at me I grew up 60 miles from here we did long fallow on a half section of ground because the landlord wanted that wheat Milo long fallow we had saline seeps god-awful mess in there and I had no idea when I got older and got a little more educated I goat cheese thought it's stupid damn thing to do right now they farm it the way they should and they don't have the Saline seat problem cover crop seeds need to be in expensive in terms of cost per acre small seeds means less volume you know we we look on our shed but be careful to not do peas as cover crops of you doing peas someplace in the rotation you'd like to have about a six year break between pea crops to not get root diseases or lentils some of these crops you've got to be careful with small seeds grow better on the surface and larger seeds large seeds emerge better through a matter residue mixing large and small seeds in the same trench helps the large seeds help the small seeds emerge better they kind of break the path using harrows to improve the stand of surface pride cast seed improves the stand of weeds as well and it makes your residue go away right not not one of the things you like to do one important goal is to use it the cover crop to balance the diet of the soil organisms run elverson was asking some questions before about how do I you know shouldn't I add more carbon and whatever and I'm sitting back there with him saying well Ron maybe that's put some cover crops in and up up your nitrogen and carbon but have a higher proportion and if you want to get more in in the system to balance your high carbon so that's kind of what you do with that thing it's kind of like feeding cows is you want you don't feed a cow straight straw she needs to have some protein the trouble with feeding the cows straight straw it's you just can't eat enough of it because you can't digest it hey it's not good food for so you got to give her a little protein and then that makes it good food so that's thing managing cover crops is more of an art than a science at this point if anybody tells you they know how to do it they're a liar I mean it's just really more of an art if at least some component of a rotation to not feeling excessively dry year John was talking about 2012 if you didn't fail in 2012 with some of your components we harvested really good winter wheat in 2012 but the corn sucked okay but if some of those components don't fail then you don't have enough intensity nobody everybody wants to have a rotation that doesn't fail when it's dry but if you don't fail when it's really dry like that you haven't taken full advantage of a normal year and you will fail badly in wet years and this is what's happened to a lot of people they've been overly cautious and then they failed because it's too wet if you look at a guy that still does wheat summer fallows in Montana couple weeks ago they still do we thumb fallow there for hey boo do ya pH is a five because they're leaching all the lime out the limes at 3 foot and then they're telling put lime on the top because they put all their lying down below I mean like get some roots out there bring the stuff from pool back to the surface we're blonde but I just said to them guys 9 years out of town you fail because you followed that ground and you could have done something with it you've failed 9 years out of 10 when gets Homer fella so take about water cycle energy flow mineral cycle community dynamics ok mineral cycler the nutrients available for plant use or have they been leached eroded or transported from the landscape ecosystems the leak nutrients become deserts one of those nutrients is carbon k talked about losing carbon gaining carbon losing carbon gaining carbon if we keep losing carbon we're going to turn into a desert as these e good good students saline seeps indicate leakage decreasing pH indicates leaking one unit rain soybeans almost half a million pounds so saline seep brain here goes here we've got to get this cycle fix here truly a water cycling issue I call this catch and release nutrients what's in the saline sea salt I used to teach chemistry there's lots of salts right every to take an acid the base to make a salt so salt isn't an answer number one thing that's in the saline seep is nitrate that's fertilizer number two thing that's in there's calcium sulfate that's gypsum that's a fertilizer number three thing that's in there is calcium carbonate that's lime that's a fertilizer so when I asked you that question you're supposed to say fertilizer okay so all the kids from SCSU and all the kids from water tell them to come and visit I got two instructors trained then I asked those kids that class and they'll go because if they don't say that then I yell at the instructor if you get stranded in the rain the back forty drive home across the tilled field or the pastor pastor people say oh I get you know by no-till is too wet and I get stuck it's not no tills fault you haven't got the soil structure there yet and you haven't got your water cycle fixed organic matter makes a difference we've been running some rotations that read at Pier 4 since 1990 here's some winter wheat 2006 it doesn't look very good right across the road it looks like this what's the difference well if I look at those two fields this is a good one this is a bad one both of them are winter wheat that followed peas that followed corn this rotation is identical except I've got an extra soybean in there soybeans are low and carbon peas are low in carbon wheat and corn or high in carbon so one of those I got two-thirds high carbon one third low and the other ones half-and-half corn soybeans half-and-half you don't have enough carbon unless you add some carbons from other place so what's that mean for yields with seven point nine inches of rain or total coal preset between when the peas harvested and the wheat was harvested and seven point nine inches in 2006 sixty versus twenty nine twenty three point seven in 2005 92 versus fifty-seven six point four and two two thousand two fifty six verses twenty eight organic matter makes a difference but you kind of had to be there for a few years and we John showed that - hey takes a little while to restore those soils because they've been degraded it wasn't our fault but we're fixing them if you if you get a chance watch the Cronin farms video Leopold video mics as well grandpa broke this land and my dad mind the land and it's up to Monty and I fix it right okay that's it's up to us to fix it this year okay here's that two-thirds high residue ninety-five bushel thirteen four here's that half eighty here's another half with Cara nada instead of piece sixty here's where I got even higher carbon count content ninety-five and eighty-seven organic matter makes a difference alternate year week this is old data from 1990s every other year wheat half high residue half low residue forty six bushel two years high and one year at old fifty-three here I got two years a wheat one your corn forty eight four but that's organic matter makes a difference here's what it cost me in 1990s to grow this here's a fallow thing wheat corn fallow wheat corn P it cost me four sixty that would do weak fallow 379 two wheat corn fallow to forty five to do wheat corn P people used to ask me do you make any money on them dang peez and I said don't make me to make money on peas I just have to lose less money than it cost me to summer fell hey I used to love doing that to people we ran that study out in Lyman County for twelve years and in the thirteenth year I put the whole thing in the spring wheat and I've shown a lot of over the years showing a lot of weed things from there I've never shown you this yield 2002 really dry year right where we where we did week can all this all went to spring wheat so where we done wheat canola for twelve years and then planted spring wheat there fifteen point four where did wheat fallow we got twenty point seven that was on fallow ground we're just doing the measured the ones were wheat would have normally gone wheat corn fallow 23-7 wheat corn pea 25/8 the interesting thing there this is a really dry year why is this wheat better than this week organic matter 12 years of organic matter we had that one year when we were producing at least peas instead of a zero it's an organic matter thing who says going to talk about grazing I took this picture at Lloydminster Saskatchewan how many people have been to Lloydminster less people in the bend of Chicago even John we really don't know where the hell anything is in Illinois Indiana it's just over east right we don't have a clue or any of them things are but you talk about these towns there we don't know where they're at that Lloydminster sits right on the border of alberta and saskatchewan east of edmonton which is about five or six or seven hours north of the border long ways north grow a lot of corn there and they graze it in the wintertime so I took this like in January there's a cow there in case you guys really can't see there's a cow hiding and this guy's over here can't see it that cows hard to see that's one of the best things you can do is in Canada is they can't really grow corn for corn but they can grow it as a grazer and they had to do a lot of grazing because of BSE mad cow and I don't know how many years ago it was maybe ten years ago I didn't meet a whole swing up through northern Canada or north central Canada Saskatchewan Alberta and I'm listening to the radio and old cow was worth seven cents or eight cents a pound because you couldn't do anything with them other than make them into dog food they had to take a bunch of money out of their cow raising system and they did it by quittin hey you know quitting doing hauling stuff and feeding the college they put him put them out these are Canadian cows okay and I'm going to give you a link later on but if you miss it just google Alberta swath grazing Alberta Bale grazing and get all these videos and these guys talk about how they do their different different things it's really interesting why are we doing this and Jay talked about a little bit in so did Lance and dry or brittle environments and soil biology slows during times of low soil moisture that would be western central and western South Dakota the rumen of grazing animals remains moist continuing the biological process when it normally would stop similarly in cold climates soil biology slows during times of low soil temperatures and Lance brought that up talked about the tundra that you realize the tundra is a hundred miles north of here right Bruce grew up in Winnipeg which is several hundred miles north in here and I didn't see any Tundra still looking for the polar bears when we go up to visit the family but the rumen of grazing animals remains warm during these times so that's why this winter grazing thing like Jay said is is really probably a pretty good thing so here some of our cover crop that's of X votes and peas and if in a little bit of rapeseed growing after we harvest going to corn okay this is our mix it's not real fancy we just swap it we swath it because if you don't swap it it gets too mature your weight tell us about right and your swath it otherwise it goes to hell in terms of all quantity and quality okay and there it is it looks like that nice big swath right there it look nice and green if you don't swap it on time you get less stuff and less quality to sloth on time that where we did it right we had for a little over 4 tons of stuff 20% protein very good feed oats peas and rape where we're going to go from weak to soybeans then we use a mix of oats German millet and brown midrib for exordium Sudan and it doesn't grow late in the fall so didn't yield us as much in terms of tons or it's not as good of quality either but it's not opportunity and then we use a moving fence now you move it by hand and there's lots of people know how to do that and that's fine we decided to do that most of us we did on our irrigated ground we use our irrigator to move the fence so that's a rope hanging down from the irrigator we've got three of them for span there's a post and a wire up here and a wire down here and a bucket to keep things from blowing around and I do have videos of this but I'm not going to show it cuz I don't have time but we just move it every day or two and then the cows follow right behind in the movie it shows them running at a dead run as soon as they hear the irrigator going they just come there's a goat dad's moving the irrigator right so there they line up and they graze here the day before and that was a day before that you can see behind this but they clean up those swaths all the way down to the ground but it's nice and uniform see there's that fence and the irrigator it's a whole lot nicer to go out when it's 20 below zero and push a button then it is to go you know drilling holes and doing whatever so not even when it's cold it's you know the irrigator doesn't like it sometimes those contactors are kind of a little hard to get them to kick in and stuff but if you do it right the manures nice you know that 100 and some bushel wheat that we had is right there is that straw they never touched that and then this is the oats stuff now we were drilling most of this we had had it so we we also do in corn stocks at the same time so we could balance their diet with moving the core pivot and the oats pivot so they got a nice balanced diet there's a hay millet stuff and then we swath that it doesn't look as good but it's okay the nice thing about swath grazing if you just leave the cover crop stand there and gets jumped full of snow they can't eat it but if you get it in a swath like that they will eat it if you go to that Alberta thing they'll talk about that mean they got them out and stuff this deep and the college is going oh there's a swath under here right but if it's just they're trying to have to stick their nose through it all the time but if they can get their nose on the end of that sloth they just keep pushing it with their head and going ahead it's kind of interesting watch and see here this is this is them eating through the snow because we had quite a bit of snow at time this year there's a fence right across here this wasn't an irrigator is actually a fence you can see where the fence is and right there it's you know the swath and they know that the swath goes on goes on ahead they're the buckets worked better than five gallon buckets worked better than then the little tubs but now here we're doing a thing what we we want to do is plant earlier so we're working with the thing with the buffett you know Howard Buffett gave us some money and told us do whatever we want to do with it which is kind of nice you know but but we're trying to if we can get that cover crop to start consistently before we harvest the present crop then it's a win because we pick up time and and and we don't have the weed problems and we get extra time and and so we're looking at at at seed coatings and we we flew at Gettysburg we flew in this area John O'Connell from Letcher flew a bunch of stuff in this area around Mitchell and I've got a lot of pictures from from Gettysburg but not from from John but here we're flying at Gettysburg there's a seed the coated seed on the ground we looked at seed with with just a coating on it none of this had peat or anything which I think we're going to need to do it's just a limestone coating with absorbent or without absorbent but you can see the seed the seed grew better when it was on where it had residue there so just run through a few this is field one there seed with with nothing what we had out there is Indian Head lentils forage peas and flax so if you see grass there it doesn't count so there's bear seed there's where we had 50% coating with no absorbent on it and there's more there with absorbent there's even more it's kind of hard to tell there but if you take a picture like that that's what that looked like and and that's the bare seat equivalent there was was half 50% so b7 half pounds of lentils 14 pounds of peas and and 6 pounds of flax ok so the same as the same seeding rate and all of them and then we did a thing that we called winter that was a spring this is winter levels winter piece and flax versus not winter flax but the same this is 50% again saying was that bear seed basically but it's using winter species so again the seven and a half and fourteen and and six and the winters don't take off as fast as the springs because they're going well it's going to be winter and then I'll rest and then I'll come back next spring right it's like winter wheat versus oats winter wheat it'll just lay there and kind of go oh okay and then take off the next frame whereas oats goes it's spring even though it doesn't know it's August it goes it's bringing in the dissin and way it goes and the heads out and okay so there's that looking down the row okay and then we we say we we do a winter it's the same winter things plus we added a few extra seeing rapeseed and oats so we put the winter lentil winter pea flax rapeseed notes these are all going to go to to two-week to spring so we didn't want any winter wheat or anything like in there and that's a bit better because you got the oats and things trying to do some things for you and that's what it looks like down the road okay and that's just that's just the 50 percent with no absorbent here's the 50 percent with absorbent looking down the road that's a bit thicker now not all the time has the absorbent helped us sometimes it doesn't help but in this case it helped us and there there's another one with absorbent and then here we go 70% 70% coating with no absorbent wasn't all that flash and then filled one I showed you this picture before here's field one there's a 50 percent zero and then filled for 50 percent zero this is a different field that one didn't they were about three miles apart okay so it's not consistent enough and then again field one with the absorbent on it field for with absorbent again it's a little better but it will see the spring what it looks like here's that thing I told you about but just Google Alberta swath grazing whatever more cows more goats more sheep that's how we're going to feed all these people a number one meat eat and in the world is goat okay just so all you Cowboys get get humbled a bit 100% grass-fed ground beef this is done in Aberdeen a guy buys cattle from Montana coal cows puts him on cover crops at Aberdeen and he has them as certified grass-fed somebody bought off on that okay use a perennial sequence or perennial cover crops will probably be necessary we're not going to fix the salinity thing without perennials and I think Jay talked about that right day I'm sound good thing Jay took care easy work so I just put in one slide yet all tillage tools destroy soil structure all til he still has decreased water infiltration all tillage tools reduce organic matter and all till these twos increase weeks right and all these years that I've come here showed you every one of those sinks all the data behind it so I just put that in so you don't get confused as you drive back by the machinery dealership when you leave bureaucracies got reminds corporations are operated by people of limited tenure some are more limited than others right but they're not going to be here long society and landowners and farmers deserve to have long term research so it Dakota Lakes does farmers and ranchers harvest sunlight carbon dioxide and water produce products they can sell some of this is human food we need to be aware of nutrition issues and off-site impact so if we want to eat meat maybe we should contrary in producing meat we have a new director the West River AG Center Rapid City you know that's where we kind of house all the cowboys and stuff for the West River thing and when we were interviewing the candidates I asked the question do you think there'll be feed Lots in 40 years do you think about that with all the energy it takes and all the problems with biological resistance and all the issues with nutrient cycling and all these issues and one of the candidates answered no the other one went probably not so how do we start preparing for that tillage is agriculture where fracking is - petroleum tying in with Jays thing this morning they both increase the speed and extent of nutrient removal from a resource leaving the resource degraded in mining that's what we want to do that's what grandfather did we can't do that anymore so we need to quit frackie our soils and start building our soils tenuous low disturbance no-till in combination with diverse rotations and cover crops is a biological answer to a biological problem doing the right thing environmentally is almost always a crack to have economic approach in the long run take the out of e tea and the tea out of cat thank you [Applause] you",
