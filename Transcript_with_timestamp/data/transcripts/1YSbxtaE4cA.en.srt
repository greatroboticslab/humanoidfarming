about permaculture answer adapting it to

9
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:21,600
a small space for one subscribe now many

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,580
permaculture plans start with a

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,810
foundation of fruit and nut trees that

12
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,880
can get very large

13
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,740
keyline design and other water

14
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,660
management systems are often at odds

15
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,969
with zoning regulations and space

16
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,340
restrictions but you can still establish

17
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:37,770
beautiful lower maintenance perennial

18
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,020
gardens in your backyard ultimately

19
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,149
permaculture is about designing outdoor

20
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,190
spaces so that all elements of plants

21
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:47,070
resources and humans interact in a

22
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:49,110
synergistic efficient way each part of

23
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,969
the system can perform and support many

24
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,160
different functions no matter the size

25
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:54,960
of the space here are some ways to

26
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,789
include permaculture in your backyard

27
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,320
farm one use resources wisely

28
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:03,899
permaculture design includes minimizing

29
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,119
human created energy use designing smart

30
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:09,060
water systems and maximizing natural

31
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,280
resources on a large permaculture farm

32
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,990
efficiently using resources might mean

33
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,900
digging a large system of drainage

34
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:18,210
swales and holding ponds some include

35
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,210
solar panels wood stands and windmills

36
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:23,400
to harvest natural energy on a backyard

37
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,290
scale you can install rain barrels to

38
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,509
water the garden and align garden beds

39
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,490
and dig swales to work with natural rain

40
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:31,530
runoff whether that's collecting excess

41
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,650
in dry areas are draining it away in

42
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,600
swampy areas consider growing prolific

43
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,520
plants like hops and beans to shade

44
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,400
sunny parts of the house in summer and

45
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,470
reduce indoor temperatures use highly

46
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,479
efficient hand tools like a broad fork

47
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:48,509
in hand tiller to minimize gas-powered

48
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:51,210
machine use carefully use your time and

49
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:53,369
space too if growing a certain plant

50
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,840
takes extensive pruning or weeding and

51
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:57,750
you don't like those chores try

52
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,820
something else if your family desires an

53
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:03,140
outdoor cooking space or more privacy

54
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:06,990
adjust plans to create those areas to

55
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:09,300
prioritize diversity diversity of plants

56
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:12,060
wildlife and experiences is key to

57
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,770
permaculture systems with many plant

58
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,750
variety

59
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:16,610
are more productive than monoculture in

60
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:18,410
the face of challenges like difficult

61
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:20,900
weather soil or chore time

62
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:23,990
they allow space for play work and

63
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:26,360
relaxation diverse Gardens attract many

64
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:29,540
species of pollinators and birds and can

65
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:31,370
be beautiful in all their variety 3 work

66
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:34,070
with nature and existing elements

67
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:36,170
working around existing buildings and

68
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,850
valuable real estate can be tricky for

69
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:39,860
city growers but part of the

70
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:41,990
permaculture mindset is transforming

71
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,550
those obstacles those problems into

72
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:46,010
something that can benefit you and your

73
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:48,320
garden says Patrick O'Connell certified

74
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:50,030
permaculture and restoration agriculture

75
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:53,090
instructor and member of the Columbus

76
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:54,590
agrarian society for example a yard

77
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,450
covered with large trees will have

78
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:59,780
trouble growing lots of sun-loving

79
00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:01,400
annual vegetables and fruits he says so

80
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,110
instead grow mushrooms and

81
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,820
shade-tolerant ephemeral plants that

82
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:07,060
gather most of their photosynthetic

83
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:09,770
energy before trees put on their leaves

84
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:11,930
similarly build on existing physical

85
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:14,120
structures by using fences to trellis

86
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:16,280
climbing vegetables or flowers slopes

87
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,610
for plants needing well-drained soil and

88
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,200
reused materials for paths and borders

89
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:23,510
especially in a neighborhood with lawn

90
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,340
and garden standards it's a good idea to

91
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:27,410
start incorporating perennials into

92
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:29,120
existing flower beds to minimize the

93
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:32,300
shock of creating something that looks

94
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,480
so different than the status quo 4 build

95
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:37,670
appropriately sized plant guilds forest

96
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,980
gardening plans often suggest a top

97
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:41,959
story of chestnut walnut or other very

98
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:43,580
large trees that could dominate a small

99
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:46,610
yard or interfere with existing

100
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:48,560
buildings and power lines skip this top

101
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:51,260
layer and start with smaller fruit and

102
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,209
nut trees in tight spaces layer them

103
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:56,870
together so that space and harvests are

104
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:58,700
maximized focus on trees shrubs rhizomes

105
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:00,590
and vines that are typically found in

106
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:03,650
the mid canopy and understory layers

107
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:05,840
O'Connell suggests in temperate North

108
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:08,360
America a common assemblage of plants

109
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,970
might be apple pear plum peach cherry

110
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:15,410
raspberry gooseberry currant grape

111
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:17,480
strawberry and garlic 5 act a favorite

112
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:19,489
saying of permaculture advocates is the

113
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,220
best time to plant a tree as 10 years

114
00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:24,500
ago the second best time is right now

115
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,540
it's easy to get caught up in the

116
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,520
principles of permaculture

117
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:30,440
some spend months or years trying to

118
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,450
design the perfect system where every

119
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,910
element interacts precisely with every

120
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:37,100
need perfection in a natural system

121
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:38,330
doesn't actually exist though so it's

122
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,120
best to jump right in

123
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:42,920
start with one area of your space or one

124
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,250
area of need and move through the rest

125
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:49,100
of your ideas as time and budget allows

126
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:51,860
six adapt enjoy and observe your

127
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:53,660
perennial food gardens focus on what

128
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,310
thrives in your environment and be ready

129
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:58,220
to change or move on from what isn't

130
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:59,450
working sometimes certain plants don't

131
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,070
get what they need from the soil

132
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:03,290
temperatures or pressures of your

133
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:05,000
particular space and it's okay to allow

134
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:07,670
yourself to move on to other plant

135
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,800
families in time you may experience

136
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:11,720
gardening like o'connell does where the

137
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,700
biggest reward is having tons of fresh

138
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,710
fruit and produced a harvest while the

139
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:18,880
biggest challenges harvesting tons of

140
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,880
the fresh fruit and produce
