1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,240
Back at the vegetable bed again, looking

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:07,759
at these early blighted tomatoes. So,

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:10,559
early blight is one of the most common

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:13,120
fungal diseases of tomatoes. This fungal

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:16,119
disease loves wet and warm conditions

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:19,439
and this is usually spread through

7
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:22,080
overcrowdedness and bad airflow and so

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,400
that comes with overcrowdedness. So,

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,599
that's the easiest fix without using any

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,480
type of substance. Oh, lost one. Blight

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,800
can also affect the stems and the leaves

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,320
as well. And usually this type of fungal

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,520
disease starts at the bottom of the

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,040
plant and works its way up. So if it

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,200
starts down here, leaves start falling

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,840
off and then you see some fruit like

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,920
this, you definitely have some light.

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,760
The stem damage is usually characterized

19
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,600
by brown dry spots. Sometimes sun come

20
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,520
in kind of like this one, but definitely

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,199
brown and dry. The first thing you

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:01,320
should do when you see blight on your

23
00:00:56,199 --> 00:01:03,239
tomatoes is get rid of the affected

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,320
fruit. Get rid of

25
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:08,720
that. The next easiest fix is to use

26
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,159
something that we use at the garden

27
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,080
center and offer at the garden center.

28
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,240
It's copper fungicide. So, you can get

29
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,320
this. You can spray it right on the

30
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,439
plants and the tomatoes and it'll help

31
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,119
you mitigate your fungal infections and

32
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,119
spreads. And then you want to make sure

33
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,920
everything is getting good separation

34
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,960
and good

35
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,960
airflow. That's how you beat it.
