  "text": "you know that's one thing I haven't heard yet today is carbon and soil and that's the driving force in what we're doing I don't care what anybody says that's a driving force and we've got to really focus on that you know and another thing I've learned over the years is you can't make all the mistakes yourself and I really try to do that so what I'm saying is team together you guys with your neighbor or whatever and try to learn from each other because if rather we realized or not we have to change what we're doing we have got to change what we're doing we've got to be more sustainable so we're 9600 acres and we've been no-till since 1993 we feel like residues really a friend we'll do our rotation with a heavier residue crop because we need the soil armor so residue is our friend we did not take one if we'd out of a rotation because residue is our friend we've got to have that soil armor Brady 85 hundred acres of grass on the Missouri River breaks 850 head of cows at the cow-calf pair and you can see that'll always be a virgin sod and and it's a good thing the boys do a really good job of managing there are pastures they they rotate them they've got divided fences they're doing a tremendously good job with their cattle and and it's nothing but a where I used to think it was kind of a detriment to a farm and now I think it's all about our farm is about our cattle because one pays the other one off so here's our pasture and the bad thing is it's in one chunk and so when we run into a little dry spell and we get hurt but then we run into in the wintertime we've got two sections where we bring the cows home - and so we so we had an issue so we're bringing them home we were grazing them hard we're losing residue so we were getting to her our home two sections we're losing productivity off of it because we are grazing it too hard in the winter time and so then as the story goes along I'll tell you how we tried to remedy that okay so I don't know how many you guys have read Howard Buffett's book 40 chances so what he said in this book is you've got 40 chances in your life to make a difference just think about that your farmer maybe you've already used 20 so you've got 40 chances to really make a difference in your life so I've already used 48 let's see what what I'm ashamed of embarrassed of and what I'm trying to make better is the first 24 years I completely destroyed this soil then what Dave was talking about in the 70s I lived the 70s I mean it was I did we did everything we could do to destroy the soil and we didn't know any better and I'm not so sure that isn't what happened right now so much to do in so little time to me that's my main goal it's what I want to do is if I can influence people to do the right thing that's a win-win situation for me so in the seventies we were good farmers we felt we were the better farmers around we are cover crops was wild buck what buckwheat and cosa weed and and though we didn't really understand anything all we knew was we were so busy working so busy no one doing we were doing the right thing tilling the ground working the ground after harvest she would go out there and you'd you had the power to disc it when dave said there when you started plough and you kept plowing and till the color of the soil changed what we'd do was I mean actually you guys in the time that we ploughed we did we were plowing six inches deep and then all of a sudden you went to five because we're turning it up yellow dirt we didn't understand but so we're our own worst enemies the worst two pieces of machinery you can use this one's terrible cuts all the macropores off we had to go to we had we finally went to Buckley because earlier normal blades because our Buckley was so bad we couldn't get through our stubble because the buckwheat was so bad right now we don't have any buckwheat on our farm with our rotations we pretty well take care of it so farm in the 80s so you'd go along and every time the wind blew if you were in powder if you were someplace you were afraid to look like Tosti to be the West because there'd be dirt in here and we're just so we just been so afraid it would be us that we just go home you wouldn't go out look because it wasn't a lot you could do about it but we still thought we were good farmers so we didn't have really good we didn't really have really good deals what we thought we thought we did one thing about the corn this 70 bushel we'd never plant corn but over three miles away from the farm because we knew we were going to have to cut it for silage we knew it wouldn't make corn so we'd always be close to the house and then another thing is this was on black summer fellow and we thought we were good farmers so our organic matter really you know it was going down and then we started using some fertilizer and and you talked about a response you talked about a response first we started using phosphorus of 50-pound bags and then we went to some nitrogen and we had one drill with the with fertilizer rope or fertilizer cashflow and the other than we didn't but you talk about a response so we thought we had this deal figured out you know I just compared the rainfall here Alexandr you know they get about thirty seven where am I at twenty-four about 25 inches we get nineteen six only thing is you guys are a little bit warmer but then look at this year there's not a lot of difference is there this isn't all this is in our whole County but see the thing like with us you take our snow away and we have seventeen three inches of moisture this year and you guys had eighteen point one so one thing about this whole thing with this snow were you able to capture it did you have the residue standing that you're not using the knife rollers did you leave that residue stand to catch that snow a lot of guys say you're too wet and I think with the no-till and in a high diversity and rotation I think you can handle I make it different so this is part of County so it's just like anything and I'm sure it's the same way the county is here see the difference in the rainfalls so there's our place there's a main farm but see there's a river there's our pastures 13 inches of rain down there this year I mean so the boys in there they're the native grass and their pasture rotations are bringing us through but it's it's an issue okay this is how it all changed Duane back you know I'm very fortunate enough to be on Dakota lakes board and I'm very fortunate enough to be on South Dakota soil health coalition board Dwayne's the one that started this the only reason Dwayne we were the first ones in our area to start a no-till we have seven 50s and we didn't know what we were doing with Dwayne's lead but I mean you talk about someone you didn't have places like this to go to safe what am I going to do we didn't have we were really struggling with rotations we we just it was a struggle but you can't put a value on what it's done for our area and when I say no-till I mean low residue no-till as far as I am concerned there's a shank drill that will do quite a bit of damage I'm talking about it if drill you know there's a lot of no-till captures carbon and organic matter which is full of nutrients so yes the tillage past will release those nutrients causing a crop response but then you are back to square one it's like burning your house your house for heat you did get some heat but you destroyed your house so basically you're not capturing that carbon all the carbon you plant took in you go work it whatever the way that carbon goes in the air there's a lot of truth to that you guys we have to focus on carbon there's no question in my mind you have to focus on carbon so we were looking for ways to fertilize we had 750 drills and on and so we tried spreading urea and we really get like that because we knew were volatize and we knew where it loses some fertilizer and you're always you there's a lot of times they're having to spread when they had time instead of when it should have been done so then we went to anhydrous and you can see why we didn't like anhydrous see what it did to the soil anytime you do that you're gonna release carbon then another thing you're going to lose that source or armor and we had to have that soil armor so this is how we do our wheat and there's a reason I'm going to tell you on how why we put our fertilizer down so we have an 1895 drill so the fertilizer will gold the nitrogen to go five inches away from the seed and then the but the reason when you do that when there's five inches away 45 inches away from the seed at the fourth week four sleeve the nitrogen and fertilizer will get together and when it does that then that's how you can control your tillering so basically what you're doing instead of like having five pillars if it's broadcast we want about we want about two and a half good heads between two and two and a half a good hands per kernel of wheat we don't want to grow strong we want to grow heads of wheat so that really helped another thing about the 1895 the first one that John Deere Bill went to Ralph Holsworth he's the neighbor he started no-tilling year before we did it went to he lives a mile or three miles west of Weston and drill number two went to our farm so that's how much we believe that we're that in this system and then we'll put down we'll put down 1152 and reduce of potash and AMS with their starter and the potash we want the chloride for soil health and then we come back at stream bar I know Dave said that with us we have to have protein we have got to have quality we have to assure ourselves of quality so what we'll do is we'll put enough on and then we'll come back the way the weather is timing the weather or whatever in heaven and then we'll come back and stream barge at about fetus five because in our environment we have got to have protein if we do not have protein like on spring wood if we don't have 14 protein does it's just about feed they'll cost you a dollar a bushel so this is our a field of no tilled long-term no-till sunflower stalks and you can see our residue I mean you can't say enough good things about our residue but so there's quite a bit of that around so that was in central South Dakota in 2007 just a little bit little what too far from our place that came off the sunflower field so we got to stop this we know how to stop this well here's 2012 that's four miles from my place that was a bean field that they planted the spring wheat and then it blew there's quite a bit of that where they'll put fertilizer on bean stubble in the fall and then it'll blow so you know we got over that we won't let that happen again whoops we did you know that's organic matter there this is a this is a high note Hill environment that's what manage you'll do man but we'll do we've got to pay attention to that everybody's got to pay attention that we can't let that happen so you know and this is Dwayne helped us with this week so what do we do so here's an 1895 drill these are 10 inches apart so and then so all we did and this isn't a very good picture but see we just took and put the wheel over here will over there so then you've got a rolling stock standing right here we did it we did that on both sides of the drill on the wings and that was enough so what our fields look right now that's what I feel look like and that was enough to stop to blowing if you if we have enough residue we won't blow but that's enough to stop the blowing so our row crowd fertilizers will we put we on the river we do a little different but on our dryland are your real gold three inches off the side and two inches down and we'll put our starter with with the the seed and I'm gonna there's I'm coming too that's why we're doing this so if you broadcast urea on top to soil the rias enzyme will break it down and that's where you get it we release it and get your validation so but if it's under the ground it'll help but he'll slow it down so this is my theory and it's just a theory so Colton and you can google it this was in the thrill magazine I've read quite a bit about this so what they claim is you if you pack it if you pack that urea into tight deal it'll it'll slow down your real system and make it flow relief and I really I really feel that's working for so you say what's your benefit abandon someone will say well you can cut back some will say well you know cuz it's close to the seed and I you know and this is my thought now get into a little more what ah hi I'm beginning to believe this all the time a lot of you guys have probably read this book if you don't have this book you get this book 84 pages long that don't only get it but get one to give to your neighbor also good book much of modern agronomy is focused on feeding plants the nutrients they need to grow for harvestable crop very little is said about the most limited element most needed for crop production that is carbon we've got to have carbon we've got to have carbon so right now you put on your you put on your inorganic fertilizer and you plant a plant so that plants on welfare most the time what a plan will do is they'll take them through for the census they'll take in it'll take out and you'll take the cart of the sugar out and then the fungi will take it and then they'll go get the organic nitrogen so what happens when it does this is it's got its on welfare so it's going to use that or inorganic nitrogen and it's gonna get lazy I mean why wouldn't you why wouldn't you use that if you could how many people have you had if you had free meals given to your pie would you have to go work so that's exactly what the plants doing so then when it comes time for the plant to actually save line running out of that inorganic fertilizer I need some more so it goes as if since sugar out to try to get the attention of the mycorrhizae and the bacteria to go after and get the organic in so instead of taking everything to the head it's taking everything it's got to try to go after more fertilizer so I'm not saying we should quit fertilizing I'm not saying I think we need to watch what we fertilize it may be managed or fertilizer a little better but one thing I'm really I'm one thing in the end I there's no scientific deal this is just a farmer's thought I think when you put that fertilizer in a tight band like that I think part of this is what helping we're actually going off and finding it's not being overwhelmed with that inorganic fertilizer we soil sample with variable rate we do our own I've been doing it since 2000 and the main reason we do this is because not that for most production we're just finding out what the fields need and I think the last thing we on our farm right now we don't farm for max maximum yield we farm for maximum profit and when we started doing that that made a lot of difference because you know if you're not you're gonna be going through the 180 bushel yields and you might get them 1 out of 10 years and we take an average and so we don't do that anymore we farm for maximum profit so you put all them together you got a variable rate map again same thing cost efficient management I think you really have to do that our feeling that's really taken us two long ways on our farm here's another staying of Duane's quit putting band-aids on things when you have something wrong instead of just trying to find out some way to well how am I gonna heal this or let's see I need I need to go buy another fungicide that will take care of this or they've got a new herbicide and I know I gotta spray that herbicide what you do is you go find out what the problem is what the issue is and it took me a while I'm a full learner so I thought well this is where we need to be and the reason these are the first rotations we started with and the reason this was is because before the freedom to farm we had to we had the planter fleet base the only way we could plant wheat base is plant when if we back on spring wheat so and so I mean we thought we had it made well the only thing that someone else was thinking the cheatgrass said you know I'm gonna figure you guys so we went we went two times around on this two and a half times around we realized we had to make a change we could either spray for cheatgrass and keep fighting the cheatgrass or we had to let rotations do it and and our goal was to do it with rotation so these aren't any big deals we just all we did was we stayed up two years away from there were three years away from wheat I mean but doing this we still that's the reason we were doing a but in the long run what it was really doing was getting us more diversified and helping us with soil health and then we started cover crops in 2006 these are a crop trades in 2017 and I know we've got forage crops in there but one thing we'll do is we'll go look for the markets but you can see our high residue crop we value residue and our dry environment we've we value residue have to have residue if you ever want to read something and rusty just Charles Darwin on worms I mean you can read for hours about what is what he what's his thoughts were on worms earthworms this is a field of it was volunteer levels this fall and you know when you the levels were sorted anyway and and when you're full CD rates forty pounds so it wasn't anything to leave 3040 pounds because they shattered they're only six inches tall eight inches tall but look at the look at the earthworm hold there's water gonna go down as water gonna go down it's just got a place to go risk got a place to go but another thing with earthworms channels there's two and a half times more nitrogen there's a 1/2 more carbon one and a half more times nitrogen seven times more phosphorus at six and a half times more potash so if you were a plant you're in a drier environment and you had to you said well where am I gonna go well here's an easy place than when I go down there I'm going to have all that fertility I'm gonna have all that fertility at the earth rooms created you know the NRCS has done a lot of work on our farm and and along with SDSU I don't want to give one anybody one more credit than the other but you know the more you read the more you realize this what's under the soil everybody drives by and say boy that's a nice corn crop boy that's a nice wheat crop how many times do you say boy let's go take a spade and go look at that soil I mean I think we have to do that you guys I think we have to because soils a driving force is what's going to happen in the future so we took Chad and Osborne and Mike Lehman askest told us we could bring some some soil samples over to the lab and it was 2012 extremely dry and I said I don't think you'll do any good because we're dry I mean we're just terribly drying it was middle of winter February well February 14th guess what else I did on Valentine's Day but anyway so anyway and this is this is how lowly that I know about it so I was so proud of taking this one because look at the rotation I mean holy buckets I mean there wasn't any way that thing wasn't going to be a you know as big rotation and it was the least count so it just kind of shows you how little we know about what's going on under her feet but the one thing that really helped me is everything was still alive when you warmed it up under a microscope it was still alive and I just thought that meant a lot so mycorrhizae Micro is a fungi if you guys ever get it all you read everything you can about it because that thing's helping us so much it's been around forever but the it dumb it moves in from legume plants that started fertilizer is reduced destroying the food web by tillage I mean that'll hurt it it can access water from very small pores in the soil bringing the water through the plants during times when the soil is dry when we were in Indianapolis with dr. ray wells how to talk and it was all the talk on what his talk was is on the micro rise I the ruddy structure of a mycorrhizae and he's got pictures of my cries a poor little gold aggregation when you get aggregated soils that look like cottage cheese that's the glue mona from those is from the sugar that the mycorrhizae takes to the center of that and then that's what makes it as sticky and then that's but anyway he has pictures of it where his right and it will go right right in the center of that and then that's where it will take most of the it'll go after most of my Fuhrer but I thought it was kind of neat so we put a we had of forage soybeans and then we planted corn and we came back we did this two years and one year I took it to harvest and the other year we cut it for silage and so what we'll do what we did was we came back and we planted the corn and came back about right when the corn was spiked and plants of forage soybeans group sevens you know and the the thing that was really stuck out at me is so these are the this is the corn with the soybeans and we thought we were running it was a drought but you see the tips of these that corn house tipped back so basically then forage soybeans were feeding the nitrogen and our limited rainfall we have to be careful with this because then forage soybeans talk quite a bit of moisture but it's just enough to be kind to have to be care Flo you know this is another thing dr. Dave Francine we plant flocks I love flax but it's micros a friendly flock doesn't take any and he he would have told you that today that's in his book it doesn't take any phosphorous because the mycorrhizae it goes after the organic phosphorous if you could get him to say it and we should ask him today he'll tell you that sunflowers doesn't take any phosphorous he don't recommend any phosphorous the sunflowers and if you would ask him is it mycorrhizae and he probably would have said yes because if sunflowers are very mycorrhizae lovely in a cover crop mix there would be sufficient link to my crazy hype in the top four inches of a four square yard of healthy grassland to stretch around the world there's a lot to this I mean you guys I really encourage you to read about it because the more you read about it the more you plan my carides I plants and there's a lot of them just realized the value of them okay now we're gonna get into carbon we were at a meeting in 1991 and Dwayne Beck said do you see what I see and he was talking about carbon it blew over the top of my head only took me 20 years to figure it out but it's you guys the more you the more you realize we have to take carbon in not only take carbon in but we have to store it 57 percent of organic matter is carbon we have to take carbon in that's the biggest thing about you carbon is a driving force any time you could grow bring it in through the plants you've got to have carbon another thing we're doing is we're working some native grass and are nothing big but you know it's kind of a rotation type deal kind of slough area some hunting area will put 60 acres in Lee within four or five years to take it out again we're getting a written structure we're getting we're bringing that land back I mean we're bringing it back to where it was so I mean then we will take it back to a crop but I just think that's really going to help us in the long run je Fuhrer take the world to Jai this is a trade cronin that's Mike's son he's going to be one of the the main owners the farms shifting gears next year and Kacy and Cori that's Monty's two sons and Mike and Trager it's going to Bonnie stepping out of the picture he's going to retire which is you know fine but anyway I really believe that if you have more carbon entering your soil than leaving your kids will probably farm that land if you have more carbon leaving than entering they probably will not what he's saying is you gotta farm for the future so we had some corn and heavy strip of stubble in 2017 nice-looking corn old deeds we had a Frost June 26th was it going to come back I don't know if it was going to come back it was really it was probably six collar plus the thing but is our that would have 160 acres and we lost maybe eighty acres out of the quarter but it was being the low ground didn't know how to make any sense of it so we knew we had to do something we weren't going to leave that land alone because it had the fertility there it wanted something growing in it so we planted you can't see it very well but we planted the pearl millet because that's what the chemical let me had kalisto on it and brown mid we have forage sorghum because we had cows because we had cows here's what we ended up with I should have done a biomass unreal unreal what we did and to show you Ruth came up Ruth beckoned and I said now to say Ruth Becca should be able to say Ruth and everybody knows her because she's up but anyway Ruth came up and Jason and we went out there you guys and it was it was really something it was really felt like this success story so what we did as we had them so what are you gonna how are you going to handle it now so we went in with decided now this is our better soils so we knew we had the fertility there we knew organic matters will hire there we knew the we had still had good ground cover you saw that on the picture so what do you do so we cut up for silage and you say boy you took all that stuff off but you know that was terrible well I understand but we had to do what we had to do so we took this silage off but I kept thinking look at all the root mass we have look at the rut master we'd have with that they've probably down three three foot two and a half three foot so I felt I did want to take it all off but it's something in the way the temperature was or the weather was the rainfall we felt we had to so here's another thing about if we need cover or not so look at the temperature look at the temperature when you start the start evaporating 85 percent of the moisture loss through evaporation transpiration at 95 degrees so what happens on bare soils you know if you guys ever done much of this it doesn't take very much to go over the thermometer and get a hundred and hundred and ten degrees soil on bare soil so this is just one of them things and this isn't my pictures the NRCS my thermometers sideways and it's hard to take a picture but look at the difference same day same place these came from Jay Fuhrer we have to have that soil Armen we have to have that soil covered so here's where organic matter when we started taking off I mean so it's building and we felt good about it and that we're no-tilling and you know you feel you know we're going in the right direction because if we would not have I don't know where we would have been because when you the microbes are going to eat something and they're going to eat organic matter if they don't have anything any carbon that you brought in so they're going to eat something so this is 10% it's where we used to be we let a lot of places in the United States for less than two what do you think that grant was telling his grandson I'm sorry when we were in Indiana with the buffett people we had people from the thumb of Michigan we had from the Boot Hill Missouri from Nebraska to Indiana to Iowa and a lot of guys you talk about organic wagon they didn't want to really talk about organic matter but when they did talk that their lot of members in the one and a half two twos the two and a halves they're trying to do it all with they're getting in to cover crops now that's what they should but because they've got to get carbon back to make organic matter they're trying to do with the inorganic nutrients so this is what we've done on our farm and so what I did was I took of that grass was planted in the 30s it was planted back in the 30s so I took a soil sample of it I should have gone to native but so it was five point one an average land in 2008 was 2.8 and we have a lot of land in the fours right now what I'm going to say about cover crops anytime you get a cover crop going on your field but I mean I'm talking a pretty active cover crop where everything's really Perkin well I think you know I used to say if you could gain a tenth of a percent a year you're doing well and I think you could get the two tenths or maybe even three tenths here by uses of the cover crop I think cover crop is just going to jumpstart that soil one thing too is and Jay talked about is when you plant covers don't be disappointed after the first year because he explains it kind of like a soybean where the second year soybeans always better than the first year natively and he says it's just something about it because you plan to cover on that stubble it's just kind of a shock to this house stuff that's never had before but it's always better the second time around so while I'm really saying to you guys it's just this this ain't just a one or two year deal we just got to have to keep working on this benefits twenty to thirty pounds of nitrogen sulfur phosphorus what I would pay attention to the most is your organic matter water holding capacity and our dryer environment that's tremendously important if I can hold another 1/2 or 3/4 inch of water that's going to get me through that tough time time and time again it shows that mineralization this fall we really you know we just everybody said boy I can't believe we've got that much nitrogen well all it is is is the microbes are really working and they're working on your organic matter and whatever whatever but the more organic matter you have the more mineralization you're gonna have this is our word organic matter what's going now and that's uh I feel good about that I just hope we can keep the one thing about it is we're not going backwards I do not take credit for organic matter in a soil test they will not 1% of organic matter is like one point one trillion waters a gallon per day over Niagara Falls one percent over the United States that's how much water that 1% of organic matter could hold it's our savings account when we fertilize for one hundred and forty and you can have a good moisture and get 160 how do you get that you get it from your organic matter but Dave Francine says just like Connie and he just came out with this on his corn deal if you have 6% organic matter over he'll credit he won't credit until you get 60% he sees the value of organic matter so like when he talks about fertilizing wheat which I'm not saying I don't I'm a farmer I don't have I don't have enough knowledge or education disagree with dr. Francine but I don't I don't really believe that because what he's saying he's going to fertilize for two bushel wheat and if he gets rain the organic matter is gonna kick in the only thing is it's what if you don't have five percent organic matter what if you're two and a half and so I think I think I I really think that's critical that you that's why we won't use any organic matter credit we do what we don't we don't use it as credit when we do use organic matter this is on the Internet $600 six hundred eighty dollars for one percent of organic matter and I just put some of our own numbers in and you still there's really still quite a value to 1% of organic matter if you own your land if you own your own land why aren't you doing that why aren't you trying to get more organic matter everybody says I'm too hot to drive whatever whatever but optimum management and add an external carbon stores anytime you can anytime you can cover crops you guys this is our first cover crop Dwayne you know he was going he was trying to get someone to try cover crops and he got me kind of cornered and so we did it the only thing is is we come off a really dry year we had thirteen point seven inches of moisture but it was really a low carbon to only a twenty to one carbon and and I was worried about it and he was worried about it enough he called one day and he said when you're gonna start combining that and I said well we're probably gonna be doing it Tuesday and Tuesday morning he pulled in and he rolled with me so he was as nervous as I was but it turned out pretty good for his we ended up with good moisture in 2007 but it turned out for us so another question so we're gonna plant cover crops there's not enough people a lot of people what they'll do is though and I'm not I think there's a tremendous lot of good seed sales when I I hope I don't offend anybody but when you walk up your seed salesman you say this is what I want to do I want to graze it I want to increase organic matter you know and whatever you want to do you want to use up the excess moisture whatever you want to do you have them goals and usually what I do when I sit down to make my my cover crop plans I have three things in mind if it's grazing organic matter would it be one two three I always have my first one but don't just go up there and say I need a cover crop they can help you they know what you want but you let them know what you want this is from the NRCS jason miller and jeff Hemmings we made this and it's a good chart and and what I usually do let's just take flocks for instance so you know it's highly my karai's I it's good you know an intelligent it's very organic matter carbonate nitrogen ratio high but so one thing too is you look at the seeding rate full seeding rate twenty pounds so when I make a cover crop mix if I got five things and I wonder so I got five things that we like I want so I'll do twenty percent of each one so right now that'd be four pounds of flax and that's how I build my cover crop mix so do a percentage if you feel really good about it if you've got enough moisture I sometimes go to 115 to 120 percent that's that's who I I'm not saying this the right ways just the way I do it another thing Chris mentioned this this is on the Google cover crop chart ARS and you can go and they'll tell you anything you want to know about any cover crop the carbon and nitrogen ratio everything salt-tolerant good website one thing I found in the Sarah book and I started doing this because when we plant sorghum Sudan grass we always plant Piper's today on grass I never plant one thing alone Piper's today on grass and probably like either a white a white wonder of a German millet because I never want anything alone I think that everybody gets along better when there's something else there then another thing about that millet is it keeps the windrow fluffy and but the one thing that really just look at that so a few money seen this six inch stub will look how much deeper the rust go more root mass more it takes in more carbon the more benefit that's taught soil microbes I mean if a guy has cattle I mean I think this is a win-win carbon-to-nitrogen ratio so you know one time Dwayne was up and I was talking about all our high carbon crops at all this double we had and and he made the comment to me he said but you have to learn to manage that that's a high management and that I thought well you know anybody could but it is I mean is 8 inches of stubble it's ok but is it too much so you just have to kind of realize what you want to do with your cover crop or with your soil cover with your carbon but one thing you have to be awful careful that you don't use it up and you leave some right now like on our littles and peas where a lot of guys will go on corn stalks I'll plant them on some on sprinkly stubble okay so I got spring wheat stubble then lentils and then I'll and then I'll come back to corn corn or winter wheat for one thing is the weed control if I've got a cheatgrass issue downy Brome issue behind the spring wheat the lentils I can take anything out I want as far as grass is concerned and then I can come back to one of wheat the next year and then corn so I just take a break I don't have any set rotations and I don't know if that's right or wrong it's just something that works for us carbon nitrogen ratio so like that one we said was right here on that first cover crop ideal is right here and I don't know on our where soil czar so active with the mature soil so I like to be a little higher than that and we started working covers into our pivots covers and rotations because I thought this is really an important thing as we were the corn bean guys were kind of caught up in that and that was the best thing we ever did was get was get rid of that corn bean corn bean corn bean we got rid of our white mold issue I mean you talk about a win-win situation so we plan a lot of different crops down there you know and I've heard the comment today how do you make money on wheat how do you make money on oats you plan a cover behind them you put your cattle on there so we had a we had a pivot it was filled peas and we planned two full season cover in 2016 and the boys always passed you in so what they'll do is they'll take the know that they'll along the river they'll take the cows on one side of the fence and the calves on the other the calves will stay next to the river where they used to drink and out of and then they'll then they'll just leave them like that well this year what they did so it was a we planted a 10-way mix that's snow in the air these are the calves so what they did is they put the pears in and then after about seven days they took the cows out and the calves didn't have any idea of what happened they just they were so satisfied they didn't care whatever but the one thing that really noticeable about that usually bring the cows home about the fifteenth the septic Absalom about the 15th of September and this year we that year they didn't have to because this is like the seventh of November and them calves are still there and they're still doing good there's no dust there's there's plenty of grazing so I that was really a and we're gonna try to copy that again we got two pivots kind of set up for that purpose this coming year so this is a we planted the corn in 2017 and this is a heavy Gumble circle heavy heavy soil when I broke them the circles back in 70 I don't know a 77 or 78 with the disc the there was two circles side-by-side 140-acre circle and this circle was virgin sod the homesteaders knew enough not to farm this so we always struggle with raising the crop always struggle so then we got into no-till and we really helped yourselves this is the second time this fields had covers on it and this respondent it's getting so we can manage it now we're getting good yields we had to 20-plus on it this year but this is something I'd like to be able to do it again and I don't know how but this is the volunteer come from the year before the cattle stomped the oats and the radishes and turnips in five minutes kale have to hustle but they but it really is a win-win situation for the cattle so we started in 2016 I said well let's I think we can make more money raising the full season Covercraft of what we can plant wheat and I so we my goal was is so we planted June 6 and the tests double really diversified mix so you can see the one thing I really focused on is our micro rise I everything I put in there how to had a reason we put it in there I wanted to 32 to 1 racial carbon and nitrogen so we'll just follow that through so this is our this is a quarter section we left some in free strips I put a threeway in just to see why if the 3 would be rather than a 12 way put 50 pounds the end up planning and you know I didn't know if I should really do that or not and then je Fuhrer said he didn't think a guy should and then this is where it cross Fitz's went when we fed during the wintertime so that we saw their different paddocks June 29th you can see the end free strips so full season that's a hard picture to see but I loved kale kale the last way into the winter so here's what we what happened and so this is what we ended up with with most of field 80 200 pounds of biomass we're down to 25 to 1 carbon nitrogen ratio but you know 11 percent protein you can see that how much more we gained from with the no end don't know in the earlier we had 7600 but it really fell off because the young succulent plants gave out with the cold weather so this is just the relative feed value so what I did is is I said okay let's find out what we're gonna do here so I wanted to know I knew how much it cost us I knew what I wanted to say we went ahead and I tracked all the the temperatures of what the cattle should eat there's a 650 had eaten there but one thing I didn't really count on we had a lot of snow and then we had we got really cold and sold in the long run we had to feed if we fed 1/4 of our feeding through the wagon was it really a win it was still a win did we make as much money as we thought we did no we didn't but the big it really showed up this year coming off that full season cover we wintered 150 head of deer and kind of waiting for the game fish and parks to pay us for that one but I guess we'll wait a while so Jason and Ruth and Hosea and Dwayne set up a plot plan and this is kind of a so this is 28% and then the rest of this is seated this way with their planning so here's what we come up with her they came up with I'm just here for the I could say I get it but they're all here so I better not but one thing I really thought was so right now you take the one with the one with the no side side band in was 181 bushel no side band in was 149 beside with more nitrogen it was less so we put the stream bar on the 2nd of May 46 degrees temperature humidity 74% but it was 7 days before we had a quarter inch of rain was out the reason I used stream bars so I didn't want to spread it out I wanted to have a stream bar come down so the furiousness header was flowing and uh breaking it down so I mean it just really showed us a lot of things and you'll talk to Jason Dwayne Routh or anybody and use your yields or 10 to 12 percent more when you hand harvested these were hand harvested so they're usually more they were dried down to 8 percent this is official as you could get it's just like we the morning the more protein but look at here so everybody says boy I gotta like it's not such a thing it's put too much nitrogen on look what it did 100 180 pounds of nitrogen 176 bushel that's 60 pounds of nitrogen look what it cost it's 9 bushel 11 bushel but so anything and the thing of it is on this field we're gonna go back on that same spot and they're gonna do that same thing they're gonna replicate the same exact spot everything is going to be the same we're gonna have three or four of these trials around the farm we have to find out if we should be using one or one point - everybody's going to be different we're not going to use one point - but we have to find out if we can use in our environment with our system we got to find out if we can use a eight tenths of a pound or nine tenths of a pound so this is a the one thing this we did a strip with the starter different rates have started but one thing I want you to notice so this was soil sampled in the spring before we planted corn and you'll see this time and time again I mean you know a lot of people talk about it after cover after cover later in the year you'll get a spike in your phosphorous and this here might have been a fluke the only thing is that a lot where they see at four point four then three point eight so I mean at least there's an increase I'm going to get hollered out again here so this is what this is basically how our plots turned out so there wasn't there wasn't any significant difference sent it to ward lab there's 388 pounds of organic phosphorus in that soil the micro rise I went and looked after the wind got that organic phosphorous this test right here is a twelve dollar and fifty cent test award lab if you want to find out your total phosphorous in the field so full season grazing we're going to do the same thing the only thing is I'm going to maybe try to increase the the carbon and nitrogen ratio it's going to be a dry so we soil sample excuse me with planet covers and a lot of talk was his covers worth negative so we had this field side-by-side there this did not have covered they were just sixteen rows apart and so we went in so I soil sampled it in the in in November 16 before the coroner is nine pounds where there wasn't cover there's 38 pounds so I came back and we soiled sampler after corn harvest and we had 89 pounds and here we had 38 so I gave it back to us it just didn't give it back to us in time for the the cattle I soil I fertilize this accordingly so this is a our cover crop mix it's kind of a there's a reason in that by I went to that mix but this is what I the so we ended up with a no cover was 160 with cover is 156 so you take all it during that cost you $26 when I credited ourselves back to the residual end and all I'm saying is you can't say anything off the side by side this should even be shown you've got to be replicated you got to be replicated three times value of it this is what our corn you know this is these are three years these are three years all I'm trying to say is I know the corn varieties gets part of that but look at their 1994 19.5 2016 18.8 are we going in the right direction this is what its kind of scares me a little bit look at the amount of grass that came out in powder county look at the amount of beans over 2006 to 2017 corn went up look at the winter wheat in the winter if he's going to be less when if we going to be down there around 12,000 this year the teal Don beans is 38 bushel the beans are gonna be way over here so then we'll look at Davidson County look how much you guys took away from pasture increased soybeans some corn some you eavesdropping corne retires 9 inches moisture vegetative growth adds 10 bushel for each additional inch so a yield goal 140 pounds how can you do that how can you reach that and it's organic matter the use of a savings account 58% of organic matters carbon low disturbance no-till there's a lot of reasons we need to learn to farm to the maximum profit not the maximum yield let the soil help you with that you know a great deal of carbon to once restored the soil null storing the atmosphere and it's there you guys all we have to do is learn to get it and and we definitely need to return the carbon back to humans this is really makes you feel good because right here look at the youth on our farm and everybody says everybody said boy you guys got a lot of people on the farm well three of these aren't ours but you've got a lot of people on the farm and but everybody's get along fine we're making it work and we're not real big but we're making it work and just because we're we're trying to make the we're taking care of the soil and the soils taking care of us you know this is something that change happens when the pain of staying the same is greater than the pain of change just think about that I feel we should do everything we can to make this a better world and why who cares and just this picture is going to tell the story I'm not going to say anything about it I don't think we have a choice okay thank you guys sorry I sorry",
