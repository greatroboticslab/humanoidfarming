  "text": "hi I'm Christy smart man and I'm Melissa Wilson and we're with the University of Minnesota Extension using manure is a nutrient source it can really improve your pastures and cropland while reducing the need for fertilizers but it has to be applied properly in order to protect the environment and understanding the application rate is an essential piece of a manure management plan today we're going to talk about and demonstrate how to calibrate a solid manure spreader the first thing you need to know about manure spreaders and calibration is that there are several variables affecting application rates for all spreaders the tractor speed or gearbox settings will help determine the rate at which you apply manure then depending on the type of spreader used you'll also want to know the apron or hydraulic push Gate setting an example of the setting for an apron spreader is shown here other important settings may include the PTO speed and/or the spreader gate opening settings but please know that not all of these settings will apply to every type of spreader while calibrating keep all of these factors consistent but make adjustments if you need to increase or lower your rate when you're finished be sure to record the final settings used so you can repeat them in the following years remember that application rates will be determined by the crop or pasture nutrient needs as an example regulations in Minnesota state that you cannot apply more nitrogen that is needed by the crop including manure and fertilizer sources this is why writing a nutrient management plan and calibrating your spreader are important there are two possible ways to calibrate a spreader the first is the load area method which involves weighing your spreader with drive on scales and the second is the tart method which involves spreading manure over several tarps and weighing the manure collected if you have drive on scales available to you the load area method is the most convenient way of calibrating a spreader the only other equipment you'll need is something to help measure distances like a measuring wheel and paper and pen to record the measurements first step is to weigh the spreader when it is full of manure and record the weight make sure to include the tongue weight of the spreader once the Lotus spread way the spreader empty and record the weight by subtracting the empty weight from the full weight you can get the weight of the manure next you'll need to measure the area over which the manure was spread if the area is rectangular in shape measure the length and width once you've recorded the length in the width and feet multiply the two values to get the area in square feet finally calculate the application rate divide the weight of the manure by the area over which it was spread then multiply by a conversion factor of 21.8 this will give you the tons of manure spread per acre where does 21.8 come from it is 43,560 square feet per acre divided by 2,000 pounds per ton this will convert pounds per square foot to tons per acre we suggest repeating the process at least three times with the same settings so that you can find the average manure application rate if the application rate is too low or too high make adjustments to your speed gearbox or spreader gate opening settings then calibrate again and that's how you use the load area method to calibrate a spreader for that art method you'll need a tarp for rocks or other heavy objects to hold down the corners of the tarp a measuring tape a bucket a scale and pencil and paper for recording first step is to put the tarp in the bucket and weigh it empty before any manure is applied then record the weight next spread the tarp out in the field where you'll apply manure and secure the corners with the rocks then use the measuring tape to measure the length and width so that you can determine the area of the tarp record these values now you'll want to spread the menorah most people try to spread manure as evenly as possible and avoid skips between application passes so they'll try to overlap their passes a bit in this case we're spreading the manure fairly thick this is because it is composted it has a low nutrient content other manure may be spread more thinly depending on the nutrient content to account for overlapping passes you'll want to do three passes with the middle pass lined up over the tarp make sure you are spacing each pass the same as you would when you normally apply manure once the manure spread carefully pick up the corners of the tarp and fold the manure into the center place the folded tarp with them in or in the middle into the bucket and place it on the scale record the weight now we can begin to calculate the application rate first you will need to know the weight of the manure subtract the empty bucket weight from the bucket with manure weight this will leave you with pounds of manure that was applied next you should calculate the area of the tarp that thinman or of a spread over multiply the length of the tarp by the width of the dark this will give you the area in square feet the remaining calculations are very similar to how we calculated the application rate with the load weight method divide the weight of the manure by the area of the tarp then multiply by a conversion factor of 21.8 this will give you the tons of manure spread per acre for this method we recommend doing this procedure at least three times and then find the average or use three tarps at once line them up in a row in the middle pass and find the average weight of manure on the three tarps the application rate is too low or too high make adjustments to your speed gearbox or spreader gate openings then calibrate again one question that people will often ask is how often should I calibrate my manure spreader we recommend doing it when the manure consistency is not the same perhaps when it is wetter or drier than normal when you've changed your management practices like using a new type of bedding or maybe you've started composting the manure instead of spreading it raw or when something changes on your spreader equipment like a new tractor or ATV or if something gets replaced on the spreader if nothing has changed over the years we still recommend recalibrating every couple of years to make sure nothing has changed to summarize calibrating your manure spreader is an important step in knowing how much manure you are applying so that you can accurately create a manure management plan using either the load weight or the tart method is a useful way to calibrate your manure spreader remember to record the tractor settings like the speed when you're traveling and the gearbox and spreader gate opening settings your spreader is run by PTO then record the PTO sb2 this will help you remember what settings to use in the following years good luck and happy spreading [Music]",
