  "text": "[Music] [Applause] hey guys John with off-grid homesteading welcome to a new installment of fixing our water pump at the lower cistern hopefully this will be the final fix I've been using a shurflo diaphragm pump for the first year and a half the diaphragm pumps work great they can actually pump up to about you know siphoning about seven feet of pressure and then pump it up the lines that are going up to our upper cistern challenges when it gets cold that box gets real cold the parts and starts start freezing and the components in there start failing that failed last a little bit after last winter and the components are failing again so it's now time to take this aquamarine made 24 volt DC pump four amps max 100 foot maximum submersible 100 foot and it'll do 1.6 gallons per minute but this is the one of those pumps you'll find on Amazon I'll put a link to this I think it was about $90 I ended up getting one the top was cracked the company was real good they ended up sending me another one took forever to get it and then when I finally call this air where the heck's my cap they just went ahead and shipped me another unit and then a few days later the caps came in so I have two units now for the price of one that's being frugal not cheap so with this pump I'm going to be installing it inside the cistern I got to drill some holes in the side of the plastic here for the pumping lines going up into the system but I got to make sure that the pecs goes all the way to and inside the top cap here otherwise it will freeze and it will expand and it'll correct all the metal parts in between seem to crack so I have to eliminate all of the metal pieces unfortunately there's one metal piece down there so we got a little weak link of the system what I should have done is how to actually run this continual pipe directly into this tank the first time so let's go and get started Emma and apologies for looking like a gimpy old man I hurt my back last week and it's been taken its toll this is I think the heard on Monday today is Thursday so I can finally at least walk around a little bit but I still feel pretty stiff [Applause] I'm going to show you the flow inside I've never shown this before that's coming directly from our develop spring I'm gonna have a text pipe going from here to the outside coming down to this pumping situation here I'm just taking a regular garden hose which is the one that seems to fit great here and I'm going to think I'm going to go ahead and give me some extra slack here okay that's a fairly tight here I'm going to go ahead and put a float valve in here just in case I can get it to work so that if I'm gone and the thing is pumping up to the top when the water reaches the bottom it'll turn off the pump keep it from burning out or having any issues I'll need to get some sort of wire tie to keep this in place the original wire tie copper wire [Applause] okay now I'm going to drill the two holes for the electric wires one for the float that float switch and the other one for the pump [Applause] okay so what you see in here I've got my pecs coming in to this point right here I didn't I really like to go from 3/4 right to the opening I mean now I'm coming on the output there but this is already run it's already in the box this has not broken that has not broken so I think we're gonna be pretty safe this is my release the water actually holds the water from the top of the hill down here so that if I'm working on the pump I can shut this off work on it without getting back sprayed so I'm gonna go and cover these back up give it a little bit more protection from winter I need to come back and put some electrical tape around all this and make it a little bit better but this is the positive wire coming off of the solar panel if this is negative I am going to go basically positive to positive to positive negative through the switch to that so as long as the float is up it'll get power when the float goes down to the bottom and we'll check the pump off remember the white is positive on the pump and the switch it doesn't matter which side you put the connection on it can switch the positive or it can switch the negative no does not make a difference doing this to give me a little bit more slack here I don't know where my wire my special wire cutters went so going back to what works twist those really good anything here okay yeah strip these now positive to positive it's gonna even see if I can hear the pump running for a second I feel voltage all right so from here [Applause] and I had this setup for my other setup there you go now we got voltage right there I had this set up for a stop switch up top so with the black wire that's negative so right now with this one while the float is up it cuts the power and when the float is down it starts it so we need it the other way around when the float is up the power starts when the photos down the power stops so this one is not going to be used and I'm going to use the opposite wire because this float switch can work and open up or open down and the way I could check that real simple you look close no spark look here spark so you got an open circuit I mean a closed circuit on the red wire right now and that's what I want I want it on when the water is up I want it off when the float drops [Applause] okay so I'm gonna put the cap back on gather up all my crap and take it back to the top of the hill and then what I need to come down here and do is fill these holes up with some silicone keep any critters and stuff from getting in there and then as soon as I get a break in the clouds for a minute I can go up up there and after a few minutes and we should be hearing water pumping into the upper cistern with this new submersible pump so I'm not gonna have any issues with priming anymore so I after all the iterations are the pumps and stuff that I've used this little orange one that comes up is like a solar well pump because we're not pressurizing a tank up top it goes right it just drops into the tank from the techs right into the inlet hole on the side of the tank that's why you can actually pump that far because it's uh it says it'll actually pump a hundred feet of head up there we're going 50 foot this way and we're not pressurizing so yeah I've actually had this pump running the I had the other pump running at the pond and it pumped from the pond all the way to the top of the hill so I know it works already we just need to I'm just glad this is done I just don't have to mess with this thing freezing any if any more except these connections here and if these still have an issue freezing I'll have to insulate them more and figure out something a better solution to just put more insulation around these outlet pipes all right okay I don't think I've shown the whole system together in one video for quite some time I should in the in the beginning when I was building it so you can see our setup over here now who's got our overflow down here returning back to the stream here's our overflow this is going down to our pumping valve and stuff here's your wires coming in to the edge of the box coming up and around into their lids on and this is being gravity-fed all the way back over there let me show you my Buried amplifier wire which is 10 gauge wire all the way back here 100 feet of it I'll put a link for that in here as well and I did red and black wire the red has turned clear and the black stayed black down here so this is your positive this is your negative and these are your oh gosh I figure out what these MC no what are they these come off the solar panels so here's the rating on the solar panel itself so windy nation this is the ones I used here I'll put a link in the description if they're still available or something comparable and then basically I built a frame had a I believe I did a 35 degree now a 33 degree angle and then I wired them in parallel so you got 12 volts with lots of the amperage I could actually wire them in series now give me 24 volts and I might check that out and see if that might work better but let's walk over and see how the spring is doing I know my battery's running low yeah it's working pretty good so here's my overflow [Applause] my overflow [Applause] and you can see we're not having very little leakage right there where we did all the all the work before this is something off right off the top that's coming off the other edge and then this one is coming off in between the rocks here got our main cutoff right there looks like this is failed so that'll have computer plates at some point we got this one here oh look keep a little pecs connector handy and let's see what's in here not bad bad at all hip lova what did Roly Polys let's get rid of those let's release this flush everything out stop it and I just try to cover it up keep the sunlight off of it help keep it from getting algae too soon as you can see this follows the path here all the way down to the lower cistern and then this is our this area stays full pretty much all the time if you had to you could drink it through a special filtration system we've got one here that we can actually test out and try I'll show you that a little bit later when we get to little bit warmer [Applause] so peaceful back here [Applause] so thanks for joining me on my trip today off-grid homesteading signing off [Music]",
