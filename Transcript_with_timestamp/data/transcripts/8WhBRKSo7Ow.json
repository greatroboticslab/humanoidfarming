  "text": "hi and welcome back to another video one thing I have personally come to like so much about a solar system is the fact that you can always start small and then go back later so starting small has to do with the number of um solar panels as well as batteries and then other accessories you might need and then you are always able to upgrade um data to you know a bigger package or solution so you could record that when we were approaching electricity phase like get electricity for this house and we decide to consider Sula we're able to start small that was starting with two batteries two panels and then added so in today's video let's talk about the upgrade of our solar system foreign [Music] so as I was saying earlier we started off with a solar system with just two batteries that was a 100 age batteries each so that gave us like 200 amp hours and then also I have two panels of each that was some 182 watts each that was 360 watt of panels that was what we got and then we had the inverter that was 3 KVA or 3000 watts of inverter there's some few other accessories now that particular solution wasn't able to power much as of then I was basically you know to help us test the electrical system that we've had installed and then to use some few power tools so it was able to power up some few parties not for a long time you know we had to regulate how we're using those parts too so that we don't run completely out of battery as at then so that particular solution as you could record in some of my videos was around 6600 cities plus they're about that's what it costs for that particular solution having the two panels two batteries and then one inverter there's some few other accessories to you know get started that and then aside from that when we continue working on this house and then you got to a point where we needed more to use more power tools uh there was a need to upgrade from that particular solution to something higher so that meant that we had to go in for two additional batteries that was 100 age each and then two more panels and then also some few accessories to help with that particular upgrade so going about that upgrade also that cost around 9000 plus their button so we upgraded from 6600 to around 9000 plus that but we spent like around 30 000 Plus for that particular upgrade house for the battery that is two batteries that is um 100 age each and then white watts of panels each now during that particular upgrade also going about the upgrade was it was very necessary to take into consideration you know the angle of the sound where the sun comes from where it rises and the rest so we ended up installing those two panels on the other side of the building so their first two panels went to the side of the building and then the other two went to this side of the uh building the reason was we normally have the sun rises from this place and then set around this place so when it sunrises it takes you know a long time for it to get to this point too I said even though we're getting good amounts of sun energy we're still losing Samsung I didn't have those two panels over here I was able to you know help um get you know good amount of energy for their batteries now that solution also was given us around 720 watts of panels solution or energy from them solar panels and then also around 400 amp hours from the battery so that was like the energy were able to get acid and then that it cost like around um was upgraded to around 9000 now when it got to a point where we were down with the building and we had to move in there was also a need to upgrade but we took time to upgrade to that particularly sure the current solution we have now because after then the solution we had was able to power up our fridge was able to power up TV um water pump and then the lights and then the fan in the house however I wasn't able to pop uh that is especially in the fridge 24 hours because during the daytime of course the solar panel um is able to also supply energy to whatever devices that we are using whenever the Sun is up or even during the daylight that we have so that means that we're going to pop our fridge from like early morning from around six o'clock to around four or five PM I get into the evening then we have to turn it up because if we keep it on it means that um some of the energy which would have have to start and use in the evening room have to be cut off so that's how we're regulating that and so we got the final upgrade and also during then we were able to pop all the lights outside um the house yeah throughout the evening until the next morning and we're also not watching so much of tele I'm not really so much of a TV person so that was how we're going about it and then um the water pump we use it as well we need if you want to get water in the house and there isn't so much pressure from the tank then you just turned part of the pumping machine and that was mostly during the daytime so we're not using I have that pump doing that evening time so that was how we went about uh the second phase of our upgrade we were able to manage situations until we go to the Final Phase or not necessarily find out but to the current stage of our upgrade so the current stage of our upgrade has two 200 h batteries so instead of additional 100 eh we added to 208 so that gives us an additional 408 and 400 amp hours so adding it to whatever we had what we had earlier that was 400 basically now 800 hours and then we also added two more panels that is 180 watts of panels so that also gives us a total of 1080 watts of um solar you know energy or energy which is being drawn from the solar panels so as you can see talking about the upgrade especially with regard to the solar panels we've sticked to the same wattage of solar panels so we started 180 Watt and all our upgrade has been with 180 Watts so so that is an important consideration especially when you have a certain solution of solar system and you want to upgrade it's always advisable recommended to stick to the same size of their panels yeah especially the panels but for the batteries we're able to upgrade from 100 age to 200 h this time around now that solution or this current solutionary we have has brought the total solar cost up to around seven seventeen thousand five Android City so it means that we spend around 8 500 about for this particular solution that was because one of the 108 watch and 200 age batteries was selling for like around two thousand four hundred they're about and then you have to buy two more panels and I had to get a rails and then um the other accessories that I needed and then the mc4 connectors and then the cables and so on so that brought the total um upgrade to like around that um amount and the current upgrade we have is able to take almost everything that we have in the house so the fridge is now able to Pop 24 hours without any challenges we don't have to tear it off at any point I'm able to use part two so you saw me do some DIY works here um with the first few racks I was using my parts when I was there um grinding machine using it as a sandpaper machine and then I even have worked on another DIY project which is like a small dining table which I'll share with you later and I was able to use a circular saw also which takes consumes about 1200 watts of energy so I was able to use that throughout the entire project and be able to use our pump be able to use our ion we're able to turn on the lights you're able to use fans yeah so everything we have in the house the current solution that we have is able to pop everything so like I'm saying this has only been possible because of the solar system and we started small we upgraded to certain points and now we've upgraded to what we have now if in future there's a need to upgrade it's still going to be easier because you're able to add up more panels to it as well as add a battery to um whatever we have now also adding up there two more panels to our solar system we had to add it to this particular point where the sun rises from so it's able to draw much energy as compared to where the sun sets or you know um yeah from the middle point to where the sun sets so basically that's the current solar system that we have the total cost is around 17 500 cities for six one else for Batteries you know six batteries so four of them are 100 each other two of them are 200 each so another important consideration also especially with the solar upgrade was that um the outside lights that we had that was a LED light outside acid then was 50 watts each so that means that uh when we turn on all the lights that was like around 200 watts and that was a lot so there was a need to also change those ones to something which was a little lower So currently what we have each of them are 10 watts each so that gives us a little total of like 40 watt so 200 watts to 40 Watts that's okay and the brightness is not so like not so bad especially what we have like a brightness is very very okay in the evening so that is also an important consider we needed to take into action so we don't consume so much of energy that we have you know solar energy is a little bit unlimited there's no unlimited as compared to maybe um the they're great and even the grid is also Limited at some point but you only feel it when it gets to a crucial point when it has to be load shedding so that was also an important consideration we had to take um interaction um especially with the outside lights also one of the reasons why the cost has increased a little bit was because of changing prices asset you know this dollar situation that we've had for some time now for inflation so prices of goods has you know gone up so much High the amount we bought the first point was the first set of panels for we didn't get the same amount for the second set of panels and even the last set of panels also was different prices the same with the batteries the amount you got it too much the first two batteries was different from the second set of batteries and then also the final set of batteries also was um different and then with the cables the mc4 connectors and everything so in as much as it might look a little bit expensive because we have done this over like a period it hasn't been so expensive and at least it's it's been wetted I must say because we've been here now like officially three months now and if we were supposed to be paying electricity bill I said now we would have had to spend like around 600 or 8 close to 800 cities for electricity based on the things that we have um here so that is not so but I believe that in probably some few years to come it's really going to pay off um and I'm even sure there's going to be some increment to electricity or utility type so yeah the solar system so far has been good all we just need is just energy from the Sun or daylight and we are good to go so I've also been nominated for the UT greatest Awards and their category of um real estates now there are what is happening sometime in November so I'm going to leave a link in the description so you can kindly try to vote for me thank you very much so that would be just about it for this particular video maybe you might have some questions or things that you which was not so clear you can just leave them in the comment section and I'll try as much as possible to respond to them so that'll be just about it for this video thank you very much for watching bye for now",
