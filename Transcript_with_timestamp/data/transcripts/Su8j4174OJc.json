  "text": "welcome to sturgeon Creek farm this is a family operation that we've done Wilson's sturgeon Creek farm in Jackson County has been in his family since 1831 before Jackson County was a county today Wilson the eldest of three sons farms these rolling hills with his three sons formerly a diversified farm with cattle hogs and tobacco Wilson now runs a cow-calf operation with both commercial and registered Angus cows he calls it a typical Mountain farm without the bells and whistles Wilson is working with Jackson County AG Extension agent David Coffey improving her genetics in his breeding program but it's about more than just that it's it's the total operation it's it's how we're managing forage is how we're going to manage water how we're doing a nutrient that was produced on the on the farm through the manure how we manage that how we manage our wildlife have a manager our timber just a total program Wilson has big goals for his farm for improving forages fencing and rotational grazing and letting the cattle do most of the grazing while cutting some for hay those ideas are in line with what coffee has in mind and with this program I wanted to focus on the broad entire operation so everything from their forages their genetics their you know rotational grazing their even their forestry and you know horticulture if somebody's doing some of that so I wanted to check to try to you know cover everything and just help them to better manage exactly what that producers doing Wilson is one of about 17 producers who started out in the program two years ago including the happy Hollow Farm owner Bob Hornsby is working to downsize his cow numbers from 125 to about 50 to make it more manageable he is adopting many of the principles on his farm being touted by coffee to get on a total pastor program maybe feed one month the other year or just when it snows so I worked with David quite a bit on that he did all soil test last year and so we've got our soil testing so we work very hard this year to try to get everything hopefully we don't have a drought Hornsby plans to use rotational grazing using nine pastures to move his cows through to utilize the forages and hopefully feeding less hay Hornsby and Wilson are trying to follow the plan designed by coffee and so far it seems to be working I've been very pleased with with the progress and the results from it and what a lot of these guys are doing they've made some real progress and to look at it you might not think it's that much difference but it was just like we said here at me on 500 acres you make one one change in management you know that influences the whole operation a lot from the University of Kentucky College of Agriculture Food and environmental",
