  "text": "the newborn stage is over and now we have our new challenges [Music] so so [Music] i gotta hurry i gotta hurry i got the baby monitor in my pocket and the baby has just gone down for a nap got the boys working on some school work and listening out for him and i've got to quickly get these animals hey before the baby gets up babies on the homestead lots of work but we can do it silly cows are napping in the morning and the goats are waiting for fresh hay and titus is waiting for fresh scratches oh yeah what's your big billy just gotta get in and get out right right big guys you've been driving in the mud have you playing any muddy noise so we have been opening this gate and letting the cows and the goats come out and forage all this pasture here they call this the cow pasture and that the goat pasture because ideally that's what it'll turn into we've got the temporary electric net fence going all the way around the tree line and last night way back in the corner one of the sections came down so i could not let them out today and they had to stay in the ducks are molting again we still are not getting any eggs from them don't know why they are a little bit older i think i probably need to hatch out some eggs this year our chickens have knocked over their water again they are not laying either so we have not had eggs and i'm getting pretty sad about it with the gorgeous warm weather we've had because even though it's rained every night it has been sunny and warm during the day the last couple of days the bees are so happy they're doing very well most days i try to wait till that first morning nap of the babies to come out and do the hay that's pretty much all i gotta do in the morning so while he's laying down i try to run out and do the hay some mornings he comes with me because he's not taking a nap or what have you and then a lot of these nice days we all come out and play the boys come out with me and i lay add a blanket for the baby to play on it doesn't stay on the blanket anymore he crawls all over the yard eating leaves and twigs just like a goat and he enjoys it thoroughly but because we had so much rain the ground is really wet so that wasn't really an option today even though it's warm t-shirt weather he would get soaking through if he crawled on the ground today unfortunately but let's go see how the quail are our quail house has turned out to work perfectly the quail are nice and protected in here from the elements and they still get some good sunlight in here coming through the sides so they're also doing really well but unfortunately they're not laying eggs either they're taking a little winter break right now we actually had to buy store-bought eggs because i haven't been able to meet anybody locally yet that sells eggs that would have been my first choice but i don't get out much and i don't meet new people very often so hopefully soon we'll have eggs again this is about the time of year that our chickens start laying again after their winter break so we're crossing our fingers we will have lots of eggs soon and we will even start incubating once we have our fill of eggs and we're back into being happy full bellies we're gonna throw a good batch into the incubator and hatch out some quail some ducks and some chickens so i'm really looking forward to hatching season the garden is pretty much the same as it was the last time the one bed of garlic is all we have in the ground i sure do miss having a winter garden where i can harvest greens and roots all winter long but by next year we will definitely have that going again and i cannot wait i can't wait to see this whole area bright with green new growth in the spring we are super excited to start sewing seeds we're not planting outside yet but we are going to begin planting our seeds in here i've gone through most of my seeds by now and sorted and arranged them by category i will be doing that one more time before i'm officially into the sowing season but boy is it hard when you have so many seeds one of those things that we worked on this weekend besides sorting the seeds was getting the seed shelf ready so we have heating mats grow lights on two shelves and then once they have germinated and they're doing okay temperature wise and they don't need the heat mats anymore we can then transfer them up to the top shelf because we have solar coming from the roof then as they get bigger and bigger hopefully we'll be moving them out to a sheltered location as we transition them off one really cool thing that i am able to do this year is i became an affiliate with mary's heirloom seed i have been promoting mary's seed for over a year now because of the quality and the service that she provides is above and beyond um pretty much any other seed company out there and luckily she invited me to join her affiliate program and so now i have my own link that you guys can use to shop for your mary's heirloom seed it doesn't change the price of the seeds for you but it does help me out just a little bit so if you want to use that i'll be leaving it in the description down below yeah baby black gold this is some wonderful compost that we were able to get because we participate in the composting program that ryan works for so we turn in our compost and we get a certain percent back those finished compost love it so excited to add this to our new beds something else i've been spending a lot of time with through the winter is i don't know if you can see but i've got all these beautiful plants in the house all of my house plants i've kind of gone overboard i've been propagating a lot of them and i'm hoping that i can start sharing them with other people we'll be sharing a lot of vegetable seeds with some families we were doing the food box program through the summer where we were handing out hundreds and hundreds of food boxes to people and we're looking to adopt some families to help get them started growing their own veggies and we're going to provide the seeds and the information and the guidance and mentorship as long as they are willing to provide the labor so if you know anybody who lives in the carrollton georgia area have them reach out to me by email wholesomerootsblog gmail.com the goats are fat and sassy we've got this bar across here to keep the cow from going in and messing it up the cow uses the other side as a lean-to shelter we do have plans to make a pallet house over on the cow pasture for the house but for right now the lean 2 is working just fine we've had a really nice mild weather for the most part a little bit too much rain but i can't complain about that because i'd rather have that than a drought we moved here in the fall when we would normally be breeding all of our goats and after the move nobody really came into heat thyme is the only one that i have confirmed bread from the fall there is one other dough that might be bread but i'm not even positive of that so this week for some reason all of my doughs have been coming into heat so we have now bred um kitty hearts fancy and shady the ones that have been with us for a long time so that's pretty awesome we are not breeding our most senior doe ruby she is being retired she probably could go another round but her body condition isn't good enough to be re-read anyway so we're going to continue to fatten her up and hope that she can live a nice long retirement with us for those of you that have been with us for a long time you've probably noticed our reduced herd getting ready for a move meant we had to reduce a lot we are actually down to only 10 goats now can you believe it i i honestly cannot believe it i don't remember the last time i only had 10 goats but with adding in two cows and moving to a new property i felt like this is a great place for us to be i feel like i'm really comfortable where we are we're going to have some new kids coming along i might choose a couple of does out of those that i like to and can see potential for and we may keep them but we also want to kind of focus on what we're doing and the garden and the cows are going to be some pretty hefty projects for us um the garden being new we're going to have to see what kind of battles that we have to face having a garden on this property in a new property you never know what kind of pests you're going to have what kind of weeds are going to be around we don't know what the deer presence is going to be we just really don't know so we're hoping to get a good handle on the garden in this location this year and start lots of new projects some new birds that we're going to be hatching and that's pretty much going to keep us busy i think with a new baby i mean he's eight months old now guys but that's actually when it starts to get a little harder because he can crawl he can get around he can get into things so the newborn stage is over and now we have our new challenges so it's going to be an interesting ride make sure you check out our facebook group and our facebook page we have lots of information we share there you can contact us there to answer any of your questions and we'd be happy to help you also if you haven't checked out our wish list in a while go ahead and check that out i was just reminded that i even had a wish list when we had a wonderful subscriber purchase a couple of things from there just this week it filled my heart with joy all right guys i'm gonna go back in and hopefully be able to finish a cup of coffee before the baby gets up rowan everything okay yep okay thank you",
