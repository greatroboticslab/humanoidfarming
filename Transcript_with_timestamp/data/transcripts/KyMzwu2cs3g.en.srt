1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,120
guys welcome back today we're gonna use

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:07,520
an ideal 48 inch tiller you can see

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,120
right here in a previous video we use an

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,360
all-purpose plow

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,960
three passes down and back this is the

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,799
finished results we're going to compare

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,400
those results versus the results of a

8
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,520
tiller this is the same day alright so

9
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,439
we went and hooked this up right

10
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,039
afterwards gonna go down and back see

11
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,359
the results with one pass compared to

12
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,439
three passes if needed we'll go down and

13
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,439
back again and i think i'm gonna run

14
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,840
this tiller over top of what i plowed

15
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,840
already that's just not a good enough

16
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,079
result for me there to want to plant in

17
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,840
so i'm going to finish that out smooth

18
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,440
it out for a good seed bed before we

19
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,280
seed later this spring now you guys know

20
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,680
i'm a big fan of dirt dog equipment but

21
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,600
dirt dog does not offer a four foot

22
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,879
tiller so something for your subcompact

23
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,600
tractors the 1025r kubota bx anything

24
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,920
and that smallest footprint of modern

25
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,920
day tractors so the 48 inch that we

26
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,600
offered this year is by ideal farm

27
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,199
equipment so this is going to be similar

28
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,120
to the dirt dog that is a made in the

29
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,879
usa with some foreign or imported

30
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,239
components like the gearbox for example

31
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,080
so we're trying to get away from the

32
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,320
maiden china stuff whenever possible

33
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,400
last year you saw us running tar river

34
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,640
tillers and land planes and it was

35
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,560
kind of our last season with them for a

36
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,920
number of reasons but so we're switching

37
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,000
over to more north american-made

38
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,759
companies as is the gist of it so this

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,360
ideal tiller is gonna be four foot wide

40
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,799
it's gonna have a slip clutch on it

41
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,920
something that i actually notice i don't

42
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,600
see very often is um just basically slip

43
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,040
clutch maintenance or almost like a

44
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,640
checklist over here on the sticker so

45
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,240
that's kind of nice to see too so we'll

46
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,400
have similar features what you expect

47
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,400
what you want to see on a tiller so i've

48
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,840
got the gearbox up here this is gear

49
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,040
driven on the side it's not going to be

50
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,720
chain driven i like that a little bit

51
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,400
more robust i believe

52
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,159
swing gate on the back with this chain

53
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,840
so you can adjust that swing your gate

54
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,600
open if you want to or not you're going

55
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,960
to have a parking stand over on this far

56
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,040
side now this has four blades per flange

57
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,880
and the thought process i think with

58
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,119
ideal is that you're going to put less

59
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,280
strain on a subcompact tractor versus a

60
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,719
six blades per flange so we'll be able

61
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,399
to see if there's a difference in

62
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,560
performance as we're tilling today but

63
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,640
something interesting is that on the the

64
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,240
flanges themselves that the blades bolt

65
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,399
onto there's extra holes on there

66
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,879
there's four extra holes you have two

67
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,200
bolts per flange so potentially you

68
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,520
could stagger in a different way add

69
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,560
another flange or two more

70
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,560
wow look at them geese

71
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,440
that's a flock

72
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,599
so what i was saying was that on the

73
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,200
flanges underneath here right now you

74
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,840
have four blades per flange but there's

75
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,599
extra holes in those flanges so there's

76
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,080
four extra holes total which would

77
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,920
equate to a total of two extra blades so

78
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,760
i almost feel like you could potentially

79
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,440
add more blades onto each flange if you

80
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,959
wanted to but we'll check out the

81
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,480
performance with four blades see how it

82
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,840
does and we can make a determination

83
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,400
from there a couple more features you

84
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,360
might be interested in this whole plate

85
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,920
that you see down here kind of

86
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,920
underneath the housing is adjustable up

87
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,360
and down so you have multiple bolt holes

88
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,120
so you can adjust this kind of skid

89
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,440
runner to help out with your depth and

90
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,599
speaking of max depth it is up to a

91
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,319
seven inch tilling depth which is

92
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,560
typically unheard of on a four foot

93
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,319
tiller i don't really see the need to go

94
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,760
seven inches down but it's nice to know

95
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,920
you can and of course if you didn't

96
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,599
notice this is quick hitch compatible

97
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,920
we're using the spiko cat one quick

98
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,120
hitch this one does not use any bushings

99
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,640
all right so we sell an absolute

100
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,480
boatload of these things for that very

101
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,920
reason but you don't have to use a quick

102
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,280
hitch if you want to just hook it right

103
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,040
up to your category one three-point

104
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,080
hitch you can do that as well it's

105
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,760
standard 540 rpm rear pto just got the

106
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,760
pto shaft hook it up right to the back

107
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,680
of your tractor have the safety chains

108
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,200
the shaft cover all that good stuff too

109
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,360
now something that's mentioned on this

110
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,360
sticker on this side and maybe somewhere

111
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,599
else as well and just for your general

112
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,920
information most gearboxes these days

113
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,599
are coming empty without any oil in

114
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,040
there maybe there's just a trace film

115
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,599
just to kind of coat the inside of the

116
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,519
gearbox but that's due to different

117
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,239
shipping regulations federal regulations

118
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,799
that

119
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,239
limit or or don't allow at all any

120
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,840
fluids to be shipped and so that's the

121
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,080
reason behind that so it's always a good

122
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,519
idea to check your gear boxes before you

123
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,959
get to work and speaking of work we're

124
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,720
going to get to it right now as always

125
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,879
we're sponsored by borah wheel spacers

126
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,200
they are made in america have a lifetime

127
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,640
warranty if your tractor feels tippy

128
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,239
side to side especially if you have a

129
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,920
cab on it then adding a set of wheel

130
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,200
spacers can make a big difference get

131
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,390
more information on them at the link

132
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:31,110
down below

133
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:31,110
[Music]

134
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,479
so

135
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:45,690
[Music]

136
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:55,230
[Music]

137
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:12,379
[Music]

138
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:28,510
[Music]

139
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:47,839
so

140
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:47,839
[Music]

141
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:56,019
[Applause]

142
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:16,830
[Music]

143
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:16,830
[Applause]

144
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,600
all right so we just did one pass down a

145
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,840
one pass back so that's single

146
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,160
coverage right there and it is slower

147
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,759
than using the plow there's no doubt but

148
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,199
when you have to go multiple passes to

149
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,440
get these results

150
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,440
versus one pass to get those results

151
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,759
i'll leave that up to you now you're

152
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,880
going probably twice as deep

153
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,720
with the

154
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,400
the all-purpose plow compared to the

155
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,919
tiller that's about four inches deeper

156
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,759
so maybe four and a half some are right

157
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,039
in there i would guess this is around

158
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,360
eight

159
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,720
maybe nine in certain places but it's

160
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,199
inconsistent right there's a lot of

161
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,240
areas that didn't get plowed up so you

162
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,160
have those

163
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,000
deeper furrows that did get plowed up

164
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,160
and then chunks of sod that are still in

165
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
place and that's after three passes back

166
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,400
and forth and it was a very jarring ride

167
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,120
doing that this was a very smooth ride

168
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,039
very easy to do a consistent seabed all

169
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,560
the way across there and you can still

170
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,280
see some

171
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,960
grass and other debris and matter that's

172
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,039
on top here but

173
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,560
same thing in the all-purpose plow area

174
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,639
as well so what i think is that you're

175
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,479
getting better results in my opinion

176
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,479
with the tiller a more consistent seed

177
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,639
bed so that when you go to seed you're

178
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,240
going to have an easier

179
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,080
chance or more

180
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,919
higher likelihood i guess of having

181
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,680
consistent seed depth so if your clover

182
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,599
seed needs to be a half inch down or

183
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,800
brassicas need to be an inch or inch and

184
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,160
a half or two inches whatever it is

185
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,680
whatever you're planting

186
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,880
you're going to have a more consistent

187
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,280
chance to do so versus having chunks of

188
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,280
sod that are way up high and

189
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,120
very solid other areas that haven't been

190
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,800
tilled and turned at all and then deep

191
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,720
referrals that are just going to be

192
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,000
tough to work with and you really

193
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,360
wouldn't want to plant in this you'd

194
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
want to come back through with something

195
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,479
else a disc maybe break up those clods a

196
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,520
cultipacker to smooth it out as well but

197
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,000
again

198
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,680
it's a lot more work a lot more passes

199
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,840
to get the same result as what a tiller

200
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,960
can do in just one or two passes so at

201
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,720
this point i'm going to leave what i

202
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,240
just tilled all alone i'm going to come

203
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,080
through what i plowed with the

204
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,319
all-purpose plow and try to get that

205
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,720
resembling somewhat uh what the tiller

206
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,319
did over here and then well let's see

207
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,440
we're in april probably about a month

208
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,440
and a half still technically i'm

209
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,639
probably a little early on my tilling

210
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,199
we're going to come back through and

211
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:28,319
plant our screening cover that we have

212
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,479
so it's a giant screen it'll grow up to

213
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,320
it's over 12 foot tall in one season so

214
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,080
you can plant it even in in june and

215
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,000
still get i think it's over 10 foot in

216
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,360
height it's a crazy cool

217
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,959
type of plant that you can get and so

218
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,719
we're actually a new dealer with

219
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,399
northwoods whitetails

220
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,000
who sells this product along with all

221
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,000
sorts of food plot seeds too so we're

222
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
going to plant plots all over this place

223
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,680
this year get the screening cover here

224
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,440
closer to the road a lot of different

225
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,360
areas so access to stands that kind of

226
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,640
thing too going to have a lot of fun so

227
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,160
if you want to see what's going on out

228
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,600

247
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:48,230

248

[Music]

249
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,880
all right guys i'm going to finish up in

250
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,120
just a minute but these next two rows

251
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,240
here were done over the plowing that

252
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,079
we'd already done with the all-purpose

253
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,680
plow so

254
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,760
i mean these results are just so much

255
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,760
better i don't

256
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,320
i don't really see the need the

257
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,920
requirement to plow before you till

258
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,279
i mean what we did over here just

259
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,360
tilling

260
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,519
plowing and then tilling and then just

261
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,120
plowing you can see the results i think

262
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,440
speak for themselves okay we're just

263
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,000
wrapping up just thought of it but

264
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,040
this is the performance with four blades

265
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,600
per flange on the tiller all right so

266
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,560
i've always used six blades per flange

267
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,240
there's no way you could tell the

268
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,880
difference between four and six blade

269
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,320
this did just as good as any

270
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,120
six blade

271
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,480
tiller that i've used so

272
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,399
i think you might be able to add more

273
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,000
blades onto this one if you needed to i

274
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,399
don't know for sure i'll have to verify

275
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,480
that but the way it set up stock with

276
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,240
four blades on each flange works pretty

277
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,000
darn good so i'm gonna get that knocked

278
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,079
out but if you guys are in the market

279
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,279
for something for your tractor whether

280
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,720
it's for the three-point hitch or the

281
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,880
front end loader could be pallet forks

282
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,639
could be a snow pusher

283
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,480
it could be a tiller could be a snow

284
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,959
blower it could be a brush hog you name

285
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,000
it we can help check out

286
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:04,000
