  "text": "hi my name is nat from living the dream permaculture and today i'm going to talk to you about some of my favorite gardening books i was recently asked if i could share this so i thought i'd make a video and hopefully help some other people who want to expand their library to learn how to grow their own food preserve their own food and learn about permaculture so i'm going to start off with the first book i ever bought i bought this about 13 years ago i got it off ebay it was a couple of bucks delivered and i only bought it because it was so cheap and it's turned out to be one of the best investments that i've ever made he can still get this book because i have checked recently for someone else and why i love this book so much it's based in tasmania which has which has a similar climate to um me here in hipfland victoria i'm in a cool temperate climate so i would only recommend this for people who garden in a cooler area this is not something you'd use in northern australia and what i love about it is that it's all organic and it teaches you how to grow each individual thing so here we have lettuce and i'll talk about how to grow it and the conditions that it likes and all that sort of stuff i've read this so many times and i enjoy it and learn something new from it each time this is something that i'll definitely have in my library if you live in a cool temperate area the next book that i'm going to talk about is this one that i got from the library it's called soil food and if you really want to improve your soil something like this would be really awesome for you in the beginning she talks about all the different nutrients and elements and how they impact plant growth and [Music] soil health and it's really really interesting um she also talks about sources um and how to naturally put that stuff into your soil and then we talk about 1 372 ways to add fertility to your soil so it's a really fantastic book full of great ideas and if you are passionate about soil have a read of this the next couple of books are from pat colby there's another one of her books that i really want to get and it's called um cattle care natural cutting natural cattle care so we've got natural farming and natural sheep care and basically these go through soil health regenerative farming trees minerals and vitamins and remedies so if you want to farm naturally um this is a really good book it talks about minerals um and how to remineralize the land she uses different technique techniques to other people um but i find it really interesting and she funds really awesome because she's got diseases and illnesses and how to remedy that with minerals all naturally so we've used this quite a lot and that's why we want to get cattle one because we would like to look up cattle diseases if that was to ever happen to us and be able to fix it before it became an issue also a local book um i do love local because when i'm reading about it i can really um put that knowledge to use on my land and this lady lives about 30 minutes away over the mountain ranges and she talks about all the different weeds and how to use them um let's find something um let's have a look comfrey or rocket salad talks about how to preserve nasturtiums and vinegar [Music] how to use it for health controlling weeds and how to eat them and how to identify them so i found that really useful in my area especially with your foraging but also on farmland because you get a whole lot of weeds out here and sometimes you don't know what they are you don't know if they're poisonous and you don't know if you can eat them or not so that's been really interesting really eye opening because there's a heap of weeds that we have here that i didn't realize you could eat or use as a stock fodder and that's really beneficial something like chickweed for example really high in protein in the seeds similar to quinoa or related to quinoa and um yeah it's called fat hem another name for its fat hen so it's called fat hen for reason because it really puts on the weight these books are all permaculture books so we've got the first three permaculture books that were ever written so the first one ever written was permaculture one which is when david was learning under bill bill was the tutor um at the university that david was studying at and this was the book that he wrote as part of his sustainable degree i can't remember exactly what that degree was but there's something in sustainable sustainability and so permaculture evolved from that um and then permaculture ii was written by bill um delving a little bit deeper and then introduction to permaculture so these are the first ones i would recommend for beginners that want to learn more about permaculture and then the next one i would suggest especially if you're on farmland is the earth user's guide um to permaculture and this is by rosary morrow who is up in the blue mountains in new south wales slightly different climate to me um or not that much different but slightly different but she's got some different ideas in here and it's presented really nicely you can see there that the illustrations are gorgeous and really helpful if you're creating your own plan or just um trying to implement some ideas on your own property this isn't bad for urban but this is probably better for rural next one i would suggest if you are wanting to do your pvc or get into permaculture design is the basics of permaculture design this helped me heaps during my pdc and basically talks you through all the equipment you need and where to get started in your design so base maps sector analysis and then all the other elements that you're going to implement um in your design so it just talks you through that and i found this really useful so this would only um be useful for people who are wanting to design i wouldn't recommend this for someone who's just a hobby permi um that is someone who wants to get into permaculture as a business as with this book the designer's manual this touches on just about everything you'll ever need in your permaculture design this is called the black book um i use this quite a bit in my pdc just to kind of get ideas and then i would go elsewhere to dive deeper into those ideas for example he touches on key line which a lot of permaculture books do and then you can kind of go to piero and stuff and dive even deeper into what key light is and how to implement it on your property but this is full of so much good stuff very expensive and hard to get but if you are wanting to use permaculture as a means of income source then having a resource like this on your shelf is really helpful so it goes through concepts in them and design methods of design patterns and understanding them climate trees and their energy transactions water soils earthworking and earth resources the tropics dry lands humid cool to cool climates aquaculture and then strategies of an alternative global nation so it's over 500 pages and it's pretty pretty good book to have if you want to um keep referring back to different ideas the next book that i'm going to show you uh more cooking style books this is the second book that i bought um actually paul bought me this for christmas and it's from stephanie alexander who does the kitchen garden foundation and this one's called kitchen garden companion and in here she lifts a whole lot of stuff all the gardening equipment you need different methods of gardening kitchen equipment um and she has a really useful chart on when to grow um certain things so what time of year and the different climates and then she goes alphabetically through a heap of different veggies quite a lot of veggies i don't think i've found anything that i've grown that she hasn't cooked with so um i'd say it's really comprehensive let me try and find a starter one so we have asian greens she talks about um they're an annual perennial soil types soil preparation climate position winter plants water requirements how to plant successive planting when to fertilize harvest period pests and organic control companion planting special information and quantities to plant for families of four and then you turn the page and it's got more information about all that so growing and harvesting container planting preparing and sharing um especially for kids so she does do a lot of like i said kitchen gardens at school so um she's really passionate about teaching kids how to grow and cook their own food um and then she goes into recipes which is really useful for when you have a heap of something in your garden and you're stuck for ideas of what to cook it's nice to open up the book and be inspired with all these ideas and then yeah so alphabetical and all the veg and all the fruit you could ever want so i really enjoyed that as a resource i got this one for an op shop for a couple of bucks and it's the same sort of principle except not as detailed he um orders his by seasons and then he has like the cabbage family carrots and beets climbing beans courgettes onions peas and broad beans pizza potatoes strawberries summer salad and tomatoes now he's obviously in england because jamie oliver is from england so for me i have to rethink the seasons and the time of year that he suggests to plant stuff um also i can't grow broad beans in summer so for me that's an autumn sorry uh late winter and spring crop another summer crop um but he's got some awesome recipes in here and that's why i've got it not so much for the gardening advice but for the recipes because his recipes are really awesome easy to follow and yummy um for australia you've got the commons um which is from matthew evans very similar to jamie at home but his recipes are a bit more fancy um what i also liked about it was that he's got a little bit of a diary in here so he'll talk about what's happening on his farm at that particular time point in time and um his recipes are really awesome but fancier so um not as easy as jamie's but still delicious his other book that gourmet farm which comes from its tv show i guess um is also written um nick haddos in here and ross o'meara this is not so much veggie um but it's more meat and dairy and how you would preserve them into delicious things like cheese and salami ham sausages um so that's why i've got this one um there are a few veggie dishes in here but it's more so chicory um but if you are on a farm and you're slaughtering your own animals and want to make chicuteri this is a really good beginner's book for that the cheeses in here are soft cheeses not so much hard cheeses but there are other books for high cheeses and if you do need to find a good book for hard cheeses let me know because i've got one that was recommended i haven't used the recipes or all the recipes in it because um i'm still learning how to make cheese and now for some more nitty gritty books books that give you um lots and lots of technical information about growing um i got these from op shops so i'm not sure if you can find them easily or not but they've been really cool um horticulture australia basically it's a reference complete reference for the horticultural industry and basically it goes through um growing planting harvesting um i can't remember if this one teaches you how to propagate by cuttings as well but this is a nice technical book when we need to reference um you know either an issue that we're having in the orchard or with other trees um or had a graft or how to propagate trees that aren't as easy to propagate as others um the ultimate australian gardening book great for referencing plants that we don't know much about um in design and in on on and on our property sorry um so it tells you all the different species here we've got cholesterols and all the different types so that's just a nice little handy book um and then the royal horticultural um studies concise inclu encyclopedia of gardening techniques so this has got the grafting um propagating and all that sort of stuff if you want to go into more details this is not just sowing seeds this is um serious plant propagation which we're trying to learn more about and the last two things that i would recommend um are two books on c savings so i've just ordered these books one is called the seed savers manual and the other ones the seed savers handbook i'll put the proper um names down below and i'll also add the names of these books down below but basically one's an australian version and one's not um but they tell you how to save seeds they tell you how far away to plant different species um to stop cross-pollination timing to stop cross-pollination and proper harvesting and storage techniques for all your seeds i read the manual before and it's full of amazing information um but it's something that i'd love to have on my shelf to quickly reference because it's something like this yellow book that i'd use a lot of um and just keep i don't know work with it but i'd keep going back to it and referencing um hiding under there referencing um techniques and stuff like that because um there's a lot of information in there and a lot of it's new for me um and it's something i want to get really good at so we can be self-sufficient in our seed production so yeah i think really useful to have yourself so i think my top ones would be if you were to only buy a couple of books definitely that book and i'd say that one too if you were to get two books and if you were to get one permaculture book i'd get the infuses guide so they'll be my top top three this one's just really really good full of so much information about how to grow all your own food this one's just great for permaculture design and different principles in there and then this one will tell you successive planting and um how much to plant for your family but also great ways to use up everything that you harvest from your garden so i hope this helps you and that you've found some new books to add to your stash thanks for watching guys see ya",
