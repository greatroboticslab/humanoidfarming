Tim and in today's episode I'm going to

be working on the footing for the feeder

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,780
pigs around their feeder and yeah I'm

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,160
going to be putting down some mulch it's

6
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,080
going to take a lot because that mud's

7
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,639
really deep this way it'll make it much

8
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,190
easier for them to stand there and fill

9
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:30,039
their bellies up

well that's 13 bags so that should about

15
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:04,260
do it we'll see how well this holds up

16
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,260

18
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,979
looks like the pigs are enjoying it

19
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,299
that'll make it much easier for them to

20
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,500
stand there at the feeder and fill their

21
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,100
bellies

22
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,740

23
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,080
