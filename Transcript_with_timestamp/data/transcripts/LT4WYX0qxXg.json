  "text": "[Music] thank you g'day hey going so we're back again it's Richard from off-road touring off now in this video it's not so much a how-to video it's more of a video of what you need to turn your Jerry can into a gravity fed system so when you are at Camp you can actually leave your Jerry can in the back of your car or if you've got a wagon lock myself or in a canopy I've got a list of bits and pieces you need to actually turn that into that system and I'll walk you through those now and show you exactly what you need to our setup it'll only cost you around thirty dollars to do it so it is a pretty cheap option rather than having to Lug that out and the dog's waiting for its ball to be thrown all right so that should keep the dog happy for a minute now firstly we'll start from the end of the Jerry can so obviously at the bottom here you have a water Outlet there or you can even fill it from it if you want to once this is done I'll show you that but you can take this off here a little plug at the end so what you do need is a 20 mil BPA thread and it has a 13 mil Barb on it so you'll find this in the uh this is from the gardening section in your local hardware store so that just screws straight into there so I've also got some uh Teflon tape now I probably don't really need Teflon but it doesn't hurt just to do a couple wraps around it just to minimize the chances of that leaking so what I'll do now I'll um put the tape on it and I'll take that little plug out hang on a minute I'll get the ball in a sec and then we'll uh show you the next step now I know I said it's not really a how-to video but that Phillips head there that I have there is not really adequate and if I want to strip the uh cap out so all I've done we're going to use this shifter shortly but that actually the back end of that fits an egg not too bad so I'll just unscrew that now and then I'll uh Chuck a bit of tape on here and I'll fit that in but this comes in handy for when you want to tighten up your thread into the Jerry can but obviously you don't want to do it up too tight because it wouldn't take much just to strip out that there but I'll put the tape on now I won't film all that bit it's not that exciting but uh I'll Chuck that in now and get that bit set up so earlier on I mentioned about this thread here so your 20 mil BPA and I'll talk you through the other um parts that you'll need as well so I've got myself a two meter uh garden hose so it's already come with the brass fittings and it's all crimped there nice and tight So that obviously reduces the chance of the hose leaking at all and then I grabbed an inline tap now that's got a uh from memory I think that had the 13 mil thread on it as well now the beauty of this is once it's all connected I'll show you but that does screw into the um the fitting on the end there and that gives you your tap and a hose clamp and the tape so just bottom screwing that in there now um You might be wondering why I didn't get the food grade hose which in my old camper trailer and stuff I definitely use food grade but this jewelry can is predominantly for washing up or showering and things like that it's we don't use it just for drinking water we prefer to buy the uh 600 mL bottles and then we if for waistbander away we actually squash the bottles down screw the lid on so you don't have big plastic bottles everywhere but just for drinking water we don't always use these of course if we need an emergency we have got it but that's why I've just used the garden hose before any of you wonder why I haven't used it it's because we normally do it with the uh oh with the water bottles that you buy and they're relatively cheap now yep and I'll just throw the ball to the dog again I'll be right back so I'll just nip that up all right so I've got that all threaded in there now I'll just hit the Jerry can in the car where I'm going to actually um have it positioned and I'll cut this hose to length make sure I cut it off the right end of the hose of course and then I'll uh show you what the next step is or the next part that I need which will be this hose clamp here so I'm just going to measure that up and I'll be right back just got the old trusty layer them in there so that's about the length I'm going to need I've just got the tap diamond in there at the moment and I'll uh give this a quick cut [Music] all right that should be the perfect length there I'll grab that Jerry can back here and I'll uh connect the hose to it all right so hang on foreign I've got but this is just one I had sitting at home so basically I've just cut the hose off there I'm going to slide that on like that and I'll get the screwdriver out the Leatherman tighten that up but before I do do that I'll show you this hose fitting so oh hang on Scout so got this fitting here which comes with the uh which comes with the hose obviously it's already connected to it so that's that's good and then I can just screw that tap on so nice and simple just an inline tap there and the other luxuries as well if you want to you can even get a connection get a connector and leave it in your car or if it's mounted permanently into canopy Etc you can actually fill that up from the bottom up but of course you want to be keeping an eye on the top and not make sure that you don't uh overfill it but I'll uh go ahead and tidy uh tighten up that hose clamp now and uh do a test run and see how it all goes make sure I've got no leaks I've got that hose clamp on the hose is on and I'll just pop this uh tap in now and then I'll fill it with water and see how we go so those of you with a Keen Eye will notice that I've swapped Jerry can so I swapped it out with the 18 liter Pro quip for the 22 liter so the beauty of this is quite simple to swap from Jerry can to Jerry can depending on your trip and how much room and all that sort of stuff so it's quite a versatile little uh setup so as you can see it all works well I'll probably leave water sit in it for a day or two and I'll swirl it around and make sure that I don't have any leaks but it's just a matter of having the Gerry can hire obviously turn it on and then there's your water so no more lugging this thing in and out of the car when I'm away on weekends and for a cheap thirty dollar mod it's nice and easy 20 mil to 13 mil Barb with a garden hose the hose clamp which most people have probably got lying around anyway and the inline tap which screws neatly into the tap fitting so oh nice and simple so and for those of you wondering who is all that barking carrying on in the background this is her here our kelpie so she's been in a couple of videos but um yeah obviously loves their ball being thrown so we'll see you all next time cheers [Music] we were on our way",
