1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,719
ever wondered how that delicious sweet

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,120
corn on your dinner table came to be

3
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:08,000
it's not just Nature's magic but also a

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,120
result of smart efficient and

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,799
sustainable cultivation

6
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:14,440
technology today we delve into the

7
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,600
fascinating world of sweet corn

8
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,680
cultivation right from the humble seed

9
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,880
to the Golden Harvest our journey begins

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,640
with a single

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,199
kernel the

12
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,240
seed this seed isn't just any regular

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,119
corn seed it's specifically bread for

14
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,520
its sweetness it's a product of years of

15
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:34,600
research and selective breeding chosen

16
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,960
for its high sugar content and tender

17
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,800
kernels once the seed is ready it's time

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,800
for planting but it's not as simple as

19
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,719
just throwing seeds into the ground

20
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,879
sweet corn requires specific conditions

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,920
to grow the soil needs to be rich in

22
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,960
nutrients and have good drainage the

23
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,440
seeds are planted about 1 in deep and

24
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,359
about 8 to 12 in apart to allow each

25
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,000
plant enough space to grow after

26
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:58,079
planting comes the nurturing phase the

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,600
plants need regular watering but not too

28
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,160
much as corn has shallow roots and can

29
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,880
easily become water logged as the plants

30
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:08,360
grow they also need protection from

31
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,159
pests there are various methods for this

32
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,920
from natural predators to the use of

33
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:16,159
eco-friendly pesticides as the plants

34
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:18,040
mature they start to Bear ears the part

35
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,680
of the plant we commonly refer to as

36
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,320
corn each ear is covered in a Husk and

37
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,439
contains rows of kernels these kernels

38
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,400
start off as small white dots and

39
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,960
gradually swell and turn yellow as they

40
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,640
fill with sugars the key to sweet corn

41
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,040
sweetness is in the timing of the

42
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,159
Harvest the sugars in the kernel start

43
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,799
converting into starch as soon as the

44
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,159
corn is picked therefore the corn must

45
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,799
be harvested at just the right time

46
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:44,920
usually when the silk at the end of the

47
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,280
ear starts to turn brown but while the

48
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,000
husk is still green once harvested the

49
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,799
corn should be cooked and consumed as

50
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
soon as possible to enjoy its full

51
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,240
sweetness but if you can't eat it all at

52
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,079
once don't worry modern freezing

53
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,280
technology allows us to preserve the

54
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:02,360
sweetness of the Corn for later use so

55
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,920
that's how a Single Seed transforms into

56
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,439
the sweet corn that we all love it's a

57
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,679
process that combines traditional

58
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:10,599
farming methods with modern technology

59
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:12,800
resulting in a crop that is not only

60
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:14,599
delicious but also sustainable and

61
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,840
efficient the benefits of this

62
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:18,800
cultivation technology are numerous it

63
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,879
allows for higher yields better quality

64
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,200
crops and more sustainable farming

65
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,239
practices it's a testament to human

66
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,720
Ingenuity and how we can work with

67
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:29,080
nature to produce something truly

68
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,879
wonderful sweet corn cultivation is a

69
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,480
Marvel of modern agriculture each kernel

70
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:35,840
on your plate is a testament to the

71
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,800
power of technology and the endless

72
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,400
possibilities it holds for the future of

73
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,840
farming so the next time you bite into a

74
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,400
cob of sweet corn remember the journey

75
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:48,319
it took to get to your plate and

76
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,319
appreciate the Marvel that is sweet corn

77
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,040
cultivation
