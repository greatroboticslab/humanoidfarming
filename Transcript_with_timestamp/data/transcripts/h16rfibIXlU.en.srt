00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,120
hey y'all it's betsy from happily ever

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:08,000
after etc and i am back with another

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,679
gardening video so today i have a few

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,080
things to plant

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,280
not a lot but i figured might as well

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,200
pop out here

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,440
and talk about it just a little bit so

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,920
the first two things

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,039
i have to plant are some more of these

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,680
really pretty blue

11
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:27,760
lobelias so they are smaller they only

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,720
get six to 12 inches tall but they do

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,239
get pretty wide and i picked up two more

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,040
one here

15
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,000
and one down there for the new garden

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,480
bed

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,200
when i first got these i think i got one

18
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,000
two three four five of them

19
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,120
um

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,200
and i really liked them but i went back

21
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,719
to get some more for this bed they were

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,960
sold out so

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,199
went back this week and they had some

24
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,399
more i was very excited so i grabbed

25
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,239
a one

26
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,399
for all the way down at the end i needed

27
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,280
just one more down there and

28
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,920
two

29
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,000
for this garden bed to just kind of tie

30
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,720
it all together and give it that short

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,760
little fun front layer that i needed in

32
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,799
a few places so we're gonna pop those in

33
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,720
and then i'm going to be planting some

34
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,439
proven winners

35
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,280
truffle of pink gomprina

36
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:22,400
so i will put a picture up on the screen

37
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,640
[Music]

38
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,439
of what these look like i grew them last

39
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,000
year

40
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,799
right in here you can see i'll show you

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,759
up close i have one coming back i

42
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:37,280
planted four now these babies get like

43
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:40,000
two to almost three feet tall and wide

44
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,600
and they they take a little bit to start

45
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,360
going like maybe mid-june mid-july they

46
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,240
really start to put on growth and then

47
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,759
they just explode so i like to

48
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,840
interplant them

49
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,960
um well i say i like like i've done it a

50
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,600
million times

51
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,119
last year i had the idea that i would

52
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,960
interplant them

53
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,200
with my fox glove

54
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,520
because the fox glove only blooms in the

55
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,680
spring you can see it is

56
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,799
it is not done there are definitely

57
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,080
still

58
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:13,440
new sims new socks coming up

59
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,920
but it is a spring flowering plant it is

60
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,840
a biannual so it only comes up and

61
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,640
blooms once every two year then you

62
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,440
plant you plant new ones for next year

63
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,920
and so i do have two of those growing in

64
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,440
that will bloom for me next year and i'm

65
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,239
going to be planning some more of the

66
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,800
camelot mix next year which holds in its

67
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,920
first year but regardless whichever type

68
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,680
you have

69
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,480
first year second year

70
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,519
whatever year they only bloom in the

71
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,080
spring

72
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:45,680
and sometimes very early summer they do

73
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,160
not bloom all summer long um and so

74
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,239
i love this little spot with my sweet

75
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,200
little

76
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:56,319
bird bath and those long tall spikes

77
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:59,120
behind my lower layers and so

78
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,360
the gomphrena that doesn't start really

79
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,000
putting on exploding growth until june

80
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,120
or july is perfect i interpret it with

81
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,720
the fox gloves and they are also a tall

82
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:13,599
pink airy spike kind of flower and so as

83
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,480
the fox gloves fade out the vampirina

84
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:19,680
really starts to take over and i always

85
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:22,959
have that beautiful tall pink element

86
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,799
in that mid layer of my garden bed here

87
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,040
on this here i'll have the glass behind

88
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,680
it so that'll be even prettier but i'm

89
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,519
very excited so my mom actually went and

90
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,840
just picked those up

91
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,159
i am at home because i have to go every

92
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,840
30 minutes and check on our new puppies

93
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,760
cinnamon if you guys have been watching

94
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,000
me i've had cinnamon with me glued to my

95
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,239
hip for the last like two weeks she

96
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,560
finally had her puppies so they are

97
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,480
resting inside they're not old enough to

98
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,480
come out here yet but i can't leave the

99
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,879
house for a while because

100
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,720
i have to be on puppy watch so

101
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,879
mom went to get the grandparent and as

102
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,400
soon as she gets here we will pop those

103
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,159
in the ground and i will show them off

104
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,720
to you but right now i'm gonna stop

105
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:06,410
talking i'm gonna put these two lobelias

106
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,920
in the ground and get them watered in

107
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:11,480
[Music]

108
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,480
coming together y'all

109
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,109
[Music]

110
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:43,499
[Music]

111
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:53,280
all right y'all the truffula pink

112
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,680
gumprina is here i'm so excited i

113
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,720
absolutely loved these last year so they

114
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,240
are like

115
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:03,440
little pink cotton candy puff balls

116
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,240
the pollinators love them

117
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,080
that they wanted

118
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,400
and they are just so pretty and they

119
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,039
really like once they get going they

120
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:17,039
fill in and they were a massive presence

121
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,039
right here behind my little

122
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,080
bird bath

123
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,039
so

124
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,280
um mom went and got these like i said

125
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:28,080
she got 18 of them

126
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,160
10 for her i asked for eight

127
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,320
so i will show you exactly how i'm going

128
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,400
to put them in here

129
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,560
over here

130
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,800
right down there

131
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,120
i have my one that came back from last

132
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,680
year now these are annuals they are not

133
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,080
perennials i'm not sure why that one

134
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,919
came back the other three didn't

135
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,720
i think it's because it's just closest

136
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:53,759
to the porch and it was really protected

137
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,160
and i am down here in alabama 8b almost

138
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,000
florida so i do think

139
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,400
that maybe if i cut these back to the

140
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,560
ground next year and i really want to

141
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,560
make a wreath out of these because i

142
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,199
have seen so many people do dried

143
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,840
gumprina wreaths and they're beautiful

144
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,720
so i really want to harvest a bunch this

145
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,880
year

146
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,400
and make a big wreath so that will give

147
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,319
me some motivation

148
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,000
cut them back to the ground i'm going to

149
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,199
mulch over them and we'll just see if

150
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,360
they come back

151
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,479
all of them next year so i'm gonna put

152
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,800
four in right here so again they fill in

153
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,960
amongst the fox glove and then i think

154
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,280
i'm gonna put four more down on the

155
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,600
other side i really liked these last

156
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,919
year and i wanted them in more places in

157
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,720
my garden so i'm going to put them down

158
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:41,600
um in front of some of my iris that are

159
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,360
also about to be out of bloom and

160
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,600
hopefully these will do well on that

161
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,759
side as well it'll also be a bit of an

162
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,599
experiment because these are definitely

163
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,080
full sun plants

164
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,800
this spot gets a lot of sun it doesn't

165
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,639
get quite as much down there um i have

166
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,280
my peonies down there because they need

167
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,120
less sun so i do think these will do

168
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,360
okay down there i don't think they'll

169
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,759
get as big so it's going to be a bit of

170
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,400
an experiment to see

171
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,000
how they do in other parts of my garden

172
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,919
maybe next year i'll put them even more

173
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,560
places

174
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:19,039
i don't know but like you saw on the top

175
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:22,639
they are um 22 to 28 tall

176
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:24,560
spacing is a minimum of 12 to 18 inches

177
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,120
they get

178
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:31,599
well that's the width um they are

179
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:35,039
annuals except for end zones 9a to 11b

180
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,800
and hearty down to 30 degrees

181
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,319
they do say you want to fertilize them

182
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,759
for best results so i will start to

183
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,280
fertilize them

184
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,800
and

185
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,360
full sun

186
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,840
dead deadheading not necessary drought

187
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,680
tolerant heat tolerant i mean these guys

188
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,759
are workhorses so

189
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,490
let's go ahead and place them and see

190
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:58,470
what we think

191
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:58,470
[Music]

192
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,840
so

193
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,680
i definitely want one

194
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,440
right here

195
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,879
kind of

196
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:27,100
right behind the little girl

197
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:30,639
and then i think i want one on either

198
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:33,599
[Music]

199
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,599
that's definitely

200
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,080
12 to 18 inches

201
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:48,880
[Music]

202
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:53,480
i think that's better

203
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,480
that'll give me more about 18 inches

204
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,160
trying not to fall over

205
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,560
crush anything

206
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:06,640
[Music]

207
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:11,200
that was a bug it was my own hair

208
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,640
[Music]

209
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,800
okay

210
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,920
so that's what i'm going to do so you

211
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,040
can see

212
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,279
the fox club are clint in a triangle

213
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:24,000
and i've just flipped that over and made

214
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,120
a reverse triangle with the gomphrena

215
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,720
that way

216
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,560
as the fox glove are going away the

217
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:33,160
gomphrena are coming up

218
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,160
i do need one more over there

219
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:45,000
[Music]

220
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
oh

221
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:58,399
[Music]

222
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,800
i have a fox glove right here and i have

223
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,519
this hydrangea right here so

224
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,800
it kind of makes it a little hard

225
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:09,120
to put this exactly 12 to 18 inches i

226
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,720
don't want it to crowd the hydrangea

227
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,560
either

228
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,320
but

229
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,440
i think that's good

230
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,200
i am going to go ahead

231
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,079
pop down to the other side and see where

232
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,360
i want to place these for because

233
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,680
if

234
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,680
there is a better spot for five over

235
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,560
there then i might just stick with four

236
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:33,010
on this side and do five over there so

237
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:36,149
give me two seconds

238
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:36,149
[Music]

239
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,279
okay y'all so i'm definitely gonna move

240
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,720
this one

241
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:45,040
down there i have spots for five of them

242
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,680
down kind of behind my panties i just

243
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,480
planted two peony plants

244
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,920
um and it is their first year they are

245
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,920
not going to flower this year they're

246
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,160
going to grow big and beautiful and

247
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,240
hopefully next year we'll have blooms

248
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,240
but they're pretty little this year

249
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,160
and you need to leave quite a bit of air

250
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,480
around candies check out my video that i

251
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,200
did i'm still learning but i did a lot

252
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:10,320
of research on how to grow candies in

253
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,160
south because it is hard

254
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,720
and i got a lot of good tips from other

255
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,680
people so i want to share them with all

256
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,839
of you

257
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,360
but you need a lot of air there's so

258
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,240
many maps

259
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,560
eat a lot of air

260
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,880
around your peonies when they're fully

261
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,640
grown and so there is a lot of space

262
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,920
around them right now that they do not

263
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,839
need this year

264
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,839
but they will need in um

265
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,240
the new year the year after that in the

266
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,320
next couple years as they grow so

267
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,320
filling that space with annuals is not

268
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,279
necessary

269
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,279
but it is a good way to still have color

270
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,440
in that space that will eventually be

271
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,200
filled with beautiful peonies and this

272
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,880
year can be filled with beautiful gum

273
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,320
free so

274
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,560
we'll stop talking about it we're going

275
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,920
to put these babies in the ground

276
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,480
got my gloves

277
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:03,279
i've got my little shovel this area is

278
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,320
pretty tilled up i um i planted here

279
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:08,320
last year and i used my auger to really

280
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,000
aerate the soil before i planted this

281
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,079
here

282
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,800
so i'm going to try to use my little

283
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:17,360
spade so as not to disturb

284
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,360
the roots of the things already growing

285
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,279
i do not

286
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,360
want to hurt the fox gloves or the

287
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:26,000
hydrangea or anything else that i have

288
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,560
in here especially my fox gloves that i

289
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,160
have going for next year because

290
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,519
then i've started at ground zero all

291
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,079
over

292
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,760
also i need new gloves i love these but

293
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:39,200
i have literally

294
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,480
literally more holes in them

295
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,000
all right

296
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,839
i'm gonna be careful cause i do have a

297
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,040
couple seeds in here that still haven't

298
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,880
germinated

299
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,440
they might not they might be dead but

300
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:52,800
i'm hoping they'll still come up

301
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:55,519
they're also for fox club so

302
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:58,320
eventually i want this whole

303
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,160
area to be full of foxglove as well as

304
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,120
over there just popping out of the back

305
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,240
border with the gladiolus and the iris

306
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,560
but

307
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,720
oxford expensive i bought a bunch of

308
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,560
seats to start for next year i'm going

309
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:14,200
to start them inside

310
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,200
like a real gardener

box store

314
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,480
or at your local nursery which is where

315
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:35,200
i got these three

316
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,200
i actually have not seen a single

317
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,639
fox glove at a big box store this year

318
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,000
i've been looking so i wanted to get

319
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,000
some more inexpensive ones

320
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:47,199
haven't seen any

321
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,440
these i all bought from dolphin

322
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,800
nurseries which is my favorite local

323
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,240
nursery

324
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,079
here in the area check them out

325
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,920
um

326
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,880
other two the white ones that are almost

327
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,240
done

328
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,480
i got from

329
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,760
buzz and blossom's nursery which is

330
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,519
actually

331
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,519
i believe owned by the same family

332
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,240
they're a little rebound so let's just

333
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,240
tease them

334
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,040

336
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,120
that was literally perfect

337
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,440
i don't know if you were supposed to cut

338
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,000
these back as you plant them like you

339
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,959
are with some other things like um

340
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,560
petunias or verbena i'm not going to

341
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,920
because i still want to enjoy the fox

342
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,880
gloves so i definitely don't want the

343
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:11,120
comprehensive start growing like mad yet

344
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,399
they shouldn't they need heat

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,680
to really grow

00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,120

347
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,420

there aren't multiple spires but you

379
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,360
know

380
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,640
they're pretty close

381
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:43,559
[Music]

382
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,559
gonna get these

383
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,480
it is literally the end of the day

384
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,760
shadiest part possible but

385
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,919
still human and alafrica mammal

386
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,840
and get these babies watered in go pop

387
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,960
the other five in and i'm gonna call it

388
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,430
a day

389
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,529

392
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,160
all right y'all i have my three little

393
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:35,679
truffle pinks here

394
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:39,440
and another two here behind this peony

395
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:41,840
and behind this peony i also moved

396
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,160
the begonias up so all these begonias

397
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,400
were here last year

398
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,200
and for some reason they're coming back

399
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,760
so

400
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,919
i'm just gonna let them do their thing

401
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,679
and we'll see how they do but you saw i

402
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,760
had to pull out some old landscaping

403
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,760
fabric

404
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,280
i put it in last year when i did the

405
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,280
border

406
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,600
and it was to suppress all the grass but

407
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,039
the grass is definitely dead under there

408
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,200
and it was starting to inhibit the

409
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,360
growth of some of these things

410
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,520
you cut a hole for your plant but i

411
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,760
would notice at least with the begonias

412
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,919
they weren't growing through properly

413
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,600
the bigger rooted things were fine so

414
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,520
i've just been pulling it from around

415
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,159
the begonias and hopefully they will

416
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,679
fill in better this year but

417
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,840
there's that truffula pink it should

418
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,919
give us a nice mid layer there once all

419
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,919
these iris are done

420
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,960
and back there as well we'll see how

421
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:35,039
they do over here since it's not as

422
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,120
sunny but

423
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,960
in the meantime let's pop over here real

424
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,960
quick and i will show you

425
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,919
up close the other ones and we will be

426
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,600
done

427
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,080
all right

428
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,280
you can see that baby truffle of pink

429
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:51,280
there

430
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:53,440
and there and whoop one right there so

431
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:56,240
this is the one right here in front of

432
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,280
this box club it's coming back from last

433
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,159
year

434
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:02,159
they're not too different of a size so

435
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,640
we will just see how this area fell down

436
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:07,120
but i gotta go take care of cinnamon and

437
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,480
those puppies so i'll see y'all later

438
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:35,300
bye
