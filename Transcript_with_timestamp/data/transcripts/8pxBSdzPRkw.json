  "text": "one of the most important thing about micronics is that you have the number of chicken you have up there the ratio has to match the number of uh uh fish down there ABS today we be discussing with you about micronics my name is mar John I your host in betel Farm where the fish are if you can look at it carefully we have our M massive pump here our suive pump is inside the water so from from the water the submassive pump takes it to to this filter here we build our mechanical filter and from our mechanical filter we have our biological filter this is where all the bacteria are formed after after the bacteria is formed it runs through the PVC pipe down to the grow beds and from the grow bed that is where the plant absorb all the nutrient that is taken from the pond the fish pond and also after observing it it sent it back you can see the water comes back here as a clean water so that the fish can have good oxygen one of the most important thing about micronics is that you have the number of chicken you have up there the ratio has to match the number of uh uh fish down there so if you are putting if we put 10 chicken to 100 fish which is very important because if you miss the ratio the amount of uh the amount of chicken if you supersede that of the fish then the water will become so acidic and all your fish will die so it's it's 10 chicken to at least 100 fish in the pond depending on the number of uh depending on the size of the pond you want to build so your ratio has to be accurate about uh micronics so here what we do is that this Pond right here is uh 22 M by by 3 m and we put 10 chicken 10 chicken to 100 fish so if we put two chicken 20 chickens that means we have 200 fish there so that is the ratio we use so that the water will never be acidic because it's very important that your water remain in an alkaline form so that is very important because from uh just as I said from this place here from the pond it goes to the mechanical filter from the mechanical filter to the biological filter and everything what the what the chicken release to the fish and the fish come consume it and whatever the fish release it pass out to the plants and the plant in return absorve all the nutrients and in return send it back to the fish as a clean water why do we do this kind of farming is very important micronics mimic natural ecosystem it encourage the growth of both plant and animal in a way that minimize environmental impact it redu dependency on large scale industrial agricultural practice making it more sustainable choice is for food security micronus can be implemented in a small space making it suitable for urban environment small household or communities which is limited to land resources this makes it very valuable too for promoting local food production and improving food security particularly in urban areas or region with limited agricultural land yes so thank you so much this is our topic today on micronics because I wanted to educate you on more what we do with micronic and please I want you to subscribe to our Channel better F and HS and please like share comment on the video and if there's any specific question you have please put it on the comment section let us know and if there's anything you disagree about feel free to contact us and we can talk about it thank you for subscribing and see you next time",
