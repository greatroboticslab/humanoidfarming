  "text": "hello my name is Brian Otis with rice tech incorporated proper grand real calibration is a very important aspect to getting off on the right foot each season and with rice tech seed that's no exception as you know we're dealing with lower than normal seeding rates so it's very important to get your grain drill calibrated so that you get a good start each season so today we're going to go through calibrating three major types of grain drills an air cedar like you see behind me we're going to go through a John Deere type box drill and then finally we're going to finish with a Great Plains type box group okay so I'm going to go through basically your supply list of what you're going to need for proper drill calibration first thing you're going to need to do is look at your bag of seed or the piece of paper that comes with a mini bull and find out what your seed per pound rate is for this particular bag we know that we've got twenty thousand two hundred and two seed per pound okay so what you're going to do is divide that number into your seeding rate which in the case you know depending on how many pounds heat breaker your number of seed per acre you divide that number by the number on the bag and when you do that that's going to give you the exact number of pounds per acre that you need to plant once you determine the number of seeds per pound either in our pre-planning newsletter that we send out annually on our website at Rice techcom you can get or you can download an Excel spreadsheet which is our calibration worksheet which works for any seed you want to plant in your grain drill works for rice takes seed works for soybean seed but you're going to need to know the number of seat per pound and the number or the pounds per acre of seed that you want to plant you'll enter that number into our calibration worksheet and our worksheet will give you the proper amount of seed that you need to catch in the grain drill to ensure that you're properly calibrated now at our website and in our pre-planning newsletter we also provide basic starting points for each type of box grain group which based on previous experience of our field tech and tech reps out in the field we've determined on Great Plains and John Deere drills a good starting point with each type of drills so that you can be in the ballpark at least from where you want to get started okay so for supplies that you're going to need first you'll need a tape measure you're going to need to measure the circumference of the gauge wheel or the transmission wheel that's actually turning the drill second you're going to need a ruler and this will enable you to measure the COG so that you can get a very accurate measurement so to which meters the seed coming out of the drill we recommend a metal ruler in metric so it's in centimeters and millimeters second you'll need a calculator just to help you do some basic calculations although if you download the spreadsheet from our website the Excel spreadsheet will do that for you duct tape you'll need duct tape to mark the transmission wheel because we will be making a number of revolutions with the gauge wheel or transmission wheel this will just help you keep track and where you're at finally in something that most people probably don't have will be a small electric scale in this particular case you can use a postage scale or this scale is just about just a standard electric scale that you can actually buy off the internet next just a couple of cups to help move in seed around on the drill to measure seed out of the bag to pour into the drill in order to measure the seed out of each of the each of the seed cups under the Box drill you can either use individual cups to put under the cups you can use the styrofoam cup as shown here or a standard plastic Solo Cup or if you'd rather you can use a catch catch can which you can catch several row units at one time and then you can pour it out here at the ends you know either one of these methods will work fine and then finally once you're calibrated we've come up with these handy magnets that can you can affixed to the lid in the box and you can write down your settings so each year when you come to recalibrate at the beginning of the year you've got good starting points from where you were set last year so that in the following year you'll know where to start and you can calibrate the drill on your own okay we're going to demonstrate proper calibration of a Great Plains type box true okay in order to get started first you need to make sure that the drill is completely empty all the seat cups have been cleaned out but then have been moved back up to that first position then you can go to our website and get the approximate starting points for this type of drill first thing you need to know on the Great Plains is to make sure that the transmission is in the lowest setting so on this particular drill this is a Great Plains 2020 we're going to be in drive setting number one a transmission setting number one then because this is an eight inch model drill we're going to make sure that our knotch setting is at number sixty the times these drills have quite a bit of play I'm going to go all the way to zero and then move it to sixty okay now this is just going to be an approximate starting point from this point we'll begin our calibration and then make small adjustments up or down depending on which way we need to go okay the next step is to get a proper measurement of your gauge wheel on this particular drill there's two gauge wheels one on each side that run the transmission but we just need to measure one of them because typically they're the same so the easiest way to do this is to get a tape measure and a piece of duct tape tape the tape measure to the gauge wheel and the center spin it around until it comes back and then get a measurement this particular gauge wheel is seven foot eleven and a half inches long as we're going to convert that into inches and then enter that into our and our spreadsheet as our wheel circumference okay once you get the circumference of your drive wheel you can go online download our get our spreadsheet off the internet and enter the circumference of the gauge wheel you can also enter the number of seats per pound which on your bag or on your mini boat is a listing of the number of seats per pound for your particular lot of seed you'll put that information in and then you're going to divide this number number see per pounds into the number of seats per acre that you need to plant that will in turn give you the number of pounds per acre that you need to plant you'll plug that number into the spreadsheet and it will give you the number of grams you need to catch from the predetermined number of row units and turns of the the gauge wheel and when you get that number then you'll know that you're properly calibrated we're going to come back to the back side of the grill and we're going to measure five seed cups so with this particular drill it's a lot easier to pull the tubes off of the road units and it is to pull the tubes down from the seat code we've got this handy catch catch can hear so what I'm going to do is pull five of these drop tubes off so that they lay in this catch pin if you choose to you can also use Solo cups or get some help here - just hold cups underneath these C cups if you don't have a pan like this to use to catch the C okay once you've got your drop tube set and the drills cleaned out you're going to need to go ahead and put some seed in only put enough seed in to cover the five row units that you're going to calibrate because it makes it a lot easier to make adjustments on the drill if only a few seed cups are full if the whole drills full it's nearly impossible to move the thing once it's been set so what you'll do is just put enough seed in there to fill up the seed cup and do that for each of the row units that you're going to calibrate once you get the drill primed all the seed cups are full of seed and you're ready to begin go ahead and empty your catch pan until there's no seed left and then we can begin the calibration okay once you get the drill primed and ready to go you'll enter your seed pan or your seed cups get them completely empty put the tubes back in and get it ready to go now we're going to turn the gauge wheel 15 times because our calibration worksheet has told us if we turn it 15 times we need to catch so much seed for the right weight or pound per acre that we're shooting for so I'm going to turn the wheel 15 times okay once you get through with your 15 turns before you get the weight of that seed you've got to zero out the weight of your container what you'll do is put the empty container on your scale and then hit the zero out button to zero the weight so that when you add the rice seed back into this or whatever seed you're calibrating forward back in there you're only getting that weight and not the weight of the seed plus the container and once you get the calibration or get close because the adjustments are going to be so small it'll be handy to have a ruler one of these metrics small metal rulers but you can put on the COG on the outside of the seed cup all the way against the edge of the seed cup this number will actually be much more accurate than using the number off of the leaper because in many cases there's a lot of play on these older drills so it's always better to use this number in this case we're at eighteen and a half millimeters so we'll make small adjustments up or down depending on what our calibration weight gives us okay once we get this side calibrated we might have to make a couple of adjustments back and forth to get them the weight that's specified on that calibration shoot once we've got that we recommend that you go to the other side and do the other side as well carry that number that you get from that ruler to the other side and rather than using the number off of the lever use the number off that ruler and that'll get you died in a dial in a lot closer okay once you get the grains real calibrated write your numbers on this magnetic sheet that right stick will provide and keep it with the drill we recommend maybe putting it on the inside of the lid so you don't lose it okay it's also important that once you get out into the field that you follow behind the drill periodically and check behind the drill to make sure that you're still properly calibrated in the field okay also there are several other drills that follow this same type of format you can calibrate those exactly the same way it really all comes down to measuring the gate wheel getting that information in and determining how much you need to catch based on the gauge wheel circumference and the row width your row spacing once you get all that done always be sure to check behind the drill if you've got any question you can always contact your ricetec grip or your dealer",
