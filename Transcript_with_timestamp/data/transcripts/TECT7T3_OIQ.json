  "text": "cilantro is a fantastic addition to your garden but it can be a real challenge to grow I find Cilantro is a bit of a contradiction it's a shortlived annual herb that prefers colder temperatures but it really is best in the kitchen in the summer when it goes so well with all the hot season crops it can be hard to get plants established it's a bit finicky and when the tomatoes are finally ripe enough to make salsa the cilantro is often all bolted and bitter it's also best used fresh and it's hard to preserve a surface plus if you planted too much although I do have some ideas for processing at the end of this video so I'm going to talk about how we plan ahead to have fresh plantable cilantro all year round including in the winter and if you want to see more of what we're doing in the restaurant culinary Garden hit subscribe so first things first the seed the cilantro seed is actually coriander seed which you would recognize from your kitchen both cilantro and coriander are used in Cuisines from all over the world but they both have really different taste profiles and flavors so we're just talking about growing cilantro for the leaves in this video so there's a lot of different varieties of cilantro that you might see when you're buying seed uh a lot of them have to do with their bolt tolerance so how slow bolting you'll see listed on some of the labels um some of it might have to do with the height or the growth habit or The Taste uh but really there's a few types I often have planted Calypso which is slow to bolt I've also just planted cilantro seeds from the Shelf in my kitchen it had pretty low germination rates but it did work cilantro is definitely best grown by direct seating it has a tap rout so it really doesn't like being transplanted and it'll undergo transplant shock so that means when you put it into the ground it will just basically stop growing or grow very very very slowly last year I grew some in soil blocks uh early on in the spring uh this is the cilantro here so two rows of cilantro and every second Bunch this Bunch was when I trans planted and then this is what I seeded so at the same time as I did this I also seeded little clumps of cilantro and it's interesting because this has hardly done anything here's a transplanted Bunch here's a seated Bunch here's a transplanted Bunch so I would say uh transplanting them out in early April which is like almost two months ago now really made no difference and waiting for them to come up from seed probably would have been a better bet so it wasn't really worth the extra effort of growing the transplants and then putting them in the garden it would have been better off just direct seeding so that's what I'm going to do this year you can plant cilantro in rows or in clumps the seeds can be about 1 cmet apart and they need to be lightly covered because they need dark to germinate but just lightly covered uh you want to keep it well watered until it germinates in a week or more and the ideal germination temp is around 18 to 21\u00b0 C so 65 to 70 fhe so you want to start seating them around your last frost State when the soil temps have warmed up if you want to get a head start you could warm up the soil in a bed by putting a piece of plastic over it or some row cover even though cilantro plants are cold hearty to get the seeds to germinate it really wants a fairly warm temperature soil that's light well drained not wet pretty standard for any herb or vegetable plant uh and now the hard part is don't plant too many seeds at once this is a mistake I've made year after year if if you're planting a rows maybe just think about planting a quarter or a half of the row space now and then plant another section later so the reason you don't want to plant all your cilantro at once is because it's considered a short-lived plant so it's going to bolt it's going to produce flowers and then seeds and then it's going to die when the days start to get long in the summer and when the temperatures are warm in the summer this is programmed into the plant and once it starts to bolt there isn't really anything you can do to change it the leaves really start to change texture they go from sort of a thick typical cilantro looking Leaf to sort of thin and fern like and they often become bitter and there's not as much of it to harvest either so if we look at a chart to make sure that there's cilantro all year so I'm going to start with the seeding dates and then I'm going to harvest around 6 weeks after planting and then I'm going to expect to harvest from these plants for about a month before it bolts and I pull it out so you can see if I decide to plant on May 1st I'm going to harvest June 15th 6 weeks away and then I'm going to pull it out July 15th but then I've got my second sucession coming so I've got some that I planted June 1st I'm going to harvest that July 15th which is when I'm pulling the previous cilantro bed and then I've got that till August 15th and then you can see if I do it July 1st August 1st I've got cilantro going right until the frost and that's sort of an estimation but it gives you an idea of the kind of thing you can do uh I'm probably going to plant cilantro actually every two weeks instead of every month like is demonstrated here but it gives you an idea of um what kind of timing you want and where you want to put it in your garden and you can put this in the same bed you can actually plant seeds among the plants that are already there that you know you're going to pull out or you can plant them in a different spot in your garden what are other ways we can keep cilantro plants happy and healthy in the summer so one is pick where you plant them using the sunny beds in Spring and then Shady in the summer so early on I'm going to plant in the first places that warm up where my heat leming crops aren't ready to go yet cilantro is great in the under story of taller summer crops like beans or tomatoes or cucumbers that you might have growing up vertical support so then you have some bare soil underneath and you can put clumps of cilantro we also seated this cilantro it came up and it was growing uh and I actually pulled out all the spinach around it and left it here and planted the tomatoes among it because it doesn't take up too much space Also keeping the cilantro plants well watered and mulch can keep the soil temperature down and really the soil temperature is as important as the air temperature so if you can cool your soil then then that helps keep it from bolting and cilantro will go right until the end of the season it's Frost hearty to below zero so I've had cilantro plants that are frozen in the garden um come back to life when the sun comes out and light frosts um Can are fine for it especially if it's covered with row cover and another thing you can do about bolting is can just leave some plants to bolt uh it's a beautiful flower that attracts all kinds of beneficial insects you can let the seeds go until they're ready to harvest which will take probably another month and then I harvest the plant when about half the seeds are dry pull it out of the garden uh put it in a paper bag let it dry completely I find it's hard to save cilantro seeds because as you're letting it dry on the plant they're dropping it all over the garden and so you end up with self-seed cilantro as well in the the past we've had a lot of cilantro self-seeding and it's always a good indication of when it's ready to uh germinate when the soil is warm enough when it's at its Optimum temperature so you can let these volunteer seedlings come up they might not come up in the right place but they'll come up at the right time so maybe that's a signal for you to plant cilantro seeds or maybe it's just uh a couple of cilantro plants somewhere on the margins that you can just let go and harvest from I find it's not worth it to try and move Cilantros that that are self-seeded in the garden they don't like being transplanted like I said so at that stage um either let them grow where they are or just pull them up like weeds so when you're harvesting you can cut the leaves you can either just chop the whole plant right to the ground uh and then let it regrow it takes about two weeks to do that you can also just selectively pick leaves off of the plants if you have a big clump of them that works really well and and cilantro is best when it's a little bit bigger than this um and you can harvest the leaves really easily and often I'll just pull it straight out of the ground and then keep that in the fridge so that's an easier way than cutting it I find it lasts longer because it has this nice Tap Root on it if you put that on like a piece of moistened paper towel it'll actually um stay perky and stay uh straight for a couple days it'll maintain some of that water or and when using in cooking you can also use the stems they have the same flavor and they're pretty tender and juicy so uh just chop the whole thing up and to preserve it it's a tough one drying does not preserve the flavor and I don't really find that freezing does that well either um the best bet that we found is to blend it into salsa verde or other sauces that can be Jarred or Frozen uh flavors are integrated into the sauces when they're made and then it's in a form where it can stay tasty and delicious for many months so we make uh salsa ver that we put in the freezer we make salsa that we put in jars that does take more processing time up front and and it doesn't fill the Gap in the one beautiful cilantro sprig that's placed on a dish for garnish but that's what micro greens are for so the other thing that we do is we grow micr greine cilantro over the winter so I'm using a 1020 tray here a shallow one for micro greens filling it with just a promix potting soil uh and then I'm putting in this case it was 30 gram of cilantro seed into a container soaked for 24 hours so then I spread those out on the promix and I cover it with a container just another one just to exclude the light until it's germinated so I'm going to check on this every day or so then once that done I'm going to pull it off and I'm going to put it under the lights and you want to put it right up close to the lights that you have um maybe propped up with another uh Bin and then let it grow I find it's not the fastest growing micr green compared to radishes or peas shs but uh it is delicious it has all of the cilantro flavor and all of that beautiful cilantro look that is um just really like iconic and really nice on a chili or a noodle bowl that we have on the menu so so thanks for watching give this video a like And subscribe if you want to see
