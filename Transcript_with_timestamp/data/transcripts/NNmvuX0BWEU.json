  "text": "other than the 40 minutes so I'm Grand butcher I'm cheering the session just on the on on the loose in I have a timekeeper here somewhere I think well there you go Charlie good um can we have the nord at ten to two your big stink you do what you have to do but probably everyone here knows Dirac anyway he's extremely well known scientist based up at Lincoln been there since 1996 and he's the go-to man when it comes to loosen and sub clover will touch on subcriber but mostly talking about loose in who hasn't heard Derek speak before so anyway we'll get straight into it we're going to have a 10-minute session at the end but are you happy to take clarifications all the way through we have there's this little innovation here if you've got a question put your hand up or throw this at you you have to catch it all right I won't throw it fast we'll have so I'll hand it over to Derek [Music] thank you very much and thank you for coming what I thought I'd do today is actually I'm going to talk about loosing but really what I'm going to talk about is how I got on to loosen and what the principles of it are and trying I know that the audience here is not a true Lucerne audience some of you are not actually in areas that would be conducive to Lucerne but the principles that we talk about hopefully are appropriate for all the farming systems that we work with what I'm going to do is give you some information so when I operate what I'm doing are called on station experiments so my postgraduate students they do good research that has great data integrity and farmers consider their of low currency and relevance so generally the results that come out of a field experiment done at Lincoln or done at Massey farmers are all that's interesting but it didn't happen on my farm it's that's the tendency for that sort of thing so what we're trying to do is well I actually have to do it and the students have to do that because we want good quality data but when it becomes more relevant is when we get down here and we have some case studies so case studies are often for farmers what happened in the region or a farmer - becomes of high relevance so high currency and relevance here but for me trying to publish in journals it's got low data integrity so I can actually talk to other scientists with those case studies because they're not considered to have really good controls so what we're doing is scientist is trying to operate from up here way down to here to get things to happen no personal opinion here has low currency relevance and low data integrity so you may think you know everything but actually unless it's got some science behind it it probably isn't that good and I'm not sure where we put Donald Trump on that particular diagram myths and legends maybe over here I don't know and as I mind so what I'm going to try and do is give you a little bit of data to say look this is this is what I base things on but then try and give you a few case studies of people that have implemented some of the things we've talked about in some of the results that they've got from doing so this is me you can spot me here as a callow youth look and I did wear shorts and I don't show my students that but that's pretty much how many of my students look at the moment so I finished I did some farming at Bell Pluta for part of my prank and I finished and I went overseas and I was given a book when I left it was called the village pub so we visited 87 village pubs in England my wife and I it was fantastic got us off the main roads but what I was doing it was actually working on climate change and that was 2022 many years ago twenty to twenty three years ago and at that time people were just starting to measure carbon dioxide levels and start to think about whether climate change was going to occur and as a young scientist oh well I've not really heard much about this so I did some investigation and thought yeah actually I think this is real I was working out whether we could grow wheat and Spain or not anymore what was going to happen in 25 years so that was what I was you know doing my research on and then I came higher and I was given a brief one of the nice things about the university is you given a brief we don't care what you do research on just do something very nice brief to be given and that's what it was and I said well if I put climate change with farming actually in New Zealand the predicted biggest impact is on the east coast of New Zealand it's from Central Otago through the Hawke's Bay that's where climate change is supposed to have the biggest impact and more importantly actually they're already coping with the greatest variability of climate of anywhere in New Zealand any way they cope with years of rainfall no rainfall cold with the whole lot so I didn't really talk about climate change for twenty years and some people I don't still don't talk about it with them but I talk about trying to cope with the variability that occurs from farming on the east coast of New Zealand and so that's what I did I said well let's work on that the other thing was there was no one really working on anything but rye grass and white clover when I came out 25 years ago so I thought well I'll do something different everything we do is actually on our dry land website so if you're looking for information from my research team that's basically at Lincoln University slash dryland and I'll put this presentation there as well and it'll just have today's date and go on it so you'd be able to have a look at that if you want to as well the first experiment I ever did those of you that heard me speak before will recognize this it was very simple we've got a cocksfoot pasture and we said well what actually makes plants grow here's our normal cocksfoot let's said all the water we can to it so we've just bought $10,000 with a center pivot irrigation or let's add all the nitrogen we can to it here all it said irrigation and nitrogen here and so that's what we did and we looked there was a nine year old one a cocksfoot scheme so it doesn't have a lot of leg in a minute and it was pretty grass dominant but the results actually have transferred when we've gone and worked on Grimes and rye grasses and tall fescue the same thing happen that's pretty much what the average growth rate for the dryland pasture was was about six and a half tons of dry matter that we got when we just added water we took that to ten tons now if you've just spent a lot of money converting to a dairy farm that's not a great change in the amount of yield that you get what interested me was that one when we gave those pastures all the nitrogen they needed we went from six and a half tons to sixteen tons so that highlighted how nitrogen deficient those pastures were the consequence of of that line is that farmers recognized that water wasn't their main limitation in Canterbury now remember this is Canterbury 20 years ago all those dryland farmers being converted into center permit irrigate is actually the main limitation wasn't water it was nitrogen and so to produce 22 tons of dry matter that's what they actually do is they add nitrogen and water to get 22 tons of dry matter that's pretty much what's happened if we if we look at this graph and you look at the blue line at the top this line here has all the water it wanted and all the nitrogen it wanted so the only thing that's causing it to go up and down is temperature and if I account for temperature I can do that I simply account for temperature and instead of saying that today is Thursday I accumulate how much temperature we get today and if I do that I can get my 22 tonnes of dry matter and say that that pasture grew seven kilograms of dry matter per hectare per temperature unit that I've accumulated okay so that's the 22 tonnes and I've got rid of the wiggly line and this one here is the irrigated one that had no nitrogen so which produced three and a half kilos of dry matter four that's the nitrogen gap that's what was missing in those pastures there was the potential yield gap that we have in those dryland pastures so what's happened to nitrogen applied in New Zealand well that's what's happened to nitrogen applied in New Zealand because people started doing this around here and recognised that if I put water on I'm not really getting much of response so we have increased their nitrogen footprint and nitrogen use quite dramatically in recent times with their nitrogen production is a very inefficient process so we produce a huge amount of carbon dioxide it's an energy intensive process but I'm not begging nitrogen because without it we wouldn't have seven and a half billion people on the planet that's a good thing or a bad thing doesn't matter until the 1950s there were about two billion people on the planet after that with nitrogen fertilizer it's allowed the population to increase exponentially prior to that the haber-bosch process which produces the nitrogen if you looked at farming in the 1920s it wouldn't have been much different from the 1820s or the 1720s it's really the advent of nitrogen that allowed us to grow wheat crops it allowed us to industrialize rice production that has allowed the growth of what people now call industrial agriculture so that's what happens and that's the urea use in Canterbury since about 2002 it's gone up on average eight and a half thousand tons per year every year okay now you can shake your head when you look at that but if you look at the previous graph you can understand why that's happened because they put water on and nothing grew because actually what was limiting their production and what limits their production all the time and what limits every plant's production is nitrogen I haven't got a nitrogen I don't grow so what we now have is the difficulty of we've still got yellow nitrogen deficient pastures all over Canterbury and thousand kilos are being deposited from a urine patch causing us environmental problems so there's a real dilemma on how we deal with this issue but actually we've still got in deficient pastures and if you drive around Southland in the spring and you see those urine patches that's the yield potential that you must say that's the gap that's accurate one of the other things that happens is we add nitrogen fertilizer is we stop nitrogen fixation so this is loosen and white clover and what happened to them as we increase nitrogen fertilizer application this is the percentage of their nitrogen that they derived free from the atmosphere how much did they fix with nitrogen fixation so all of it when they've got no fertilizer and then it decreases down as we increase the fertilizer rate so if we put a lot of nitrogen on we suppress the nitrogen fixation we also give the advantage to the grass and we end up with very grass dominant pasture natural state of affairs and now the dairy industry and Canada a lot of the time it is when the cows leave the paddock they call the arere truck in and and I don't have an issue with that because that's actually makes sense biologically but what I was trying to get at was this one do I really want to be doing that or can I get the dryland farmers to get somewhere between the six and a half they've got now in the sixteen that's possible by having nitrogen on the system and the way to do that if we look at sorry if we look at that from a summer perspective I'll just go back to that Griffith year you can see in both of these cases we've got a dry period through the summer if I count for that summer while looking at the moisture response what you find is here's my seven kilos of dry matter three cubed greasy day at my 22 tons of dry matter in the spring if I've got water and I have nitrogen in the system that pasture that grew 15 tons of dry matter is growing as fast as the one because it's exactly the same it's got a nitrogen and it's got water and then it runs out of water now plants are not that clever but if ever you've spoken to them recently but they don't really talk back that well they don't know they're running out of water so what they do is grow as fast as they possibly can and then bang they run out of water and that's why you've got a flat line there so we ran out of water and then the slope of verse is pretty much the same of this life of this so here's I can't do much about it but there's huge potential for me to grow feed and spring when I've got water and in autumn when I've got water if I have nitrogen in the system because nitrogen is used at the same right water is used at the same rate whether the pasture has nitrogen or not so this shows you what a bucket of water looks like here's my bucket of water in its full this is basically your soil profile on your farm when you've got fuel capacity start sweet and then we use the water as we go through the summer period and then we get dry and we've got a little bit of rainfall happening so we come up a bit but more I'm full and then at the end of the season hopefully we've filled the bucket again it's a dry land rain feed sort of system but both the dry land plus nitrogen in the dry land without nitrogen pastures used that back in a water at about the same rate because the use of water is driven by physics it's driven by the humidity the wind speed and the temperature and you know the use of water because you've heard that today we're going to lose five millimeters vedepo transpiration all that's saying is how much water are we losing from the system we're losing five mils of water and every day we lose some water not five mils if you've got nitrogen and two mils if you haven't it's five mils that's what the evapotranspiration is on any given day driven by temperature wind speed and humidity and that's what's going to happen so they're pretty much says I can use lots of water efficiently the same bucket of water sorry efficiently or not depending on with rahi being in the system so what it means is this patch here in this patch here are using the water at the same rate that clear alright so my philosophy was well if I know that it can I get dryland pastures to be more efficient than what they currently are because we know we have a limited water supply we know nitrogen makes plants grow we know we've got a meat animal demand particularly during lactation and we know that we can grow more feed in spring if we have some nitrogen in the system we want to minimize impact on a year in water be productive and profitable and socially acceptable and my answer was well I think we can do that with legumes and it wasn't that new because when I was a student that was what I was taught it's sort of changed a bit but well how do we make the system actually operate so when I started working there was I'd been taught about loosen when I was a student at Lincoln by a professor professor Langer the late Professor Langer who died last week but I've been taught about loose and I came back to New Zealand no one was talking about it so can we use soli games fix about 25 to 30 kilos of nitrogen per ton of Liam that you grow and that doesn't matter if it's beans or it's peas or its course or its white clover or its loosing or sub clover about 25 30 kilos of nitrogen fixed for nothing from the atmosphere for every tonne of legume that you grow that's what you get put into your system okay and we also know that hive eating value pastures look like that the leafy there's not a lot of deep material there's a lot of dicot a lot of liam in there and a little bit of grass so that's what we're looking for and we also know that if we want to grow animals fast and I had to grow them fast 300 grams per head per day or more then I have to actually have an MA of 12 and the only pastures that do their a mostly clover pastures good quality loose soon rate pairs ja or bidam that Mother's Milk if I get the national average of around 150 odd grams per head per day really what I'm dealing with is average rye grass growing pasture but he may have a bear team now for my dryland systems I've got a graph later but for a lot of the people I work with they had to get a lamb from birth to slaughter in a hundred days because I've only got three months of growth September October November or October November December and then it's dry so they either sell stores and get hit by a store market or they've got to grow animals quicker so if you think about that if I have a five kilo booth weight and I want to get to thirty five kilo live weight to finish I've got to put on 300 grams bahid per day over a hundred days that's just the numbers that's just what it says and to do that I therefore need high-quality pastures and we also know that animals like to eat legumes given a choice they'll eat 70% liam 30% grass so when we put them on a paddock and there's not very very much liam that's what they go and eat so we constantly put pressure on the lagoon but I wanna he'll block constantly it's the legging that gets eaten so over time the he'll block starts to deteriorate in terms of their production because the thing they'll eat when they target and particularly use they will target the high protein they'll target that need you so I asked around white people weren't using leucine at that time and got a few answers and so what I've got here is a precis of some of the results of the research that we've done in getting the lucerne system operating now I don't care whether it's a red clover and plantain or its sub clover it's white clover or what it is that might work in your farm system the principles are pretty much the same it's a liam that will drive production it's a league in that the u requires just pre lambing and.and as their lemon because that's when the greatest demand is coming on and any animal that's losing weight during that time as an animal that's harder to put back weight back on your to put more feed back into them before you take them through to toughing the following year so high-quality feed is very important through their early lactation period from an establishment perspective loosen'd does based on free draining soils with same sort of pH and fertility as rye grass white clover we saw about ten kilos per hectare and we use peat and occu lated seed particularly if you're putting in lucerne stand into an area that hasn't had one before then you need the inoculant for a lot of our legumes red clover white clover there's actually the bacteria that will fix nitrogen floating in the atmosphere here now and if you sow them under the ground they'll actually grow pretty well we generally spring so occasionally we autumn so and we generally cultivate all direct drill now leucine can be successfully direct drilled if you are direct drilling anything if it's weeds or it's looser whatever it is you should be thinking about using something like diammonium phosphate one of the things that direct drilling does is it doesn't mineralize nitrogen to give those plants a kick off because you're not actually turning the soil over so a little bit of phosphorous is very important when you're establishing a suede crop for example particularly if you're direct drilling it it becomes really important the root system the more important the phosphorus becomes phosphorus is the energy source for plants because what we're trying to do with a Lucerne stand is grow a decent tap root and this one is one and a half meters long after eight months so you know it's growing about a centimeter a day that one actually came out of Pleasant point it was sent to me by a farmer when they had a flood there a few years ago and it washed away a part of his paddock and he sent me sent me through a picture of his plant in Central Otago those you've grown driven through there you'll see there's quite a big change in that so one of the key things we've done here is autumn spraying really important if you've got a weird autumn and you've got brown top dominant pastures or you've got California thistles you're trying to kill that's the time to do it the autumn is the critical time because the plants are taking sugar down from the top to the roots so that's an author the thing that really happens every year and pretty much but even some willow trees over there that's what deciduous trees do they take the nitrogen out of the leaves and they store it in the trunk or they store it in the roots and they store nitrogen because they can't make nitrogen but it's the nitrogen that makes the leaf green that allows photosynthesis to happen so our deciduous trees actually take that light region out of the leaves the tune lovely yellow and red and all sorts of colors but it's the nitrogen they're storing and waiting for next year so does the brown top so does the Californian thistle if you want to control Kelly thistles top them in the spring we'd wipe them in the autumn with a trans locatable herbicide that's when they'll be taking sugars down so the key thing here this is low rainfall obviously is to conserve moisture and killed the root mass seek and spraying in the spring but these are really you know did and this is just to reach drilled so that's an autumn spray that's then been seek and sprayed in the spring again with some insecticide and then drilled in the drilling here as the loosens being direct drilled in here seed plus fertilizer and that fertilizer as the phosphorus phosphorus is what's keeping you warm the moment it's the energy source for all of us and for plants it's the energy source for them to do photosynthesis and it's the energy source for them to do nitrogen fixation so plants actually need phosphorus that's why we do super phosphate but here we're just talking about banding at below the plant and giving that plant a good kick off when it gets going one of the other issues that comes up is people get concerned about carbon soil carbon everyone wants soil carbon I don't want soil carbon okay this is organic Medus this is a fetch sitting on top of soil I don't mind the soil carbon down here but this carbon here actually stops nutrient cycling so one of the problems when you get a thick thatch of brown on top or a buildup of material on the top of your pasture is it's difficult to establish in here you've got to get rid of that I can't put a seed in here and expect it to grow but that's often the thatch we have when we're breaking in new lands so we've got to get rid of that thatch and we might use a rye corn crop or something like that to be able to do that that's one of the reasons that these cereal crops work so well when we're breaking in that she'll and is that we put a seed and what we're doing in that case is we can put a rye corn seed at depth through this I can't put a clover seed in here and I can't put it down here because it's too deep it won't come up but a big cereal will go in there and it'll then come up so the cereal crop in that case is being used to break down that organic matter and often farmers that put in their rye corn crop or their oak crop or whatever it might be find that the first year crop isn't very good and the reason that's not very good is because they're generally putting nitrogen on to grow this crop but the nitrogen is being used well by the microbes to break down this cabin because you've got to have nitrogen in the system to get the breakdown of that carbon so we lose some of that nitrogen but then if we break feed this through the winter we return some urine and then that urine helps and the seeking year crop is generally much better so on a dry situation that's the way we've predominantly been breaking in it sort of land from establishment in cultivated areas and Canterbury will sell in about October and we'll get our first crop in December and we graze that if it's weedy and then we start rotational grazing we don't need it to flower if it does that's great but we don't need Lucerne to be flowering as we're rotationally grazing it the key thing is to be patient I'm not going to go through all the technical details of this if you've got specific questions around this we can do it but in 40 minutes I can't give you how we do loosen ABC I just wanted to give you some principles some other principles growth is what we call kilograms of dry matter per hectare per day okay so we need to understand that growth is about catching light and one thing to keep in your head is that light is instantaneous if I don't catch the light today it's not there tomorrow the soil moisture is I can conserve that for tomorrow I can consider the nutrients for tomorrow but light is instantaneous you either captured or you lose it so capturing light becomes really important because light is the driver of kilograms of dry matter per hectare most of you think kilograms of dry matter per hectare per day what I like what's my growth rate actually what you're talking about is how much photosynthesis happened today how much carbon was made how much sugar did we make okay and then and to do that you've got to capture light and then development is when the plants flower or when do they produce leaves and those things are driven by temperatures they're driven by the same sorts of things and they're influenced by environmental signals plants can tell time and they tell it by the day length how did the willow tree know to drop its leaves because the days were getting shorter okay so that's how they're telling the time so that's our energy capture device whenever I don't have a canopy of leaves then I'm losing light from the system one of the issues we have in spring is we have our pastures so short that actually we are losing light from the system because if they're completely short they're not capturing all of the light that's available if I I just wanted to illustrate that if I've got me too squid that area here and I've got it completely covenant in the ground I have what's called a leaf area index of 1 1 unit of green leaf 1 meter of green leaf a meter of ground to capture all of the available light I actually need about three and a half meters of green leaf for every meter of ground so I actually need the leaves to be up a little bit to be capturing and intercepting the light because there's generally more light available for us than the plants have the ability to capture so we're going to capture all of that light what we found with the Lucerne was that if we irrigated the crop and we had a mean temperature of 12 and the spring it's growing about 60 kilos of dry matter per hectare per day but in the autumn it's still irrigated it's still capturing all of the light but it's only growing 35 kilos of dry matter per hectare per day so this is these are it's got nitrogen because it's a leaking so we said about trying to work out why do we get this big difference in growth rates between spring and autumn so this was a PhD students job at Lincoln and we had crops that we grazed 38 days resting and four days grazing were crops that we grazed after 25 days 19 gave them three days of resting the experiment doesn't matter too much what matters is what happened below ground so this is the start of the spring and I've got about three tons of biomass below ground because we don't often think about what's happening below ground but below ground the Lucerne stand and I suspect the red clover in the chicory have this mass of carbon and nitrogen stored and then they use that and transport it up and therefore we get high growth rates hence we get those higher growth rates that I showed you on the spring and then in the autumn in for the plants there's only spring in autumn plants only register when the days are getting longer and when the days are getting shorter that's how they tell the time and if they do that then at the end of the season this crop had got back to its three tonnes of dry matter and look pretty good so it was doing very well but the consequence of that if I was only measuring above ground was that this that's being put under the ground makes it look like it's got a lower growth rate so the difference between these two lines is that really the mean is about here this is from stuff coming from below ground up Californian thistles exploding in the spring this is from sugar being put under the ground into the rhizomes and into the roots going down that's when I put my herbicide on the Kelly thistles and get them because they're taking it down so Lucian is doing that once we understood that the same thing happening if we don't if we don't look after the Lucian stand the same thing happened in the second treatment but we killed that crop in two years because we never gave it a rest in the autumn needs a risk to get back to three tonnes to be breeding so what that told us was we can be much more flexible with grazing a loosen stand than we ever thought we could be so we now graze loosen stand I had people that are grazing loosen stands that are about 10 centimeters tall in the spring they will start when the first panic and the rotation is about that big okay now I used to be told when I was a student you wait for 10% flowering sometimes the crops with us but who's heard that he was in flower okay that's what I got told and this set of data I've just shown you is my scientific explanation for no we don't we can start when the lucien is quite small we can start rotational grazing on that or we can actually we have some people who made a low stocking rate er actually set stalked on that because they've got so much leucine on their property if they didn't have some animals on it during spring and when it's just starting to kick off they'd run in a room so we can graze before flowers of d appear ideally with using lambs the growing point is at the top of the plant so once I remove that growing point the growing point of a plant is the bit that produces the leaves it's also the bit that tells the temperature okay so the growing point at the top now with a grass that growing point is below ground so pokes the leaves above ground and therefore I can see it stopped grasses because if I remove the leaf another one will pop up because the the point the growing point the bit that produces the leaf is protected and it's below ground with loose units at the top of the plant so if I take it off it has to start and produce it a whole new one from from that crown of shoots that it's got so that's why we rotationally graze loose soon and we can set stock grasses so here we're looking at a stand pre grazing now I've got that at 20 to 25 centimetres tall as being the first paddock that we're grazing in September we've now shifted this down we're actually at Lincoln grazing often the first week of September and we're on to 10 to 15 centimetres okay so it's then becomes a really viable option because we're using it early in the spring this one looks like it's 10 to 15 centimetres because the photo has been taken on an angle but that's what a grazing rotation looks like so this is that first paddock it's got to be at 2 tons a dry matter second paddock we go into third paddock 43056 panic because we're rotationally grazing around the paddocks that all looks pretty good and I've come back here a top paddock one two and three and about three town about 30 centimetres which is perfect for going back in for the second rotation perfect height to be going in 25 30 centimeters 30cm metres tall but look these ones here gotta weigh on me so they'd be paddocks that I probably should be dropping out of the rotation and cutting and carrying so what we're in an experimental situation is very difficult to do there but if I'd shifted this set of lines down a bit which is what we're doing now then actually all of these come down a bit and I no longer have to drop those out so I'm maximizing the feed that's actually going in to the animals so we're starting grazing at about 10 centimetres tool in the spring and that's about twelve use plus twins per hectare is what we're starting on at about that point so if I've got a 20 hit deer block of low soon and maybe I've got it split in into five paddocks that's 20 times 12news plus 28 years that's 240 in a mall so it'd make sense you would have been an absolutely no problem start grazing 22nd of August that's a month earlier than we were starting when we first started doing this research I'd be quite comfortable coming into the sluicey understand now 22nd of August okay so that's very that's for me at Lincoln but it's a month earlier than we ever were previously and then it grows it continues to grow and we grew some stuff that 60 centimeters tall and you can't see a flower anywhere near it so it's this big and there's no flowers if I'm waiting 14% flowering what a waste okay so the key message is let's get on to the loosen and the spring and look after it in the autumn triplets happily grazing some malucia and grass here in priority stock lamb beef deer we've got dairy cows grazing lucerne now once they're on it they should stay on it and we want to stay on a rotation with those with that mob of animals if you haven't got loose in and you'd like to have it about 20 hectares is a good amount to start with because it'll take your Hoggett mob for example five hectares becomes a nuisance five hectares cut and carry you know but if you're just starting 28 years is probably what you want to do and that'll give you the opportunity of having five four here paddocks and being able to work some of us out and see see whether it's going to work on your property high numbers for short periods of time no more than seven to ten days on any individual panic and then they're off these bulls are quite happily grazing with the ewes and lambs and early spring in Marlborough but a fibres out there for them to eat and some salts available to them blue stone stores salt or sodium in its roots so it needs sodium to be available so it's just a normal Salt Lick gets put out whenever your grazing Lucy needs some sodium out yeah one of the things that Doug Avery started to do for those who don't know Doug farms in Marlborough it's pre grazed my when the Lucien's really lush and the spring I have no scientific evidence to say if this is good or bad but it seems to work so instead of oops go backwards go big go big oh it's not wanting to go back for me here we go instead of having to put the fibery out if you've loaned some strips the animals will actually come in here and eat this so that's the fiber and because whatever we put out is hey is not going to be as high-quality as the stuff and the paddock the animals will tend to not eat the hay you can't get every animal to eat hay because it's not quite as good a quality and they'll always try and choose the highest quality feed but if you have some strips like this then this is actually just wilted for about 48 hours before the animals have gone in and that deals with that lush lucerne that can be a problem in the very early spring and you can see the Bulls are in here eating the loose and at the same time in the autumn because we know it's putting stuff under the ground we look after the plant so what I'm trying to say is I think Lucerne fits the breeding systems really well we've got a lot of animals coming in the spring it's producing a whole lot of carbohydrate coming up producing more feed than it should based on how much light it's intercepted but in the autumn we've got to recognize it's going to slow down and so in the autumn we've got to give it a chance to build up those root reserves and that means trying to leave it have a flower or an extended period in autumn as anytime between the second week of January and the end of May that gives you a pretty big window to get it right and go here the stand needs a rest okay and that way we can keep stands or wait around for a while in terms of quality the Emmy of the leaf is always above 12 the Emmy of the steam is always about 8 the reason we're trying to graze it about 30 centimetres is because that's about 3 tons of biomass if I grace 5 tonnes I've got two and a half tonnes of leaf and two and a half tonnes of steam if I graze two tonnes I've got two tonnes of leaf in no steam it's all highly palatable there's a bear two and a half tons of good stuff in a loose sense game which is about 25 30 centimetres tall now if I'm making hay I'll probably have to do 40 centimetres because I need that bit of steam at the bottom to have hardened off so I can actually cut it and so that's why you tend to find hay crops a taller but from a grazing perspective actually that's where we want to be and I don't know what that is it's just that my hands go there so you know it's that that's what we want to go into a para can eat about that and if it's Wayne lambs probably about that but that's about where we want to come under loosen stand to maximize the quality that we're eating we can't have animal health issues so a vaccination program has to be good and I'm not an animal scientist but people tell me a seven and one is the best option for a loose hoon situation b12 injections for if you've got a cobalt deficiency and we don't flush on loosen if we can avoid it in dull or wet weather because these little spots here they cause a compound and they loosen to rise and when it rises up it's called chemists roll it actually suppresses ovulation rate so you don't get as many twins as you expect and we may find that we get that this year cuz there was a lot of wet autumn and if farmers use their loosen and it may find they're scanning and lambing percentages are down a bit but this is some recent PhD work what we found was if you're in that situation you can leave them on the loose in until two weeks before the RAM goes out so they can be going through the window if you go through the summer putting on weight doing really well and then two weeks before you want to put the rear mirror they should be off the loo soon and then you won't have a conception problem okay once they're pregnant they can go back on Lucy and no problem at all it doesn't cause abortion there's no issues with that it's just that leaf disease from fungal causes it some problems Reed got the fiber that mowing helps in that situation bloat we know about it can always be an issue I'm not going to say you won't get bloke people do get bloat and it's devastating when it happens okay sodium we've talked about because we need we need you might see sometimes animals go into a Lucy and panic and that and the third paddock in the rotation and they're just eating the fence line it's often because they're eating the weeds because the weeds have got sodium in them because we haven't they have any excess to sodium so start well that's fifteen between us enemies tool qualities maximized at thirty centimeters the leaf and the saw part of the high quality stuff dari about the residual that's in a panic once you've grazed it it's of no consequence to the plant it looks messy so if you don't like a messy looking stand you can go and trim it off but otherwise it's of no consequence drop out paddocks if it's getting away what you should be doing ana-lucia and grazing in the spring is I'm grazing panic for and my six paddock rotation what does paddock one look like I'm grazing paddock five what does paddock one look like because I want it in two paddock one the second time when it's about 30 centimeters tall so that's how you should be looking at your stand there's no defined number of days grazing rotation nothing like that it's when do I get back to about 30 centimetres and for us at Lincoln's sometimes that's been after 28 days sometimes it's been after 35 4 to 5 weeks has been what we've required when we started that short one - when we get back onto the first paddock again the second time around we've talked about an extended period of autumn growth and in some areas if you've got a wet autumn then use your grass for tapping not your loosen and weed control the weather it is then the weed control becomes really important so that's sort of an overview of loo soon and I'll take technical questions later if people have got them I just wanted to give you an overall understanding of the plant and then give you a little bit of case study stuff so this is Doug average who's who Doug speak a number of here Doug speak was retired he's in town now I'm going to visit him this weekend my own will still live in Blenheim so I'm off to visit my in-laws and I'll go and see Doug but I'll see him in Teheran we'll have coffee instead of me driving out to the farm but phrase is still on the farm I Gompers at Frazer this is the story this is the graph that really turned Doug's mind was when I shown him this one and said you know what because of that remobilize ation plus the plants never nitrogen deficient in your limited bucket that you get there at Vaughn Avery and Marlborough in the spring you can do about 30 kilos of dry matter for every millimetre of water you've gotten the soil whereas your grass is only doing about 13 so all of a sudden instead of producing two and a half tonnes per hectare and spring you're producing six tonnes per hectare and spring because you've dealt with that nitrogen deficiency that I talked about by having the league game in the system and he got that and he then started to understand that what he really was is a farmer of water and it's maximizing the use of the water that becomes important when we talk about five mils of evapotranspiration what that means is you they actually lost 50 tonnes of water from a hectare you know the process of photosynthesis is not about saving water it's about getting carbon dioxide into the plant to do that it's got a little holes that open and the water flies out you can't change that that's biology but we can maximize the use of that water by having nitrogen efficient plants and the system particularly in spring hence my desire to have sub clover and because it's our earliest growing medium that's 14th of August so obviously lots of using lambs around and one of the things that we find is that you get hog at mating as you put more weight because those new Lambs oh go back again you lambs here will get mums milk so they'll do 300 grams per head per day and then they'll get straight lu soon and it's much easier to get them up to 55 kilos by the time they come around and saved in your hog at mating and we know that as you put weight on hog it's you increase the percentage that you're going to get out of them so the whole system starts to spiral up because you've got better grown you lambs wider that from that first period of growth when they're just born right through they stay on the loose in and they're looking pretty good by the time you come to mating it's an example of them growing and just another example of if you this is October and he's still cutting some strips in here because it's been raining as a 550ml rainfall environment on Doug's property he increased the land area between 2002 and 2012 I stopped he gave me the figures every year but I stopped in 2012 because about then he started to lease a lot of land and take another farm all except when it became too complicated to try and do a true comparison between the systems but over a decade when I first sort of met Doug he went from 1100 Heatley's to 1800 a sheet numbers went up a bird about 12 percent but the key thing was the performance so we've got a 28% lift and lambing we're no longer selling stores at 13.3 we're selling 19 kilo lambs that are going off prime so we've got a 43% increase here in total lamb sold we've gone up almost 100% now I know we've got an increase in area of about a third to a half but we've gone up a hundred percent in terms of lamb production now to pretty much the same flock in the return obviously being quite high and for those of you that are interested then he's written a fairly good story that you might want to have a look at called the resilient farmer one of the key things he says about that is it wasn't playing sailing and so I wanted to illustrate that whenever you have a farm system your farm system or whatever you're operating on you know that system so you've maximized that system and its operating as well as it possibly can because wherever your farm is after say five 16 years you've got it as optimized as it can possibly be so your ability to have to change it becomes limited you already know where the animals should be on any given day or how much feed you're going to grow you've optimized that farm pretty much and so your system starts to plateau and what we're talking about is how do we implement a new technology like Lucerne grazing well generally what we find is things go backwards and Ford AG they went backwards quite quickly but this is you get a new car or you whatever it is you do something different you start to play squash and you've never played before you know there's a damn period here where you go backwards a bit and it's always going to happen because you're trying something new but what you're wanting is look if I keep on this path I'm going to stay here so I go backwards a bit and then I've got potential to increase my output quite dramatically that's what we talk about when we say transformational change incremental change is a little bit transformation is big output change what agribusiness there's a problem here and this is if you read Doug's book that sort of when I met him when he was down here you know I and it took a bit to come out and there's a risk you're going backwards ah this isn't gonna work so we have to minimize that and hopefully that's what science agribusiness technology people are doing that's their job is to try and minimize that but don't be scared if things don't work the first time you grow on a rape crop or a plantain red clover crop or whatever it might be that you try you can't expect it to work as well as what you've been doing for ten years because you don't know the nuances of that system so you have to learn how to deal with that and our job is to try and minimize this negative the output in the risk of reversion from there maybe the next thing is irrigation and you can move to another I'm not sure most guys that switch from a dryer into an irrigation actually have a problem it doesn't it's not plain sailing to fish start putting an irrigator on there's a lot of problem a lot of things to learn keep an ID it keep it thought of that process as I show you the next case study this is Bob Roy 300 400 mill rainfall and central in the Mackenzie you know Oda Matata Dundee and Lisa Anderson this is their property and what happened is they had heard Doug's story in about 2008 and they were driving back from somewhere unless there was a fir trip for Ravens down and she came into my office because she was Aniak student and she set my office and we she was asking me some questions calendar and what the questions were but Gandhi was sitting there sort of a bit bored and he saw this handout that I'd had from a field day at Doug over his place and so he grabbed that and he started reading it and then he just took over the conversation said I heard about this guy and that was it and I don't know Gandhi at all but he told me what he was trying to do and I said to him well actually your farm system your feed supply an animal demand don't match you're trying to produce a whole lot of animals in the middle of January in February we don't have any feed your for hundreds of rainfall weren't your grazing your loosen and that was about it that was about the end of the conversation you brilliantly from there from Lincoln through to America he then just talked to Lisa the whole way home about what they were going to do and how it was going to change so this is their story after ten years there was their old system see it stopped constantly chasing grass hill country going backwards because they're constantly up there looking for every blade of grass hundred-day supplementary feeding peak demand and feed supply completely misaligned so what we did was try and implement what I call landscape farming so we take the areas that are deeper soils and we put some loose in and because that's where the waters going to run - why would I cultivate this it's already hard and bony I'll let the water run here and cultivate that area in the first time they're using lambs went on they got a phone call from the neighbor the user lamb escaped and dear Lucy and paddock because until high country was traditionally cut and carried so you know outside the box getting started they had a little bit of Lucerne but starting the grazing was the big issue and in working out which bits of our landscape can we put moose in into and utilize loosen in there the best thing Gandhi did was marry well because Lisa was quite happy to cut cages and get some idea of how much they're actually producing she was a numbers person and her training and forced her to do that so they got good support also Peter Anderson my things with stock here and they recorded the numbers so in the last 12 months or so I've just being able to go back and look at the numbers over time what they found was kilograms of lamb weaned it was the number of lambs you've got times their weaning weight so that's the key period we were looking for how much how many kilos are you getting and that depends on your scanning percentage your lamb wastage and your lambing this is the key thing that changed they decreased the lamb wastage Marino's are not very good mothers any of you there's no anything about Marino's because they're generally being starved so they give birth and say thank God the parasites gone and they walk away but if they feed well then they might not walk so far and they might actually go back and inquire as to what that thing was that they just dropped or maybe - look now we've got two so the lambing percentage Liam growth rate etc you can see the 2008 system producing about 90 to 90 tons of weaned lamb and then starting to get an increase from their grazing and then a bit more and then a bit more near no reversion I'd like to say that's because they had some intervention from good agribusiness and myself so they're backwards but that's what happened and you can see now the same property is essentially producing 150 tons of weaned lamb when it was producing 90 it's a 50% increase and they've done that on a four hundred mill rainfall environment and there you use mated hasn't changed very much initially so what you find is you don't have to change your stocking rate very much you're just feeding animals better paths place are we all right okay that's good because I am - putting the two together you can see those steps and stairs and that's the the change the key take-home message they listen to advice and acted on it that was the key thing I'm just here the advice they actually listen to the advice and acted on it so the lucerne story has worked pretty well it's defined a lot of systems people are making money out of it the sheep milk goat milk people they're all wanting green chopped looser because they know it's the highest quality feed if you're making if your product is milk out of sheep you need high quality feed to do that and rye grass cab I'll flick through that one except to say that part we knew 5 to 35 kilos in 100 days the other plant we've been interested in and we're working on more at the moment is sub fly though so this is the 11th of September Ashley Dean at Lincoln and what we're finding is we're able to produce animals that are growing 300 grams per head per day very early and within a hundred days I mean Ashley Dean is essentially a grave all for those who don't know it's a stone farm at Lincoln that they put some soil in pretty much what the dairy cows are on and most of the plains there's not a lot of soil there but within a three-month period we are averaging 300 that's about 330 grams per head per day and if you do that 300 grams per head per day the time to go from 25 to 35 kilos live weight is about a month or is if you're only doing a hundred grams per head per day it's three months so you've got to have animals growing fast have to get 20 to megajoules per day if I've got 12 megajoules from my Lucerne they need to be out two kilos of loosin per day that's what I need to eat to be able to do that and then they're gone in a month from a sub clover story if you're interested in sub clover this is amol broccoli team Paulo David and Joe Greg and their staff is online on the beef and lamb website and what they pretty much did was all through grazing management David learnt how to graze he didn't even know he had sub clover on the property when we visited he didn't know it was there and he grazed it properly get that sort of pasture in the spring and his values here saying he's gone from sixty to seventy six tons of meat all they did was put in stock water and fences so they could manage this sub clover no seed introduced in that so if there's any seed merchant to you but they just managed what they had and knew which league in was going to work in their environment you can have clover and sometimes that can be too short so I just wanted to finish sometimes high quality feed is not good enough by itself there needs to be intake this is too short and what you find this is a sheep well then you may have a living and a half but a decent intake so you can get decent and take here depending on what the herbage mess is so you can't just have high quality feed there's also got to be a decent Amanda herbage so I might take home heroes sometimes our pastures are too short and it's not the quality of pasture that's limiting our production it's the intake you've got to have both and that's why the lucerne works is why the sub clovers work and there I've done sorry I'm around Moran til the end of the day some people got questions happy to answer them thanks Graham we looked at our place because we were in the Waimea Valley and I see that's got the greatest change in climate and so you're looking towards drier okay and I thought a great idea we plant looser well then I looked around and there wasn't a paddock that didn't have fill tiles in it that required some extra care with that help bed is looser in field trials I'd put the loose in in and find out very brave I'll give you a ring so so what we know is that it will find them and it'll probably block them but the advantage you get out of it I suspect will be worth the hassle and I'd have a go and I'd find the dryer of the paddocks obviously north west face if there's any slope at all any contour I'd go under those contours first but the benefits are so great that I would give it a go that would be my advice and if I get it wrong well you've done a panic and I'm sorry but at least unless you do it we're not going to know how far no what what is your the the highest rainfall that you can suitably okay loosen it rainfall is a misnomer it's when does it rain okay so a lot of people think they've got 1200 millimeter rainfall and go you should be dairy farming but actually it all falls in June and July and August actually what matters is how much rainfall do you get in October November December January and February if you have six weeks eight weeks of dry then it's worth putting loosenin it's worth having a go with a deep taproot of legume that will give you some summer production and you only got three weeks of dry well most years you'll get through there so the amount of rainfall doesn't matter it's when it falls that really matters so yeah it's easy to say 400 mils and a dermatology absolutely you've got to do it but I've got people at a thousand mils of rainfall that are still doing loose in because they're back they've got soil like this it's already fall if they get another 200 mils of rainfall in August and September not actually helping that's when it falls that matters hm could I've got the nod for another year you just do a few water tables at 20 meters and you're 20 meters yep and you're your tip rates going down a meter and it's you got Tim which is dry is is it still beneficial and you're farming on Gribble if you found me on gravel what else you going to grow and I've had situations and of people that sell the gravel ringing me to try and kill the elusive because at the end of the load that going down to get the gravel they were still loose in routes at six meters so it won't stop at a meter it'll keep going down as long as there is moisture there now if the water table comes up we don't know whether that will cut but you know if you've got a water table that goes up and down but if it's just down there and you've got gravel nothing else is going to grow on it so I know that situation I'd probably look at all them selling but we can talk about there at morning tea because you're wanting to stop there nothing to do you want other people to bring this issue to a close I've got people busting to get into the door just like you to think Dirac please and the normal sort of work I don't it always a it's quite remarkable you get the top-flight speakers they make reasonably complex sort of discussions quite simple and easily understandable and Derek's a real cracker at that and just an addition to the round of applause you can drink this on the aircraft on the way home it's for you and that's for you as well and many thanks again Derek so you mean a good thank you [Applause]",
