  "text": "okay my name is Julia Django I work with the international life research institute a theory based in nairobi can i work with the team that looks into animal genetics and breeding basically am our vision and our goal is to try and use livestock and the practice of language ethics and breeding to try and help change the livelihoods of livestock keepers in developing countries one of the developing countries we've had the privilege to work in is Nicaragua which is in Latin America a totally different system from what we would generally find in Africa and Nicaragua is unique they keep animals both for milk and meat products because um they produce both milk and meat for export all american countries but also some to the united states of america nicaragua's is a developing country in terms of the livelihoods or the incomes for their farmers are really still no but livestock does contribute significantly to their national economy in nicaragua and we found that there were a lot of livestock keepers that own smaller land sizes with herd sizes of less than 25 animals that's between 10 and 25 animals and these are the livestock keepers of me felt would be important to help target to to change their their livelihoods as part of the livestock and fish strategy the objective was how do we use genetics to help change the way in which the breeds that the animal of the farmers are keeping we produce products for for their lives but because we didn't have a lot of information on Nicaragua we had to begin by trying to understand the environment and the systems that we were working in husk and following the baseline and we immediately realized that all the small almost all the small holder farmers kept a bull and the other thing was there was not one single breed type that you would say this is the main print type being kept by the farmers but they had a variety of crosses not really pure breds but crosses most of the crosses were crosses to Brahman but you had like brown swiss crosses Jersey crosses holston crosses and that immediately I'm raised raised a lot of questions as to why and what happened so following the baseline way we decided let's go back to the communities and talk with them and try and learn from them and see what influences that practices and what would they need to do what would they try to change if they were asked to change from from experiences elsewhere the best way to get farmers to to give you information is using their animals so we organized for the group discussion to be held on a farmers farm so and we we requested them to get a farmer who had enough animals of the different variety and to try and see if we could actually at the same time give feedback and have training on the choice and selection of different pretax what struck us immediately went for their follow-up or the feedback workshop is that it's mainly men who attended within the whole group there was only one woman who came and her peculiarity was she was already an extension worker so she was an extension worker as well as a life storekeeper that was the only thing that made her feel free to come and sit among the men to talk but otherwise all the other participants were men but the farmer's wife and his children were available to prepare the meals and cook for the group that came so they offered that service and they they were subsequently facilitated to cook for a group that came for the training as part of them process of group discussions we have developed a series of tools that we used and small group work to try first of all just share with the farmers what we saw from the baseline the different breed types and then we raised questions related to the types of animals they were keeping and the practices that they they were using and in in the smaller subgroups we got the farmers to define what were the traits of importance but particularly our interest was the breeding practices adopted to help change their heads and what they knew about them the farmers noted that here's they they understood the use of AI because for cattle production mean artificial insemination is not really cause rapid and drastic changes in the hearse over a short time so they said they do know about the practice but they don't really use it much and the question came to why they said well projects do bring up a I and they adopt it but then after that the air is not available so they don't use it anymore and then we asked them what do they like about the animals that they use and they they choose that the traits that they would desire in their animals their vision was the order a mother could produce about 15 kilos of of milk and had good growth rates because the curves that were born to their cows are often sold off to other producers who then raise them as animals for slaughter so that way then they have been the dual purpose nature of the animals but one thing that was concerning each one of us was their promotion also of different breed types within the farmer hoods in in the process of having the group work we decide let's have a practical demonstration so we requested the farmers to go and actually look at the animals at their farmer kept and we separated them into groups and told them to identify the two best in terms of the traits that they felt were of interest to them as livestock around breeders it was very interesting because when the farmers selected their cows physically the end of the day when we asked them why they selected their cows and then we brought up what they had listed in that discussion it turned out that they were kind of two different lines along which they were selected because they selected the live animals based on the color and the physical appearance externally of the animals without looking at the other characteristics without looking at did the animal have any records or information on them without looking at any historical background on the animals and yet during the group discussions these are the things that they had said would guide their choices of which animals they would use now of course then that that for us are served as a learning point at the point where you could help guide to the farmers in terms of these are the principles you look at inbreeding so following that the discussions we will go back to plenary sessions but because the whole morning and day's activities had been quite busy took a break and decide let's have some refreshment in some lunch as facilitators we were given good treatment and were asked please come and sit in a separate room and so we went us and said master bedroom and then what surprised us was as the women served us they said they had a question to ask and so we said yeah I'll go ahead and that question was you know this AI that you talk about well when you use it how low you have to wait you know when you see a cow wanting to be mounted how long do you have to wait before it has to be served if you really want to get that cough so we asked that's an interesting question have you tried to use the AI which is this yes we've tried but we never get a cuff so you no longer use it because every time we try to use if we don't get a car and so we asked what what's the process when you try to use the AI she says or well I see the animal in heat then I tell my husband but normally he waits until the following morning and then he sends for the AI technician wheel after all by then it is too late because the animal is probably cycled and lost the psycho says yes in fact normally I'd then push it beside the boon or near the labor spoon and I'll get the cuff that I need but the next question was where can I get information on what to do so immediately we notice that though the women were not present at the workshop it didn't hear that the women were not humorous to manual or learn about the braiding or the use of the different technologies but it also tells me that the woman didn't want to use them it's just they didn't have the knowledge required so we requested our partners on the ground do you think we could try and have a workshop where you just target or bring the women together and try and find them and this this was possible and it was arranged and when the women will ask what training do you think we should try and organize for you immediate reaction was trained us on how to manage the production and use AI if we can use air effectively then we don't have to keep these bulls and maybe we could change our heads you",
