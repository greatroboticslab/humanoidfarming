2
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:07,890
I'm Jeremy Smith and Trish Jenkins so we

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:11,250
have a little farm mixed vegetable farm

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:13,110
here in Spearfish Valley and we're kind

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:16,289
of halfway through our sixth season here

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:19,170
the Spearfish Valley is in western South

7
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:21,750
Dakota twelve miles from Wyoming we're

8
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,550
the northern Black Hills when we started

9
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:27,180
the farm we were marketing through the

10
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:29,609
farmers market in town and then three

11
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:32,009
years ago now we moved one of the old

12
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:34,320
farm stands from down the road to the

13
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,570
front of our place and started selling

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,629
just direct from the farm we have a

15
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,399
pretty good crop rotation that we're

16
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:44,070
happy with some of its on a four-year

17
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,260
rotation where it's peas and beans corn

18
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,210
or garlic potatoes and then winter

19
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,160
squash so that's one of our four year

20
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,899
rotations and then the rest of the

21
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,750
vegetable beds are on an eight year

22
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:57,149
rotation between families a big part of

23
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:00,680
our land management practices is we're

24
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:04,199
doing a mixed vegetable production on

25
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:07,170
using no-till methods

26
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:10,250
and that's requiring a lot of mulching

27
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,899
and cover cropping we're trying to have

28
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:16,680
the soil covered pretty much all the

29
00:01:12,899 --> 00:01:18,509
time if we have gaps in the in the

30
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,440
vegetable rows we're trying to get cover

31
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:23,970
crops in there and get living roots

32
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,049
feeding the soils of pulling carbon

33
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,000
dioxide out of the air through

34
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:29,009
photosynthesis and feeding soil

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,950
microbiology increasing our soil organic

36
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:33,509
matter because that's one of the reasons

37
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,799
why we're trying to build the organic

38
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:37,140
matter in the soil and keep things

39
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,220
covered and we're on sort of a not too

40
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,229
temperamental but a little bit

41
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,899
temperamental watering system and if

42
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:44,729
it's dry and the waters shut down if

43
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:46,440
there's like it up the line breaks or

44
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:47,909
something you don't have to stress too

45
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,619
much about not having water back there

46
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:52,590
because the soil has that resiliency to

47
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:55,170
manage some dryness there seems to be a

48
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,539
push of matching that like the no-till

49
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,149
and soil health principles from bigger

50
00:01:57,539 --> 00:02:03,509
agriculture down to the small scale that

51
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:04,920
I think a lot of new farmers or people

52
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:06,420
like ourselves that didn't grow up in

53
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,459
agriculture but that are coming to it

54
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,880
are coming to it and seeing like the

55
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,920
benefits of soil health practices and so

56
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,630
they're trying to apply these things

57
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,790
that have been figured out on big scales

58
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:21,600
shrinking them down to like how do I

59
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:22,769
have like arugula crops here and still

60
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,269
not disturb the soil even though I've

61
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:28,170
got tiny little seeds that I'm trying to

62
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:30,510
plant we're growing organically beyond

63
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:33,000
that we're trying to minimize our off

64
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:35,579
arm input so as much compost and

65
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,519
nutrients that we can generate on farm

66
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:41,190
we're trying to do that and the crop

67
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:43,079
rotation has helped us with nutrient

68
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,790
cycling on the farm and making sure that

69
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:46,280
we can

70
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:48,680
kind of feed everybody appropriately

71
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,840
yeah and that we're not like pulling all

72
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:54,829
of a certain nutrient out by having the

73
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:57,709
same crop in the place over and over

74
00:02:54,829 --> 00:03:00,329
trying to get people on the farm and

75
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:02,430
engaged with the local food system I

76
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:05,579
think is a an important part of what we

77
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:07,680
do in addition to the farm stand we also

78
00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:09,780
take some produce to a couple of local

79
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,359
restaurants in town I guess we'd say

80
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,010
that the like awareness of local food

81
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:17,489
and support from the community has grown

82
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:19,079
over the last six years awareness of

83
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:21,900
local foods in kind of it some of the

84
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:24,209
benefits are just just kind of starting

85
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,730
to like snowball here so it's really

86
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:29,280
exciting to kind of be here at the

87
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:32,639
beginning of that and kind of watch as

88
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,739
the local food system develops so once

89
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:37,349
in a while we get asked why we're

90
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:41,010
farming or why we're we're doing this or

91
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:44,579
why in Spearfish or part of its that we

92
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:47,909
both really like like massive challenges

93
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:50,189
that are like multifaceted and we have a

94
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:54,269
friend that farms in new hampshire that

95
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:56,010
has a beautiful like quote that farming

96
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:57,420
is not rocket science it's a lot harder

97
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:00,359
than that

98
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:03,540
which we love so that kind of like

99
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:05,940
challenge of farming but also the the

100
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:09,720
idea that like we can do really good

101
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:11,579
work that is beneficial in as many ways

102
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,079
as possible so like the carbon

103
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:16,889
sequestering the feeding the community

104
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:19,440
the like education component like that

105
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:22,229
the farm every aspect of it can be a

106
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,510
positive and feel rewarding I think is a

107
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:25,110
lot of why we want to do it

108
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:35,159
you

109
