00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,480
Hey there. Welcome back to the

5
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:58,160
homestead. Today we are working on the

6
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,559
offgrid um garden watering setup. Uh

7
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:04,159
what I got here is a 1100galon water

8
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:06,799
tank, a pair of tennis shoes and a can

9
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:10,479
of glue and some plumbing fittings along

10
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,880
with pipe. And um what we're working on

11
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,600
is on the top of this hill here is a

12
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,360
irrigation ditch. It's a part of a large

13
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,200
network of irrigation ditches throughout

14
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,360
the foothills of Northern California

15
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,680
here. And uh it runs right through the

16
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,479
property, which is really nice. Uh one

17
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,720
thing that we don't have is power. There

18
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:31,759
is power lines right there, but I don't

19
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,840
have a meter and a pole on this lower

20
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,320
portion of property. So, we're just

21
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,799
doing with what we got the uh most

22
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,880
cheapest way and and see if we can make

23
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,560
it work. Uh so, what I'm going to work

24
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,640
on is getting water from the there's a

25
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,799
valve there that they supply. I'm going

26
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,920
to have it tied into the top side here.

27
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,720
And then on the bottom, I'm just going

28
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,360
to do a couple valves that will uh allow

29
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,520
us to get water to that direction. and

30
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:01,280
it's I just want to have a stockpile of

31
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,920
water. Um, we'll go over how the the

32
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,920
ditch works and all that and sizing of

33
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,360
water and stuff like that. It'll kind of

34
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,720
explain why I got a tank. Um, so yeah,

35
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,319
what I'm going to do, put it all

36
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,840
together and then we'll kind of walk

37
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,959
through it and I'll just show you what I

38
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,959
did and uh hopefully it works. Let's get

39
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,959
started.

40
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:48,400
[Music]

41
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,920
So, some people might ask to prime or

42
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,000
not to prime. That's what this purple

43
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:56,800
stuff is. It's a PVC primer. When I was

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,400
younger, uh, working on a VA hospital

45
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:03,680
and, uh, we did a chiller bypass system

46
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:07,599
and we were doing 8 in PVC, 8 and 6 in

47
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:10,080
PVC, and, uh, you bet you, we primed cuz

48
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,400
we did not want any failures in any way.

49
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,080
Um, yeah, it was uh, something else. So,

50
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,760
yeah, we'd prime it and then put glue

51
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,800
and then slam them together. We actually

52
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,360
had to use ratchet straps to like pull

53
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,599
it together. It was it was uh crazy. And

54
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:28,239
some of them were like 50 ft in the air.

55
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:30,000
It was just uh it was fun. So, we got uh

56
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,239
all our fittings or all our pipes here.

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,040
I'm leaving this one a little bit long

58
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,480
in case I do run into any issues. I'm

59
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,640
able to cut this and either put a

60
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,480
coupling or a union in there. But, yeah,

61
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,680
I just like to be safe and prepared for

62
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,410
the future. Now, I'm going to start

63
00:03:41,680 --> 00:04:03,160
gluing it up.

64
00:03:44,410 --> 00:04:03,160
[Music]

65
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,000
Another good tip to have is uh when

66
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,640
you're gluing up your fittings, glue

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,360
your female fitting first and that way

68
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,280
you can set it down

69
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,280
and then uh

70
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,120
do the male fitting because this one's a

71
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,960
little bit harder to set down with glue

72
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:26,520
on the outside. So, just uh keep that

73
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,520
one on your mind.

74
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,199
And then also uh push and hold. Don't

75
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:40,120
let off right away because it will kind

76
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,120
of work its way out.

All

96
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,120
right. Well, I should probably do the

97
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,319
right thing and let it sit for a little

98
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,840
while before I turn it on,

99
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,440
but

100
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,080
that's not going to happen. I'm going to

101
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,240
give it a try. It's not under pressure

102
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,919
necessarily. It's just gravity. Um, if

103
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,680
it was under pressure, I wouldn't turn

104
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:57,400
it on. But let's see what happens here.

105
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,400
Let's give it a try.

107
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,479
While that tank is filling up, let me

108
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,880
show you what we got going on here and

109
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,919
uh this whole setup and why I did what I

110
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:48,160
did and what the future plans are. We'll

111
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:50,000
start up here at the ditch. Um, this is

112
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,399
what's known as an irrigation ditch.

113
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,760
It's a part of a large network of

114
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:57,279
ditches throughout the uh county here

115
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,279
and they go into other counties and

116
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,839
stuff like that and it just gets water

117
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:04,240
from one place to the other. Luckily, it

118
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,240
goes right through our property. Um, you

119
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,720
do have to pay for it, which is what

120
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,880
this box is. You notice there's a lock

121
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,680
on one side and then an opening on the

122
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,160
other.

123
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:20,399
Basically, get in there, clean out the

124
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:22,880
screen side, and then on this side,

125
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,880
they took it out.

126
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,920
But there's a piece of plywood typically

127
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,360
that goes in there like this.

128
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,200
I think they were having a hard time

129
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,880
getting the old one out, so they just

130
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:38,320
kind of walked away. But that plywood

131
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,320
slides in

132
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,760
down there like so. And this is how much

133
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,480
water I'm supposed to be getting. A half

134
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,320
3/4 of an inch. But right now, I'm

135
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,959
getting full ditch. So, I'm not going to

136
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,959
complain. It'll fill it up. If they

137
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,480
forget to swap it out, that's okay with

138
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,720
me.

139
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,240
Then

140
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:05,760
on the end of that box inside is a pipe.

141
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:09,360
4-in pipe. comes through the ground here

142
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,920
and pops out right here.

143
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,000
At the end of that pipe is this valve

144
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:17,200
and that allows me to control and shut

145
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,959
off the water there. One thing that uh

146
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,959
when I was plumbing this all up, I

147
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,680
noticed that that

148
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:25,760
male male slipped fitting here was not

149
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,320
really what I wanted. I should have

150
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:31,200
replaced it, but I didn't. And now you

151
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,760
can see it's leaking. So, if you should

152
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,240
replace, you should replace.

153
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:39,040
Anyway, I did a 4 inch little pipe here

154
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,680
to get me out and then a four to three

155
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:45,200
reducer, three to inch and a half

156
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:47,839
reducer. Little inch and a half pipe

157
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:51,760
running up here. Uh, the reason I went

158
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:53,680
inch and a half is the

159
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:58,160
um

160
00:10:53,680 --> 00:11:00,399
what do they call it? Not petcock. Uh

161
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,000
the fitting here I'll remember in the

162
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,160
tank here was inch and a half. So I just

163
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,600
figured might as well do full port all

164
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:11,200
the way through. Um male slip thread

165
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:15,680
here 90 down. Um I did put a shut off

166
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:17,839
here um below one because I could use

167
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,160
the water

168
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,600
without the tank if I need and also I

169
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,440
could use it as a cleanout. You'll

170
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,000
notice when I first fired it up, I left

171
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:29,040
this open so that anything that was in

172
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,640
that pipe, although I did run it before

173
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,720
I put all this on there, anything that

174
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,839
was in that pipe would kind of clean out

175
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,760
and drop out the bottom. What's that?

176
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:41,519
So, now

177
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:44,000
we're filling up the tank.

178
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:47,519
It's only been running for about half an

179
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,640
hour and it's almost full. So, I think

180
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:53,040
might be a pretty quick fill.

181
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:55,600
Uh, this is the tank. Pretty simple,

182
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,640
self-explanatory.

183
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,480
I did just level out an area for it, set

184
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,800
it down. I did put wood chips underneath

185
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,600
it just to give any voids, fill the

186
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:08,160
voids and stuff like that. Um, so yeah,

187
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,920
that's just that,00.

188
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,959
Uh, the reason I went with a smaller

189
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:16,000
tank is because I needed to be lower

190
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,920
than the ditch. And if I would have went

191
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,959
with like a 2500gallon tank, I would

192
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:23,519
have been my out my inlet would have

193
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:25,760
been like 7 or 8 ft up in the air. So I

194
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,839
just decided we'll go little and if I

195
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,680
need to, I can add another tank, you

196
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,920
know, next to it or something like that.

197
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,399
But I think this should be fine. Um then

198
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,120
we'll come down to the

199
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,680
lower valves here.

200
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,760
Uh I went with 2 in only because the

201
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,839
existing

202
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,839
it's not ballcohawk

203
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,800
manifold. I forget the existing fitting

204
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:51,040
here was 2 in. So I just decided to keep

205
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,839
it full port all the way through. I did

206
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,079
run two valves because I have a hard

207
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,079
time making decisions.

208
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,440
So this gives me options later in the

209
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,040
future because I'd have to drain the

210
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,639
whole tank in order to put another valve

211
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:07,519
in. So I can do something here later.

212
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:10,480
also irrigate the field if I need to.

213
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:12,720
Same with kind of this thing. And then

214
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,320
on this valve, being as it's the

215
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,880
straight shooter coming right out of the

216
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,160
tank, I I won't have any turbulence

217
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:23,279
issues here. So, this will just come

218
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:26,160
right out. What I did is just a 2-in

219
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:29,200
slip to male thread or slip to female

220
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,920
thread. And that

221
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:35,760
again because I can't make my mind up or

222
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:39,040
decisions allows me to do different

223
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:41,440
things. So 2 in to inch and a quarter,

224
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:45,760
inch and a quarter to 1 in. And that

225
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:48,720
just allows me to

226
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,600
adjust whatever I want to put on this at

227
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:55,120
all times. My next goal is to figure out

228
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:58,000
how to get it from the tank

229
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,560
to the garden. So, coming up, the next

230
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,279
videos will be different things. Uh, gas

231
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:06,720
powered pump, possibly a solar well pump

232
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:09,760
if it ever comes. Uh, I did get drip

233
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,160
irrigation, a low PSI drip irrigation. I

234
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:15,600
also want to see what the PSI is on this

235
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,519
tank with a garden hose over here. Just

236
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,959
see how much PSI I have. If I have

237
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,920
enough, I won't need to do any sort of

238
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:23,760
pumps. So, that'll work out great. So,

239
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,040
keep an eye out for those videos. Thanks

240
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,360
for watching. We'll see you on the next

241
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,360
one.
