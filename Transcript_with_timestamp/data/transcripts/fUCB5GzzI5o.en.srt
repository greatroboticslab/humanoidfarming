00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:34,230
hey guys Natalie here and welcome back

4
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,730
to hey it's a good life so today is

5
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,950
Friday happy Friday

6
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,079
that means that it's vlog day so today I

7
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,940
am taking you guys along with us as we

8
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,710
do all of our chores here on the urban

9
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,180
homestead and yeah I think it's going to

10
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,770
be a great day on the homestead so

11
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,700
without further ado let's hop into

12
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:53,340
things on today's agenda I will be doing

13
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,629
my exercises first and foremost a lot of

14
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,730
you guys know I sustained a really

15
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:58,469
serious injury about two years ago and

16
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,420
I'm finally just now getting into a

17
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:01,680
really good groove of healing and that

18
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:07,920
means that I have to stay up on my

19
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:10,020
exercises every single day burns it's

20
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,820
crazy to think like this is hard for me

21
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,070
right now when I used to play college

22
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,140
volleyball but I'm coming to terms with

23
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,909
the fact that I have a back injury and

24
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,500
it's gonna take a long time to get

25
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:21,360
better in fact it's gonna be the journey

26
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:25,110
of a thousand steps like so many good

27
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,290
things in life but it also feels really

28
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,290
good

29
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:36,039
[Music]

30
00:01:33,929 --> 00:01:37,450
all right I've got my worms you ready to

31
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:39,250
go I try not to make this thing too

32
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:40,179
heavy because our back injury if you

33
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,740
guys want to know how to make your own

34
00:01:40,179 --> 00:01:43,400
warranty I've got a link just click

35
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:53,000
right there

36
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:53,000
[Music]

00:01:55,510 --> 00:02:01,840
[Music]

38
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,939
while your feed my plants with warm tea

39
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,799
in the morning because that is when the

40
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:07,720
pores of the plant are most open like

41
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:09,340
think of plants right there ready to

42
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,750
accept that morning dew first thing in

43
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,400
the morning over the course of the day

44
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,050
they kind of closed those pores that

45
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,550
night they open them back up and then

46
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,080
they kind of closed as the day goes on

47
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,760
so in the morning is one of the best

48
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,430
times to feed plants because their pores

49
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,870
are more open but also it's not as hot

50
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,640
especially in the summer you want to be

51
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:26,140
mindful of when you boil your few plants

52
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,180
because you don't want to burn them but

53
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:30,610
one great thing about warm tea is that

54
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,560
the likelihood in general of burning

55
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:34,959
your plants is very low because it is a

56
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,310
very balanced very gentle fertilizer and

57
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,930
so I'm never really worried that I'm

58
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,940
gonna burn my plants but I do try to be

59
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,650
mindful of that I take care of them in

60
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,750
the morning rather than in the noonday

61
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:45,730
Sun or even at night because because the

62
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,200
likelihood of them absorbing as many of

63
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:49,030
the nutrients as possible it's just so

64
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,519
much a lower at night than it is in the

65
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:53,260
morning I love this plant so much and I

66
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,120
did not save the tag I did not write it

67
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:57,430
down and I cannot remember the name to

68
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,030
save so anyway I do you know it leave it

69
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:03,780

there we go

72
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,640
I got stuck I gotta help my tomcat out

73
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,850
he might be a little camera-shy but I

74
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,710
love him and he's my Tomcat okay at that

75
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:16,270
time we are gonna build the garden beds

76
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:18,370
and hopefully we're gonna get this

77
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:20,800
knocked out in just a couple hours today

78
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:22,300
Tommy is helping me because I'm still

79
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,890
getting over this back injury and it's

80
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,350
important to ask for help and not

81
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,820
believe that you're superwoman so today

82
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:29,650
he's gonna be helping me and I'm super

83
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,660
excited to have his help it's always

84
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:33,760
nice to have a buddy and build things

85
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:36,070
together and together we are gonna show

86
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,590
you how to build some really simple

87
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:40,510
really easy bag friendly rent friendly

88
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:46,930
garden beds I'm so excited I cannot wait

89
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:49,030
to see how they turn out all right my

90
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,320
friends let's talk about this plan here

91
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:55,030
is what you're gonna need for this

92
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:58,390
project then we are going to put this

93
00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:01,090
all together by sanding cutting you can

94
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:03,780
see my shownotes cut list down below and

95
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,780
putting it all together

96
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:09,730
I want to share with you guys

97
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:12,640
our supplies because I want to encourage

98
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:14,349
you guys to get creative you guys might

99
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,900
have stuff laying around your property

100
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:19,209
that you can use just like us we are

101
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,519
actually repurposing these cedar fence

102
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:24,580
pickets which were laying in the back of

103
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,620
our property just unused for years and

104
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:29,320
they have this really beautiful finish

105
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:31,360
that I'm about to show you I love how we

106
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,510
can take something that was old and

107
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,210
forgotten about and restore life to it

108
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:41,110
by standing it down and giving it this

109
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:43,330
new kind of like rustic patina look I

110
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:44,500
just love the way it's finished and I

111
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:46,690
want us to share that with you guys

112
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,479
because I think it's really easy to feel

113
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:50,710
like we have to use all new products

114
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,870
another thing to consider to save money

115
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:54,850
on this project is using coal lumber

116
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:58,780
which is lumber that has been damaged

117
00:04:54,850 --> 00:05:01,030
and thus discounted this piece of wood

118
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:02,710
had a crack on one end of it for about

119
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:04,630
foot and a half and so what I was able

120
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:07,300
to do is just cut that part off and then

121
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:08,480
use the rest of this beautiful wood for

122
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:11,709
the project

123
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,709
[Music]

124
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:19,170
another money saving tip is buying

125
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:24,120
lumber that is extraordinarily long this

126
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:26,220
is a 16 foot 2x4 and I bought this when

127
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,020
I built our raised garden beds about a

128
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:30,180
year ago and it helped me save a

129
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,340
significant amount of money per garden

130
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:34,640
bed so it was a decent amount of savings

131
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:37,260
and well worth the extra trouble and

132
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,120
here Tommy is helping me set up a stop

133
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:42,420
block which helps you to quickly and

134
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,480
easily cut the same sized pieces of wood

135
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:46,440
very quickly very easily and I'll show

136
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,420
you what that looks like in just a

137
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,210
second because essentially you just butt

138
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:53,010
up the wood to the stop block to the

139
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:55,410
length that you need it to be and then

140
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:57,410
you cut from there so this is what that

141
00:05:55,410 --> 00:06:12,890
looks like

142
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:15,600
[Music]

143
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:17,490
once we had all of our wood cut and

144
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,410
sanded it was time to lay everything out

145
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,030
I'm a really visual person so I like to

146
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:24,060
lay the project out to make sure that I

147
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:25,800
cut everything that I need and so laying

148
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,060
everything out in this way helps me see

149
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,410
that and I thought I would share that

150
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,240
process with you guys and keep that's

151
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:30,810
helpful to any other fellow visual

152
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:44,529
learners

153
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:44,529
[Music]

154
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:51,790
all right the moment we've all been

155
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:54,640
waiting for the actual build of this

156
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:56,380
project is so easy it does help to have

157
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,720
somebody there with you to just kind of

158
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:00,490
keep the boards in place I've done it by

159
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,650
myself though so it's fully possible to

160
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:04,720
do it on your own however it was really

161
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:06,250
nice to have a buddy and so if you have

162
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,100
somebody who can help you a neighbor a

163
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:10,750
friend a spouse a partner I definitely

164
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,160
recommend that now this is one of my

165
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,510
favorite parts I don't know that I've

166
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,580
talked a lot about this on my channel

167
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:18,130
but these I believe are called cornered

168
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:20,590
clamps and it helps me build boxes

169
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:22,690
really really easily especially if I'm

170
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:23,980
building by myself and I really like

171
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:26,530
these because it does help you get a

172
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:29,560
really nice clean 90 degree angle I've

173
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:31,300
built boxes and out using corner clamps

174
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,980
before and I don't think that they

175
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,390
turned out as well so we use these

176
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:36,310
corner clamps to really square

177
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:37,930
everything up and then once everything

178
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:39,610
is in those corner claims you basically

179
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,680
have a box and you just have to screw it

180
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:43,960
together once you've got your box it's

181
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,100
time to lay these in there I'm not

182
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,830
really sure what to call these Tommy

183
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:49,480
called these spanners and then you'd

184
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:51,800
fight your garden bed all that's left to

185
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:54,860
do is lay down the slats

186
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,860
[Music]

187
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:08,980
and here is the final product pre-stain

188
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:10,960
some of these boards are stained because

189
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:13,780
we repurposed them from an old project

190
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,510
but I actually really liked this kind of

191
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:18,340
like combination of wood colors I don't

192
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:19,390
know why but let me know in the comments

193
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:22,660
down below if you guys think I should

194
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:24,490
finish staining or leave as is now once

195
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,560
you've got the slats in these beds all

196
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:29,200
you have to do is fill them with pots

197
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,270
and that is why I think this is such a

198
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,520
genius rent friendly solution because

199
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:36,820
you could repurpose seasonal pots like

200
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:38,530
this one or you can use dollar store

201
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,210
pots like this one just make sure

202
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:42,010
whatever it is it's got great drainage

203
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:43,300
that's why I'm kind of plucking out some

204
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:45,400
of the plastic here to make sure that

205
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,600
there are good drainage holes because

206
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,900
that's really important for healthy

207
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:52,660
plants and you can also use grow bags

208
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:55,720
and that is what I am using the majority

209
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:57,430
of to fill these beds with these are

210
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,960
three gallon grow bags that I got on

211
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:01,330
Amazon and I'll include a link in the

212
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,790
show notes down below once these are all

213
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:06,400
filled I basically have a very

214
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:08,500
straightforward very portable brent

215
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,750
friendly square foot garden and I

216
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,250
actually wish I had thought of this

217
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,890
sooner because I think it would have

218
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:17,890
saved me a lot of shoveling dirt into

219
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:20,080
our garden beds but alas my failures can

220
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:22,210
be your successes and I'm really happy

221
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,000
to share this with you guys here is the

222
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:26,020
final result pre planting and I really

223
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,730
love how it looks

224
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:29,380
