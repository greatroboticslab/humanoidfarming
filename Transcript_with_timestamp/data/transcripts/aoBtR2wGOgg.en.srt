7
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:18,160
don't have a college degree yet I

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,960
managed to scale my gardening hobby into

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,760

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,880
business structure like an LLC and

profitable business hey what's up

19
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,199
everybody welcome back to Chef's Harvest

20
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,719
Farm if you're new here I'm Chef Mikey

21
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:52,120
I'm a former executive chef turned Urban

22
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:54,000
Farmer I took my backyard gardening

23
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,640
Hobby and turned it into a thriving

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,800
smallscale vegetable operation I started

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,000
out selling at farmers markets but

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,359
eventually shifted to a wholesale model

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,439
supplying high quality organic

28
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,439
vegetables to some of the best chefs in

29
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:10,320
the greater Knoxville Tennessee area so

30
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:13,000
just like anyone starting out with no

31
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,159
experience I began gardening in simple

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,200
raised beds that I built out of wood and

33
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:20,119
filled the soil from Home

34
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,759
Depot at first it was just a fun hobby

35
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:23,960
but it didn't take long before I was

36
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,840
growing more food than we could eat

37
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,680
living on a busy road always thought

38
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,159
about setting up a Farm Stand to sell

39
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,960
extra produce but instead I started Ed

40
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,600
posting extra produce for sale on

41
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:38,600
Facebook my co-workers were my first

42
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,960
customers however my hobby wasn't cheap

43
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:43,840
I was spending about $300 a week on

44
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,000
supplies to grow produce once I reached

45
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,799
a certain level of production it became

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,560
clear that I needed to invest in

47
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:52,159
refrigeration wash pack equipment and

48
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,280
that's when I realized it was time to

49
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,640
take things more seriously and formal

50
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,399
legitimate

51
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:00,360
business at first I had no clue where to

52
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,119
start I began researching ing all the

53
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,960
forms and legal requirements for

54
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:06,000
starting a business which is

55
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,479
overwhelming that's when I came across a

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,879
company called Zen business they handle

57
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,720
all the paperwork for you file necessary

58
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,400
documents and keep your business

59
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,360
compliant year after year these services

60
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,480
do cost money but for a few hundred

61
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,160
dollar a year it took all the guest work

62
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,720
out and gave me piece of mind that my

63
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,640
business was operating legally you don't

64
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,480
technically need a business license in

65
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:31,239
Tennessee until you have over $10,000 in

66
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,519
sales but just to be safe I contacted my

67
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:35,360
county clerk they issued me a minimal

68
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,519
business license for businesses with

69
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,040
under $110,000 in Revenue it was an easy

70
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:43,239
and inexpensive way to make sure I was

71
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,280
covered because once I started attending

72
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:47,360
farmers markets they required me to have

73
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,360
a business license even if my yearly

74
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,159
Revenue was under

75
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,840
$10,000 the following year my Revenue

76
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:56,519
exceeded the $10,000 threshold and they

77
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,680
just switched me over to a standard

78
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:02,360
business license that first year I ended

79
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,879
up up claiming a $20,000 loss on my

80
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,560
taxes which turned into a huge tax

81
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,640
savings if I hadn't set up my LLC I

82
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,760
would have had to pay income tax on that

83
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:15,000
$20,000 from my day job but instead I

84
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,440
got it back as a tax return while I

85
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,920
didn't know much about forming a

86
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:21,120
business initially my background as an

87
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,239
executive chef for multi-million dollar

88
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,040
food and beverage operations gave me a

89
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:27,599
foundation in managing Financial records

90
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,760
bookkeeping and

91
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,560
operations those skills became inval

92
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,959
valuable is I transitioned my gardening

93
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,920
hobby into a legitimate scalable

94
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:39,200
business once I established my LLC and

95
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,159
got my business license I knew one of

96
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,840
the biggest advantages for Farmers like

97
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:45,920
me was qualifying for a tax exemption

98
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,640
and trust me you'll want to get this tax

99
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,680
exemption before you start making any

100
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,799
big purchases because it can save you a

101
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,920
ton of money the reason you won't have

102
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:55,840
to pay sales tax on products that are

103
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,280
directly used for growing crops like

104
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,920
seeds fertilizers and tools in Tennessee

105
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,879
all you need need to qualify for an

106
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:06,159
Agricultural tax exemption is $11,000 in

107
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:08,599
sales which if you're selling anything

108
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,760
should be pretty easy goal to hit but at

109
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:12,720
that point I hadn't filed for taxes for

110
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,079
my business yet so I didn't have any

111
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,840
sales on the books so I took a bit of a

112
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:19,280
leap of faith and I wrote a letter to

113
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,280
the IRS I explained that I was starting

114
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,600
a small farm and that I wanted to start

115
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,720
making tax deductible purchases to build

116
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,960
my business I mentioned that I was

117
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,720
selling extra produce to co-workers and

118
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,160
that I plan to attend Farmers Market

119
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,560
kids and sell to restaurants in the

120
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,680
future I also included a spreadsheet

121
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,520
with projected sales for the upcoming

122
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,720
year hoping that would help strengthen

123
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,960
my case to my surprise a few weeks later

124
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,080
I received a tax exemption in the mail

125
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,560
and since then I've consistently cleared

126
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:50,520
the $1,000 Mark in sales each year to

127
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,880
stay in compliance now a big question I

128
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,919
get is whether you need special

129
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,240
licensing to sell produce and in

130
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:59,039
Tennessee the answer is no not for

131
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,280
locally grown vegetables grown produce

132
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:03,840
and selling locally is considered low

133
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,639
risk for foodborn pathogens so there's

134
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,680
no additional licensing requirements

135
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,000
however if you start crossing state

136
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:13,840
lines things might change and if you

137
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,400
decide to sell meat dairy or eggs or add

138
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,360
animals like chickens you may need extra

139
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,440
licensing but for now as long as you're

140
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,160
just selling raw veggies you're good to

141
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:25,880
go I do have a greenhouse license which

142
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,880
allows me to legally sell rooted plants

143
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,319
typically this kind of Licensing costs

144
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,440
money but I qualified for an exemption

145
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:34,880
since my main form of Revenue comes from

146
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,600
vegetables not plants I simply had to

147
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,160
show them my books to prove that the

148
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,280
majority of my Revenue comes from

149
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,960
selling vegetables the greenhouse

150
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,919
license just helps me sell extra

151
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,360
seedlings at the farmers market when I

152
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:49,280
have them available also have a license

153
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,600
to grow cannabis although 99% of my

154
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,080
business Revenue comes from vegetables

155
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,680
the Cannabis is simply a passion project

156
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,280
but for most of you setting up your LLC

157
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,240
and getting your business license will

158
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:03,000
be all you need to get started started

159
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,199
legally now let's dive into how I manage

160
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,639
my taxes and accounting once I had my

161
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,720
LLC set up for my business and started

162
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:11,840
to grow one of the first things I did

163
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,680
was separate my business finances from

164
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,400
my personal finances I opened a business

165
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,560
bank account and credit cards which

166
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,360
really helped me keep things organized

167
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,400
at this point I was still working my

168
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,319
full-time job but I knew it was

169
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,680
important to keep track of my Farm's

170
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,400
revenue and expenses so I set up a

171
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,080
QuickBooks account to help manage

172
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,919
everything however I quickly realized

173
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,479
that QuickBooks wasn't quite what I

174
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:38,160
needed as a farmer I needed to be able

175
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:40,639
to categorize expenses for schedule F

176
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,080
form which is a requirement for Farmers

177
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,880
when filing taxes unfortunately

178
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,400
QuickBooks didn't allow me to do this

179
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,319
effectively so I had to look for an

180
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,400
alternative that's when I discovered

181
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:53,160
Farm raise and I highly recommend it to

182
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:56,000
any farmer who's just starting out or

183
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,520
looking to make tax filing easier Farm

184
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,400
ra is designed specifically for farmers

185
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,400
and everything is already set up with

186
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,440
schedule F categories which made

187
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,280
tracking expenses and revenue a lot

188
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,840
simpler it also sends out notices about

189
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,879
available grants and funding

190
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,440
opportunities which is a huge benefit

191
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:14,479
for anybody trying to scale their

192
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,520
operation if you're serious about

193
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:19,360
farming as a business Farm raay is a

194
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,240
game changer next I need an efficient

195
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,680
way to take payments especially for my

196
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:26,120
farmers market sales so I opened up a

197
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,240
square account square is free to sign up

198
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,000
for and they send you a free credit card

199
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,759
reader which I use when when I go to the

200
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,960
farmers market there are no monthly fees

201
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:36,960
Square just charges you a small fee when

202
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,520
you use a digital payment like a credit

203
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,680
card since I sell mostly to restaurants

204
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,599
now I only attend farmers markets

205
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,479
occasionally but it's still super

206
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,199
convenient way to take payments and keep

207
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:50,720
track of customer orders I also use my

208
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:52,759
Square account to run payroll my workers

209
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,199
can clock in and out on their phone and

210
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:56,440
at the end of the week I just press a

211
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:58,440
couple buttons and everyone gets paid it

212
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,840
takes care of all my payroll taxes and

213
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:03,840
compliance and it's sends everybody a W2

214
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:06,199
at the end of the year for my busino

215
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,720
business transactions with restaurants I

216
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:10,800
now only accept checks or wire transfer

217
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,360
so Square allows me to create and send

218
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,080
invoices to my customers for free and

219
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,680
they can pay me via check or wire

220
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:20,199
transfer once I get paid I simply Mark

221
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,720
those invoices as paid and square and I

222
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:24,639
don't incur any processing fees the

223
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,560
beauty of using Square and farm rais is

224
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,879
that everything's linked together every

225
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,240
time I use a credit card it

226
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:32,760
automatically goes into Farm ra account

227
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,240
and it's categorized properly and my

228
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,959
Square account is also synced to farm ra

229
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,080
so that all my Revenue automatically

230
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,800
gets pulled in and categorize the way I

231
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,760
need it to be for tax season by keeping

232
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,519
everything organized and linked together

233
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,519
I don't have to stress about missing out

234
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,680
on deductions or not having the right

235
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,600
records everything I need is right at my

236
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,600
fingertips making tax time so much less

237
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,680
stressful one of the most important

238
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,040
steps I took on my farm as I started to

239
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:01,399
grow was getting Insurance to protect my

240
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,880
business at first I didn't think much

241
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:06,120
about it I mean I was just gardening in

242
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:08,320
my backyard but as I started selling

243
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,160
produce and interacting with customers I

244
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,880
realized I needed to cover myself in

245
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,519
case anything unexpected happens I use

246
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:18,120
next insurance for my liability coverage

247
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,880
this includes product liability which

248
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,440
protects me in case anyone ever gets

249
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:24,839
sick from my produce and general

250
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,279
liability which covers accidents that

251
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:29,440
may happen either on the farm or off

252
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,200
site this just gives me peace of mind

253
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,920
known that I'm covered no matter where

254
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,240
or how I'm selling my vegetables on top

255
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,240
of that our homeowners insurance is

256
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,959
through Farm Bureau and it covers the

257
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,720
structures and equipment that I use on

258
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:44,000
the farm like my green houses and

259
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,320
tractor this is a great setup because it

260
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,880
protects not just my farm business but

261
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,720
also the assets tied to it if you're

262
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,040
just starting out I recommend looking

263
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,839
into liability insurance first It's

264
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,079
usually the most essential for small

265
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:59,480
farmers for example if you sell at a

266
00:09:57,079 --> 00:10:01,839
farmers market or to restaurants product

267
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,760
liability insurance ensures you're

268
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,800
covered if someone claims they got sick

269
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,959
from something you sold and general

270
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,079
liability protects you from accidents

271
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:11,360
like if someone trips on your farm or if

272
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,560
something happens while you're out

273
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,279
delivering produce the good news

274
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,760
insurance for small farms is pretty

275
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:20,560
affordable my liability insurance costs

276
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,560
about $300 a year of course costs will

277
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,399
vary depending on your farm size and

278
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,880
location so it's worth shopping around

279
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,079
and getting quotes from different

280
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:30,120
providers I suggest starting with

281
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,480
companies like next especially if you're

282
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,240
looking for Farm specific policies and

283
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,000
if you have structures like green houses

284
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,200
or large equipment check with your

285
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,160
homeowners insurance provider they might

286
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,480
be able to bundle coverage for your farm

287
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,399
asset ultimately getting the right

288
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,279
insurance for your farm isn't just about

289
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,279
complying with legal requirements it's

290
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:50,720
about protecting everything you've built

291
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:53,000
and ensuring that one unexpected event

292
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,320
doesn't wipe it all out when I first

293
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,399
started gardening in my backyard scaling

294
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,920
up to a profitable business wasn't even

295
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:01,839
on my radar but over time as I started

296
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,480
selling extra produce I saw the

297
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,760
potential to grow into something bigger

298
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,560
scaling up didn't happen overnight it

299
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:11,040
was a process of making small

300
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,760
intentional Investments and reinvesting

301
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,839
profits back into the farm one of the

302
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,279
first major upgrades I made was building

303
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,880
a mobile walk-in cooler proper

304
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:23,200
Refrigeration was a game Cher it allowed

305
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,200
me to store larger quantities of produce

306
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,040
while maintaining the quality needed for

307
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,720
restaurant sales early on I also

308
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,480
realized the importance of staying

309
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,880
organized and thinking strategically I

310
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,120
focused on growing fewer crops at higher

311
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,320
volumes which streamlined my workflow

312
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,920
and reduced waste transitioning from

313
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,800
farmers markets to wholesale sales with

314
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,680
restaurants was another key step in

315
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,760
scaling up this shift not only saved me

316
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:51,440
time but also created a more predictable

317
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:54,160
and stable income stream but scaling up

318
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,200
isn't just about infrastructure or sales

319
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,079
it's about learning and adapting I

320
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,480
invested in tools like Farm raise for

321
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,800
bookkeeping and Square for invoicing

322
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,200
which helped me manage finances and keep

323
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,920
track of my growth I also took every

324
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,320
opportunity to learn whether through

325
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:12,120
networking watching videos or seeking

326
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,240
out resources to improve my processes

327
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,560
most importantly I stayed patient

328
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,639
farming is a long game and success

329
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,320
doesn't happen overnight there were

330
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:23,800
Seasons when I made mistakes lost crops

331
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:26,000
or faced unexpected challenges but I

332
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,760
kept pushing forward learning from those

333
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,839
experiences and making small

334
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,360
