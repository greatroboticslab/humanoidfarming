1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:11,840
in the side meeting I was in the main

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,320
message was who will be the spokesperson

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,039
who is this trusted messenger who will

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,680
drive The Innovation platform and what

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,160
was clear was that we may be sidelined

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:26,679
traditional leaders we have not looked

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:29,039
at non scientists non uh technocrats and

8
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:31,119
we should be focusing more on empowering

9
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,880
them with the scientific evidence

10
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,600
because they live in these basins they

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,840
are the ones who are affected by these

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:40,480
problems and they should be given

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:44,280
capacity to inform policy processes

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,280
that's where sustainability will come

15
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:53,520
from African institutions are weak they

16
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,840
are weak because we have not invested in

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,680
research there's still very little

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,440
appreciation of the role that research

19
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,960
plays in development and for as long as

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,720
our researchers are sitting idle with no

21
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,720
resources they doing their research in a

22
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,720
closet within the station and not

23
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,880
getting out to the farmers there is no

24
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,880
way that we are going to help Africa

25
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:19,640
feed itself so I think the starting

26
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:22,640
point is a call on governance can we use

27
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:25,400
African money to invest in African

28
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,079
research institutions that way we will

29
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:31,240
have researchers who can follow the

30
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:33,520
development agenda we have policies that

31
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:37,159
cannot be implemented because they are

32
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,439
created bottom down we want policies

33
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:42,079
that are created bottom up where the

34
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,759
evidence comes from practitioners but

35
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,600
it's packaged such that it can fed

36
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,079
directly into policy and I think that's

37
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,880
what the Innovation platforms have a new

38
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,880
way of doing business where you don't

39
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,960
stop a project level but you move

40
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,560
vertically to inform change at a higher

41
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,119
level District National and Regional

42
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:04,600
level so that you have policies that

43
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:04,600
save the

44
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,520
people really it's exciting because

45
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:16,560
Innovation platform is about equipping

46
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,920
all the actors to be drivers of change

47
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,560
but we are saying this change has to be

48
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,680
led through evidence and evidence that

49
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,879
emanates from research so when we are

50
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,080
talking about impact and outcomes the

51
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,680
the chain starts from those who are

52
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:34,959
affected by the problem being around the

53
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,959
table and those who want to experiment

54
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:40,400
research and deliver options for

55
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:43,680
development sitting as equal partners

56
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,680
and that's what the new CG

57
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:49,519
is
