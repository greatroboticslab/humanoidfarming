  "text": "[Music] we have a couple of questions but I sort of tried I'd like to start with the some of the points a few of our presenters alluded to particularly about sample custody and how quickly to get the sample from the collection point to the analysis and what does that if how does that how important is this to the sample eternity I mean if you'd like to get started you know it definitely is something to keep in mind I guess that goes back to protocol you know some of that just you know knowing that there is probably gonna be some effect as you maybe hold it or not but if you use it consistently that's gonna help you out I [Music] banish to see what Carl in my cap you know their market they might have some Carl you well to acknowledge that when you pull that manure sample out from the rest of the manure you change it fireman so it's going to start changing a little different than the manure and the pond is changing so that that's a concern but I guess from my perspective I'm just like my last slide where I had you know that perfect sampling is not it's a perfect sampling is unachievable but good sampling is the process of getting better over time so you know that's I guess that's where I would put my focus on is doing the best we can and acknowledge there may be some imperfections that are open for improvements in the future so you know go Roarke yeah I'll just I would just add that that preference is is to get that at least refrigerated as soon as possible don't leave it laying on the dash to pick up for a week and then here we do most of the samples come into the extend in office where they're put into a refrigerator transported to the lab once a week and up here in Raleigh so so yeah certainly it would be nice to put them on on Ison or in it at least in the cooler out of this direct sunlight until you can get them refrigerated yeah well the follow up on that is it's recommended in Arkansas part of your county office first as they wind you when do you expect to be sipping a mailing something out so you may want to keep it refrigerator at home for a day before you get it to any office and and they'll they'll actually mail it out we don't we don't have transportation for texting mail to the center to the lab let's be sure and label it appropriately yes in your home refrigerator have a specialized refrigerator and it having my comment about when you fill the bottles you pull them up 1/2 to 3/4 full for I have 500 mil bottles of what we use because you want to leave some room for a good gas expansion you don't want the tops to blow out and the post office so there is one of the points that and one of the questions raised is the statistical analysis or sort of an idea so variability in all of our presentations today that variability is the name of the game so you're sampling you're trying to add as many samples as you can to the variability - so the good question specifically what are the typical statistical methods that you're relying on in order to either analyze that variability or to reduce that variability in general so I kind of like to start that a little bit so some of the it's a personal experience some people sampling has to do with just increasing the number of samples and seeing how that changes to me essentially so that sort of almost like a simulation where you're adding more you're seeing how you are shifting the mean typically this is how we reach the to the rules of thumbs that we typically have 8 to 10 samples and it varies species to species but I'm wondering any of the presenters if they'd like to kind of contribute or comment on this particular aspect of mineral sampling well I'll just say from a lagoon liquid standpoint the their the the top water is relatively well mixed and so it's not difficult for us to get a representative sample simply by walking around the lagoon and taking grab samples but we also we're using that same liquid that's being pumped back to the barns to flush the barns so most of our producers simply collect a sample from the pipe as they're pumping water back to the pits and that's and plus there they are sampling relatively frequently so they have a long-term data set of lagoon analysis and it really doesn't change significantly there is some seasonal variabilities but it's not a tremendous amount and the way the records are done for their land application it's essentially a checkbook method that so they've got the fields how much will they pump and then how much the analysis for that so at the end of the day when they entered all that information in it comes out with a total plant available nitrogen that's been applied applied to that field now how I would agree with mark that the top water is fairly uniform and where I have my concerns from a sampling of a holding pond is where is the solids deposition pattern because as the manure is discharged into the pond from the pipe there's a tendency to be right at the end of the pipe there's kind of a clean area where the flow of water flushes the manure or solids away but then you start getting a solids deposition in that area and it's kind of a sweep then you move farther away from the pond you'll have the deposition will fall off and the silence level will decrease of course the whole ballgame changes the next time they come in and they pump out or they agitate so that's part of the sampling process when you go around the and why I like to use a clear PVC pipe is that gives me an opportunity to visually see that solid step and also you can tell a lot just by the resistance to insertion with the probe as you go in and one time that I've sampled pretty regularly I make them I have the advantage of their wonder kind of dock kind of out in it so it gave me an opportunity to walk out the end of the dock carefully yeah get the samples from there and that actually happened to be towards the end of where they had a solid accumulation typically that's one of the nice things that with that the survey the remote control boats and and sonar in that picture that I showed if you can see that where that sludge is and where you need to be guide that sampling yeah from a historical or time trends so to speak and Carl's slide kind of we had a question on this point but also one of the slides you presented on accumulated data between oh five and 2010 from Allah and I'd like to kind of open that question to our panel here and in terms of your observation so anecdotally some of the values are changing diet changes in genetics so changes in the manual nutrient values that you are seeing or observing or sort of key takeaways on that front compared to the typical book value that we have established the the anecdotal on the poultry side is yeah there's changes over time because our poultry industry has gone from rebuilding the house completely every after every flock to you may not read bed the house completely if you know it may happen every third year so just just the carbon editions in extraction and litter management has changed manure over time on the liquids I've had several occasions where I would have an integrator a producer raising for an integrator who come names at Carl explain why my manure used to be this way and now it's like Hamlin oatmeal in this Daleks were the only thing we configure is it was a diet change of course the diet changes are driven by the least-cost rations as well as nutrient balance so Mort and I don't have a lot of data to support it but certainly anecdotally talking with folks in the swine industry the feed rations have changed and now as folks are starting to clean out legumes we are seeing there indications that that's true and if you if you just start stripping away layers you can see higher concentrations of phosphorus zinc and copper in the in that sludge so yes I think there's evidence of that I think we need to do a better job of quantifying that and my mood and I've talked about how do we do that and setting up some sampling plugins sludge sampling protocols to kind of try and address that yeah I think the key take-home wound justice discussion is to just read the variability means you really need to be developing a farm specific database of what your sample of what you're applying and really give some thought in terms of what what are you doing and why are you doing it and what's the best way to do it well I would say that also reinforces some earlier discussion about sampling beforehand because we've have had some instances where folks a dredge sludge put it out based on what they thought it was going to be and based on their initial sample turns out what they actually dredge was different than that and they've over applied both phosphorus and copper zinc and a few few instances and to the point that some folks are reluctant very reluctant to accept sludge application now on fields well I'd like to thank our presenters for this really informative material on your sampling [Music]",
