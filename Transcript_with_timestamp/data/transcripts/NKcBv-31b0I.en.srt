smartwatch discussion paper is developed

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,920
by the land and water division of

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:29,039
fao as a contribution to the topical

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,800
debate on the rapidly evolving situation

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,920
of covet 19

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,160
and its impact on nutrition

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,480
and food security beyond the

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,800
well-defined health risks

11
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,600
undoubtedly exploiting irrigation

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,920
potential

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,719
has a major role in enhancing food

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,239
security

15
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,280
however expanding irrigation entails

16
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,719
considerable

17
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,280
growth in water use meanwhile provision

18
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,520
of safe water for sanitation is the

19
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,199
precondition to slow down the spread of

20
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,920
the pandemic

21
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,800
the twin track smart irrigation

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,920
smartwatch

23
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:09,200
approach clearly embodies

24
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,960
that water resources should be employed

25
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,040
for multiple uses

26
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,360
in order to respond to both food

27
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,479
security and health needs

28
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,520
the fight against the pandemic is a

29
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,200
marathon

30
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,240
not a sprint as far as emergency

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,439
interventions

32
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,320
can be highly beneficial in reducing

33
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,439
the most negative impacts of hunger and

34
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,560
pandemics

35
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,520
countries are required to define their

36
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,479
strategies

37
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,119
to protect the most vulnerable and

38
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,079
ensure

39
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,799
the resources are available for the most

40
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,079
basic

41
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,240
human needs food security and human

42
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,200
health

43
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,479
this evolving assessment starts with the

44
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,119
identification

45
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,159
of geographical hotspots of copied-19

46
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,799
impacts

47
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,759
in the context of agriculture food

48
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,280
production

49
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,240
and hygiene the mapping is carried out

50
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,680
along

51
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,720
largely agreed risky indicators

52
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:14,319
food insecurity and health

53
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,080
the probability of food security impacts

54
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,360
is assessed through irrigated

55
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,840
agriculture

56
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,200
and the probability of has impact

57
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,480
through the provision

58
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:27,680
of safe water countries with the most

59
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:31,360
overlapping levels of vulnerability

60
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,680
are identified as potential hotspots

61
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,640
on the other side the spreading trend of

62
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,720
the pandemic

63
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,959
is analyzed considering also the

64
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,319
reliability

65
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:44,400
of reported cases the intersection

66
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,599
between countries with high

67
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,319
vulnerability

68
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,879
related to agricultural production and

69
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:53,440
countries with high vulnerability

70
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,879
related to the pandemic spread are

71
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,239
finally defined

72
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:00,159
as geographical hotspots

73
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,000
after the vulnerability mapping and

74
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,519
analysis investment categorization

75
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,959
matrix is completed

76
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,800
the investment packages for

77
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,319
interventions can be proposed for the

78
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,840
affected countries

79
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,519
here we can divide the investment

80
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,560
packages into two levels of

81
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,040
interventions

82
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,879
the on-farm level and the system level

83
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,040
there are hundreds of system-level water

84
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,200
conservation technologies

85
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,200
however a set of selected technologies

86
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,200
that meet the multiple use criteria are

87
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,120
presented in this paper to address the

88
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:33,840
challenges under consideration that is

89
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:33,840
the food security and public hygiene
