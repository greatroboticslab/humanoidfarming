1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,200
in this video you will learn how to make

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,440
a very basic biochar fertilizer this

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,440
fertilizer will work well with soil

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,519
conditions and crops common in north

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,240
thailand but also in southeast asia in

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,480
general you will need a hoe

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,520
you're in

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,160
em

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,960
20 kilograms of rich soil preferably

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,599
inoculated with mycorrhizae 20 kilograms

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:29,199
of dried manure that's about two large

12
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:32,000
rice bags 20 kilograms of biochar that's

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,559
roughly three large rice bags choose a

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,960
flat hard surface and cover it with

15
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,280
heavy construction plastic empty the

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,840
three bags of biochar into the center of

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,960
the plastic using a simple watering can

18
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:48,000
or just a bucket put the urine all over

19
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,239
the biochar lots of it spread the two

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,399
bags of dried manure on top of the

21
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,440
biochar pour more

22
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,320
urine

23
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,840
on top of that top the pile with a bag

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,399
of soil sprinkle even more urine on top

25
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,119
of that begin to mix your ingredients

26
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,360
together urine you should start to leak

27
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,760
out the bottom when it does mix some

28
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,119
more stop when you think that the pile

29
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:16,080
will absorb no more urine you want as

30
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,920
much urine your fertilizer is possible

31
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,159
because it has lots of nitrogen

32
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,840
potassium and phosphorus fill your

33
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,240
watering can with em and sprinkle em all

34
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,280
over while you keep mixing you can learn

35
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,880
about em in the two warm heart videos

36
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,759
making em solution and using em cover

37
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,479
the finished biochar fertilizer mix and

38
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,799
trench around it to protect it from rain

39
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,439
after three months you will have a rich

40
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,520
powerful fertilizer in our experiments

41
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,960
this fertilizer performed as well as

42
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,960
your standard npk and it's free it also

43
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,360
restores the natural fertility of your

44
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,159
soil and biochar fertilizer traps

45
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,320
pesticide leftovers so they do not end

46
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,560
up in your fruits and vegetables where

47
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,719
they can poison you and your family

48
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,280
thank you for watching and from all of

49
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,630
us at warmheart may your costs be low

50
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:28,830
and your yields high
