00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,439
The Lao People's Democratic Republic is

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:22,560
a small landlock country in the Meong

4
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:25,600
region. It is home to two world heritage

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,960
sites. This country is rich in natural

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,760
resources such as forest, water, and

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,239
agricultural

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:38,480
land. Rice is a staple crop accounting

9
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:41,200
for 70 to 80% of food grain production.

10
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:44,079
In the uplands of Laos, farmers grow

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,800
rice along mountain slopes, in valleys,

12
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,879
and on terraces. Farmers mostly use

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,360
slash and burn to clear land along

14
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:54,440
mountain slopes and to kill weeds and

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,280
soilborn pests before

16
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,680
sewing. These uplands have diverse

17
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,559
agricultural environments that allow

18
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:06,640
farmers to grow not only rice but also

19
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:10,360
other crops such as maize, job's tear,

20
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:13,600
small grain legumes, pepper, sesame,

21
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:16,080
vegetables and fruits.

22
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,080
Farmers mainly consume these products at

23
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,000
home and sell small quantities for cash

24
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:24,479
income. They also sell livestock and

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,320
forest products such as mushrooms,

26
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,680
bamboo shoots, and medicinal

27
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,759
plants. The major constraints to

28
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,439
agricultural improvements in the area

29
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:38,000
are low crop yields, weeds, drought,

30
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:41,360
poor soils, and limited access to

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,920
improved technologies and information.

32
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,240
Farmers grow crops in forest edges and

33
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,880
on steep slopes using practices that

34
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,360
contribute to deforestation and soil

35
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,159
erosion. Farmers are caught in a vicious

36
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,439
circle of low yield, high poverty and

37
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,680
environmental degradation.

38
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,680
To overcome these constraints, the

39
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,880
International Fund for Agricultural

40
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,640
Development or IFAD provided funding to

41
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,720
the International Rice Research

42
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,640
Institute to develop improved

43
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,599
technologies for managing rice

44
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,599
landscapes in the uplands for household

45
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,680
food security and environmental

46
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,920
protection.

47
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,319
Increased rice productivity will not

48
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,480
only increase the food supply, but will

49
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,879
also help protect the fragile upland

50
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,879
environment by reducing pressure to

51
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:32,000
increase food production in steeply

52
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,400
sloping fields. Erie and its partners

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,879
are validating technological options

54
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,879
that combine improved plant material

55
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:42,800
with appropriate resource management

56
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:44,879
options for increasing productivity.

57
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,720
The project is a collaborative effort

58
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,080
with the Northern Agriculture and

59
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:52,080
Forestry Research Center or Nafre of the

60
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,560
National Agriculture and Forestry

61
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:58,160
Research Institute also known as

62
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,519
Nafrey. Most of the research activities

63
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:04,239
were done in farmers fields in two

64
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:06,080
villages Bonfi and Bansillech.

65
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,959
Farmers were fully involved in all

66
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,120
stages of this process with the aim of

67
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,760
identifying suitable technologies that

68
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,599
poor farmers can

69
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:18,080
afford. Farmer participatory research

70
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:21,120
has identified, selected, and tested

71
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,120
different rice varieties. These improved

72
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,760
varieties have clearly demonstrated

73
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:29,040
higher yield under both low and moderate

74
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,440
fertilizer application.

75
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,360
In addition to improved varieties,

76
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,159
traditional varieties suited to these

77
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,920
areas have also been identified. The

78
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,760
project has brought back traditional

79
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,599
varieties that are no longer grown

80
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,440
widely because of the unavailability of

81
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:47,680
seed. Small quantities of seed of these

82
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,599
varieties have been obtained from a gene

83
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,159
bank and evaluated for their

84
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,239
suitability. Additional quantities of

85
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,030
seed have been produced for distribution

86
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,210
to farmers.

92
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,600
Scientists have demonstrated that the

93
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,320
use of leguminous plant species such as

94
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,039
pigeon pee accelerate the renewal of

95
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,919
land productivity and give farmers an

96
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:18,880
opportunity to earn additional income.

97
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:21,919
For example, farmers culture sticklac

98
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:25,280
insects on pigeon pee plants and harvest

99
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:27,600
sticklac resin. Sticklac is used for the

100
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,560
manufacturer of lacquer and this fetches

101
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,919
a high price in the

102
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,600
market. Improved crop management

103
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,440
technologies that are helpful in

104
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,000
achieving better yields were also

105
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,000
introduced in the project. These include

106
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,440
seed selection, testing seed

107
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
germination, and weed management.

108
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:49,199
The project also did research on how to

109
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,680
control weeds. Imperata is a persistent

110
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,080
and hard to control weed in upland rice

111
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,680
fields. Improved methods for controlling

112
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,360
this difficult upland weed have been

113
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:02,000
validated. Nafra facilitated the

114
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:05,360
production of more than 24 tons of seeds

115
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,240
by farmers in 2008. This was done with

116
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,800
farmers participation. These seeds were

117
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,400
made available to farmers directly and

118
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,759
through local extension

119
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,000
agencies. Fact sheets in the local

120
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,400
language were published and distributed

121
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,560
and training activities and study tours

122
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,680
were conducted for staff and farmers

123
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,600
involved in the project. The project

124
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,080
also established a partnership with

125
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,919
different local and national

126
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:34,240
institutions for regional collaboration

127
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,400
and for promoting learning across the

128
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,400
border.

129
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,039
The partnership is strengthened through

130
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,759
extended field validation in Udum Sai

131
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:46,240
and Saiaburi, neighboring provinces in

132
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:49,199
Laos in which IFAD has funded large

133
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,120
rural development programs. Improved

134
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,639
validated technologies are being

135
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,120
promoted to farmers who are

136
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,520
participating in these rural development

137
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,400
programs.

138
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,039
Farmers they like uh in upland for

139
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,599
upland area because we have lot of

140
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:09,680
upland area for highest contribution. So

141
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:11,919
uh rice uh pigent pee cultivation is uh

142
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,720
very much like by farmer. So they can

143
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,240
get rice and also they can get the pige

144
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,479
and they also improve the soil

145
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,360
productivity. No matter what population

146
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:23,759
also reduce, insect incidence reduce,

147
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,400
soil erosion also reduce and they reduce

148
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,639
uh they reduce the symptom cycle they

149
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:33,280
can cultivate on cities of plant for

150
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:36,400
long time and uh one technology is uh

151
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:41,120
like zero tillage or minimum tillage

152
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:43,680
also gaining popularity among farmers.

153
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:48,400
the following allow government policy.

154
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:52,240
We try to stop the uh sled and sunburn

155
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:57,280
there. Okay. So now we try to uh

156
00:07:52,240 --> 00:08:00,479
increase the quality of rice. So if we

157
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:03,440
cannot do we cannot success this that I

158
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:07,240
we know that we have never to stop the

159
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:11,039
the slice and burn.

160
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:15,240
So the the new technology very important

161
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:18,720
and will the need for the villages to to

162
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:22,000
to train them how to to to grow rice and

163
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,319
how to get a high quality.

164
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,479
In four years the project has helped

165
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,319
farmers to identify improved rice

166
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:31,199
varieties that are suited to their

167
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,919
conditions. The project also helped them

168
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,519
produce good quality seeds and learn new

169
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:39,680
techniques for improved crop

170
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:41,760
management. 4 years is a short time and

171
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,399
the challenge remains for these farmers

172
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,640
to continue to increase their yield. The

173
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,519
project may be ending but our commitment

174
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,600
to help the farmers remains. We will

175
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,160
continue to build on the progress made

176
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,240
by the project to develop and provide

177
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:00,560
better technologies to improve the

178
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,560
