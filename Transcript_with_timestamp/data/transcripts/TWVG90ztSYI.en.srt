hello i am a sebalg and i'm a graduate

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:09,920
student at the university of minnesota

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
studying land dynamics for atmospheric

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,759
science with an emphasis in manure and

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,519
nutrient management

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,359
for this poster i will be going over

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,880
some preliminary data from research that

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,199
is measuring the impacts integrating

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,519
cover crops and manure have on soil

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,880
health nutrient cycling and agronomic

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,640
production

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,480
cover crops have been gaining momentum

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,160
over the years yet their adoption rates

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,519
in the upper midwest are not as robust

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,719
as other regions across the united

16
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,239
states

17
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,520
this is especially the case in manure

18
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,960
applied systems

19
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,480
this stems from the short cover crop

20
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,399
growing season due to the prolonged

21
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,840
winters that places in the upper upper

22
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:46,239
midwest such as in minnesota frequently

23
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,239
have farmers are also hesitant to use

24
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,920
cover crops because limited information

25
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,440
is available on how integrating cover

26
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,800
crops and manure impact crop yield

27
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,399
the objective of this study is to

28
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,160
determine the best management practices

29
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,760
of integrating cover crops and manure

30
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,840
and how that affects corn yields in the

31
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,680
upper midwest

32
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,920
in this study we set up plots at the

33
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,600
university of minnesota west central

34
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,680

35
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,119
near morris minnesota

36
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,600
plots were arranged in a randomized

37
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,759
complete block design with split plots

38
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,759
main plots include nutrient source which

39
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,600
was liquid dairy manure applied in the

40
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,759
early fall when soil temperatures were

41
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,799
above 50 degrees fahrenheit or 10

42
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,799
degrees celsius or in late fall when

43
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,720
soil temperatures were below 50 degrees

44
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,720
fahrenheit or 10 degrees celsius through

45
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,200
sweep injection

46
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,960
to minimize soil disturbance

47
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,720
urea is applied in the spring prior to

48
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,560
corn planting for plots not receiving

49
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,560
manure application

50
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,280
we aim to apply the same plant available

51
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,280
night generates across all treatments

52
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,920
the split plot was cover crop seeding

54
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,079
winter rye annual rye grass mixtures

55
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,840
were broadcast by hand at the v5 corn

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,719
growth stage which you can see in the

57
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,600

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,920
physiological maturity or drilled after

60
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,600
corn harvest

61
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,640
plots receiving urea in the spring with

62
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,560
no cover crops served as a control

63
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,400
overall we first planted cover crops in

64
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,000
the late summer and early fall then

65
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,520
applied manure when the cover crops had

66
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,120
enough time

67
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,239
to grow and establish an active root

68
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,920
system

69
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,760
we thought that by first planting cover

70
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,520
crop prior to manure application the

71
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,680
cover crops may tie up readily available

72
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,920
nutrients into their biomass instead of

73
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,440
being lost to the environment

74
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,040
then once the cover crops were

75
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,319
terminated in the spring they can

76
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,040
release those nutrients to the

77
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,640
succeeding corn crop

78
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,080
we on to preliminary data it is

79
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,239
important to note that the similar

80
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,000
letters above the bars within each graph

81
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:45,200
indicates a significant effect of our

82
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,959
fixed effects among the treatments

83
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,040
when sampling cover crops in late fall

84
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,519
prior to the first frost event cover

85
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,280
crop biomass which is a y-axis is the

86
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,519
greatest when winter rye annual rye

87
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,840
grass is overseeded near r5 compared to

88
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,920
drilling after harvest

89
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,599
broadcasting at v5 also produce

90
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,280
significantly more biomass than drilling

91
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,760
come spring the story changes a little

92
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,400
bit the highest biomass produced was for

93
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,680
cover crops planted near r5 whereas the

94
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,640
other cover crop treatments were not

95
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,080
statistically different from one another

96
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,599
nutrient sources now have an effect on

97
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,680
cover crop biomass production in both

98
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,440
fall and spring

99
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,159
you may also notice a drop in biomass

100
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,840
production between fall and spring this

101
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,280
is most likely due to annual rye grass

102
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,760
being winter killed unlike the winter

103
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,799
rye which is a very winter hardy cover

104
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,799
crop species

105
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,720
moving on to yield data when looking at

106
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,959
the effects of nutrient source the x

107
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,599
axes have

108
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,560
which is the x axes have on solid yield

109
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:47,040
the y axis manure either

110
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,640
applied in the early fall or late fall

111
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,640
significantly better than spring applied

112
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,239
durian fertilizer

113
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,599
although nitrogen is applied at similar

114
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,200
rates

115
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,879
manure may be providing other services

116
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,640
other than supply nutrients which may be

117
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,760
positively impacting the soil and

118
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,280
subsequently the corn crops

119
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,040
there was no statistical difference

120
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,040
between the no cover crop and all and

121
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,159
all the cover crop treatments on silage

122
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,400
yield

123
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,400
among the cover crop treatments

124
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,480
broadcasting your v5 had the highest

125
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,079
solid yield

126
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,919
so far we learned that planting cover

127
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,239
crops near plants and essences is a more

128
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,400
optimal time to plant cover crops

129
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:24,479
overseas at r5 gives cover crops more

130
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,400
time to grow compared to drilling after

131
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,080
harvest while providing enough sunlight

132
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,400
exposure for cover crops to produce more

133
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,560
biomass compared to overseeding before

134
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,800
canopy closure

135
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,440
increased cover crop biomass may reduce

136
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,199
allergies to a certain extent though

137
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,600
ongoing research measuring various soil

138
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,280
