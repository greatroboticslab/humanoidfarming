4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,300
program is based on agreements for

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:21,119
sustainable agricultural practices so on

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,039
one side the farm commits to series of

7
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,840
management practices that benefit nature

8
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,660
and on the other side of the agreement

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,400
government in recognition of this

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,199
commitment that benefits society as a

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,960
whole will help the farmers in various

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,399
ways one of our lines of action is

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,160
providing training and consulting

14
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,260
services on sustainable Farm practices

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,960
and farm management

16
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,059
we know that education is a motive for

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,340
change but we also know that farmers and

18
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:48,719
land workers are extremely busy so we

19
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,820
try and choose topics of special

20
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,760
interests such as those that are around

21
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:56,760
increasing agricultural productivity and

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,399
reducing production costs

23
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,680
aware of the implications of working in

24
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,600
agriculture and livestock we organize

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,339
training sessions during one or two days

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,320
where farmers can pick and choose the

27
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:09,420
workshops of Interest so they don't have

28
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,119
to attend all of the sessions

29
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,799
we tried to organize training when there

30
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:15,960
is lease workload in the agricultural

31
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,119
sector and we always prioritize an

32
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,460
informal space and time where producers

33
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,960
Educators and other stakeholders can

34
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,100
chat with each other and exchange

35
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,100
valuable experiences

36
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,460
one of the activities that we organize

37
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,979
is the Agriculture and environment

38
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,799
seminar you could say that we have been

39
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:37,680
organizing it historically because we

40
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,680
have already organized 15 editions it is

41
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,200
an annual event where we share inspiring

42
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,840
stories from within the agricultural

43
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,060
sector the key point is that the

44
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,820
speakers share their direct life

45
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,399
experience so they share their success

46
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,840
but also the mistakes they have made and

47
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,720
the lessons that they have learned from

48
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,520
it

49
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,320
we also organized technical workshops

50
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,280
that include theory and practice in the

51
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,020
same day

52
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,060
they cover various topics such as

53
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:09,599
natural pest control soil fertility

54
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,580
directed grazing or wind manures

55
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,680
during these workshops we go into the

56
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,560
detail on how to implement the practices

57
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,720
shown on the farms

58
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,400
finally a point we believe is key when

59
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,980
it comes to moving from Theory to

60
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,599
practice is accompanying the farmer in

61
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:27,000
their first steps when implementing

62
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:29,340
these new practices

63
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,400
this is why we have invested in personal

64
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,680
post Workshop consultations on farms

65
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,360
basically from the participants those

66
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,940
firms who decide to implement the learn

67
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,040
practice can opt into an accompanying

68
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,959
consultation that can help them put it

69
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,819
into action and resolve any questions

70
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,819
when they pop up during this process

71
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,540
this would conclude the short summary of

72
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,660
activities we do in training and

73
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:56,879
Consulting work in custadia this is just

74
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,160
one of the routes we take as we also

75
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,980
take action by providing services and

76
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,660
materials Product Promotion and also

77
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,660
working with the general public through

78
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,920
volunteering and Environmental Education

79
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:11,159
and other activities that we will

80
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,360
explain in the following videos
