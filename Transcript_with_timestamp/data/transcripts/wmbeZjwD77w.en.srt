they'll probably blow off on the ground

41
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,439
wind is whipping at about 20 M an hour

42
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,640

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,360
sitting out here big te we're going to

45
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,520
be in that tractor in just a minute we

46
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,520
got cows to feed track uh four-wheelers

47
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,600

51
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:07,039
go ahead in the kennel I've got a cinder

52
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:09,399
block on top of my dog food uh container

53
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:12,319
here and if you guys don't know these

54
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:14,400
make the best ever food containers for

55
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,640

56
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,000
containers and this is my little

57
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,319
concoction of CBD oil so I'll give Buddy

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,879
a little scoop right here he doesn't

59
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,200
mind the flavor of the CBD oil I think

60
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,040
it kind of stinks I think he really

61
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,120
likes it so we'll just dab a little bit

62
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,680

63
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:38,400

69
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,760
badly but you know about the time a dog

70
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,000
gets good you know what I mean by the

71
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,480
time a dog gets perfect it's about the

72
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,280
time they start having health problems

73
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,879

[Music]

280
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:08,839
this is George George has got a battery

281
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:12,360
issue let me show you real

282
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:13,959
quick George's battery is dead as a door

283
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:17,320
nail that's how we call it here in the

284
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:18,839
southern regions of the United States

285
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:22,120
reason he's dead is because I left a

286
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:24,160
switch on thanks Josh good job make more

287
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,800
work for yourself already got the hood

288
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,120
up and I tried to jump this off of the

289
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,600
jump box the other day battery was too

290
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:34,320
dead to jump with a jump box so this is

291
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,320
the solution and it's really

292
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,360
cool this is a power station portable

they poop eat on the top of the hill and

462
00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:33,120

484
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,720
there's not a machine for everything on

485
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:29,440
the farm that's a common misconception

486
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,919
these Mega Farms make folks think that

487
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,240
everything's done from the seat of a

488
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:35,799
tractor and it's just not the case on a

489
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:39,159
small farm guys share your stories with

490
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:39,159

fence monitor from sensor Tech got guys

497
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,760
awesome I can tell every day every

498
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,399
morning when my fence is working and

499
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:07,720
when it's not working and actually that

500
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:09,440
setup right there shuts itself down at

501
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,320
about midnight and starts back up at

502
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,480
sunrise every morning I had no idea

503
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:17,159
until last night this is a first day

504
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:18,919
trying that new sensor way cool let's

505
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:21,279
get back on the blue Becon we're going

506
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:25,279
to go back and we'll move the uh tire

507
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:25,279
pump to another tire

508
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:30,309
[Music]

509
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:37,120
those two blue balls that you see

510
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,039
floating right there two little blue

511
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,480
things that tells me my water system is

512
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:43,279
working properly we're also checking the

513
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,480
water system over on the other side

514
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:47,360
where the cows were too long as those

515
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:50,159
two blue balls are sticking up like they

516
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:53,080
should be then we know the water system

517
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:55,760
is working all the water on the farm is

518
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:58,480
pumped via solar so we have a solar well

519
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:00,320
it only works during the daytime so so

520
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,080
the cows have enough water storage in

521
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,559
those tanks to keep them watered

522
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,760
overnight they don't really drink a lot

523
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:05,760

525
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,760
night just riding by the chicken coop

526
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,159
there I can tell they need a little bit

527
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,960
of water we're going to get feeding

528
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:30,120
water here in just a little bit might

529
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:32,279
check the honey bees real quick too we

530
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,760
lost one beehive this year but there was

531
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:36,250
still honey in there and I'm letting the

532
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:39,490
bees gobble that honey down check it

533
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:39,490

00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,559
hanging out for

536
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:52,429
[Music]

537
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,039
that let's check on this truck see if

538
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,440
that battery got any more voltage we may

539
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:04,840
have to give it a boost because I really

540
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:06,600
killed that battery and it's not a new

541
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:10,519
battery and it's a Walmart never start

542
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,519
battery too let's see what we

543
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:19,679
got well says 12 volts already 80%

544
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:22,440
charge no no way no way we're going to

545
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:28,399
boost it hit it with a

546
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:32,080
booster no way it's 80% charge

547
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:35,640
that quick find that hard to

548
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,640
believe let's just

549
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:47,320
see no

550
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:50,880
way here we go yeah right my sneaking

551
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:52,840
suspicion is this battery is so fried

552
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,200

00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:44,640
says

739
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:48,200
1% we'll put her own engine

740
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,200
starter she said

741
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:53,920
ready oh no no no she not

742
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,319
ready all right we're going to let that

743
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,880
charge while we

744
00:39:55,319 --> 00:39:59,359
go we got to grab a tractor across the

745
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:01,280
farm here bring it up here and get it

746
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:04,680
filled with fuel that way it's good to

747
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,680
go we're going to be running the Sawmill

748
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:17,190
[Music]

749
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:27,440
tomorrow this door is about to make me

750
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:29,640
mad man it what happened was the wind

751
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,440
caught it it sprung it it broke this

752
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:33,640
hook right here that holds it in place I

753
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,880
just need to go buy a new one I think

754
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:38,440
but what happened it sprung the hinges

755
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:41,760
all the way back and now it's not

756
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:43,200
shutting like it should oh now it shuts

757
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,599
like it

758
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,599
should oh

759
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:52,160
man good it's getting a grab when it's

760
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:55,240
real cold outside these steel buildings

761
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:57,800
tend to swell and shrink and sometimes

762
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:59,720
I'll find that door just blown open

763
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:02,280
and it just basically tries to rip it

764
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:06,319
off I was saying we're going to go over

765
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:07,599
the other side of the farm and uh grab a

766
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:08,839
tractor and bring it over here but I

767
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:11,319
think we're going to take the fuel to

768
00:41:08,839 --> 00:41:14,400
the Tractor not the tractor to the

769
00:41:11,319 --> 00:41:19,280
fuel this is the Unicorn Dodge

770
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:23,119
truck this is my fuel set up right here

771
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:27,520
and uh it's a little bit janky janky

772
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:27,520
shanky that's okay

773
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,520
now the reason I call this the Unicorn

774
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:40,359
Dodge it could be more of a unicorn if

775
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:43,280
it was a sixspeed and a one ton douly

776
00:41:40,359 --> 00:41:46,240
but it's not

777
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:48,599
contact but it is a cumings baby she

778
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:51,319
sounds good so why am I filling up this

779
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:53,560
tractor it seems unnecessary right well

780
00:41:51,319 --> 00:41:57,079
I'm going up to Virginia that's what the

781
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:59,000
Virginia folks call it Virginia Virginia

782
00:41:57,079 --> 00:42:00,960
and and we are going to fill up the fuel

783
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,200
tank in the back of the truck here

784
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,760
because fuel is about 20 cents cheaper

785
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,599
per gallon in Virginia than it is in

786
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,839
North

787
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:10,839
Carolina uh we're going to use off-road

788
00:42:08,839 --> 00:42:14,160
diesel but it's still cheaper up there

789
00:42:10,839 --> 00:42:16,520
it may be under three bucks a gallon

790
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:18,359
yeah I'll fill this diesel tank up

791
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:20,400
probably three times a year and that's

792
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:23,160
all the fuel that I'll need for the year

793
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,640
here on the Stony Ridge cows do most of

794
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:28,079
the work but I got to come in and clip

795
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,079
behind the cows

796
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:14,960
Sawmills way over here this is my land

797
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:16,559
that's my neighbors's land we're pretty

798
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:19,559
cool I take care of their property for

799
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:22,200
them most of the time um they just

800
00:43:19,559 --> 00:43:24,480
reimburse me for fuel I've talked to

801
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:26,160
them about leasing uh their pasture for

802
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:29,720
the cows and at some point we may do

803
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:31,839
that or May moh but for right now I'm

804
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:34,160
just mowing it keeping it up keep it

805
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:35,520
pretty the cast loader is right over

806
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:39,040
here I'll show you guys what a cast

807
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:41,559
loader is this is why I didn't drive my

808
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:43,359
nice truck down through here it's muddy

809
00:43:41,559 --> 00:43:46,880
right here and that truck just got a

819
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:12,800
go on the Saw Mill all this is going to

820
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:15,480
be milled into 2x4s so we can finish out

821
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:18,240
the Tool Crib in the mega shop that you

823
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:24,200
is the cast loader and this is the wood

824
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:26,119
meiser lt40 and I've already been over

825
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:29,760
here making a little bit of lumber you

826
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:31,839
can tell but this is a job for tomorrow

827
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,520
cast loaders from TNA Distributing we

828
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:36,319
got a triel grapple on the cast loader

829
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:37,680
that we're moving our logs and all of

830
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:41,040
our brush with we're going to have a big

831
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:44,839
old bonfire pretty soon pretty awesome

832
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:46,800
this is a mini articulating loader

833
00:44:44,839 --> 00:44:50,760
meaning it bends in the middle so it's

834
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:55,119
just a mini loader cast mini loader um

835
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:58,960
again from topnotch equipment out of

836
00:44:55,119 --> 00:45:02,440
Minnesota contact

837
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:05,319
yeah and it's way low on fuel I ran out

838
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:07,800
of gas in this thing one time not fun

839
00:45:05,319 --> 00:45:10,720
not cool and don't don't don't leave the

840
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:14,119
door open I busted the glass out of it

841
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:16,920
one time too so check it out when you

842
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:20,280
steer see how the tire gets

843
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:24,720
closer okay we got a loader and then we

844
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:28,079
got a button on here that extends the

845
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:32,240
loader so the boom extends

846
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:34,640
our uh forward and reverse is right

847
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:37,760
there and that's just how easy a cast

848
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:41,880
loader works very fun my fuel light is

849
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:43,079
on on this thing which means not good

850
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:48,040
got to get over there and get this thing

851
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:49,760
filled up the reason I didn't uh drive

852
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:51,680
it across the farm was cuz I was afraid

853
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,599
I was going to run out of fuel with it

854
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:57,319
this thing will turn on a dime check it

855
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:58,510
out there's a sawmill I mean look at

856
00:45:57,319 --> 00:46:14,369
that that's so

857
00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:14,369
[Music]

858
00:46:17,319 --> 00:46:22,359
cool hit

859
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:22,359
it

860
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:30,079
yeeh this thing's a little sensitive on

861
00:46:26,359 --> 00:46:32,640
fueling up up it does not like full

862
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:35,240
trigger pressure when I fill it

863
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:36,160
up it'll kick back a little bit so I got

864
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:38,520
to be

865
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:41,520
careful you know what I just noticed a

866
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:46,520
little something here the tire is low on

867
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:49,480
this so I just so happened to bring

868
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:51,839
over the tire pump we're going to go

869
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:54,319
ahead and fill this tire up see a little

870
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:57,680
bit low right there well a lot of bit

871
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:59,640
low that's pretty soft

872
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:02,240
again if you don't have one of these

873
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:04,960
pumps on your farm you just need one

874
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:07,119
even around the house we're going to go

875
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:09,760
to 24

876
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:13,160
PSI ask me how I

877
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:16,280
know I've I've had to fill that tire of

878
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:20,880
at least 20 times just got a slow

879
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:20,880
leak okay it's cool

880
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:27,070

let me show you something this looks

888
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:50,599
like a 2000 Dodge commercial man this

889
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,599
truck is so

890
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:56,920

pretty gosh

892
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:00,920
told them when they bury me dig a hole

893
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:04,240
big enough for this truck and put me in

894
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:04,240
it right

895
00:49:05,559 --> 00:49:10,720
here clear

896
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:13,000
prop we're off to Rural King and here's

897
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:15,559
what we're picking up at the Rural King

898
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:19,000
oil is cheaper there I'm picking up

899
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:21,640
hydraulic fluid for the Gale

900
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,720
rt210 and it says hydraulic fluid

901
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:26,760
capacity

902
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:28,640
21.5 Gall and I got all the specs right

903
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:30,920
right here so I get the right

904
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:33,400
stuff things are cheaper at Rural King

905
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,400
it's worth a

906
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,400
drive we just passed Martinsville

907
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,520
Speedway right back there got some

908
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:43,680
pretty cool arcade tractors sitting out

909
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:46,440
here I wonder if anybody will recognize

910
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:49,079
their friend Stony Ridge Farmer in the

911
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:51,640
store here today fingers crossed this

912
00:49:49,079 --> 00:49:54,880
used to be Kmart my brother used to work

913
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:57,119
here at Kmart back in the day and uh had

914
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:59,359
a lot of fun in this parking lot doing

915
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:03,119
donuts in the snow after

916
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:05,880
hours back in my high school days got my

917
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:08,040
wallet this one's going to be

918
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:12,240
expensive I know it

919
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:15,160
