1
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,439
if a plant has enough water minerals and

2
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,359
energy it will grow right well sort of

3
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,199
but there is more to it like why do

4
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,279
plants bend towards the light and not

5
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,199
just grow straight and why is it that

6
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,880
the stem grows up but the roots grow

7
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,400
down

8
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,719
it isn't as if the plant has eyes to

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,640
tell it where the sun is

10
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,840
you should already know about tropisms

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,600
so phototropism and geotropism but if

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,320
you have forgotten watch our video

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,320
called plant hormones tropisms first

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,920
but how does it actually do this having

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,559
been made in the tips of the stems and

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,800
roots auxin is moved in solution by

17
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,879
diffusion to older parts of the plant in

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,559
the stem the auxin causes the cells to

19
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,719
change in elasticity

20
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:59,600
more elastic cells absorb more water and

21
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,280
can grow longer strangely though stems

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,120
and roots respond differently to high

23
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,360
concentrations of auxin

24
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,920
whilst the stem cells grow more the root

25
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,280
cells actually grow less so auxins make

26
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,520
plants grow

27
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,119
but why do they bend towards the light

28
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,720
how do they know to do this when they

29
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,400
don't have eyes

30
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,720
the bending happens because the light

31
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,960
hits on one side more and breaks down

32
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,200
the auxins on that side of the stem

33
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,680
so then growth slows down on the light

34
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,920
side the faster growth on the dark side

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,079
causes the shoots and leaves to turn

36
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,000
towards the light which is ideal for the

37
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,079
plant for photosynthesis

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,119
auxin is produced in the tips of growing

39
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,720
shoots

40
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,119
if the tips are cut off

41
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,040
then no auxin can be produced and so no

42
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,040
plant growth if the tips are covered

43
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,360
whilst auxin is still produced light

44
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,960
cannot break it down and so phototropism

45
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,799
cannot occur

46
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,799
the plant just grows straight up and

47
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,720
does not bend towards the light pretty

48
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,720
straightforward so far now let's switch

49
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,360
it up a bit auxins have the opposite

50
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,000
effect on root cells in roots

51
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,479
auxins cause less growth the shaded side

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,840
of roots contain more auxin and so they

53
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,680
grow less

54
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,439
this enables the light side of the roots

55
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,000
to grow more and bend away from the

56
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,000
light and if that wasn't weird enough we

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,879
have the opposite happening with auxins

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,720
to gravity too in a horizontal route the

59
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,000
bottom side contains more auxin and

60
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,840
grows less

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,920
so the root bends downwards in the

62
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,160
direction of gravity so positive

63
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,760
geotropism but of course the stem

64
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,360
responds differently

65
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,280
in a horizontal stem

66
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,200
again the bottom side contains more

67
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,720
auxins because it is less directly hit

68
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,280
by sunlight

69
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,280
but because auxins cause growth in stems

70
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,200
the bottom side grows more causing the

71
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,280
stem to bend upwards against the

72
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,640
direction of gravity so negative

73
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,879
geotropism

74
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,400
but i'm giving auxins too much credit

75
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,840
they don't work alone

76
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,480
they have a partner in crime

77
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,840
cytokinins

78
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,120
you don't need to know anything about

79
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,319
these hormones

80
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,560
other than the fact that they work

81
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,400
alongside auxins there is another plant

82
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,599
hormone however that you do need to be

83
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,040
aware of

84
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,360
gibberellins

85
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,959
once the seed germinates the roots and

86
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,440
shoots start to grow

87
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,280
but for this the seed needs energy

88
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,440
luckily the seed releases a hormone

89
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,440
called gibberellin

90
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,360
which causes the starch in the seed to

91
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,519
turn into sugars and provides the seed

92
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,360
with energy to grow

93
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,879
as well as causing shoot growth

94
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,640
gibberillins can also stimulate

95
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,720
flowering and the production of fruit in

96
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,920
some plants and they also work with

97
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,440
auxins to cause stem elongation

98
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,519
so now we know all about how plant

99
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,879
hormones work have a think about how

100
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,959
they could be used

101
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:39,000
we will discover some uses in our video

102
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,000
on how we use plant hormones
