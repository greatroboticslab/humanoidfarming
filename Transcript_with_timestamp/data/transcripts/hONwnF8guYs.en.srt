here to share

15
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:41,700
um a story of his farmer Rancher project

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,920
which is forcing Belgian and dive and

17
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,480
traviso Radicchio in the Upper Midwest

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,000
well yeah I can just give a quick

19
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,920
introduction of myself so I'm Peter

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,860
skull from I own waxwing Farm together

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,899
with my wife Anna racer

22
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,660
um this coming season will be our 13th

23
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,160
growing season uh growing mixed

24
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:03,480
vegetables

25
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,799
um both for CSA and we sell probably

26
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,080
half of our businesses selling to

27
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,479
restaurants as well we sell a little bit

28
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:12,720
to the Prior Lake School District and

29
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:16,200
outside of the Twin Cities but that's

30
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,659
kind of the the big breakdown and

31
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:22,140
um yeah we got um through our restaurant

32
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:25,259
work we got interested in growing

33
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:28,320
um Radicchio and kind of The Logical

34
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:30,060
extension of that has brought us to this

35
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,180
project

36
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,640
um so it's just kind of it was a desire

37
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,400
to

38
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:41,180
expand our options and diversify our

39
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,439
winter offerings to our restaurants and

40
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:45,600
we thought it might fit the bill but we

41
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,880
needed a little uh help to get over the

42
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,920
hump of of the initial investment in

43
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,140
trial period so the that's why we

44
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,500
applied for the Sarah Grant and once we

45
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,960
got it we put the project into uh into

46
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,399
practice and

47
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,320
um had a few hiccups because of the

48
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,200
coveted pandemic but

49
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,700
um we actually it was It was kind of

50
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,140
nice we we delayed the project or

51
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,319
extended the project by a year because

52
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,580
of that and we were able to put a lot of

53
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,920
stuff that we had learned into practice

54
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,200
and I think the the project was actually

55
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,640
better for it okay so um yeah this is

56
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,620
just a little presentation I put

57
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,360
together just to kind of

58
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,920
um hit the high points of of what we

59
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,959
learned

60
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,459
um so as you can see it the whole thing

61
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,140
was about diversifying our season

62
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:30,540
extension you know Season extension in

63
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,160
the Upper Midwest is really critical for

64
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,840
Vegetable Farms

65
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,080
um and so

66
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,000
um we just wanted to explore an option

67
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,980
to give us something

68
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,360
um something a little bit more higher

69
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,580
value than some of the root crops

70
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,379
especially for us uh selling to

71
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:48,420
restaurants you know root crops at

72
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:49,980
smaller restaurant volumes are not super

73
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,660
profitable

74
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,519
um so having something that

75
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,440
um is a higher demand higher value

76
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,239
product

77
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,879
um was was something that we've been

78
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,680
pursuing for our winter restaurant sales

79
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,940
and we thought that these forcing

80
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,400
chicorys

81
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:07,620
um would fit that bill pretty well so so

82
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,800
what is a forcing chicory it's um

83
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,900
chicories are a crop that grows a lot

84
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,480
like lettuce so it's got a leafy top

85
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,440
above ground and a single Taproot down

86
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,140
below

87
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,640
it's been used for thousands and

88
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:23,340
thousands of years it's originally from

89
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,519
the Mediterranean area

90
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,920
um and it includes you know forage crops

91
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:32,280
and also crops for human consumption

92
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:34,860
humans and animals alike both the leaves

93
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,920
and The Roots the Roots historically

94
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:42,180
have been used as a coffee substitute

95
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,260
um so it's it's a crop that is well

96
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,080
known

97
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:48,420
um in certain parts of the world

98
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,220
um and then Radicchio and Endive are the

99
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:52,500
things that are the crops in the family

100
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:55,560
that uh most

101
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,720
um people are familiar with

102
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,659
um and so forcing chicories are a

103
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,220
certain variety that you plant them in

104
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:04,200
this in the ground and you grow them

105
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,760
like a regular chicory throughout the

106
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:09,180
growing season but then you dig them up

107
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,340
and you bring them inside and you force

108
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,099
them to grow inside a dark

109
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,840
room or chamber

110
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:19,139
um which forces them to grow without

111
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,780
chlorophyll and so you get a totally

112
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:22,639
different product than what grows in the

113
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:27,060
field

114
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:29,340
so not only is it is it a unique

115
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,600
um kind of value-added product for that

116
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,759
reason

117
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,840
um but it also it tastes great too it

118
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:35,759
tastes a lot different than what you

119
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,979
grow in the field so yeah this uh just

120
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,139
kind of gets at why we wanted to to grow

121
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:42,600
these things again like I mentioned it's

122
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:47,340
about extending our season our growing

123
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:49,680
season and finding a way to increase the

124
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:52,139
value of some of our winter sales to

125
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,380
restaurants in particular

126
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:57,419
um it worked really well with our our

127
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:00,600
farm infrastructure because we're able

128
00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:03,860
to use a walk-in cooler as our forcing

129
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:07,320
chamber that is not used in the winter

130
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:08,460
and then it also just kind of gives us a

131
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,680
little bit more work to do in the winter

132
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:12,199
which in theory could take away some of

133
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,580
the workload from the summer

134
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:16,979
and it's it's all about diversifying

135
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:19,620
those winter sails so growing the stuff

136
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:21,180
is uh it's a lot like growing lettuce

137
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,440
um it doesn't really if you're set up to

138
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,020
grow lettuce it doesn't require any

139
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,880
additional equipment

140
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:29,280
um you can either direct seed it in the

141
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,639
field or transplant it

142
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:36,300
um the most the biggest difference there

143
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,400
is uh the impact on root shape so this

144
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,240
crop even though a lot of people think

145
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,340
of

146
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,100
chicories as

147
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:45,960
um a leafy crop

148
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,580
when you're growing them for forcing you

149
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,400
really got to think about it as uh

150
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:52,740
you're growing a root crop

151
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,360
um and so

152
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,900
um I'll get to it later in the

153
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:00,240
presentation about why root shape can in

154
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,860
certain situations make a difference but

155
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,139
um once you see them and get them in the

156
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,580
field uh it's just like I said it's just

157
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:07,080
like growing lettuce so you've got to

158
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,940
keep them weeded keep them well watered

159
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,139
it's a long crop so they have to be

160
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,919
seated

161
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:14,759
um

162
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:15,539
right around mid-summer or early July

163
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:17,400
um

164
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:19,860
in order to get them in the ground and

165
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:23,100
have them grow enough to produce a

166
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:25,199
sizable root that can be forced

167
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,720
um so for Harvest once you've once

168
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,720
you've grown them all up we used an

169
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:33,000
undercutter bar to lift the bed and then

170
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,280
pull the roots out just like we would if

171
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,199
we were growing carrots

172
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,699
um you trim the greens and you have to

173
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,560
make sure that you leave the growing tip

174
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:43,139
intact you can see on the picture on the

175
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,240
left a lot of those roots have about one

176
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:47,520
to two inches of green still left on top

177
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,520
that's critical for getting especially

178
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:53,580
for Endive for getting the right shape

179
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:55,080
um of the final product

180
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,000
um on the right you can see we threw

181
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,699
them into feed sacks that we stored in

182
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,080
our walk-in cooler to help keep them at

183
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:03,240
the right humidity

184
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:06,419
and they store just like any other root

185
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:08,580
crop best at about you know 32 35 with

186
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:09,960
really high relative humidity

187
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,220
uh here's a picture of the forcing

188
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,220
chamber so like I said the forcing

189
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:17,580
chamber is uh we utilize an uh walking

190
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:19,919
cooler that we use in the summer for

191
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:21,780
um you know storing cold sensitive

192
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,539
things like tomatoes and eggplant and

193
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:27,539
zucchini and cucumbers but in the winter

194
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:29,699
that infrastructure was idle so this was

195
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:31,560
uh this project was a really good way to

196
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:34,020
utilize that idle space that was

197
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:37,560
otherwise just sitting there

198
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:41,220
um we had these galvanized steel tanks

199
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,960
custom made for this project and you can

200
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,400
see kind of just those red hoses

201
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,900
connecting each of the tanks so that we

202
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,919
can circulate water

203
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:51,960
through the entire system

204
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,240
I think that's helpful to keep the water

205
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,800
aerated and keep keep things healthy but

206
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,240
I don't think it's critical I think you

207
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,880
could

208
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,860
um get by with a much simpler system of

209
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:04,259
just some tupperwares with roots in them

210
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,360
and you know a couple inches of water

211
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:07,979
that maybe you changed every couple of

212
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,720
you know maybe once a week or something

213
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:11,580
like that

214
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,400
um so it certainly doesn't have to be

215
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:16,680
this sophisticated I think that um

216
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,360
we just wanted to to really have a

217
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,860
system that

218
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,960
um

219
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,720
fit the best like larger scale

220
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,639
commercial systems that we could

221
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,680
identify and so a lot of the larger

222
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:32,039
commercial systems had had the same kind

223
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:34,260
of water bath circulating water

224
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:36,000
um but I don't think it's critical

225
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:38,760
so this is the actual process for

226
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,099
forcing them for targivo Radicchio you

227
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,479
dig them up uh from the field and you

228
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:44,880
pull them out of storage and on the left

229
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,440
you can see that these plants were

230
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,600
transplanted so you can see that the

231
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,640
roots are a lot more kind of splayed out

232
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,560
and gnarly

233
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,720
um we trim off most of the greens so on

234
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,580
the left you see the root with a lot of

235
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,620
the greens attached still and then on

236
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:01,320
the right is what it looks like before

237
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:04,080
we put it into the bulb crate for

238
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,839
forcing and then on the right hand side

239
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,660
you can see a bulb crate that's ready to

240
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,300
go into the forcing chamber so you peel

241
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:14,220
off most of the greens

242
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:17,160
because the green leaves eventually

243
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:19,680
Decay and die and become kind of a slimy

244
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:22,140
mess and so the less of that that you

245
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,820
bring into the you know

246
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,860
into the forcing chamber the less

247
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:28,080
cleanup you have to do on the back side

248
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,220
and then once you put them into the

249
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,200
forcing chamber it takes about three

250
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,300
weeks for them to grow you can see these

251
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,860
ones in this picture we trimmed all the

252
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,660
greens off

253
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:39,600
um so there's no decaying matter and

254
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,920
that actually worked pretty well too so

255
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,360
um but once they're in there you just

256
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,580
have to make sure that the water level

257
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,260
is sufficient so that the roots have

258
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:48,300
something to drink

259
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,519
and that you don't accidentally leave

260
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,560
the light on that's the biggest thing is

261
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:54,420
any light will cause the plants to start

262
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,160
photosynthesizing which degrades them

263
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:58,860
for Harvest

264
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,779
um you take the bulb crates out

265
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,100
trim off the root and you can see in the

266
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:04,200
picture you leave kind of a little

267
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:07,440
little stub of the root that's at least

268
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:10,560
the traditional Italian way to do it

269
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,480
um uh and you clean off all the bad

270
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,100
leaves and then soak it in cold water to

271
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,600
kind of let it rehydrate just a little

272
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,120
bit it does tend to get a little dried

273
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,279
out in the forcing chamber

274
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,680
and then once you rinse it clean you can

275
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:25,260
shake it dry and package it

276
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,360
um for sale and just keep it dark so it

277
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:29,339
doesn't start photosynthesizing so

278
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,940
Endive is a little bit different

279
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:32,880
um

280
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:34,440
you can just trim them in the field and

281
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,839
you want to make sure like I said before

282
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,760
you leave the right amount of greens

283
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:40,980
intact on the left picture on the left

284
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:43,080
you can see the root on the bottom was

285
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:45,720
trimmed too close and you can see that

286
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,940
there's five or six small little Sprouts

287
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,959
that are coming off of the sides so

288
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,920
those aren't going to be marketable

289
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,899
because they're going to stay really

290
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,100
really small

291
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:56,279
um

292
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:58,260
whereas the root on the top was trimmed

293
00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:02,160
properly and you can still see the

294
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:04,320
growth tip of the greens intact so

295
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,660
that's going to form a nice tight head

296
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,940
growing from the middle of that root so

297
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,200
that's that's the critical thing that we

298
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,959
learned and that was one of those things

299
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,220
that we didn't learn that lesson the

300
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,339
first year that we did it and so

301
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:19,980
extending the project by a second year

302
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:22,019
um allowed us to kind of learn from that

303
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,300
mistake and and have a lot more success

304
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:27,019
the second year

305
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:30,600
um Endive is is

306
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:32,880
grown more on a commercial scale so it's

307
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:36,060
more of a familiar crop than the forcing

308
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,459
radicchios and so it's been bred to

309
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:40,920
develop that really nice straight

310
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:43,620
Tap Root so if you direct seed to

311
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:46,140
Belgian endive it'll grow a nice

312
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:48,600
straight Taproot that then could be

313
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:50,459
packed really tightly into the bulk

314
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,560
crates you can see on the picture on the

315
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:54,420
right that we fit you know more than

316
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,920
double the number of hand dive Roots

317
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,720
into one bulb crate so it's a much more

318
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,640
efficient use of space

319
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,440
so then harvesting

320
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:04,200
um and dive grows a little bit slower it

321
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,440
takes more closer to six weeks

322
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:10,079
um you can see here this picture we've

323
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,040
got on the top there's some chickens

324
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,920
that are just about ready to be

325
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,779
harvested and underneath we have a

326
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,700
um some roots that were started a couple

327
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:19,140
weeks after that so they're just

328
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,660
starting to grow

329
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:24,660
so it's but it's basically you can just

330
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:26,459
cut them off of the um the root either

331
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:29,100
with a knife or just by snapping them

332
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:32,040
off trim off any leaves that are you

333
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:34,200
know ill ill-shaped or have any kind of

334
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:36,660
tinge of green to them and then you can

335
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:39,000
pack them right from the forcing crate

336
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:40,440
um for sale and again keep them dark so

337
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,480
they don't start photosynthesizing we

338
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,220
did notice that the the end I was more

339
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,860
likely to start photosynthesizing than

340
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:49,800
the Radicchio if you aren't careful

341
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:53,100
um marketing you know the restaurants

342
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:55,639
were our primary customers for this uh

343
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,899
product they're both definitely

344
00:12:55,639 --> 00:13:01,380
Specialty Products

345
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:03,180
um the tardivo is not commercially

346
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:05,220
available anywhere in the US that we

347
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:07,500
were available so

348
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:11,399
um that helped it command a higher price

349
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:13,920
but also because it's less familiar you

350
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:16,560
know the the market options are are more

351
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:19,980
limited for sure specialty restaurants

352
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:23,100
that either have an open mind or are

353
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:25,800
have previously worked with it are the

354
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,760
easiest targets Belgian endive on the

355
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,720
other hand

356
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,899
um

357
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,600
is historically more of a large-scale

358
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:36,959
production it's more of an industrial

359
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:39,300
crop so it's it's available from regular

360
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,680
wholesalers vegetable wholesalers uh it

361
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:43,740
shows up on a lot of winter restaurant

362
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:47,700
Market or restaurant menus

363
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:52,200
um so because of that reason the market

364
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:55,680
price is a lot lower so you need to sell

365
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:58,940
in a higher volume in order to make the

366
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:01,200
make it work cost wise

367
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:03,959
I think the opportunity is definitely

368
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,639
there for that but

369
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:07,760
um it's I think you would have to do it

370
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:10,139
on a pretty significant volume

371
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,540
other options are winters farmers

372
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:14,579
markets you know in the same way that uh

373
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:16,380
for restaurants it's a really unique

374
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:18,360
different crop to differentiate

375
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,920
ourselves from the competition in the

376
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,660
winter you know if there's a winter

377
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,420
Farmers Market you know just having

378
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:26,399
these things on your stall is gonna

379
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,480
just everyone's gonna come and take at

380
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,360
least take a look

381
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,959
so then you can tell the story

382
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,519
um

383
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:35,220
and you know you have to do a lot of

384
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:37,380
customer education I think but um

385
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:40,079
the opportunity certainly is there to

386
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:41,459
get people to at least try this unique

387
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,079
product

388
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:44,639
and then you know if they're specialty

389
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:46,440
grocery stores I don't think that

390
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,699
necessarily either of these products are

391
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:51,060
going to show up in

392
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:53,399
regular everyday grocery stores but um

393
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:56,639
there's certainly a possibility for

394
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:59,160
um customers regular you know individual

395
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,240
customers who either already know about

396
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,699
these

397
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,620
um products or are interested in getting

398
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:07,800
their hands on something unique and

399
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:10,079
different so there's other Radicchio

400
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:12,360
varieties that are either meant to be

401
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:15,300
forcing varieties like this isantina in

402
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:18,180
the middle is grows really really small

403
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:19,260
and it's got a really vibrant cool color

404
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,899
but

405
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:23,459
um is you know the market for that is

406
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:25,980
probably pretty limited we've been

407
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:29,220
growing The Chicory Rosa on the left

408
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:31,860
um that is not specifically a forcing

409
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:34,320
variety but in the Upper Midwest it it

410
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:36,600
works that way

411
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,720
um so we've we've had some success

412
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,880
growing that crap as a forcing Radicchio

413
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,740
and then like I mentioned

414
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:46,800
um you know the

415
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:49,579
the Belgian endive I think for our scale

416
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:52,860
we found that um

417
00:15:49,579 --> 00:15:54,480
the the forcing radicchios are more cost

418
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:58,199
effective for us just because of the

419
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:00,420
higher price that they uh command

420
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:03,540
um but again if you wanted to really

421
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:06,000
scale up and do an acre or two of

422
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:08,399
Belgian endive and you know talk to a

423
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,440
wholesaler and try to kind of corner the

424
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,060
the market

425
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,800
um I think that there's possibility

426
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,839
there and I think that you know that it

427
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:19,199
could be cost effective so I think

428
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:21,779
there's definitely opportunities that

429
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:24,120
have been illuminated by this this uh

430
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:25,920
project yeah and so I mean couldn't have

431
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:29,040
done it without North Central Sarah so

432
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,120
uh just thank you for everything that

433
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,220
um

434
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,199
the organization has done to support and

435
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:36,120
fund this project it was it was a lot of

436
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:37,740
fun and we learned a lot and we

437
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,139
certainly developed a practice that

438
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:42,480
we're going to keep using so uh overall

439
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:45,480
it's been a huge success what just like

440
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,160
so for someone experiencing Radicchio or

441
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:52,500
Endive for the first time how would you

442
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:55,199
describe that taste or like yeah it's um

443
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,920
it's definitely bitter so you know I

444
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,620
think

445
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:01,440
um that's the the first thing that um

446
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,699
turns people off is that it's it's got a

447
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,380
bitterness to it

448
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:06,540
um you know because we work with the

449
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:08,400
restaurants we've been

450
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:10,260
they've been slowly nudging us to

451
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,079
growing a lot of radicchios a lot of

452
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:15,059
restaurants are are really excited about

453
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:19,319
that so you know there's kind of a

454
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:22,740
spectrum of like the regular main season

455
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:24,299
um ridicuous like with um kind of frize

456
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,020
and

457
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:27,720
um

458
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:29,100
oh gosh no but escarole are which are

459
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,400
Endive crops

460
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:34,140
um that are on the milder side and then

461
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,380
there's kind of the there's the kyoja

462
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:38,160
which are like the round softball red

463
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:40,980
radicchios that you see in the grocery

464
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,220
store or in the salad mixes those are

465
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:45,780
kind of like less bitter in the middle

466
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:48,179
and then you can go all the way down and

467
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:51,660
there's some really wacky ones that are

468
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:53,460
like um puntarelle is an is a it's like

469
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:55,440
basically you're you're harvesting the

470
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:57,720
flower stock so it's real bitter real

471
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,900
tough but then you soak it in the cold

472
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:03,179
water and it Mellows it out

473
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:05,900
um so so bitterness is kind of the key

474
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:08,160
there is the main feature but there's

475
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:10,320
it's you know it's kind of hard to

476
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,940
describe the flavor unless you you have

477
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,919
it and then the

478
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:16,500
um these forcing varieties because

479
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,240
they're just using they're not using

480
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,400
photosynthesis for their they're just

481
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,679
using cellular respiration so there's a

482
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,620
whole different metabolic pathway that's

483
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:27,059
happening within the plant

484
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,200
um and so it's just they're they're

485
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:29,520
different

486
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,440
um

487
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,960
chemical compounds that are being formed

488
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:37,620
within the leaves so it's um the

489
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:40,020
sweetness is like it's less bitter more

490
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:42,419
sweet but it's not like sugary sweet

491
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:45,299
it's kind of it's a it's a

492
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:47,100
yeah it's it's hard to describe but did

493
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:49,740
the crop find you or you found the crop

494
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:51,480
I guess what I mean by that is like did

495
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:54,179
you imagine yourself when you embarked

496
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:57,480
on farming like yeah endives it's gonna

497
00:18:54,179 --> 00:19:00,000
be all about endives or like no no it

498
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,440
was this was not at all on my radar at

499
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,620
all I mean it's

500
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,059
um I've always enjoyed Radicchio but but

501
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:08,100
even you know prior to getting into

502
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:10,919
growing it myself you know it was not a

503
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:14,760
like it was a staple on my dinner table

504
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:16,799
as a Scandinavian Heritage person from

505
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:19,500
Minnesota you know

506
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,880
um it's not a not a part of my culinary

507
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,960
background but

508
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,880
um

509
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,559
so it was definitely working with the

510
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,880
restaurants that has has kind of pushed

511
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:30,539
us to broaden

512
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,559
um our our scope of the crops that we

513
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:33,240
grow

514
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:35,880
um you know every once in a while we

515
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:38,220
sneak Radicchio into our CSA but it it

516
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,380
doesn't usually go over super well uh

517
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:42,480
it's not a it's not a universally loved

518
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:44,460
thing like uh potatoes or tomatoes or

519
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,520
anything like that you trim the leaves

520
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:49,620
and then you have these leftover Roots

521
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,120
um what do you do with those

522
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:53,039
yeah so

523
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,419
um right now they're just going the

524
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,400
compost

525
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:58,620
um but I think that you know again being

526
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:02,280
that they are

527
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:05,160
um historically have been a forage crop

528
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:08,280
um there's some value for I was just

529
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:11,580
reading before this uh meeting that

530
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:13,440
historically they were used as a

531
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:15,299
substitute for oats for horses because

532
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,160
there's a similar kind of nutrient

533
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:19,140
breakdown

534
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,320
um so for sure you know if you had

535
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:24,120
Livestock on the farm through the winter

536
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:27,299
uh when these spent Roots could you know

537
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:28,580
just go into the pig pasture or into the

538
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:32,340
you know

539
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:34,020
parlor or horse barn whatever

540
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:36,000
um I think that's actually how these

541
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:38,100
first got discovered they would dig them

542
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,179
up and then stick them in the corner of

543
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,799
a barn

544
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:42,419
and then in the spring when things

545
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,220
started warming up they'd start to

546
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:44,940
sprout or if like water was Dripping on

547
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,340
them

548
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:49,980
they'd start to sprout and grow

549
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:52,679
um but in the darkness of the back

550
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:54,960
corner of the barn and so then you know

551
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:57,240
people as they're feeding horses or

552
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,580
whatever like snap one off and take a

553
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:01,679
bite it's like oh this is unique and

554
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:03,299
different roasted chicory is a coffee

555
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,340
substitute so I think you could talk to

556
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:07,020
coffee shops and see if that was

557
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:09,600
something that they wanted to

558
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:12,179
try getting locally

559
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:15,840
um it's showed up in

560
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:17,220
um Stouts and porters and from breweries

561
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,559
um so I think you could talk to Brewers

562
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:22,380
about so I do think that there's an

563
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:24,960
opportunity for turning that into an

564
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:26,700
additional Revenue stream as well and if

565
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,559
nothing else feeding it to livestock so

566
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:32,059
that you you know recapture that value

567
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:36,299
can you use the route more than once

568
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:38,220
they're um there's some speculation that

569
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:41,520
yes you could

570
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:43,799
um I I read some in our initial research

571
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,360
I read some

572
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:48,120
um

573
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:50,340
sources that said yes you can I think

574
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:52,080
maybe if you were to it the the tricky

575
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:55,620
part is like how you were would Harvest

576
00:21:52,080 --> 00:22:00,679
that chicken because then if if you cut

577
00:21:55,620 --> 00:22:00,679
it low enough to keep it as a nice tight

578
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:06,000
that doesn't just like all the all the

579
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:08,760
um leaves fall off

580
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,100
uh you're gonna cut it low enough that

581
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,960
you're gonna damage that that Central

582
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,860
growth tip

583
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,080
um

584
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:18,000
so I think you know maybe snapping it

585
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,200
off you could

586
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,159
um but it's not something that we

587
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,440
explored

588
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:25,080
it's interesting it's beautiful it's

589
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,640
like lots of sequencing and just like I

590
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,440
thank you for taking through that taking

591
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,020
us through that whole process and for

592
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:33,559
other Farmers as well just like and I

593
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:36,059
can just feel your joy in this discovery

594
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:38,760
yeah I mean right exactly and it's you

595
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:40,980
know again I I think that you know for

596
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,580
small scale agriculture

597
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,380
um

598
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:45,659
you know especially working with

599
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:47,460
restaurants a lot of the farmers that we

600
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:49,620
know that are you know growing mixed

601
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:53,460
vegetables in the winter they switch to

602
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:55,080
like large volumes of a couple root

603
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:57,000
crops

604
00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:00,419
um you know selling to school districts

605
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,580
or uh wholesalers or grocery stores that

606
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:03,480
kind of thing which you know is

607
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:07,320
certainly

608
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:09,020
viable and um but you know we as threat

609
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:11,039
as the farm that we are we're we're

610
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:13,559
sized a little different and we found

611
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:15,720
that every time we try to dip our toe

612
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:18,600
into that really larger scale like

613
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,919
moving pallets of things at a time uh

614
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,340
and always you know we're just not

615
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:25,380
geared for that so we

616
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:27,419
we were really hoping that this would be

617
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:30,600
something that would allow us to kind of

618
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:33,720
keep that smaller scale but just you

619
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:35,580
know increase the value of those smaller

620
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,440
smaller deliveries to restaurants in the

621
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:40,050
winter and

622
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:44,460
um and it really did pay off

623
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:47,460
