1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,449
do I need to spend the extra money for

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:05,449
flow control valves

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:13,219
my suggestion is you definitely need to

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,529
install flow control valves in your

5
00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:18,380
sprinkler zones that use pop up spray

6
00:00:15,529 --> 00:00:20,029
heads a typical situation faced by many

7
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:22,849
of our customers is one in which you

8
00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:24,800
have multiple zones one with rotors and

9
00:00:22,849 --> 00:00:26,420
a different zone with spray heads rotors

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,189
require at least 50 pounds per square

11
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:30,349
inch of water pressure in order to

12
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:32,870
properly function and spray heads work

13
00:00:30,349 --> 00:00:35,720
best with about 30 psi of water pressure

14
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:38,809
when the 50 psi reaches your spray heads

15
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:40,579
misting will occur by installing flow

16
00:00:38,809 --> 00:00:42,770
control valves in your spray head zones

17
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:44,360
you are able to provide the proper water

18
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,850
pressure to all of your sprinklers

19
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,010
resulting in adequate irrigation all
