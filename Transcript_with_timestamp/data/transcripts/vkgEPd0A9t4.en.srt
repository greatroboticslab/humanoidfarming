1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,400
small machinery is among the innovations

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,920
that could be critical to st lucia's

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,000
food security

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,800
as autonomous farming promises to

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,200
produce more crops with less effort and

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,440
less environmental impact

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,760
farmers extension officers as well as

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,400
students recently completed a small

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,640
machinery training as part of the latest

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,880
feat of the second phase of the

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,359
enhancement of the efficiency of the

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,920
production distribution supply chain in

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,640
the fruit and vegetable sector project

14
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,559
also known as the seven crops project

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,520
participants learned how to operate

16
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:40,000
tillers and bunkers to perform primary

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,040
and secondary tillage for vegetable

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,120
farming

project coordinator for the seven crops

20
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,920
project adelinovic says the training is

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,800
in preparation for the shipment of small

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,879
machinery due to arrive later this year

23
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,879
as the ministry works towards adapting

24
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,399
to farm mechanization

25
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,399
in the past we've had several machines

26
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,160
that we have received but when it comes

27
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,960
to maintenance and how to operate the

28
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,720
machines properly it becomes an issue so

29
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,040
we have some young farmers today and

30
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,200
also some schoolchildren and extension

31
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,520
officers as well who are receiving

32
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,400
first-hand

33
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,000
training

34
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,159
in how to use these machines the proper

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,720
use of the machines so that when these

36
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,479
machines arrive we would have had that

37
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,520
done already so it could move

38
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,759
move smoothly into operations minister

for agriculture fisheries food security

40
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,640
and rural development honourable alfred

41
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,360
prosper says the introduction of small

42
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,920
mechanization particularly labor-saving

43
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,680
agricultural technology is aimed at

44
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,439
making the agriculture sector more

45
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,520
appealing to the youth

46
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,920
he notes that farm mechanization not

47
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,320
only saves time and energy but it is

48
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,159
also more efficient and can contribute

49
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,600
significantly to the development of

50
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,200
value chains

51
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,040
i've always said

52
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,640
that we haven't changed the way things

53
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,040
are done in the sector

54
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,600
farmers have been complaining of

55
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,119
the unavailability of agricultural

56
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,399
or family labor

57
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,680
to be exact

58
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,200
and

59
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,360
given

60
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,280
the old cross of the

61
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,160
is time that we

62
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,200
our farmers change the way from garand

63
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,760
all

64
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,400
in an effort to use a coastal production

65
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:22,080
farm machinery is one new technology

66
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,160
that i think is very very clear

67
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,720
because it drastically reduces the cost

68
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,520
of production a small machinery that you

69
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,200
see there will reduce the cost of maybe

70
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,120
if you had to use

71
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,560
manual labor what is happening with a

72
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,640
small machinery there

73
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,879
it would have probably

74
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,800
be done in one hour it may have taken

75
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,000
four days for one

76
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,519
worker to do

77
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,160
that is really going to be reducing the

78
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,060
cost of production of the farmer

79
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,160

adopt sustainable agricultural
