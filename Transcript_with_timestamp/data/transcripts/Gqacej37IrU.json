  "text": "folks how we doing thanks for stopping by today we are going to talk about a common question that I'm asked enough to make this video so we're looking at a small area however you can replicate this times as big of an area as you have to do the question of the day is how do you level out a bumpy lawn a bumpy field a bumpy pasture how do you level these areas out well the biggest challenge with these areas that you're going to deal with is size all right or maybe it's weeds inside or it's all that organic matter that's on the surface that's rooted in there all right and most customers when they reach out to me they're looking for a tool or tools to accomplish this renovation the first thing that they mention is using a box blade or a lamp plane and if you have sad those are not going to be the right tools to use they are very challenging because of the root systems and if you have the scarifiers or the shanks that are on those tools you may think I can rip through that surface rip it all up and then just use the box blade or the plane just to kind of pull it all to the side but what you're going to find is it's just creating a huge mess those Shanks are going to rip through the ground every 6 8 10 Ines apart you're going to have to drive back and forth over and over and over again to get all of the different root clumps worked up and then you're going to have to drive all over it again over and over and over and over again to repeatedly collect all that material you're going to wind up with a gigantic pile of it or multiple piles of it scattered all about that you have to then clean up with a bucket it's just going to be a long arduous tedious process that's not going to give you great results on top of that you're stripping away a lot of good organic material that should be there to help Reed your pasture your lawn whatever it is basically those nutrients that you would want to have in the soil to begin with to help give it a good start what I have found and we've done this actually in in many different scenarios we've we've used tillers okay we've used a tiller right here and if you follow the channel this area was actually littered with stumps just like this one there's one that's just off to the side a little bit an area that we haven't renovated but stumps just like this one this whole area was full of them and we used our stump wer we dug all those out and made a big old mess okay there were holes here and piles of dirt around and then the stumps of course that we got out of there but then we just kind of used our bucket and pushed the dirt back in those those holes where the stumps were at just to get it kind of a a rough level then we came back through with a tiller and we tilled this whole area all right we didn't till just the areas that had the bumps we just tilled everything so that it worked the entire surface up consistently right and we did that two or three times just back and forth back and forth back and forth and so what that's going to do is it's going to break up consistently all the side clumps here it doesn't mean it's going to get rid of every single last one and break it down into a super fine matter but it's doing it repeatedly across the whole area so it's smooth and consistent and you can work with it and the great part is it leaves all that organic matter right there it's right there where it needs to be where it's going to do its best work helping to regrow the grass or um The Orchard grasses or whatever it is that you're planning in that area that you want to succeed and so we did most of this work last spring okay we dug out the stumps I tilled everything up and then I used a deer rake you could also use a landscape rake if you had that on hand or depending on what your long-term application is you want a tool that's versatile a landscape rake or a dethatcher either one is super versatile and this is just one application for it but I took the decher and raked everything to one side so there was still some you know little side clumps and there are some sticks and some other little bits of debris in here rake those all to one side it was a lot less material and and the rakes and the deers they're going to let the dirt kind of fall out for the most part you're just stuck with the debris that you don't want there so it's still leaving a lot of the nutrients there as well got what you see here okay and then of course what happened well we had no rain all right I kept waiting for there to be rain in the forecast to seed this area and we had a super dry Spring and most of the summer as well and so I didn't do anything I didn't put any seed down to that point because it wasn't going to be successful and there were some weeds that were growing up here and there and so what I did is when I came back in the fall when I was planting food plots I repeated that process I tilted up one more time okay which was really easy to do because i' previously tilled it then I came back through and used the Thatcher EG one more time just to get a nice final level right cuz that rake whether it's the Thatcher or the landscape rake is one long plane right it's at the same level and so you can get a 5 foot or a 6ot or an 8ot whatever size rake you want to get one grade okay so it makes it much more consistent back and forth to be a level surface at that point I seated I used our Beth Co seater broadcast seated this area and then I use my rake one more time to kind of help cover all that seed up and give it the best possible chance for germination did that in it was either late August or early September actually that's not true it was late September I got to it a little bit late and so this is what you see going on and so it the grass the seedlings all got a good start for now had about maybe a month or so of uh decent growing conditions in the fall and this will be great next spring and in fact we actually had sprinklers put in down in this area here so we'll be able to irrigate this water this on a regular basis and uh and maintain it just like part of our yard but the same concept the same process can be applied to whether it's a little just a little patch here that's what 40 by 80 ft or if you're doing a two or three acre renovation you don't have to do the whole thing at one time you can still break it down into chunks maybe a quarter here and a quarter there maybe get your process down right do a smaller area the first time see if you're doing everything in the right order the right sequence that you want to do and then just repeat that on the rest of it and it it can make it seem like it's not an insurmountable task either but I'm telling you the first thing you can do a lot of folks don't like to spray but if you can spray if you're okay with that and kill all the grass and the weeds that's going to weaken the root system and make the rest of the job a lot easier if you don't want to spray then I would at least SC your field or your lawn or whatever it is scalp it so it's if the sun's hitting it it's burning the grass and basically killing it at that point and maybe scalp it again if there's still anything existing the idea being you want to weaken those root systems as much as possible because it's going to make your life a lot easier for the rest of this project so after you accomplish that step that's when you come through with the tiller tilling is fun it's a great job I mean it's amazing the results the before and after results that you can get with a tiller there's no tool like it it's just incredible and you think they're just for putting and food plots and Gardens but they're for so much more we actually use it for our our driveway our gravel driveway installations you want to peel out top soil when you're put in a driveway and again to make that top soil easily reusable not full of sad clumps a great way to do that is to till it up first right because it just makes everything consistent and and and breaks down as you have it sitting there in your side pile then you can scoop out some bucket fold and use it in different areas of your of your property and different projects that you have coming up instead of having big of dirt that you're then picking out a whole hunk of sad and have to throw to the side that stuff's already chopped up with the tiller so they're great tools to have very handy to have around and you get creative you can find more ways to use it so again after getting done tilling that's when you come through with your rake do all that final grading take it as far as you want right I mean if it depending if it's just a rough pasture if it's going to be a yard you spend more or less time on there depending on the application at hand at that point is when you're going to seed use that RI again to lightly cover up the seed so it has good seed to soil germination apply some water and fertilizer and Away you
