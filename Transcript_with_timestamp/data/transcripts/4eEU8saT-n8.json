  "text": "So, she's learning how to silky plow. We're going to follow them around for about seven minutes while we also learn a few things about about the silky plow. I'm at Tillers International today, which is a training center for historic farm skills like the Sulky Plow. Hi, my name is Chuck. The channel is around Van Beern and today we're talking about the Sulki plow. They're working a twoacre plot along with other uh volunteer draft horse teams. Today I caught up with Cody in the Tillers International woodworking shop and this is what he told me. How tillers international started. It was a forum for training draft animals. And so that two acres out there is sort of what ties everything together. It's where we practice those historic skills and make them come alive. People are welcome to come here and to learn these historic skills for whatever reason that they have. Maybe they want to use them on their own market garden farm or maybe they just want they're curious and they want to have the joy of learning. The sulky plow was invented by the John Deere company in 1875 and since then it's been built by many other companies. She's leading the team. Although it seems like the horse on the right is a leader, too. Thank you for coming out. I'm Cody. Hey, Cody. I'm Darren. Darren, I think we met just Yeah, we have met before, I think. But yeah, are you farm manager? Is that what what is that what you're talking? What do you do? [Music] Okay. But I hoped uh we have uh a couple of sections of Ry and then you can see this hairy bench. Today, one of the manufacturers of sulky plows is Pioneer Equipment. Another company that makes sulky plows today is White Horse Machine. Here's a picture of one of the the White Horse machine uh sulky plows. It can plow 10 to 12 acres a day. I was looking online for instructions on how to use the Sulky plow. Uh, I've got a link that's uh about as close as I can get, but I think your best bet is to uh sign up with killers international.org for one of their training sessions. If you visit um Killers International outside, it's out of Kazoo, Michigan, they've got camping and rooming. I don't I don't understand entirely, but contact them. Also, in the southeast corner of Kazoo, there's plenty of hotels, and that's a short drive away from uh Children's International. Other teams are out today practicing their skills and demonstrating draft animals as well. Oh, blacksmith at Tillers International is very helpful and uh he explained more about how things work. From tiller's program's perspective, we work with people from other countries frequently where there's not a dealer where you can get parts for repairing your farm equipment. Yeah. So the pieces sometimes are locally manufactured or sometimes they're imported from somewhere else. But if something breaks, the only way you're getting it fixed is to go to the village blacksmith just like they did in this country in the old days. Yeah. And get them to make a new part or repair the piece you have. And so sometimes it might be a modern repair like an arc weld, but it could often be just done with rivets or bolts or something involve working in a forge like this one. Mhm. You're heating the parts up to bend them around, change the shape. Okay, good. Thank you. Okay, nice talking to you. for their farming program. Tillers International trains anyone. Small farms, truck patch farms, subsistence farmers, homesteaders, preppers, self-sufficient survivalist, off-grid, international farmers, organic farmers. Who did I miss? The Amish use horsedrawn farm implements like this all the time, but they grow up with it. For horserawn equipment, teams can consist of two, three, or four horses. The number of horses used depends on the equipment and the weight that's being pulled. A common setup is two horses hitched side by side. In this case, we have four horses hitched side by side. And sometimes the four horse hitch would consist of two teams, one in front of the other. Early sulky plows like the Oliver turned uh 12, 14 or 16inch furrows and were pulled by three horses or mules. Axle grease reduced friction. Modern silky plows might have a dozen or more grease fittings. Now we're going to see her in the driver's seat. Thanks for watching. Looking forward to reading your comments about the Sulki Plow. Be sure to like and subscribe. I'll see you next time.",
