1
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:13,490
welcome all we are going to divide the

2
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:15,130
session in two first we are going to

3
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:20,440
have

4
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:23,560
main presentations of our cases and then

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:27,369
we are we will like to open a space of

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:30,010
discussion with our panelists so I would

7
00:00:27,369 --> 00:00:33,460
like to introduce you to have it Clemens

8
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:35,890
Harry Clemens is a program officer of

9
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:38,970
carbon finance in evils the humanist

10
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:41,970
Institute of development cooperation

11
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,970
Harry

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:49,900
so I'll start then maybe you can start

13
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:53,410
the slides here so I will talk about

14
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:56,380
well I will give one presentation on one

15
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:58,330
of the cases about the relationship

16
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:01,690
between agriculture and climate change

17
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:04,930
with also incorporating climate finance

18
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:08,950
that's the case of the bio slurry by a

19
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:12,850
flurry which is used as fertilizer in

20
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:18,040
connection with with biogas domestic

21
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:21,210
biogas so the next the first slide yeah

22
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:25,259
so here you can see the basic design of

23
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:29,770
the bio digester we have programs of

24
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:34,060
biogas and by lorry in several countries

25
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:37,780
of Africa Asia and Latin America and the

26
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:41,740
basic it's a household level so these

27
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:45,459
are small digesters the basic design is

28
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:48,219
a fixed dome design of we have in

29
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:51,280
between four cubic and thirteen cubic

30
00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:55,209
meter and so you can see on the picture

31
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,009
that on the left side there's the the

32
00:01:55,209 --> 00:02:00,189
wet organic waste

33
00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:03,450
that's the inflow so usually it's a

34
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:08,860
livestock manure and also human equity

35
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:12,569
so you need to put the the manure the

36
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:15,970
left side it flows into the digester

37
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:20,650
there it is the process of the digesting

38
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:23,920
so after yeah after some 20 to 30 days

39
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:27,040
it starts producing the gas the cost

40
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:31,510
goes up and by the cost

41
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:33,400
sure the the digester slurry gets on the

42
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:35,620
pressure and they'll be put out to the

43
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,620
right so that the effluent that is the

44
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:41,590
bios slurry that will automatically go

45
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:46,030
out and that's the fertilizer that we

46
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:48,849
will be talking about so the design is

47
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:50,439
that we manage usually in the he force

48
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:52,689
and S&T programs

49
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:54,670
it's the fixed dome design coach on the

50
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:59,920
ground you have other models but this is

51
00:02:54,670 --> 00:03:04,030
a model that is quite quite solid so it

52
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:08,409
is a usual lifetime of it 20 years or

53
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:13,030
longer so but the investment cost is not

54
00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:16,090
so low but it varies between countries

55
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:18,700
in general Asia is much cheaper than

56
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:21,430
Africa and also then Latin America now

57
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:23,680
so the construction cost would be in

58
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:27,669
between three hundred and fifteen eight

59
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:31,299
hundred dollars in Asia and between 600

60
00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:35,319
and 1,000 dollars in Africa and also in

61
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:38,470
Latin America so it has basically two

62
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:40,299
products no the biogas for cooking and

63
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:43,359
lighting and also the by slurry is

64
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:48,940
volcanic fertilizer so the next light

65
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:51,129
please yeah so here you can see the the

66
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:53,739
well the two products are the the bio

67
00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:56,109
castes in the in the Vice slurry but

68
00:03:53,739 --> 00:04:01,389
there are multiple benefits so it

69
00:03:56,109 --> 00:04:05,079
decided the programs they create local

70
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:11,109
employment now at the the the gas which

71
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:13,409
is a clean cooking fuel so it has yeah

72
00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:16,530
the cooking which is convenient fast

73
00:04:13,409 --> 00:04:22,139
healthy and there's also the lighting

74
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:24,310
option or well better to say the

75
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:26,470
aggregate for those households that

76
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:30,310
don't have electricity

77
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:33,310
the lighting is also a nice benefit and

78
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:35,430
then there's the fertilizer so next like

79
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:40,599
this

80
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:43,419
so the bios slurry there's a yes I

81
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:45,520
mentioned the supreme fertilizer it can

82
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:49,240
be applied in three different forms now

83
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:54,240
it can be applied directly in a liquid

84
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:57,669
form that has added the digester slurry

85
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:01,719
is beneficial because it's readily

86
00:04:57,669 --> 00:05:04,840
available the nutrients so the liquid

87
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:08,199
form can be absorbed by the and used by

88
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:11,229
the plant directly the disadvantages

89
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:16,029
that yet a heavy and it's not so

90
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:19,419
convenient to do transport so when when

91
00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:23,650
the farmer uses it for longer distances

92
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:27,219
they often dry it and then the third

93
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:29,949
alternative is to compost it and that

94
00:05:27,219 --> 00:05:35,860
would be the best form but well that

95
00:05:29,949 --> 00:05:38,949
depends on the niche no so the most

96
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:43,469
common or the most popular model is six

97
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:47,860
cubic metre and that is sufficient for

98
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:52,240
one fertilizing one hectare on average

99
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:56,379
and if you compost it with organic waste

100
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:58,960
you can yeah you can use product you

101
00:05:56,379 --> 00:06:01,629
have fertilizer for about three hectares

102
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:05,339
of course all this variable it's depends

103
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:09,639
on the crop and the specific needs and

104
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:13,029
that also is for the for the revenues

105
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:18,009
and the yield increases so actually we

106
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:21,930
have made a document with all the yeah

107
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:24,699
the different results in in practice how

108
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:28,870
yields are increasing in different crops

109
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:33,040
so I brought some copies of that that

110
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:37,180
will be at the SNP booth here in the

111
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:41,170
yeah in the in the one of those buffers

112
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:44,140
so there you can see in more detail the

113
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:48,540
benefits of the slurry but on average is

114
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:52,420
25 percent revenue increase compared to

115
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:54,570
the the the raw manure so next slide

116
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,570
please

117
00:06:55,530 --> 00:07:05,670
okay so at those programs that we have

118
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:11,020
in society in Africa Asia and Latin

119
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:12,760
America well in Africa does the African

120
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:18,280
biogas partnership program that's in

121
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:23,820
five countries we have an Indonesia and

122
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:26,350
Cambodia so now we have carbon projects

123
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:28,180
registered for biogas in four countries

124
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:32,170
and in validation for the other

125
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:35,830
countries we will focus now on the Kenya

126
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:39,120
and Indonesia because that's where we

127
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:41,620
are working also on the by slurry part

128
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:45,760
on the energy part

129
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:49,600
hence it is already registered in Kenyan

130
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:55,330
Indonesia Kenya case by the CDM is a

131
00:07:49,600 --> 00:08:01,810
renewable energy project so they're what

132
00:07:55,330 --> 00:08:06,790
you quantify is the replacement of of

133
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:09,130
firewood now and also but that's more in

134
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:11,170
Indonesia and in Cambodia there's also

135
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:15,060
the manual management because there's no

136
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:18,010
methane emissions in the raw menu so

137
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:19,930
Indonesia domestic biogas project is

138
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:25,390
registered in the voluntary code

139
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:28,510
standard in 2013 and on average we are

140
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:31,810
all variable but on average it's Fortin

141
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:34,500
co2 per household so there's four carbon

142
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:37,540
credits per household

143
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:41,260
that's for the energy part so that is

144
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:44,200
the part that is fitting into the the

145
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:48,430
current called standard

146
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:51,520
and CDM method approve methodologies but

147
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:54,700
it does not recognize the part for the

148
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:56,080
bios slurry so now we are working with

149
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:59,260
the gold standard as the gold standard

150
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,810
launched maybe you have seen it launched

151
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:04,870
this week the the gold standard

152
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:10,030
agriculture standard and was last

153
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:13,810
Wednesday and so and now we can work on

154
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:17,650
the methodologies to be approved to to

155
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:20,410
quantify the impact on carbon

156
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:23,050
sequestration and fertilizer replacement

157
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:26,190
by the by the base salary and we are

158
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:29,460
working on that it's yeah the depends on

159
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:32,890
where you use it many different crops

160
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:35,230
and and how you use it in liquid form or

161
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:39,360
in the dried form on the composite form

162
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:47,310
so that makes we are different

163
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:47,310
situations here maybe the next lighting

164
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:56,439
yeah okay so do we we are working there

165
00:09:53,379 --> 00:10:02,290
for the soil and more no that's a

166
00:09:56,439 --> 00:10:05,499
specialized company so they have

167
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:10,110
produced the methodology white paper so

168
00:10:05,499 --> 00:10:12,910
an initial methodology for the for the

169
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:15,819
measurement of the carbon impact of bio

170
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:19,689
celery we have done by celery use the

171
00:10:15,819 --> 00:10:21,970
surface in Kenya and Indonesia and we

172
00:10:19,689 --> 00:10:24,850
have now also the feasibility study for

173
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:28,869
Indonesia based on that to use a surface

174
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:31,269
so we have made a baseline scenario

175
00:10:28,869 --> 00:10:33,819
project basic scenario probably plus

176
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:37,449
scenario and that's basically because

177
00:10:33,819 --> 00:10:39,790
it's so different in the different types

178
00:10:37,449 --> 00:10:43,839
of applications so most people now use

179
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:47,619
it in the liquid or right form and only

180
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:52,300
small percentage in the composite form

181
00:10:47,619 --> 00:10:54,610
there and so the initial calculations is

182
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:58,720
that with the project basic scenario

183
00:10:54,610 --> 00:11:02,980
with that mix of applications it's 2.4

184
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:07,449
tonne per hectare that if we if up to

185
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:10,019
70% of the users would make composite

186
00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:13,809
and it would go up to 5 points written

187
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:19,299
the hectare and then well on average the

188
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:23,649
farmers they have 0.6 hectares those

189
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:26,799
that are in the in the survey so that's

190
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:33,850
more or less see we dedicated the case

191
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:37,089
description just still one more slide ok

192
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:41,920
yeah so it's a kind of a landscape plus

193
00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:44,290
I would say because it has the bio

194
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,629
khasimbai story in combination it really

195
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:49,029
has all three elements of the landscape

196
00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:51,939
the reduced deforestation or because of

197
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:54,490
the substitutes the replacement of of

198
00:11:51,939 --> 00:12:00,100
the firewood it has the improved

199
00:11:54,490 --> 00:12:02,680
agriculture and it is also reinforcing

200
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:06,160
the integrated livestock and crops

201
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:10,270
system and it has the energy system so

202
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:12,399
and besides that it also is let's say

203
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:15,730
the plus because it's about lively oats

204
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:18,370
it's about food security there's a very

205
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:21,100
strong health benefit that there's the

206
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:25,120
time savings because especially

207
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:28,390
important for the women because they in

208
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,399
many places are to collect the wood and

209
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:32,860
there's the income generation both by

210
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,740
the users and by the constructor so baby

211
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:40,000
yeah I've not mentioned yet that it's a

212
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:40,930
market-based approach we train construct

213
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,560
Mason's

214
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:47,220
they form small enterprises and so

215
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:51,370
there's also the local employment

216
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:56,850
economy part so that's yeah let's say

217
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:56,850
netscape's plus thank you

218
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:08,980
I kindly ask you all do to maintain your

219
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:12,430
questions to the end and I want to

220
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:17,230
introduce now to Francisco Fonseca a

221
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:17,230
senior researcher and adviser of zydeco

222
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:26,300
yes it works well I work for saveco

223
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,520
which is an NGO based in Costa Rica we

224
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:31,970
work in some other countries in Latin

225
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:33,140
America Sudoku is needed a sport for

226
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:35,510
about 30 years

227
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:37,940
you know sustainable agriculture and we

228
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:42,290
also have developed methodology named

229
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:44,630
cambio dos which is proper for measuring

230
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:48,190
carbon sequestration from sustainable

231
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:51,020
practice in just a lot of farming the

232
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:53,450
I'm going to present you some of the

233
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:54,920
results we already have after somehow

234
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:57,740
like one and a half years working

235
00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:01,370
together with the gold standard this is

236
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:03,290
one of the six projects selected to

237
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:06,740
implement agriculture methodologies that

238
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:08,990
may be used for the new standard of the

239
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:11,840
gold standard this whole process is

240
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:14,530
being sponsored by he was from from the

241
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:18,290
Netherlands next one

242
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:22,220
so pacifying is the name of the project

243
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:23,630
it stands for sustained agree culture in

244
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:27,010
coffee plantations in Nicaragua in

245
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:30,770
Spanish of course we are working with a

246
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:32,720
quite important organization a

247
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:35,510
cooperative second level cooperative

248
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:39,260
named por el de Kaap the it is

249
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:42,610
cooperative covers around 38 different

250
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:44,920
cups and we picked three two

251
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:48,560
cooperatives from two different

252
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:50,570
departments in in the northern part of

253
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,730
Nicola over there placed were most of

254
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:57,070
the high quality coffee comes from

255
00:14:52,730 --> 00:15:00,470
Nicaragua one co-operative was

256
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:02,960
conventional plus for trade under the

257
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:06,980
co-operative implement organic practice

258
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:12,140
certified as well plus portray from them

259
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:13,800
we picked 45 farms to implement the

260
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:18,660
computers methodology

261
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:21,449
in the film what some key aspects to be

262
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:25,050
remind from these cooperatives are that

263
00:15:21,449 --> 00:15:27,059
they are a great system our forces

264
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:31,410
systems that means that they have

265
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:34,709
already established four trees into the

266
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:36,989
coffee plantations for Shailene and our

267
00:15:34,709 --> 00:15:41,160
expect to be remind important is that

268
00:15:36,989 --> 00:15:41,869
they apply almost nothing very low to

269
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,339
nothing

270
00:15:41,869 --> 00:15:47,360
fertilizers so they have very low yields

271
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:50,749
and because of the under Nernst

272
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:55,049
condition of the plants they are

273
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:57,929
affected thoroughly severely for the

274
00:15:55,049 --> 00:16:00,019
coffee leave rust and other diseases so

275
00:15:57,929 --> 00:16:03,499
that's something that we want to tackle

276
00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:03,499
next one please

277
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:13,790
so in an eventual project with carbon

278
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:17,790
credits satisfied by the gold standard

279
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:20,790
we would expect to be these carbon

280
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:25,439
credits to be invested in a composting

281
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:29,579
facility to improve yields and to have a

282
00:16:25,439 --> 00:16:33,839
better way to manage the the sanitary

283
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:38,100
aspects of the plants and we already

284
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:40,889
said that they are real trees in the in

285
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:44,429
the systems so the carbon will come from

286
00:16:40,889 --> 00:16:47,519
the aerial biomass that they said the

287
00:16:44,429 --> 00:16:50,579
leaves and parts of the trees that comes

288
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:54,139
to falsehood into the ground and add to

289
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:57,569
carbon to the soil and soil carbon

290
00:16:54,139 --> 00:17:00,179
biomass and avoided emissions that comes

291
00:16:57,569 --> 00:17:03,240
from the substitution from chemical

292
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:07,770
fertilizers and now using compost or

293
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:11,549
organic fertilizers so in a twenty years

294
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:15,360
period this trail will be added from the

295
00:17:11,549 --> 00:17:18,419
trees and from adding applying composing

296
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:22,049
in the field that will add carbon to the

297
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:23,850
soil and will avoid emissions to the to

298
00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:25,890
the to the Earth's atmosphere

299
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:29,610
nice

300
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:33,430
so these one pre-action we have made

301
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:37,420
some model with ROTC model we have done

302
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:40,960
this prediction calculating to satisfy

303
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:42,970
the 60% of nitrogen for the coffee plant

304
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,080
for them to increase yields that

305
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:48,040
something that they cannot achieve

306
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:50,580
currently and so this is the forecast an

307
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:54,580
example the forecast accumulation rate

308
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:58,300
per year per hectare in 20 years that

309
00:17:54,580 --> 00:18:03,480
will be used for for the carbon credits

310
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:03,480
estimation in the future the next one

311
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:11,110
here we have two variables is one is

312
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:13,360
yields expected yields and emissions so

313
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:16,150
we have organic on the top and bottom

314
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:20,490
and the bulk of conventional farmers on

315
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:23,380
the top we see with the purple bars

316
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:26,560
there is the situation where there is no

317
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:29,350
project so in the organic farms Jews

318
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:33,250
will remain about the same you can see

319
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:35,650
in the red line that emissions will be

320
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:39,880
about the same emissions of greenhouse

321
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:43,390
gases but having the project we may

322
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:46,570
expect these yields to increase by year

323
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:50,380
six to almost double but we can see it

324
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:52,870
in the blue line that emissions will go

325
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:56,430
up as well I'm going to that later

326
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:59,440
you know sly for conventional farmers

327
00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:03,330
the spectators will be that you can see

328
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:08,350
again in the purple bars they will have

329
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:12,040
more similar yields it depends on coffee

330
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:15,300
price and the cost of fertilizers but we

331
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:17,860
can see that they would be parallel to

332
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:21,100
increments of the carbon emission due to

333
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:23,680
the chemical fertilizers with the

334
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:28,240
project we would SPECT the day to

335
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:31,890
increase whether the the deal we can see

336
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:34,920
in the in the green bars but we see in

337
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:37,410
the blue line that the emissions will be

338
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:40,830
reduced because of the substitution of

339
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:45,990
chemical fertilizers with compost that's

340
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:50,280
only so what I say about the emissions

341
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:55,470
from the compose application so we have

342
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:58,110
estimated that the compost will cause

343
00:19:55,470 --> 00:20:01,380
emissions but they will also add carbon

344
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:05,850
into the soil and in the organic farming

345
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:09,060
systems the accumulation of carbon will

346
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:11,790
be six times higher than the emissions

347
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:13,650
caused because of the composing so they

348
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:15,960
we don't need to worry about that is

349
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:18,830
about the same case in the conventional

350
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:22,590
one the next one please

351
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:26,129
next please

352
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:28,649
okay as I said before they have our

353
00:20:26,129 --> 00:20:32,070
forces systems where there are banana

354
00:20:28,649 --> 00:20:35,190
crops and trees useful also for the bees

355
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:39,990
they produce honey so it's important and

356
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:44,190
there are the trees covering the the the

357
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:47,669
coffee plants and district agencies - in

358
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:48,299
a capture rate for co2 assist sets in

359
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:52,679
conventional

360
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:55,019
2.33 3233 and organic a little bit lower

361
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:57,740
because they have more trees in the

362
00:20:55,019 --> 00:21:00,210
conventional ones so this important to

363
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:01,070
bear in mind because of the next slide

364
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:04,070
please

365
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:04,070
next

366
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:12,029
next

367
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:16,019
yeah so one of the importance of this

368
00:21:12,029 --> 00:21:19,409
project is that because of the coffee

369
00:21:16,019 --> 00:21:23,610
rust especially the conventional farmers

370
00:21:19,409 --> 00:21:27,419
are tempted to switch from the bars that

371
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:30,750
they already have to more resistant

372
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:32,879
varieties to the coffee Li rust and the

373
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:37,080
problem is that these darts approach

374
00:21:32,879 --> 00:21:40,830
with this the car these this plants

375
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:43,980
needs more light so they will cut the

376
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:46,350
trees they're already there and this

377
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:48,919
coffee the quality of this coffee is not

378
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:51,629
that good and the pro means that these

379
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:53,730
organization Prada coke is well

380
00:21:51,629 --> 00:21:56,909
positioned in the market because of the

381
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:59,639
quality of the coffee so they will lose

382
00:21:56,909 --> 00:22:05,789
market and they won't get the fur trade

383
00:21:59,639 --> 00:22:08,700
price they already have that complete so

384
00:22:05,789 --> 00:22:10,529
this is what we expect to happen with

385
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:15,059
the project it's another representation

386
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:18,120
we already have measured the baseline we

387
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:20,190
have already measured what is the

388
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:22,649
increase in carbon sequestration because

389
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:26,250
the shift from conventional systems

390
00:22:22,649 --> 00:22:28,830
including organic farming but by

391
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:30,870
implementing a compulsion facility we

392
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:33,360
would spec this carbon right

393
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:36,870
sequestration two-spirit to be boosts

394
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:39,120
and then this is what would be the

395
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:42,179
additionality of the project that would

396
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:47,279
be offered in the market and the carbon

397
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:48,750
markets next one please so again the

398
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:50,279
composting facility will go to the

399
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:53,220
coffee plantations we expect this to

400
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:56,009
increased yields and to increase also

401
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:58,830
carbon in soil and we get further carbo

402
00:22:56,009 --> 00:23:00,870
prayers that will be used for paying

403
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:04,759
back the investment in the composting

404
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:04,759
facility next one please

405
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:19,770
sir

406
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:22,950
so their benefits sorry are a you

407
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:25,770
increase the yields to have a better

408
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:33,630
control of the diseases especially the

409
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:36,480
coffee Li rust and there's something we

410
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:39,600
already have found that by using organic

411
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:42,740
fertilizer to improving the nutrition of

412
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:47,010
the plant we better we get better a

413
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:48,780
taste way better a higher qualification

414
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:51,420
of the other of the coffee if they have

415
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:54,900
a better taste so they can claim for a

416
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:57,990
higher price and we have seen also we

417
00:23:54,900 --> 00:24:01,500
have measured for example from reduction

418
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:05,220
from 20 to 5 percent reductions in the

419
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:07,200
the defective coffee beings so this is

420
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:09,390
very important for the in terms of the

421
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:13,970
yield and the quantities they can sell

422
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:16,500
into the quality markets next one please

423
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:19,770
so we expect from this product to

424
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:21,810
increase the income from having higher

425
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:24,150
yields to improve the quality of the

426
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:27,000
coffee to reduce the losses because of

427
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:30,120
the coffee beans and of course because

428
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,390
reducing also the losses due to the

429
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:36,480
diseases I'd report the likelihoods and

430
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:39,870
we belong we believe that a stronger

431
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:43,500
former organizations is a key key issue

432
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:47,880
in order to promote the creation of

433
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:50,430
farming and no farming jobs in in the in

434
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:53,820
the communities to demand services and

435
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:58,550
to promote then a more dynamic economy

436
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:58,550
they're in their own landscapes

437
00:24:59,879 --> 00:25:06,129
so thanks for your attention

438
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:07,380
and I hope your questions later Thank

439
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:12,749
You Francisco

440
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:12,749
[Applause]

441
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:18,560
yeah now I want to introduce you to

444
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:28,550
a research researcher in the university

445
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:33,170
la melena here improve the Vertigo

446
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:40,360
flourishes when Finella presentation for

447
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:40,360
for no it won't be easy

448
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:46,509
good morning in contrar Oh

449
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:53,170
I will report about a household survey

450
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:56,200
that we conducted a few months ago in

451
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:58,000
the Peruvian Andes and we try to

452
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:02,340
understand the relationship between

453
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:05,770
Agricola G livelihoods and food security

454
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:08,530
this was part of a project project

455
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:12,970
funded by Canadian development agencies

456
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:15,220
in which we had collaboration with

457
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:17,020
Peruvian and Canadian organizations and

458
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:18,730
our main partner in the field with the

459
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:21,340
National Association of ecological

460
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:24,760
farmers when we speak of ecological

461
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:26,890
farmers in the context of this report we

462
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:29,380
don't mean third party certified farmers

463
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:32,470
but non certified organic farmers and

464
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:34,570
they are involved in other types of

465
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:37,750
guarantee systems for organic farming

466
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:41,020
like participatory guarantee systems the

467
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:43,330
fact is that in spite of the very strong

468
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:45,790
economic growth of the last two decades

469
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:48,430
in Peru the situation in the Peruvian

470
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:50,560
Andes remains more or less similar and

471
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:53,140
the differences between urban and rural

472
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:56,110
population remains more or less the same

473
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:57,760
this is a map the official Peruvian map

474
00:26:56,110 --> 00:27:01,600
of the vulnerability to food insecurity

475
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:04,120
and as you can see the red color are the

476
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,950
districts with a highest vulnerability

477
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:09,400
to put insecurity it follows almost

478
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:12,190
exactly the Andean Highlands to the east

479
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:14,290
you have the Amazon to the west you have

480
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:17,770
the coast where almost 70% of our

481
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:20,260
population leads so in spite of this

482
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:21,820
economic growth and all the public

483
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:24,220
discourse about the importance of

484
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:26,890
traditional cultures in ditional people

485
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:29,160
and biodiversity the fact is that when

486
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:30,970
it comes to poverty and food insecurity

487
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:35,830
particularly in the high Andes the

488
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:39,040
situation is more or less the same so we

489
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:41,380
I cannot read I'm sorry I have to turn

490
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:43,930
around what we wanted was to

491
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:46,240
characterize small landholders according

492
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:48,190
to their Agricole article practices to

493
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,900
analyze the relationship between rural

494
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:52,750
livelihoods with emphasis on natural

495
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:55,090
financial physical human and social

496
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:57,220
capital and Agricole ajikko practices

497
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:59,550
and to explain food security as an

498
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:01,560
effect of Agricola chico practices and

499
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:06,530
selected indicators of

500
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:09,030
livelihoods so we developed the research

501
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:11,300
first of all trying to understand the

502
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:14,010
context in terms of social demographics

503
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:16,200
environmental profile and Agricola

504
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:18,060
Jeckle production we under try to

505
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,540
understand and through a household

506
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:23,310
survey we made several questions about

507
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:25,370
natural physical financial and human and

508
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:29,420
social capital and in the end we try to

509
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:32,190
analyze it the effects on food security

510
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:35,910
we divided the population in two main

511
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:39,090
groups agro ecological farmers were at

512
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:42,360
least 70% of the farms were under

513
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:44,460
Agricole ajikko practice they had not

514
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:47,670
used chemical inputs for the last three

515
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:51,120
years and they were implemented at least

516
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:52,890
one of the following one practice in

517
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,990
each of the following category using

518
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:57,630
organic manures soil and water

519
00:28:54,990 --> 00:29:00,120
conservation crop diversification and

520
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:02,100
ecological pest control on the other

521
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,690
hand the conventional farmers were

522
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:05,550
living in the same communities as a

523
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:08,460
research group of the Agricola Jeckle

524
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:10,500
group with similar characteristics have

525
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:12,840
not been exposed to the Agricola local

526
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:15,750
perspective or does not know or they did

527
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:17,940
not know about them and implemented

528
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:20,000
conventional practices at least one of

529
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:23,430
the following using chemical fertilizers

530
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:29,090
chemical insecticide fungicide or plant

531
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:31,830
growth hormones so we I'm sorry this is

532
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:34,350
this is the size of the sample that we

533
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:38,430
implemented we worked in three regions

534
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:40,530
the northern Andes cajamarca the central

535
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:43,530
Andes Juanico and the southern part of

536
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:47,520
the end is cusco and the total number of

537
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:51,740
farmers were 221 Agricola Tico 230

538
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:54,150
conventional with a total sample 451

539
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:56,130
households this is the first time that

540
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:58,320
this type of comparison is done in Peru

541
00:29:56,130 --> 00:30:00,240
and what we wanted to gather of course

542
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,700
concrete facts about the effect of the

543
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:05,790
agro-ecological implementation besides

544
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:08,520
the ideological discourse and this is

545
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:11,580
the type of farmers we got information

546
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:12,950
from they could have been like in the

547
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:15,290
left

548
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:18,860
it's very small tomato grower in the

549
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:20,840
northern Andes then they a woman growing

550
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:23,300
vegetables for the local markets in

551
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:25,910
Cusco under plastic tunnels or very

552
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:29,420
traditional farmers growing native

553
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:32,030
potatoes above 4,000 meters sea level

554
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:35,150
what all of them have in common is that

555
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:36,710
they practice Agricola G and they belong

556
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:39,170
to the National Association of

557
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:43,970
ecological farmers or were linked to

558
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:46,730
such organizations the results were very

559
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:50,720
different and when it comes to the

560
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:52,430
social demographic graphic profile we

561
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,710
found statistical differences for

562
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:58,490
example by the in the educational level

563
00:30:54,710 --> 00:31:01,430
achieved by the mother and in general

564
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:05,240
there was a high statistical significant

565
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:07,670
differences and the Agri collage achill

566
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:10,070
households tended to speak more Spanish

567
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:11,660
than the conventional farmers this has

568
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:14,120
something to do of course with their

569
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:18,250
access to the formal educational systems

570
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:20,630
which is basically all done in Spanish

571
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:23,870
when it comes to the farming system

572
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:26,660
profile 99 almost a hundred percent of

573
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:28,940
the agricultural households could

574
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:32,950
distinguish an agro-ecological practice

575
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:35,780
with only one third in the conventional

576
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:38,090
almost 80 percent of the conventional

577
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:40,850
households did not have any external

578
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:44,840
support compared to only 54 percent in

579
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:46,820
the Agricola chico households the agora

580
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,780
collage achill households used more

581
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:51,710
external labour

582
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:54,230
16:1 compared to 40 percent and they

583
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:56,860
were also highly more interested in

584
00:31:54,230 --> 00:32:00,370
growing new crops and diversifying their

585
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:02,390
production the sources of seats was

586
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:03,860
statistically significant with

587
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:06,740
significant differences

588
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:08,750
produced by themselves or exchanged with

589
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:10,850
other farmers with comparison to the

590
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:14,060
conventional which were more reliant on

591
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:16,220
the modern market when it comes to the

592
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:17,900
Agricola Chico practices the use of

593
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:20,300
organic manure soil and water

594
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:22,070
conservation and crop diversification we

595
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:24,710
asked what was the situation five years

596
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:26,429
ago and what was the situation today as

597
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:29,779
you can see the Agricola

598
00:32:26,429 --> 00:32:31,799
you call farmers five years ago 80%

599
00:32:29,779 --> 00:32:33,960
implemented these Agricole ajikko

600
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:36,570
practices and five years later this

601
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:38,970
climbed up to almost 100 percent while

602
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:42,269
in the conventional group it changed

603
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:46,440
from 40 to from 50 to 57 in five years

604
00:32:42,269 --> 00:32:51,539
so not a large increase over there when

605
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:54,090
it comes sorry when it comes to the soil

606
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:56,940
and water management practices five

607
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:59,850
years ago in the Agricola yoga group

608
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:02,279
there was an increase from 75 to 99

609
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:04,049
percent in five years while in the

610
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:07,230
conventional group it remained more or

611
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:09,720
less the same with regards to the

612
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:11,580
cropping diversification systems in the

613
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:14,700
Agricola Jekyll group the increase was

614
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:16,499
similar from 82 to almost 100 while in

615
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:20,009
the conventional group it moved from

616
00:33:16,499 --> 00:33:22,919
fifty to sixty seven when we

617
00:33:20,009 --> 00:33:25,230
characterized natural capital they were

618
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:28,950
very interesting differences there

619
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:30,929
the conventional group with significant

620
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:36,360
differences expressed that their their

621
00:33:30,929 --> 00:33:39,169
soils were exhausted and also in 40% of

622
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:43,590
the cases that the erosion has increased

623
00:33:39,169 --> 00:33:46,529
the Agricola Jekyll households practiced

624
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:50,220
pressurized irrigation systems three

625
00:33:46,529 --> 00:33:52,980
times more than the conventional they

626
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:55,649
have planted trees you see 85 percent

627
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:57,960
versus 65 percent in the conventional

628
00:33:55,649 --> 00:34:00,330
and they consider that water to be

629
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:05,639
contaminant free seventy five versus

630
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:08,149
sixty percent when it comes to financial

631
00:34:05,639 --> 00:34:11,809
capitals the Agricola chico had a clear

632
00:34:08,149 --> 00:34:16,260
stronger connection with markets and to

633
00:34:11,809 --> 00:34:18,569
credit sources so they usually were

634
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:20,909
selling their products in the local

635
00:34:18,569 --> 00:34:22,950
farmers market municipal markets while

636
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:26,399
in the conventional there were other

637
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:28,379
types of market connections and which is

638
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:30,899
very importantly in these years in Peru

639
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:33,030
the percentage of families participating

640
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:34,649
in government social programs was higher

641
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:37,290
in the Agra collage achill group as

642
00:34:34,649 --> 00:34:39,000
compared to the conventional and there

643
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:41,010
were also significant differences in

644
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,710
access to

645
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:48,160
when it comes to physical capital there

646
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:50,500
were significant differences sorry one

647
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:52,720
minute okay I will run a little there

648
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:55,360
were not many important differences when

649
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:57,970
it comes to physical capital when it

650
00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:01,630
comes to the perception of family income

651
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:04,930
you can see in the top the

652
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:07,180
agroecological showed responded that

653
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:08,920
their income has barely improved or has

654
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:11,050
improved substantially well the

655
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:14,260
conventional mentioned that their income

656
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:16,030
remained the same with regards to social

657
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:18,010
capital that were of course the normal

658
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:19,930
differences basically because most of

659
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:23,860
the agro-ecological farmers belong to

660
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:25,360
farmers association and when required to

661
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:28,210
answer why they belong to this

662
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:31,540
organization 66 percent mentioned to

663
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:33,190
access new markets when we decided with

664
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:35,470
the start of the growing season when

665
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:37,120
food reserves have already been finished

666
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:39,190
and there were some difference there

667
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:43,390
between Agricole ajikko and conventional

668
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:46,570
so our preliminary conclusions are that

669
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:47,740
we had a solid sampling allowing the

670
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:50,620
detection of differences between

671
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:52,480
Agricola jekyll and conventional however

672
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:54,520
this is the first study of its kind a

673
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,350
Greek illogical household showed a

674
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:58,810
better performance in the five

675
00:35:56,350 --> 00:36:01,000
dimensions of food security there are

676
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:03,540
normally four dimensions of post

677
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,740
security but we have really found that

678
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:08,500
institutions should be added at one of

679
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:10,300
us one of the dimensions with regards to

680
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:13,000
natural and social capital there were

681
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:16,090
clear differences not so much with human

682
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:19,600
and physical women had a higher

683
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:21,400
participation and and this is relevant

684
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,080
for what we are discussing today that

685
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:25,270
very often Agri collage achill

686
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:27,400
households tend to be located in similar

687
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:29,680
similar micro watersheds and are

688
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:31,900
organized increasing the relevance of

689
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:34,720
key indicators related to climate change

690
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:36,640
where they performed better there are

691
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,680
many other conclusions that we are

692
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,540
deriving right now but one very

693
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:42,400
important is in general the

694
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:45,280
institutional context in which these

695
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:48,360
households operate is weak or very weak

696
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:51,340
and there is a really strong need for

697
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:54,600
stronger government presence of good

698
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:54,600
quality thank you

00:36:54,660 --> 00:37:05,320

okay so our current system is or current

723
00:38:45,619 --> 00:38:56,150
programs are with the small holders in

724
00:38:49,160 --> 00:39:01,609
rural areas so they bio cash registers

725
00:38:56,150 --> 00:39:04,040
they are based on using the menu from

726
00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:06,130
the cows the cow dung mainly or

727
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:10,160
sometimes the pigs

728
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:15,619
it perfectly you can mix it with other

729
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:17,930
inputs organic waste but in general we

730
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:23,180
do not recommend it because then there's

731
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:26,829
a risk that people don't know how how

732
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:31,609
which are the materials that could be

733
00:39:26,829 --> 00:39:35,839
damaging the process and yeah so the the

734
00:39:31,609 --> 00:39:40,700
the program is just based on the the cow

735
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:43,970
dung the pig dung and human extra for

736
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:48,050
the first phase now so in future when

737
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:52,550
people are more accustomed to to the

738
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:55,430
system we might change that but and of

739
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:59,300
course here in in in for the waste

740
00:39:55,430 --> 00:40:03,260
management it's also in also in urban

741
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:05,820
areas very beneficial but we focus for

742
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:09,600
the moment on the on the who

743
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:11,490

00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:15,090
part in your question but I don't

00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:19,890
remember I want to hold your questions

746
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:22,680
because we want to move to the panel and

747
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:25,560
I want to introduce the panel and then

748
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:27,810
we can interact within the panel no I

749
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:30,210
said at the beginning that we will

750
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:32,970
divide this session into you we already

751
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:36,300
have seen three excellent cases in

752
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:38,760
Africa Kenya and Indonesia presented by

753
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:41,610
Harry also Nicaragua presented by

754
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:46,260
Francisco and presented by Roberto and

755
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:49,380
and now we want to also welcome to the

756
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:51,810
floor Peter bomb in about a his director

757
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:55,830
of business development and not used of

758
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:59,100
the gold standard Foundation Christian

759
00:40:55,830 --> 00:41:02,400
Danika his director of land using carbon

760
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:05,600
of South Pole say he owes alanya he is a

761
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:11,940
special advisor of global issues as in

762
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:14,400
un CCD Richie hue his regional director

763
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:18,000
of Asia for the Environmental Defense

764
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:20,070
Fund and well I didn't introduce myself

765
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:24,570
I can follow so this a problem officer

766
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:28,890
of ethos also for the regional for the

767
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:31,290
region of the Andes so this panel we

768
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:34,680
want to make it as interactive as

769
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:41,060
possible and we want to start with

770
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:43,920
innovation I will shut the first

771
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:50,040
question and then we can continue from

772
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:53,400
from that point and maybe Harry you can

773
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:58,440
explain you have already explained the

774
00:41:53,400 --> 00:42:01,290
scale but could you or someone in in the

775
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:04,260
table can set something about what is

776
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:10,740
innovative of these approaches and and

777
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:14,430
then we come to your question oh so yeah

778
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:18,010
well one thing is innovative nation the

779
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:21,170
in the scale yeah so it's really

780
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:25,340
such biocare systems already have

781
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:27,740
existed for a long time but the programs

782
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:34,430
they bring in a market-based approach

783
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:37,670
where the people get access so we work

784
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:39,200
on the demand side we work with the with

785
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:42,100
the MFIs

786
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:46,250
and also the supply side with the local

787
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:50,690
Commission's that construct us and yeah

788
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:55,420
that's that's a system so it's and it's

789
00:42:50,690 --> 00:43:00,860
the scale well I don't know if that was

790
00:42:55,420 --> 00:43:03,410
part of the kind of the of the the

791
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:07,010
question but we are in Indonesia we have

792
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:09,320
now thirteen thousand households with

793
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:12,650
biogas digesters and you can hear that

794
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:22,180
twelve thousand okay do you have a

795
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:22,180
question okay yeah could you

796
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:47,260
yeah maybe you can repeat the question

797
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:49,930
because it is to the expert from Peru

798
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:52,720
I'm Charlotte from National Council for

799
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:55,150
sustainable development India we have

800
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:58,690
exhibition upstairs my question is to

801
00:43:55,150 --> 00:44:01,390
the expert from Peru that analysis which

802
00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:03,849
were showed about agro-ecological

803
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:07,720
practices whether it is pure organic

804
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:10,090
farming or it is organic farming or

805
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:14,530
organic manure mixed with chemical

806
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:19,869
fertilizer because we have found in our

807
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:22,500
experience ok we have found in our

808
00:44:19,869 --> 00:44:26,170
experience with large number of farmers

809
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:29,320
small farmers if you directly take up

810
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:32,230
only organic farming it's not viable

811
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:36,190
because if it is not based on soil

812
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:39,640
health analysis right so if you just put

813
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:42,580
organic and soil health analysis

814
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:45,430
requires different nutrients then your

815
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:48,130
farming is not viable so I just want to

816
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:51,730
find out from the expert from Peru

817
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:54,040
what was their situation and if I can

818
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:57,089
add something maybe you can address a

819
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:59,800
little bit of what innovative approaches

820
00:44:57,089 --> 00:45:08,130
you have you have seen in in the

821
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:12,099
experience in in Peru we made a clear

822
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:13,839
sampling and the difference was food

823
00:45:12,099 --> 00:45:17,650
from the beginning the agro ecological

824
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:19,690
group about 250 farmers were using were

825
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:22,660
implementing different Agricole ajikko

826
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:25,510
practices and have not used any chemical

827
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:27,849
input for the last three years on the

828
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:29,830
other hand the conventional farmers were

829
00:45:27,849 --> 00:45:32,050
practicing agriculture in a similar

830
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:35,170
agro-ecosystem but we're using at least

831
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:37,150
one chemical inputs and a results show

832
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:40,270
and the practice shows in Peru that

833
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:43,290
there is a very high viability for

834
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:46,690
ecological farmers in certain conditions

835
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:51,280
this is specifically related to the high

836
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:53,160
Andes and what is innovated about this

837
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,349
approach I think the

838
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:57,240
strongest innovation whoo empowering

839
00:45:55,349 --> 00:46:00,480
what I reported was the close

840
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:03,030
interaction between farmers organization

841
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:06,319
sometimes powerful farmers organizations

842
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:10,380
and development agencies made many times

843
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:12,359
local NGOs or other groups even groups

844
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:16,470
of restaurants teaming together to buy

845
00:46:12,359 --> 00:46:19,500
produce from them so I would say the

846
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:21,470
most relevant innovation in this context

847
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:24,420
belongs to social capital

848
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:27,030
thanks you Roberta and did this bring me

849
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:29,549
to the next question to Francisco what

850
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:32,069
is the role of other players you present

851
00:46:29,549 --> 00:46:39,839
a case on coffee what is the role of

852
00:46:32,069 --> 00:46:44,039
private sector in in that you listen

853
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:48,059
yeah actually one of the approaches we

854
00:46:44,039 --> 00:46:51,630
are pursuing is to convince Roasters

855
00:46:48,059 --> 00:46:54,210
buyers of coffee for them to understand

856
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:56,460
what is the program behind low

857
00:46:54,210 --> 00:47:01,020
productivity and higher risk for climate

858
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:03,839
change of these coffee farmers so we

859
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:06,720
believe they can play a great role by

860
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:09,539
contributing in these investments

861
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:11,970
initial investments for scaling up these

862
00:47:09,539 --> 00:47:14,000
kind of alternatives for the farmers to

863
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:17,220
increase yields and to become more

864
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:21,599
better adapted to the climate change to

865
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:24,779
manage better their the diseases and to

866
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:27,150
also we also pursue the investments goes

867
00:47:24,779 --> 00:47:30,960
to diversification of the system so they

868
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:33,680
can not only depend on coffee so they

869
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:41,569
can also get income from other sources

870
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:44,520
so I believe these players need these

871
00:47:41,569 --> 00:47:46,710
increasing in yield they need the

872
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:49,020
farmers to be in the field producing

873
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:51,589
because it's their own business they

874
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:54,809
need to continue their own business so

875
00:47:51,589 --> 00:47:57,299
actually it's a win-win relationship

876
00:47:54,809 --> 00:47:59,369
they would expect by supporting these

877
00:47:57,299 --> 00:48:02,549
kind of activities of course the

878
00:47:59,369 --> 00:48:04,690
financial institutions together with the

879
00:48:02,549 --> 00:48:08,680
parrot sector may join

880
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:10,690
support these initiatives and to become

881
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:14,650
more resilient to the climate change

882
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:17,560
Thanks Francisco Peter a question for

883
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:19,480
you do you see enough room for for this

884
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:24,940
type of innovation in the injurer sector

885
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:27,090
in the carbon sector ok good morning

886
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:30,310
everyone

887
00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:32,490
the I think that we're talking actually

888
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:35,770
about a lot of different things here

889
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:37,540
we're talking about certification we're

890
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:39,130
talking about organic agriculture

891
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:45,160
practices we're talking about carbon

892
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:47,920
markets what Francisco presented is

893
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:50,620
actually a case how you can increase the

894
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:52,780
production of farming systems and also

895
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:56,710
find solutions to fight things like

896
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:59,230
coffee rust one of the say proxies that

897
00:48:56,710 --> 00:49:01,810
it gets out of there is the mitigation

898
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:04,660
potential that is related to it which is

899
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:06,670
I would say great news that that that

900
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:08,050
that you can combine these things there

901
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:10,540
might be other situations where the

902
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:12,910
mitigation potential is not so large but

903
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:16,270
where you still can achieve this

904
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:18,040
increase meant in production with with

905
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:20,620
adapting new practices so better

906
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:24,130
composting or increasing increasing your

907
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:26,470
soil fertility I was just getting a

908
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:29,830
figure that in 2013

909
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:32,260
24 billion tons of soil has been lost

910
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:34,660
again and a lot of these initiatives

911
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:36,370
actually look at how can we recover

912
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:38,770
these soils and make them more

913
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:42,010
productive again if carbon markets can

914
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:44,230
help with that I think that is that's

915
00:49:42,010 --> 00:49:47,440
great we need any kind of finance that

916
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:49,570
helps with that whether this violence

917
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:51,940
will maybe rather come to low-carbon

918
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:54,490
supply change that is actually a concept

919
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:57,400
in which I believe more where we see we

920
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:59,500
will see a lot of movement as the coffee

921
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:01,660
roasters and the coffee supply chains

922
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:03,880
himself have an interest it's still

923
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:05,860
being in business in 10 or 20 years from

924
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:08,320
now so you see in these sectors and

925
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:09,670
ever-increasing willingness to invest in

926
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:13,210
supply chains and increase the

927
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:14,770
production sustainably at source when it

928
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:16,930
when it really comes to the carbon

929
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:17,580
component I think there should be some

930
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:21,710
concern

931
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:24,030
expressed as well the negotiations

932
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:27,360
during the week and also next week and

933
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:29,420
next year in Paris are making our making

934
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:32,670
process I think there's a lot of new

935
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:37,170
thinking going on and a more

936
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:39,300
decentralization of contributions but

937
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:42,330
also the question is going to be who's

938
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:44,460
going to pay for all these actions that

939
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:46,260
we want to see on the ground and we're

940
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:50,040
always talking about leveraging private

941
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:51,840
capital but in fact there's not too much

942
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:54,180
private capital in the rooms here and

943
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:55,980
not in the negotiation rooms either so

944
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:58,650
these are examples where it can actually

945
00:50:55,980 --> 00:51:00,180
work and where I think the certification

946
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:03,600
for example also leads to other side

947
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:05,490
effects than just these effects but I do

948
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:08,040
have a concern more about about the

949
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:10,560
financing part of say the overall green

950
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:13,620
transition but we will definitely talk

951
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:18,960
about it more in and I definitely think

952
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:20,490
that finds requires innovative mechanism

953
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:23,460
on incentives

954
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:25,500
maybe Ricci you can it gives us a little

955
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:28,350
bit of background about market

956
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:31,350
innovations that you have seen in the

957
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:36,750
field that can bring this to scale for

958
00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:37,530
instance ICT can you all hear me oh

959
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:39,750
great

960
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:41,760
so my name's Richie Ahuja with the

961
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:43,950
Environmental Defense Fund and terrific

962
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,840
presentations from Harry Francisco and

963
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:47,880
Roberto and we are doing something

964
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:49,050
similar on the ground in India and so

965
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:50,430
I'm going to draw up on that well of

966
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:53,370
experience as well where we're working

967
00:51:50,430 --> 00:51:56,130
with about 70 80 thousand households for

968
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:58,200
biogas units about 100,000 households

969
00:51:56,130 --> 00:52:01,530
for cook stoves and 2030 thousand

970
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:02,940
farmers it is a landscape approach and

971
00:52:01,530 --> 00:52:03,960
I'm I'm loving the fact that everybody

972
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:06,720
here is talking about landscape

973
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:11,280
approaches and one thing I would caution

974
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:13,640
on is sort of on the finance pieces that

975
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:16,050
don't do this for the carbon finance

976
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:18,720
what you do this for is because it makes

977
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:22,080
economic sense for the farmer so it has

978
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:23,820
to start from that place and if it so

979
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:26,100
happens that in the process because

980
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:28,080
we're doing all the things right you're

981
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:30,640
going to get some benefits which are

982
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:33,069
carbon benefits it is then up to

983
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:35,049
the aggregator or the government in play

984
00:52:33,069 --> 00:52:37,839
or whoever to figure out if you want to

985
00:52:35,049 --> 00:52:40,359
monetize that asset and if you see value

986
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:42,670
in monetizing that asset to drive or

987
00:52:40,359 --> 00:52:46,720
catalyze more transformation on the

988
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:48,400
ground so the jury is still out but it

989
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:51,279
is certainly I'm glad that more and more

990
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:53,589
people are exploring this Avenue it's

991
00:52:51,279 --> 00:52:55,329
not a done deal yet there's also some

992
00:52:53,589 --> 00:52:58,299
issues around permanence so we need to

993
00:52:55,329 --> 00:53:00,730
think through on that as well but I

994
00:52:58,299 --> 00:53:01,869
think the rigor that needs to be done

995
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:04,029
there's nothing we need more and more

996
00:53:01,869 --> 00:53:05,650
rigor more and more data points to show

997
00:53:04,029 --> 00:53:07,749
that what's being done is real that the

998
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:09,880
development effects are really what we

999
00:53:07,749 --> 00:53:12,640
say they are that transaction costs are

1000
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:15,339
manageable on finance there's various

1001
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:18,849
sources of finance we have leveraged

1002
00:53:15,339 --> 00:53:20,079
some monies from you know this Oda and

1003
00:53:18,849 --> 00:53:21,549
philanthropic funds to build

1004
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:24,279
institutional capacity to test things

1005
00:53:21,549 --> 00:53:26,499
out but there's huge amounts of money

1006
00:53:24,279 --> 00:53:28,630
that governments like my government in

1007
00:53:26,499 --> 00:53:30,249
India for example spends on development

1008
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:32,230
that's their business they spend on

1009
00:53:30,249 --> 00:53:33,789
agriculture so there's budgetary line

1010
00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:35,710
items we should think about how they can

1011
00:53:33,789 --> 00:53:38,859
be leveraged and used better and made

1012
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:40,210
more efficient there's money from credit

1013
00:53:38,859 --> 00:53:41,710
agencies where a lot of the small

1014
00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:43,420
farmers on our credit so can we figure

1015
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:45,940
out ways to get debt to them which is

1016
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:48,670
low-cost debt there's social impact

1017
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:51,309
investments and then there's also the

1018
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:52,779
whole carbon deal so the idea is to

1019
00:53:51,309 --> 00:53:54,640
figure out ways to blend all this

1020
00:53:52,779 --> 00:53:56,440
together and come up with a solution

1021
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:58,989
that works for that particular place and

1022
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:00,579
context coffee farmers cent or into cash

1023
00:53:58,989 --> 00:54:01,960
crops so they may perhaps have more

1024
00:54:00,579 --> 00:54:04,269
availability in terms of credit

1025
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:05,499
creditworthiness and if they have tenure

1026
00:54:04,269 --> 00:54:06,940
on the line etcetera hours you've

1027
00:54:05,499 --> 00:54:09,880
talking about a small-scale farmer in

1028
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:11,859
upland or dryland agriculture in central

1029
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:13,569
India then your issues are they're a

1030
00:54:11,859 --> 00:54:16,150
little bit there's issues around credit

1031
00:54:13,569 --> 00:54:17,890
worthiness and availability of banking

1032
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:20,650
etc but all this is changing so there's

1033
00:54:17,890 --> 00:54:22,150
places you've talked about ICT you know

1034
00:54:20,650 --> 00:54:23,829
phone banking is coming into play in

1035
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:26,230
Africa phone banking is happening in

1036
00:54:23,829 --> 00:54:28,029
India now just right off the phone phone

1037
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:31,630
systems credit is being made more

1038
00:54:28,029 --> 00:54:33,039
available to the farmers GIS systems are

1039
00:54:31,630 --> 00:54:34,989
being brought in to apply to ensure that

1040
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:37,269
farm ownership is clearly defined and

1041
00:54:34,989 --> 00:54:38,890
all this is very very exciting because

1042
00:54:37,269 --> 00:54:41,980
it's going to open up the space for the

1043
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:43,820
farmer to again access the funds that

1044
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:47,210
the farmer needs to optimize

1045
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:48,620
land use and also all this information

1046
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:49,910
system is going to be very valuable for

1047
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:51,890
the farmer in the end also to take the

1048
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:53,390
right decisions in the end where I come

1049
00:54:51,890 --> 00:54:55,880
from on all this is that the farmer is

1050
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:58,130
really the best optimizer of resources

1051
00:54:55,880 --> 00:55:00,500
on the ground they're not in the

1052
00:54:58,130 --> 00:55:03,260
business of wasting resources but what

1053
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:04,700
they do best is you know if they have

1054
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:06,410
the right amount of information they'll

1055
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:07,460
take the debt right decisions the

1056
00:55:06,410 --> 00:55:11,960
challenge is getting them the

1057
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:14,360
information thank you and moving from

1058
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:17,360
innovation to livelihood so resilient

1059
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:20,930
naively hood's Christian maybe you can

1060
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:24,490
explain us how these approaches from the

1061
00:55:20,930 --> 00:55:27,820
landscape perspective builds on

1062
00:55:24,490 --> 00:55:27,820
resilient livelihoods

1063
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:50,540
I'll project there you go thank you

1064
00:55:47,390 --> 00:55:53,570
thanks for the question and actually we

1065
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:55,670
did start a while ago what which he said

1066
00:55:53,570 --> 00:55:59,240
you shouldn't do which is looking a lot

1067
00:55:55,670 --> 00:56:02,810
at carbon finance and we collected some

1068
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:05,900
experience on that in a in a organic

1069
00:56:02,810 --> 00:56:08,480
farm in a organic farming focused

1070
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:11,720
project and we draw some lessons from

1071
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:13,369
that basically the project was not only

1072
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:16,400
organic farming itself but it was an

1073
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:19,250
intervention to save forests it's a LED

1074
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:21,650
intervention in the end so what was done

1075
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:23,599
is basically the upscaling of

1076
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:26,240
conservation and organic farming in

1077
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:29,780
Mason millet production through

1078
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:32,240
activities such as compositing precision

1079
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:34,220
planting and erosion harassing and so on

1080
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:38,300
but we framed that also with additional

1081
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:41,270
activities fairly soon which were around

1082
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:43,040
enabling conditions to allow that had to

1083
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:44,750
happen for example fire management there

1084
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:47,030
was a lot of wildfires that spread from

1085
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:49,520
other farms or from poaching activities

1086
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:51,440
into the fields which and then burnt the

1087
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:54,500
biomass that you needed for the organic

1088
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:57,980
farming and we also needed to diversify

1089
00:56:54,500 --> 00:57:00,260
the workload over the year so we looked

1090
00:56:57,980 --> 00:57:03,050
at honey production and we looked at and

1091
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:05,000
nutrition gardens next to the villages

1092
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:07,670
so that created more work when there was

1093
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:12,640
no other work to do and we looked also

1094
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:16,369
into fertilizer producing trees such as

1095
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:19,550
tighter BIA and additional food crops

1096
00:57:16,369 --> 00:57:22,130
such as Moringa and finally we framed

1097
00:57:19,550 --> 00:57:25,579
that as I said with a common methodology

1098
00:57:22,130 --> 00:57:27,230
using the VCS and the CCPs and so what

1099
00:57:25,579 --> 00:57:29,390
we found is that actually the carbon

1100
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:31,640
finance in the end was only you needed

1101
00:57:29,390 --> 00:57:34,579
to kick-start activities at the start

1102
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:37,280
and then the project is sort of rolling

1103
00:57:34,579 --> 00:57:39,440
out itself by itself now of course it's

1104
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:43,069
being you know supported ongoing with

1105
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:46,190
carbon but the the project managed to to

1106
00:57:43,069 --> 00:57:48,819
raise 30 percent productivity of a glove

1107
00:57:46,190 --> 00:57:52,040
staples outputted managed to generate

1108
00:57:48,819 --> 00:57:54,109
$400 aprox of income per honey farmer

1109
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:56,119
per year which is about replicating the

1110
00:57:54,109 --> 00:57:56,980
income they had before so we saw that

1111
00:57:56,119 --> 00:57:59,530
carbon

1112
00:57:56,980 --> 00:58:01,119
was an excellent Kickstarter and if

1113
00:57:59,530 --> 00:58:02,890
there would be a better carbon price we

1114
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:06,040
could do a lot more because the project

1115
00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:07,480
is at 800,000 hectares with several

1116
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:10,300
hundred thousand people so it could be

1117
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:12,820
rolled out and I hope that in the

1118
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:16,200
negotiations that you know the enabling

1119
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:20,140
conditions will be set for that so maybe

1120
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:23,470
some lessons there one was that the it

1121
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:25,780
was key to maintain the to avoid leakage

1122
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:27,460
and maintain that conditionality that we

1123
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:30,760
know we do this for a purpose and which

1124
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:32,470
also includes mitigation as honestly for

1125
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:34,180
the local population as the second most

1126
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:36,280
important priority but the other finance

1127
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:38,470
providers most important one and

1128
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:40,180
therefore it was key to make sure that

1129
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:42,130
there was a land use planning set for

1130
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:44,920
example there were bore holes that were

1131
00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:46,990
dried up since decades partially and

1132
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:48,940
before rehabilitating those since

1133
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:50,650
starting organic farming that we looked

1134
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:53,470
at is that in a biodiversity cornea or

1135
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:56,770
or not and then we focused on those that

1136
00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:59,020
community said and we looked after that

1137
00:58:56,770 --> 00:59:02,590
are not in the middle of an area that is

1138
00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:05,460
sensitive our second point is that work

1139
00:59:02,590 --> 00:59:08,530
generation was key you don't want to

1140
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:10,660
generate more outcome with less work

1141
00:59:08,530 --> 00:59:15,010
because then people spend that time

1142
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:16,750
opening new areas and it fasoli this was

1143
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:18,460
also little facilitated because it's

1144
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:20,859
really a non market environment there's

1145
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:22,720
almost no one going to the markets at

1146
00:59:20,859 --> 00:59:24,490
selling excess crops so as long as they

1147
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:26,140
have this production they need and a

1148
00:59:24,490 --> 00:59:28,480
little excess for paying school fees for

1149
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:30,580
kids there's not a lot of expansion

1150
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:34,750
going on and with regards to that

1151
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:37,030
negotiations I mean it would be nice if

1152
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:39,100
the technologies that have been

1153
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:41,260
presented here and then are being used

1154
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:43,480
at the landscape approach could receive

1155
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:46,030
the adequate support by either

1156
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:48,070
market-based mechanisms or by the Green

1157
00:59:46,030 --> 00:59:50,700
Climate Fund or other discussions that

1158
00:59:48,070 --> 00:59:53,080
are ongoing it's going slow so meanwhile

1159
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:54,730
what the positive messages all these

1160
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:56,380
projectors have been mentioned here are

1161
00:59:54,730 --> 00:59:58,630
probably the most sexiest one that you

1162
00:59:56,380 --> 01:00:00,940
have on the voluntary car market it's

1163
00:59:58,630 --> 01:00:02,890
hard it's not a big market but meanwhile

1164
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:06,240
those are those projects that probably

1165
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:09,210
fetch the best prices things

1166
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:12,750
thank you I tend to talk too much and so

1167
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:17,250
if you please have questions just raise

1168
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:20,869
your hands meanwhile I have one for the

1169
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:24,980
case holders Harry Francisco Berto

1170
01:00:20,869 --> 01:00:28,680
basically your cases were talking about

1171
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:31,550
mitigation and how you can reduce the

1172
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:35,420
amount of carbon output what about

1173
01:00:31,550 --> 01:00:35,420
adaptation and food security

1174
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:45,140
well actually the use of the bio slurry

1175
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:48,950
also has great benefits for the food

1176
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:52,940
security and the adaptation first of all

1177
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:58,029
the food security now because it's yet

1178
01:00:52,940 --> 01:01:05,089
used the bio salary is often used for

1179
01:00:58,029 --> 01:01:11,299
growing new crops nearby in the house so

1180
01:01:05,089 --> 01:01:17,019
this new particle vegetables and food

1181
01:01:11,299 --> 01:01:23,329
crops coming into the home system yeah

1182
01:01:17,019 --> 01:01:25,460
and then next to that the get fertile as

1183
01:01:23,329 --> 01:01:27,970
I mentioned it's a good fertilizer and

1184
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:32,109
it's because it's also containing the

1185
01:01:27,970 --> 01:01:35,990
micronutrients it's improving the soil

1186
01:01:32,109 --> 01:01:39,920
condition the soil structure so that is

1187
01:01:35,990 --> 01:01:44,410
also making an impact on the resilience

1188
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:48,319
and yeah depth against possible negative

1189
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:51,069
radical impacts and climate impacts so I

1190
01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:56,539
think there's clearly an adaptation

1191
01:01:51,069 --> 01:01:59,170
benefit as well maybe you want to add

1192
01:01:56,539 --> 01:01:59,170
more on that

1193
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:16,940
okay okay yeah from we one way of

1194
01:02:12,090 --> 01:02:20,340
looking at this is farmers are already

1195
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:23,670
by using improve endure their their

1196
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:27,690
income they would be able to buy some

1197
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:30,600
other food that they already taking a

1198
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:34,400
yet because of the they have a very low

1199
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:37,680
income but we are also increasing or

1200
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:40,290
encouraging the farmers to diversify

1201
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:43,280
their production in the case of product

1202
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:46,650
they also are producing honey bee and

1203
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:49,470
they are getting income from there we

1204
01:02:46,650 --> 01:02:51,540
have seen in other cases of

1205
01:02:49,470 --> 01:02:54,540
diversification that farmers themselves

1206
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:56,280
were able to pay the renovation of the

1207
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:59,160
plant of the coffee plantations because

1208
01:02:56,280 --> 01:03:05,040
other sources that they are selling

1209
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:07,680
recently like a small farming small

1210
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:10,550
vegetable facilities are they are

1211
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:14,700
selling to the market they also having

1212
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:17,580
chicken eggs and some small animals and

1213
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:19,710
some cows and they are diversifying in

1214
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:21,210
this way they are reducing the risk and

1215
01:03:19,710 --> 01:03:24,960
they are getting income from other parts

1216
01:03:21,210 --> 01:03:26,790
so this is our contribution for the food

1217
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:29,030
security in food insecurity they already

1218
01:03:26,790 --> 01:03:29,030
have

1219
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:38,880
oh yeah

1220
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:45,109
thank you very much my name's bill her

1221
01:03:43,430 --> 01:03:47,210
ditch from Australia

1222
01:03:45,109 --> 01:03:48,349
thanks for the fantastic presentations

1223
01:03:47,210 --> 01:03:50,510
of the case studies I just had a

1224
01:03:48,349 --> 01:03:52,880
question for the panel about the

1225
01:03:50,510 --> 01:03:56,960
application of this type of innovation

1226
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:58,609
to broader scale landscapes we've talked

1227
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:00,260
a little more about small holders here

1228
01:03:58,609 --> 01:04:02,410
but in Australia for example we've got

1229
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:06,109
millions and millions of hectares of

1230
01:04:02,410 --> 01:04:09,650
extensive rangelands some on the edge of

1231
01:04:06,109 --> 01:04:13,280
deserts and we're doing some work in the

1232
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:17,030
north on the application of technology

1233
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:20,119
by way of better water access for large

1234
01:04:17,030 --> 01:04:24,710
large areas opportunities to increase

1235
01:04:20,119 --> 01:04:27,890
biodiversity sell grazing and reduction

1236
01:04:24,710 --> 01:04:29,660
of wildfire so just a general question

1237
01:04:27,890 --> 01:04:31,700
to the panel about the application of

1238
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:34,099
organic farming or agro-ecological

1239
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:35,809
farming processes to broader scale

1240
01:04:34,099 --> 01:04:38,890
landscapes around the world because in a

1241
01:04:35,809 --> 01:04:41,960
way because of the climate issues and

1242
01:04:38,890 --> 01:04:45,020
adaptation and mitigation will rely a

1243
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:47,599
lot on big areas of land being recovered

1244
01:04:45,020 --> 01:04:50,440
and rehabilitated and put into better

1245
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:50,440
food production

1246
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:09,240
for giving me the opportunity to also

1247
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:12,690
put the my hair in the soup of this this

1248
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:16,470
issue and I agree with with your your

1249
01:05:12,690 --> 01:05:20,400
question this is how this very

1250
01:05:16,470 --> 01:05:23,760
innovative examples on cases that I am

1251
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:26,040
very grateful to be here mean here this

1252
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:28,740
morning and listening to these very

1253
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:31,200
highly relevant examples at the small

1254
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:35,370
scale and how large-scale operations

1255
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:39,180
also can can benefit from this issue how

1256
01:05:35,370 --> 01:05:42,570
can this change can be driven not only

1257
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:44,760
at the at the on the ground but also the

1258
01:05:42,570 --> 01:05:46,860
financial aspects this is a challenge

1259
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:49,920
that we have in front of us and if we

1260
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:52,470
include in this in this in this soup as

1261
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:55,740
I said the the negotiation process of

1262
01:05:52,470 --> 01:06:00,090
where why we are here in in Lima today

1263
01:05:55,740 --> 01:06:02,120
the Climate Change Conference well let

1264
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:05,010
me say first that I work in the other

1265
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:06,960
convention that came out of three or one

1266
01:06:05,010 --> 01:06:09,090
of the three creo there were three

1267
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:11,280
conventions for those of you who don't

1268
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:13,050
know if you already know I'm sorry I

1269
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:14,520
would have to repeat this the climate

1270
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:16,590
change convention is only one of the

1271
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:18,420
three real conventions that were agreed

1272
01:06:16,590 --> 01:06:20,130
upon in 1992 the other one is

1273
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:22,380
biodiversity Convention and the

1274
01:06:20,130 --> 01:06:24,150
desertification convention I work in the

1275
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:24,570
desertification convention from that

1276
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:28,860
angle

1277
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:31,350
I can say that it is a challenging to to

1278
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:34,110
see the common denominator of these

1279
01:06:31,350 --> 01:06:37,410
presentations the soil organic carbon or

1280
01:06:34,110 --> 01:06:39,600
carbon content in the soil how is this

1281
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:43,770
going to be adopted and embraced by the

1282
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:46,890
negotiators in the in the I mean some

1283
01:06:43,770 --> 01:06:48,780
kilometers away from here this is not

1284
01:06:46,890 --> 01:06:50,820
something that we can hope and we can

1285
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:54,690
wish this is something that we have to

1286
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:58,560
advocate and fight for and 20 years have

1287
01:06:54,690 --> 01:07:00,330
passed by discussing about in the

1288
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:01,860
inclusion of land and soil into the

1289
01:07:00,330 --> 01:07:05,010
negotiation of climate change and

1290
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:09,180
nothing has happened in Kyoto in Curtin

1291
01:07:05,010 --> 01:07:13,050
1997 for example III at that time I had

1292
01:07:09,180 --> 01:07:15,510
my hair black we in Kyoto the the

1293
01:07:13,050 --> 01:07:15,960
Europeans they said you know we want a

1294
01:07:15,510 --> 01:07:19,349
cane

1295
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:22,109
Kalli pure a great protocol chemically

1296
01:07:19,349 --> 01:07:24,390
pure means means land and forest out of

1297
01:07:22,109 --> 01:07:27,150
the negotiation and that was what they

1298
01:07:24,390 --> 01:07:29,460
got no they got the Kyoto Protocol the

1299
01:07:27,150 --> 01:07:33,150
way they wanted it this energy business

1300
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:35,160
and now in order to include the the

1301
01:07:33,150 --> 01:07:37,830
issues of land and soils and water and

1302
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:40,500
for a vegetation it's going to be

1303
01:07:37,830 --> 01:07:41,700
challenging Christiana Figueres

1304
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:44,400
mentioned this month

1305
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:45,960
this past Monday she wants an universal

1306
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:48,420
agreement for Paris universe of the

1307
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:50,670
world Universal includes this issue but

1308
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:53,670
I don't know how it is going to happen

1309
01:07:50,670 --> 01:07:56,369
if we only well it's good that we have

1310
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:59,369
this this innovative cases and that we

1311
01:07:56,369 --> 01:08:02,400
reflect and highlight the the issue of a

1312
01:07:59,369 --> 01:08:04,680
soil carbon content but we have to pass

1313
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:07,170
this message in events like this and

1314
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:08,910
individually to those negotiators there

1315
01:08:07,170 --> 01:08:11,760
are other issues on not only on

1316
01:08:08,910 --> 01:08:14,130
mitigation mitigation is great and good

1317
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:17,450
as well the issues about adaptation and

1318
01:08:14,130 --> 01:08:20,310
food security what happened to other

1319
01:08:17,450 --> 01:08:23,719
indicators that are out there like for

1320
01:08:20,310 --> 01:08:26,900
example the land productivity dynamics

1321
01:08:23,719 --> 01:08:29,910
net primary product how can we use that

1322
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:32,489
Indyk in the within the framework of

1323
01:08:29,910 --> 01:08:35,880
this convention or the trends in land

1324
01:08:32,489 --> 01:08:40,230
cover these are a lot the indicators for

1325
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:43,950
the resilience of the of the land so

1326
01:08:40,230 --> 01:08:46,830
there are options that we out there many

1327
01:08:43,950 --> 01:08:49,410
research is has been done that it can be

1328
01:08:46,830 --> 01:08:53,190
used and this is one side the other side

1329
01:08:49,410 --> 01:08:56,069
is a financial issue it's true that that

1330
01:08:53,190 --> 01:08:58,920
there are many resources out there that

1331
01:08:56,069 --> 01:09:01,529
the national level in other investing

1332
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:04,230
and private investments but how to

1333
01:09:01,529 --> 01:09:06,960
jumpstart how to drive this change how

1334
01:09:04,230 --> 01:09:10,620
the Green Climate Fund or the Jeff or

1335
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:13,290
the CDM or all these other financial

1336
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:15,450
mechanisms that they discussed here for

1337
01:09:13,290 --> 01:09:19,380
years and years in the convention how

1338
01:09:15,450 --> 01:09:22,410
can this be the seed to create this

1339
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:24,920
change and I don't see the eligibility

1340
01:09:22,410 --> 01:09:24,920
of

1341
01:09:25,270 --> 01:09:33,150
projects that have this this soul

1342
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:37,089
component or land component be included

1343
01:09:33,150 --> 01:09:40,299
Richard Wright the the gentleman from

1344
01:09:37,089 --> 01:09:43,179
you mentioned sorry you mentioned about

1345
01:09:40,299 --> 01:09:46,359
the methodology not being agreed by the

1346
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:48,400
CDM so you have to work on this

1347
01:09:46,359 --> 01:09:50,199
methodology to include the soil carbon

1348
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:53,500
content but this is not the only case

1349
01:09:50,199 --> 01:09:56,409
how we can do this to actually make this

1350
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:58,780
project eligible for for this carbon

1351
01:09:56,409 --> 01:10:03,060
financing and adaptation finance this is

1352
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:06,040
the challenge we have in terms of

1353
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:07,540
metrics also sure I'll just take one

1354
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:10,090
minute it's a very good question on

1355
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:11,920
scale love it

1356
01:10:10,090 --> 01:10:14,380
one I think want to bring up the issue

1357
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:16,360
of adaptation mitigation I think it's

1358
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:18,340
not a question of either/or we live on a

1359
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:20,020
spectrum so no matter what you do on

1360
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:22,989
mitigation off and you get adaptation

1361
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:24,460
benefits or a few packages inhabited

1362
01:10:22,989 --> 01:10:26,199
updation you get mitigation benefits

1363
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:27,850
what's important I think is for us to

1364
01:10:26,199 --> 01:10:30,820
know where we are and what those

1365
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:33,310
elements are the components how much and

1366
01:10:30,820 --> 01:10:35,980
in terms of scale we are having these

1367
01:10:33,310 --> 01:10:38,590
negotiations and and it's great and I

1368
01:10:35,980 --> 01:10:40,960
think they can add value in terms of

1369
01:10:38,590 --> 01:10:44,050
trying to drive scale but really scale

1370
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:45,429
happens at home it happens is driven by

1371
01:10:44,050 --> 01:10:47,260
local interests which has in the

1372
01:10:45,429 --> 01:10:50,440
individual farmer and by national

1373
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:52,270
interest we need to serve those and to

1374
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:53,949
do that we need to basically these

1375
01:10:52,270 --> 01:10:56,290
examples are great and we need more and

1376
01:10:53,949 --> 01:10:58,210
more of these examples that are very

1377
01:10:56,290 --> 01:11:01,330
much data driven with strong metrics

1378
01:10:58,210 --> 01:11:04,929
that really make the economic case you

1379
01:11:01,330 --> 01:11:07,120
know governments typically look at money

1380
01:11:04,929 --> 01:11:08,409
going into this sector as a cost and we

1381
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:10,480
need to start looking at that as an

1382
01:11:08,409 --> 01:11:12,100
investment and the moment we can show

1383
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:14,800
very categorically that here are the

1384
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:16,239
returns on that investment then you can

1385
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:17,830
really start getting some scales so the

1386
01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:19,840
more number of projects you had the good

1387
01:11:17,830 --> 01:11:21,670
more data you have you get build

1388
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:22,810
confidence so that's kind of the stuff

1389
01:11:21,670 --> 01:11:24,730
that we are beginning to see with some

1390
01:11:22,810 --> 01:11:27,640
of our work we're moving from

1391
01:11:24,730 --> 01:11:29,500
project-based approaches now to try and

1392
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:32,679
drive change across a whole district but

1393
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:33,969
small holder farmers in Vietnam the work

1394
01:11:32,679 --> 01:11:35,679
we were doing in the Delta a turn are

1395
01:11:33,969 --> 01:11:36,949
now replicated and have the government

1396
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:38,929
suddenly woken up and they

1397
01:11:36,949 --> 01:11:40,280
asking some good questions and I think

1398
01:11:38,929 --> 01:11:41,929
in the end the government is the big

1399
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:43,190
driver of scale when it comes to

1400
01:11:41,929 --> 01:11:45,019
investments in this sector as well

1401
01:11:43,190 --> 01:11:47,360
including you know you need the private

1402
01:11:45,019 --> 01:11:49,369
sector you need other financing but in

1403
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:50,630
the developing countries often the

1404
01:11:49,369 --> 01:11:57,079
government plays a pretty decent role

1405
01:11:50,630 --> 01:11:58,969
especially on interest structure etc so

1406
01:11:57,079 --> 01:12:01,760
to your question in the organic movement

1407
01:11:58,969 --> 01:12:04,219
we don't pretend to have answers for yet

1408
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:06,229
for every farming system every country

1409
01:12:04,219 --> 01:12:09,739
in the world but there are already about

1410
01:12:06,229 --> 01:12:12,170
70 million hectares certified organic

1411
01:12:09,739 --> 01:12:14,179
worldwide and Australia is one of the

1412
01:12:12,170 --> 01:12:18,260
top five countries in terms of acreage

1413
01:12:14,179 --> 01:12:20,630
in organic land so and this only is when

1414
01:12:18,260 --> 01:12:22,820
we count third parties certified in

1415
01:12:20,630 --> 01:12:24,769
Africa Asia in Latin America there is

1416
01:12:22,820 --> 01:12:27,050
much more there is not yet certified but

1417
01:12:24,769 --> 01:12:29,269
the principles are applied on farm so we

1418
01:12:27,050 --> 01:12:31,309
hope to have this increased but

1419
01:12:29,269 --> 01:12:35,900
certainly we need to do much more

1420
01:12:31,309 --> 01:12:41,479
research and outreach let's move to

1421
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:43,909
Finance and beta do you see what do you

1422
01:12:41,479 --> 01:12:47,449
see the role where do you see the role

1423
01:12:43,909 --> 01:12:50,360
of private investors private capital in

1424
01:12:47,449 --> 01:12:53,170
to to reach this scale that we are

1425
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:53,170
talking about

1426
01:12:56,680 --> 01:13:01,130
it's a very important role if

1427
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:02,930
sustainability was the business-as-usual

1428
01:13:01,130 --> 01:13:08,180
we wouldn't be sitting here

1429
01:13:02,930 --> 01:13:10,580
so the the conventions and all the

1430
01:13:08,180 --> 01:13:12,530
efforts at the the case studies they all

1431
01:13:10,580 --> 01:13:14,420
show how it can be done or they want to

1432
01:13:12,530 --> 01:13:16,370
kind of break through the existing

1433
01:13:14,420 --> 01:13:18,800
systems and come up with some new

1434
01:13:16,370 --> 01:13:20,660
solutions so we make things like the

1435
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:23,210
Green Climate Fund and we do case

1436
01:13:20,660 --> 01:13:26,480
studies and we do development aid but if

1437
01:13:23,210 --> 01:13:28,400
we compare those sums with the finance

1438
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:31,280
that is yearly going to conventional

1439
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:33,110
agriculture if you know if we would ask

1440
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:34,370
something for Mars to look at how we do

1441
01:13:33,110 --> 01:13:36,440
things here you would be saying what

1442
01:13:34,370 --> 01:13:39,260
what what are you doing it this doesn't

1443
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:41,390
make any sense the only way in which we

1444
01:13:39,260 --> 01:13:43,820
can make this transition is by changing

1445
01:13:41,390 --> 01:13:47,990
the behavior of private capital that's

1446
01:13:43,820 --> 01:13:49,450
I'm totally convinced of that and it

1447
01:13:47,990 --> 01:13:52,220
seems so obvious to me as well

1448
01:13:49,450 --> 01:13:53,570
fortunately we're seeing that so there

1449
01:13:52,220 --> 01:13:56,270
is more and more corporates like

1450
01:13:53,570 --> 01:13:58,940
Unilever that are making commitments and

1451
01:13:56,270 --> 01:14:01,010
also putting you know they walk the talk

1452
01:13:58,940 --> 01:14:02,630
they make they work towards more

1453
01:14:01,010 --> 01:14:03,800
sustainable practices and there's many

1454
01:14:02,630 --> 01:14:06,410
others do that as well

1455
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:08,990
there's movements in Europe in the u.s.

1456
01:14:06,410 --> 01:14:12,530
of people that start to appreciate again

1457
01:14:08,990 --> 01:14:14,990
more say also intrinsic values of of

1458
01:14:12,530 --> 01:14:16,370
food and and regionality and and things

1459
01:14:14,990 --> 01:14:18,200
like that so I think there's hope but

1460
01:14:16,370 --> 01:14:22,640
there's a lot that needs to be done yet

1461
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:25,820
and true certification we we are partly

1462
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:28,550
doing that there is examples also of

1463
01:14:25,820 --> 01:14:30,620
Germany where a city actually paid for

1464
01:14:28,550 --> 01:14:33,200
organic certification of farmers that

1465
01:14:30,620 --> 01:14:35,240
surround the city they said we pay for

1466
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:37,010
the certification because they knew if

1467
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:39,830
farmers would be organically certified

1468
01:14:37,010 --> 01:14:41,420
in the surroundings it will improve the

1469
01:14:39,830 --> 01:14:43,420
quality of the drinking water in the

1470
01:14:41,420 --> 01:14:45,050
city because they're not allowed to use

1471
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:46,040
pesticides and chemical fertilizers

1472
01:14:45,050 --> 01:14:48,170
anymore

1473
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:52,400
there's a lot of good examples out there

1474
01:14:48,170 --> 01:14:54,500
already but for real change the behavior

1475
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:56,480
of this big lump of investments that is

1476
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:58,400
really going into agriculture that has

1477
01:14:56,480 --> 01:15:01,940
to change and this is I think what we're

1478
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:03,410
all trying true institutions through to

1479
01:15:01,940 --> 01:15:04,890
laws and regulations through

1480
01:15:03,410 --> 01:15:08,430
certification

1481
01:15:04,890 --> 01:15:10,980
and Christian so do you see a role of

1482
01:15:08,430 --> 01:15:16,920
the payment for ecosystem services

1483
01:15:10,980 --> 01:15:22,620
schemes to increase the to reduce the

1484
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:25,320
impact on forest degradation then yes

1485
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:27,120
this time it works I do thank you I

1486
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:29,160
think it was one of the two big

1487
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:31,350
frameworks that everyone is waiting for

1488
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:34,350
to be set and that everyone is working

1489
01:15:31,350 --> 01:15:36,320
on to be said one is payment for

1490
01:15:34,350 --> 01:15:39,390
ecosystem services at a global scale

1491
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:41,820
driven by a large-scale mechanism where

1492
01:15:39,390 --> 01:15:44,520
the rules are set and the reward is

1493
01:15:41,820 --> 01:15:47,330
clear and then the private sector could

1494
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:49,770
deliver very significantly on that and

1495
01:15:47,330 --> 01:15:51,630
so therefore the investment to get that

1496
01:15:49,770 --> 01:15:53,700
done should be from the public sector

1497
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:56,130
should be in setting those rules you

1498
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:58,500
know and on the other hand setting the

1499
01:15:56,130 --> 01:16:00,450
reward in the end but not crowding out

1500
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:02,160
the implementation which often can be

1501
01:16:00,450 --> 01:16:04,170
done by private players or together with

1502
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:06,120
the public place and the other one the

1503
01:16:04,170 --> 01:16:08,130
other big framework is the deforestation

1504
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:09,920
free supply chains and clean supply

1505
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:13,500
chains that we are looking at if that

1506
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:15,750
compromise that has been done this and

1507
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:17,610
last year is really delivered on by lots

1508
01:16:15,750 --> 01:16:20,010
of large companies and we had decided

1509
01:16:17,610 --> 01:16:21,660
when incop some days ago people are

1510
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:23,220
moving and companies are moving but

1511
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:25,980
they're not really clear yet how they

1512
01:16:23,220 --> 01:16:28,980
will do it to get to this very shorthand

1513
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:31,350
call to 2020 if that is getting traction

1514
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:33,060
then you know all these technologies

1515
01:16:31,350 --> 01:16:35,490
here and all these initiatives that sit

1516
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:38,130
on this desk will you know will get a

1517
01:16:35,490 --> 01:16:40,580
big boost and can probably partially

1518
01:16:38,130 --> 01:16:43,050
even forget about the ecosystem service

1519
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:47,390
payments because there's enough Drive

1520
01:16:43,050 --> 01:16:47,390
without them thank you

1521
01:16:47,570 --> 01:16:56,070
the reality is that the carbon official

1522
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:59,780
car markets are collapsed so where are

1523
01:16:56,070 --> 01:16:59,780
you going to sell these carbon credits

1524
01:17:01,370 --> 01:17:07,680
yeah well many things have been

1525
01:17:05,490 --> 01:17:11,730
mentioned by other panelists that I

1526
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:14,490
would like to reinforce and that is for

1527
01:17:11,730 --> 01:17:17,880
example also that yeah don't do this for

1528
01:17:14,490 --> 01:17:22,650
carbon finance know it the objective is

1529
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:27,300
the economic benefit of the farmer still

1530
01:17:22,650 --> 01:17:31,320
for the carbon finance can help to take

1531
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:33,840
her to kick-start changes no and another

1532
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:37,650
aspect that has not been mentioned is

1533
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:42,240
that the strong monitoring impact now so

1534
01:17:37,650 --> 01:17:44,820
interestingly is that for carbon credits

1535
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:48,750
you will need to monitor so that also

1536
01:17:44,820 --> 01:17:51,870
helps to to focus and to improve your

1537
01:17:48,750 --> 01:17:55,170
interventions because you have you have

1538
01:17:51,870 --> 01:17:58,020
to really to follow up on what you are

1539
01:17:55,170 --> 01:18:01,310
doing now so additionally also in the

1540
01:17:58,020 --> 01:18:04,650
biogas that were there were bad systems

1541
01:18:01,310 --> 01:18:08,780
better models which were distributed and

1542
01:18:04,650 --> 01:18:11,700
the people just count how many models

1543
01:18:08,780 --> 01:18:15,090
digesters have been distributed now and

1544
01:18:11,700 --> 01:18:17,790
with the water we know now well it's in

1545
01:18:15,090 --> 01:18:21,420
all the sectors it's the same so the

1546
01:18:17,790 --> 01:18:23,910
carbon finances that effect of good

1547
01:18:21,420 --> 01:18:26,940
monitoring and seeing what works about

1548
01:18:23,910 --> 01:18:30,300
nothing does not work but yeah clearly

1549
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:33,390
so where we sell the carbon credits in

1550
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:36,990
the voluntary carbon market and biogas

1551
01:18:33,390 --> 01:18:39,360
carbon credits are trait and relatively

1552
01:18:36,990 --> 01:18:42,390
good price but of course it's far from

1553
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:47,250
sufficient what is needed to make a real

1554
01:18:42,390 --> 01:18:49,830
transition and a real impact now somehow

1555
01:18:47,250 --> 01:18:53,220
also Peter mentioned we need to change

1556
01:18:49,830 --> 01:18:57,240
behaviour of private capital maybe yeah

1557
01:18:53,220 --> 01:19:00,900
there's also still so much lacking but

1558
01:18:57,240 --> 01:19:03,690
in the two cases we have

1559
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:07,230
small steps because in the Indonesia

1560
01:19:03,690 --> 01:19:11,040
biogas program and bio slurry does a

1561
01:19:07,230 --> 01:19:13,320
real contribution from Nestle know and

1562
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:15,780
that was so the program is in nine

1563
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:18,630
provinces at the and it performs best

1564
01:19:15,780 --> 01:19:23,429
where Nestle is involved now they

1565
01:19:18,630 --> 01:19:27,389
support the farmers and would produce

1566
01:19:23,429 --> 01:19:29,790
their milk and in Kenya we also after

1567
01:19:27,389 --> 01:19:34,159
the cooperation with EECOM trading which

1568
01:19:29,790 --> 01:19:37,440
is a large coffee company and it's also

1569
01:19:34,159 --> 01:19:42,449
investing in improving the agricultural

1570
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:45,690
practices and also the base salary is a

1571
01:19:42,449 --> 01:19:47,610
day they submit and they are supporting

1572
01:19:45,690 --> 01:19:51,679
with the private capital as well

1573
01:19:47,610 --> 01:19:55,139
no but it's far far from what is really

1574
01:19:51,679 --> 01:19:58,440
needed and I would say also that

1575
01:19:55,139 --> 01:20:01,679
yeah carbon markets in the project-based

1576
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:05,580
approach which just is the small start

1577
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:09,929
to watch really promoting low-carbon

1578
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:12,929
growth well I know that there are a lot

1579
01:20:09,929 --> 01:20:16,080
of questions but we ran out of time so I

1580
01:20:12,929 --> 01:20:19,199
have one last question - sir here - and

1581
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:23,060
this this session so here was what

1582
01:20:19,199 --> 01:20:26,730
lesson lessons can we take for the

1583
01:20:23,060 --> 01:20:30,500
current coming sustainable development

1584
01:20:26,730 --> 01:20:30,500
calls discussions

1585
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:43,540
hello yes with the with the topic at the

1586
01:20:37,870 --> 01:20:46,270
this session the how is it that the in

1587
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:50,280
the sustainable development goals that

1588
01:20:46,270 --> 01:20:54,010
are being negotiated in New York from

1589
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:56,260
December this December to to the next

1590
01:20:54,010 --> 01:21:00,520
August or September next year there are

1591
01:20:56,260 --> 01:21:03,370
17 goals and out of the 17 14 make a

1592
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:07,390
reference to learn so water and

1593
01:21:03,370 --> 01:21:11,200
vegetation 14 out of the 17 so how is

1594
01:21:07,390 --> 01:21:13,630
this global Universal negotiation in New

1595
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:15,520
York is going to be reflected as well in

1596
01:21:13,630 --> 01:21:17,410
the negotiations of this this this

1597
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:19,030
convention on climate change because

1598
01:21:17,410 --> 01:21:23,320
what we have seen here today this

1599
01:21:19,030 --> 01:21:25,810
morning I mean these three very we

1600
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:29,470
benefit from this innovative cases in

1601
01:21:25,810 --> 01:21:32,230
which organic agriculture has has a role

1602
01:21:29,470 --> 01:21:35,680
to play and the approaches to climate

1603
01:21:32,230 --> 01:21:38,080
change are really evident there but how

1604
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:39,610
is this going to be reflected in the

1605
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:41,140
practical approaches to the

1606
01:21:39,610 --> 01:21:45,760
implementation of the SDGs

1607
01:21:41,140 --> 01:21:48,310
it depends on the on the national and

1608
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:51,880
regional structures and negotiations

1609
01:21:48,310 --> 01:21:54,310
that are going to run dynamic situations

1610
01:21:51,880 --> 01:22:00,790
that the different countries and regions

1611
01:21:54,310 --> 01:22:02,860
have how they will see and face these

1612
01:22:00,790 --> 01:22:04,210
sustainable development goals the

1613
01:22:02,860 --> 01:22:06,190
sustainable development goals at the

1614
01:22:04,210 --> 01:22:12,450
same time they will have targets so what

1615
01:22:06,190 --> 01:22:15,490
it could be good approach is to have

1616
01:22:12,450 --> 01:22:17,590
make sure that some of the targets that

1617
01:22:15,490 --> 01:22:20,140
this sustainable development costs have

1618
01:22:17,590 --> 01:22:23,770
contain the issues of land and so for

1619
01:22:20,140 --> 01:22:25,480
example I know that target 15.3 is the

1620
01:22:23,770 --> 01:22:28,000
the achievement of land degradation

1621
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:31,240
neutrality which is like my integrity

1622
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:33,900
and prevention and the same with in food

1623
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:39,730
security the financial structures of

1624
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:43,540
that that accompany the assurance of a

1625
01:22:39,730 --> 01:22:49,990
secure world with the regarding food and

1626
01:22:43,540 --> 01:22:53,650
and feed so this this issue of political

1627
01:22:49,990 --> 01:22:55,780
negotiation financial aspects also

1628
01:22:53,650 --> 01:22:59,140
include what the presenters mentioned

1629
01:22:55,780 --> 01:23:01,420
the how to increase social capital how

1630
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:03,850
to increase livelihoods how to increase

1631
01:23:01,420 --> 01:23:06,940
governance at the local level how to

1632
01:23:03,850 --> 01:23:10,180
interact between the the small-scale

1633
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:13,030
farming and the large-scale operations

1634
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:15,570
in within the same a corridor within the

1635
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:18,400
same country these are the issues that

1636
01:23:15,570 --> 01:23:20,860
perhaps we should bring to the table and

1637
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:22,360
at the core of the negotiations not only

1638
01:23:20,860 --> 01:23:24,400
of this convention and climate change

1639
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:26,230
but also the convention of the

1640
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:29,050
certification and the convention

1641
01:23:26,230 --> 01:23:32,320
biodiversity as well as to highlighted

1642
01:23:29,050 --> 01:23:35,050
in the net in the in New York how we can

1643
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:38,320
do this we can as I said provide the

1644
01:23:35,050 --> 01:23:40,450
message like demands like this but also

1645
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:42,910
talk individually to the negotiators and

1646
01:23:40,450 --> 01:23:45,700
highlight this is important and this is

1647
01:23:42,910 --> 01:23:47,740
a priority for the majority of the

1648
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:50,650
countries even even Germany even

1649
01:23:47,740 --> 01:23:53,920
Australia even India these all these

1650
01:23:50,650 --> 01:23:56,950
countries are based have a substantive

1651
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:58,840
based on on agricultural production and

1652
01:23:56,950 --> 01:24:02,700
