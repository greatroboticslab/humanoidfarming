1
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:10,960
okay my name is Julia Django I work with

2
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,809
the international life

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:18,940
research institute a theory based in

4
00:00:13,809 --> 00:00:21,390
nairobi can i work with the team that

5
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:25,180
looks into animal genetics and breeding

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:27,250
basically am our vision and our goal is

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:29,140
to try and use livestock and the

8
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:31,810
practice of language ethics and breeding

9
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:34,149
to try and help change the livelihoods

10
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:36,220
of livestock keepers in developing

11
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:37,450
countries one of the developing

12
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:41,320
countries we've had the privilege to

13
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:43,899
work in is Nicaragua which is in Latin

14
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:46,809
America a totally different system from

15
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:51,010
what we would generally find in Africa

16
00:00:46,809 --> 00:00:53,289
and Nicaragua is unique they keep

17
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:56,829
animals both for milk and meat products

18
00:00:53,289 --> 00:00:59,379
because um they produce both milk and

19
00:00:56,829 --> 00:01:01,780
meat for export all american countries

20
00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:05,019
but also some to the united states of

21
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:08,140
america nicaragua's is a developing

22
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:10,420
country in terms of the livelihoods or

23
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,820
the incomes for their farmers are really

24
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:16,380
still no but livestock does contribute

25
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:20,049
significantly to their national economy

26
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:24,540
in nicaragua and we found that there

27
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:27,939
were a lot of livestock keepers that own

28
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:31,960
smaller land sizes with herd sizes of

29
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:34,420
less than 25 animals that's between 10

30
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,950
and 25 animals and these are the

31
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,680
livestock keepers of me felt would be

32
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:40,360
important to help target to to change

33
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,960
their their livelihoods as part of the

34
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:47,380
livestock and fish strategy the

35
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:50,770
objective was how do we use genetics to

36
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:52,299
help change the way in which the breeds

37
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:55,899
that the animal of the farmers are

38
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:57,939
keeping we produce products for for

39
00:01:55,899 --> 00:02:00,280
their lives but because we didn't have a

40
00:01:57,939 --> 00:02:02,320
lot of information on Nicaragua we had

41
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,060
to begin by trying to understand the

42
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,090
environment and the systems that we were

43
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:09,220
working in husk and following the

44
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:13,390
baseline and we immediately realized

45
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:17,240
that all the small almost all the small

46
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:20,180
holder farmers kept a bull

47
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:22,490
and the other thing was there was not

48
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:24,380
one single breed type that you would say

49
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:27,650
this is the main print type being kept

50
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:29,690
by the farmers but they had a variety of

51
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:32,180
crosses not really pure breds but

52
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:34,760
crosses most of the crosses were crosses

53
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:38,360
to Brahman but you had like brown swiss

54
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:41,360
crosses Jersey crosses holston crosses

55
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,490
and that immediately I'm raised raised a

56
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,280
lot of questions as to why and what

57
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:48,350
happened so following the baseline way

58
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,000
we decided let's go back to the

59
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:52,100
communities and talk with them and try

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,830
and learn from them and see what

61
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:56,450
influences that practices and what would

62
00:02:54,830 --> 00:03:00,470
they need to do what would they try to

63
00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:02,900
change if they were asked to change from

64
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:05,240
from experiences elsewhere the best way

65
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:08,840
to get farmers to to give you

66
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:11,030
information is using their animals so we

67
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:14,720
organized for the group discussion to be

68
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:16,340
held on a farmers farm so and we we

69
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,740
requested them to get a farmer who had

70
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,330
enough animals of the different variety

71
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:23,330
and to try and see if we could actually

72
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:25,790
at the same time give feedback and have

73
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:28,760
training on the choice and selection of

74
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:31,310
different pretax what struck us

75
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:34,400
immediately went for their follow-up or

76
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:38,570
the feedback workshop is that it's

77
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:41,000
mainly men who attended within the whole

78
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:44,510
group there was only one woman who came

79
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,550
and her peculiarity was she was already

80
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:48,290
an extension worker so she was an

81
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:50,210
extension worker as well as a life

82
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:52,850
storekeeper that was the only thing that

83
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:54,740
made her feel free to come and sit among

84
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:56,870
the men to talk but otherwise all the

85
00:03:54,740 --> 00:04:01,850
other participants were men but the

86
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:04,430
farmer's wife and his children were

87
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:07,790
available to prepare the meals and cook

88
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:09,500
for the group that came so they offered

89
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:11,990
that service and they they were

90
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:14,810
subsequently facilitated to cook for a

91
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:17,209
group that came for the training as part

92
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:20,209
of them process of group discussions we

93
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:23,070
have developed a series of tools that we

94
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:25,800
used and small group work to try

95
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:28,140
first of all just share with the farmers

96
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,240
what we saw from the baseline the

97
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:33,600
different breed types and then we raised

98
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,370
questions related to the types of

99
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,230
animals they were keeping and the

100
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:43,470
practices that they they were using and

101
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:46,140
in in the smaller subgroups we got the

102
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:49,110
farmers to define what were the traits

103
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:50,960
of importance but particularly our

104
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:54,210
interest was the breeding practices

105
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:57,410
adopted to help change their heads and

106
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:59,970
what they knew about them the farmers

107
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:02,790
noted that here's they they understood

108
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:04,500
the use of AI because for cattle

109
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:07,950
production mean artificial insemination

110
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:10,230
is not really cause rapid and drastic

111
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:12,210
changes in the hearse over a short time

112
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:13,800
so they said they do know about the

113
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:17,430
practice but they don't really use it

114
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:19,800
much and the question came to why they

115
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:21,450
said well projects do bring up a I and

116
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,040
they adopt it but then after that the

117
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:26,820
air is not available so they don't use

118
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:28,890
it anymore and then we asked them what

119
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:31,770
do they like about the animals that they

120
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:34,020
use and they they choose that the traits

121
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:35,910
that they would desire in their animals

122
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:39,210
their vision was the order a mother

123
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:41,400
could produce about 15 kilos of of milk

124
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:44,640
and had good growth rates because the

125
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:47,520
curves that were born to their cows are

126
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,620
often sold off to other producers who

127
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,750
then raise them as animals for slaughter

128
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:55,350
so that way then they have been the dual

129
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:57,870
purpose nature of the animals but one

130
00:05:55,350 --> 00:06:02,220
thing that was concerning each one of us

131
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:04,730
was their promotion also of different

132
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:08,550
breed types within the farmer hoods in

133
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:09,930
in the process of having the group work

134
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,060
we decide let's have a practical

135
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:14,250
demonstration so we requested the

136
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,650
farmers to go and actually look at the

137
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:18,960
animals at their farmer kept and we

138
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:22,020
separated them into groups and told them

139
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,790
to identify the two best in terms of the

140
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:27,150
traits that they felt were of interest

141
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,760
to them as livestock around breeders it

142
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,260
was very

143
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:33,790
interesting because when the farmers

144
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:35,470
selected their cows physically the end

145
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:37,990
of the day when we asked them why they

146
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:39,670
selected their cows and then we brought

147
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:42,580
up what they had listed in that

148
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:45,340
discussion it turned out that they were

149
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:47,740
kind of two different lines along which

150
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:50,620
they were selected because they selected

151
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:53,200
the live animals based on the color and

152
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:55,740
the physical appearance externally of

153
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:58,600
the animals without looking at the other

154
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,950
characteristics without looking at did

155
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,990
the animal have any records or

156
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:04,060
information on them without looking at

157
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:06,670
any historical background on the animals

158
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:08,050
and yet during the group discussions

159
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:10,690
these are the things that they had said

160
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:13,210
would guide their choices of which

161
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:15,760
animals they would use now of course

162
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:17,860
then that that for us are served as a

163
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,660
learning point at the point where you

164
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:21,550
could help guide to the farmers in terms

165
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:26,770
of these are the principles you look at

166
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:29,050
inbreeding so following that the

167
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:31,930
discussions we will go back to plenary

168
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:33,550
sessions but because the whole morning

169
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:36,310
and day's activities had been quite busy

170
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:38,860
took a break and decide let's have some

171
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:41,290
refreshment in some lunch as

172
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:43,000
facilitators we were given good

173
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:45,970
treatment and were asked please come and

174
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,010
sit in a separate room and so we went us

175
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:50,740
and said master bedroom and then what

176
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:55,320
surprised us was as the women served us

177
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:58,480
they said they had a question to ask and

178
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:01,150
so we said yeah I'll go ahead and that

179
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:06,580
question was you know this AI that you

180
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:10,000
talk about well when you use it how low

181
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:13,330
you have to wait you know when you see a

182
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,130
cow wanting to be mounted how long do

183
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:16,900
you have to wait before it has to be

184
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:19,040
served if you really want to get that

185
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:21,560
cough

186
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:24,550
so we asked that's an interesting

187
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:27,470
question have you tried to use the AI

188
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:30,560
which is this yes we've tried but we

189
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:33,830
never get a cuff so you no longer use it

190
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:38,270
because every time we try to use if we

191
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:40,040
don't get a car and so we asked what

192
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:42,350
what's the process when you try to use

193
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:45,050
the AI she says or well I see the animal

194
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:47,360
in heat then I tell my husband but

195
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:49,610
normally he waits until the following

196
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:53,090
morning and then he sends for the AI

197
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:56,000
technician wheel after all by then it is

198
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:58,370
too late because the animal is probably

199
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,130
cycled and lost the psycho says yes in

200
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:03,140
fact normally I'd then push it beside

201
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:05,780
the boon or near the labor spoon and

202
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:07,940
I'll get the cuff that I need but the

203
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:11,870
next question was where can I get

204
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:14,300
information on what to do so immediately

205
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:17,120
we notice that though the women were not

206
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,890
present at the workshop it didn't hear

207
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,830
that the women were not humorous to

208
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:23,690
manual or learn about the braiding or

209
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:25,550
the use of the different technologies

210
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:27,320
but it also tells me that the woman

211
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:31,370
didn't want to use them it's just they

212
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:33,230
didn't have the knowledge required so we

213
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,850
requested our partners on the ground do

214
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:37,430
you think we could try and have a

215
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:40,180
workshop where you just target or bring

216
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:44,990
the women together and try and find them

217
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:48,080
and this this was possible and it was

218
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:50,210
arranged and when the women will ask

219
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:54,050
what training do you think we should try

220
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:57,320
and organize for you immediate reaction

221
00:09:54,050 --> 00:10:01,520
was trained us on how to manage the

222
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:04,160
production and use AI if we can use air

223
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:06,800
effectively then we don't have to keep

224
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,430
these bulls and maybe we could change

225
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,430
our heads

226
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:17,839
you
