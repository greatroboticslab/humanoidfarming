00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:09,760
actually expanded to a bigger space in

00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,960
an agreement with them to use their

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,480
farming space which is about nine

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,039
is your host um once again right here on

14
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,079
the private property

15
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,920
channel

16
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,559
today we're joined by a friend of the

17
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,120
podcast who has been on the show before

18
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,840
and we spoke about hydroponic farming

19
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,880
rooftop farming because she had her own

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,040
rooftop farm in johannesburg cbd but she

21
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,280
joins us today on a different level

22
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,360
where she's going to tell us about her

23
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,960
agribusiness online platform that she

24
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,840
has started with the women's

25
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,920
organization and that promotes

26
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,320
and showcases

27
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,040
agribusinesses regarding hydroponic

28
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,360
farming and organic farming so if you

29
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,600
are interested in hydroponic farming how

30
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,200
to diverse into organic farming i

31
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,280
believe this conversation would be quite

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,520
beneficial to you because she is a

33
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,920
farmer herself and so she knows a thing

34
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,520
or two about hydroponic farming and so

35
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,159
yeah if you have any questions please

36
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,880

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,440
that have taken place

51
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,200
and in building these communities that

52
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,599
we are surrounded with because we always

53
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,840
say we want to be the ones that see the

54
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,480
change in our communities and we go all

55
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,200
out to actually make sure that we impact

56
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,280
communities absolutely so let's just

57
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,480
start off by

58
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,080
giving us a rundown of where you are

59
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,920
right now with your farming business i

60
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,519
remember the last time you spoke you're

61
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,920
farming in the rooftop is everything

62
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,360
going well and we also touched based on

63
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,440
um how covert had impacted you um in our

64
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,720
previous conversation so how's the farm

65
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,400
looking

66
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,800
are you harvesting any crops at the

67
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,800
moment

68
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,040
you know it's amazing that you've

69
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,239
actually expanded to a bigger space in

70
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,640
ekinoff

71
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,879
where we partnered with the tlc

72
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,080
children's home and we have managed to

73
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,920
form

74
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,519
an agreement with them to use their

75
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,319
farming space which is about nine

76
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,560
hectares so we set up in hydroponics

77
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,080
which takes now fourteen thousand

78
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,040
uh

79
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,879
crops

80
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,599
and we are also doing an incubation then

81
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,280
we set up a class and we working as a

82
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,360
group of five of us now in a

83
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,599
collaboration called african women in

84
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,000
agriculture okay so i've got four

85
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:33,280
dynamic women that i'm working with is

86
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,200
janus schechter agnes hawaii and i've

87
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,599
got veronica

88
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,360
aswany and we're also working with bia

89
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,239
at black so as the five of us we've

90
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,400
started that incubation now and also the

91
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,200
farming business and the platform called

92
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,879
i am citizen so it's been a great move

93
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,360
because now it has given us an

94
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:54,640
opportunity to now impact communities

95
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,120
surrounding the akanov area where we

96
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,400
recruit young women who want to do

97
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,080
hydroponics farming and do also organic

98
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,280
farming and we also give them business

99
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,080
skills

100
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,760
and

101
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,680
they're also

102
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,640
taken to a point where they're able to

103
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,840
start their own businesses using

104
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,519
farming as a way of of entering markets

105
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,680
because the challenge has been that they

106
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,600
say as young people farming hasn't been

107
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,160
easy so we said no you can join and see

108
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,800
that there's there's actually so much

109
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,600
that you can do within the value chain

110
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,400
of farming so we we we started with the

111
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,880
first incubation last year and then this

112
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,040
year we've got the second cohort which

113
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,199
we're doing up until july then july

114
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,520
we're taking the next intake

115
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,280
where we're encouraging them to go also

116
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,080
and impact their communities where they

117
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,639
come from and and we evaluate their

118
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,440
community projects we profile them on i

119
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,160
am citizen which is the online platform

120
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,680
digital platform that we have started as

121
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,639
aware yeah so tell me more about the

122
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,639
incubation that you formed with aria

123
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,240
how long does it take

124
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,520
and why did you decide that there's a

125
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,520
need for an incubation

126
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,479
with a current

127
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,639
situation where

128
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:15,039
most of the challenges that were faced

129
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:18,240
by women was access to land and access

130
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:21,039
to finance and also looking at how do we

131
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,360
make sure that we we empower them on

132
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,199
starting just starting because the key

133
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,280
thing is that people want to be into

134
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,759
farming but they're not starting so with

135
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,360
that nine hectares that we we

136
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,680
listen from the

137
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,160
children's home we're able to get them

138
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,360
to start and practice and also learn

139
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,199
from a space where we are set up and

140
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,520
then we also

141
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,680
assist them in incapacitate them to a

142
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,759
point of them starting up their own

143
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,360
businesses where they come from

144
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:53,360
so the incubation is actually on

145
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,680
incapacitating women to to be able to

146
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,000
start and farm and they have access to

147
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,080
having like trainings that they don't

148
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,319
have to do just online but they can come

149
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,639
and do practicals at the farm where we

150
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,199
are at the tlc children's home yeah and

151
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:10,639
how long do you train the woman around

152
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:14,960
farming um is it just a few months a few

153
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,960
weeks and then what happens thereafter

154
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,919
it's actually six months because the

155
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,720
first cohort we got them for the whole

156
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:25,680
year last year so this year we split it

157
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,919
into six months so we we we've got the

158
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,479
first call second cohorts that we

159
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,479
started in feb they're finishing in july

160
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:35,199
and then we'll take the next cohort up

161
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:37,919
until november so what what happens

162
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,960
there we train them on the practical

163
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,319
side of farming and also we we have

164
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,639
classes where we have personal

165
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,960
development we're also looking at

166
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,039
at training them on finances how to

167
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,880
manage their finances how to have access

168
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,560
to markets and then we invite guest

169
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,280
speakers on various topics in

170
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,280
agriculture to come and address them

171
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,000
so we understand that there's more

172
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:03,280
farming than just farming the land we

173
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,759
say you can actually be in in in any

174
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,800
value chain within the farming

175
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,280
sector so we encourage them to also look

176
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,520
at how they can come in we've got new

177
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,639
intakes that some of them are looking at

178
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,880
being retailers and starting their own

179
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,080
businesses where they will actually uh

180
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,000
be

181
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,639
acting as aggregators

182
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,039
to to to aggregate from farmers and then

183
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,120
supply the communities where they come

184
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,599
from yeah so am i correct in saying that

185
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,919
the incubation right now is purely

186
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:37,199
focused on crop farming and not

187
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,199
necessarily livestock

188
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,160
we we've we've included poultry this

189
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,479
year because we've had three intakes of

190
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,599
young ladies that want to do poultry so

191
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:50,639
we've we've included poultry and we're

192
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:53,120
looking at expanding also to piggery and

193
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,120
also looking at

194
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,160
sheep farming and goat farming and

195
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,240
rabbit farming because we interview them

196
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,039
and then they tell us what what space

197
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,720
they want to be in

198
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,280
we also

199
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,759
guest speakers on the various topics

200
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,919
like with poultry we had a young farmer

201
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,720
that has just opened an abattoir in

202
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,800
akinov to come and speak to them and

203
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,680
encourage them that there's more you can

204
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,280
do within the value chain of poultry

205
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,199
so thomas bong and it to be part of the

206
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,000
incubation do i need to be a farmer that

207
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:29,919
has access to land for example but maybe

208
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,919
need a bit of technical information or

209
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,399
technical skill in how to cultivate

210
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,800
crops etc and that is when i would apply

211
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,560
into the occupation stay there for six

212
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,200
months and then go back onto my land and

213
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:44,000
farm or can it be anybody who's just

214
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,320
interested in farming exploring the

215
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,320
different commodities that are available

216
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,399
in farming whether it's crops

217
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,760
poultry

218
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,519
even

219
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,399
adding a value add in terms of an

220
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:59,440
abattoir so can it just be anybody or do

221
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,839
i have to have land on or an already

222
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,040
existing business where i can up up

223
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,560
skill

224
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,560
and improve my knowledge in farming

225
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,760
we we're actually encouraging even those

226
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,680
who don't have land why because we're

227
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,120
saying there's lots of people who say

228
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,360
they don't have lenta they're not

229
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,040
maximizing the spaces that they have

230
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,120
where they are because there's a new

231
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,920
project also that will be starting very

232
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,399
soon in may where we're using pyramids

233
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,480
to show them how to grow in their own

234
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,399
backyards because with the current

235
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,959
situation of food shortage we cannot

236
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,120
leave those backyards to life fallow so

237
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,640
there's a friend of mine veronica who's

238
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,040
also part of the

239
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:42,800
of the women in agriculture she's

240
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,720
designed a a pyramid that you can use as

241
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,560
a vertical farm

242
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:51,279
to to plant in in a small area about 120

243
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,680
plants at a goal so we're pushing that

244
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,839
to train people on that and then we

245
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,519
assist you to get to it we give them a

246
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,360
fundable business plan

247
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,920
that they can now go back and use the

248
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:05,279
land where they come from

249
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,600
okay so now moving on to the online

250
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,200
agricultural platform you mentioned that

251
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,000
you're promoting businesses that are

252
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,240
doing hydroponic farming and organic

253
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,399
farming so just tell us a little bit

254
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:20,480
more about the platform and how it works

255
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,240
so this platform will work as a

256
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,399
community as well because we've got a

257
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,079
page where we invite communities to come

258
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:29,600
and learn and say

259
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:31,120
like for example ask an agronomist

260
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,720
and then there will be an agronomist

261
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,120
that will answer questions for people

262
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,560
who want to be informing but they've got

263
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,920
lots of questions that they're not

264
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:42,880
certain about and then we've got a site

265
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:46,560
where we do profiling of farms and also

266
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:50,000
profiling of of of stakeholders

267
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:52,640
like if there's uh your your your people

268
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,640
that supply

269
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,480
inputs

270
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,880
they will be profiled on on that i am

271
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:02,480
citizen so that people have access to

272
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:05,680
the full network of not just farmers

273
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,680
network of of also suppliers and also

274
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,640
stakeholders within the agricultural

275
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,480
space

276
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,800
when did you decide to

277
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,200
when did you develop and launch the im

278
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,279
citizen platform and what success

279
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,800
stories can you tell us thus far that

280
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,800
have come out of the platform

281
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,240
with the i'm citizen we started in in

282
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,240
2021

283
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,240
and the success stories has been that

284
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,640
we've been able to build a network of

285
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,040
farmers but even the incubators that we

286
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,959
had for a year last year they're also

287
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,959
profiled on that when they're able to do

288
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,040
their business on that platform and

289
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,880
network amongst themselves we we

290
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,959
encourage them to say

291
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,440
you you need to collaborate and work

292
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,360
together because with farming you cannot

293
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,440
operate in isolation

294
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,440
so we're encouraging them to say please

295
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,440
work together and with the second

296
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,399
incubation that we have the second

297
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,560
cohort we've also onboarded them to say

298
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,200
do your business on the platform because

299
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,120
digital space you're not limited to

300
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,279
where you are you can actually network

301
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,440
with women from different regions

302
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,360
different places because we're going

303
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,360
global and we cannot be operating just

304
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,519
locally

305
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,720
and confirming uh that you did say that

306
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,600
the land that

307
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,839
uh the incubation and the platform is is

308
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,480
is is highlighting is for the farmers

309
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:27,519
who are being incubated in akanov have

310
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,480
you received any requests for people

311
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,800
who've seen successes in your incubation

312
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,120
program to maybe replicate what you're

313
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,959
doing in other areas particularly in

314
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,839
khao deng over and above the other

315
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,920
provinces

316
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,160
yes we we've had so many requests

317
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,959
because even now we we're basically

318
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,240
communicating with people in in the area

319
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,880
of

320
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,600
iguruleni they actually saying can we

321
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,440
replicate this in in in the east as well

322
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,440
because we want to take it within

323
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,200
communities we've been counting then

324
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,519
also we've had in

325
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,160
inquiries from the eastern cape

326
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,399
to actually replicate this ip in the

327
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,200
different areas right

328
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:12,000
and just summing up

329
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:15,040
engagements with with them so we're open

330
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,440
to to replicating this model

331
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:20,000
in different areas

332
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,680
yeah i i think a critical question also

333
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,760
to find out spoken is that how many

334
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,760
intakes can you take at a time

335
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,440
okay at the moment because we're in

336
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,680
partnership with idc and we we were

337
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,000
looking at 12

338
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:40,000
cohort which is six months we're looking

339
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,279
at 24 in in in in one year but now with

340
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,800
the other

341
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:46,560
portion that we've included we're

342
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,639
looking at using the the new isa vuno

343
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,880
which we've named as isi vunaway will

344
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,560
also look at impacting communities at

345
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,839
larger scale where we'll have saturday

346
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,800
classes for them to learn about this is

347
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,320
the new

348
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,320
one that we're doing where we are

349
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,120
training them on how to maximize their

350
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,399
spaces in the urban areas especially the

351
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,839
ones that

352
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,959
back gardens

353
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:11,920
and i mean on my back garden which is

354
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:14,240
20 by 20 i've managed to grow plants as

355
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,560
well so i always say to them there's no

356
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,800
way you can leave that land follow and

357
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,800
and then you say you don't have food

358
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,920
because we still have that project

359
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,880
called farm in a box where we we donate

360
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,079
seeds

361
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:30,639
to to to to communities to start their

362
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:33,040
own food gardens at their back yards

363
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,199
right you did say that the the the

364
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,600
incubation is a non-profit so what

365
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:39,760
happens to all the crops that you uh

366
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,320
that you produce part of the incubation

367
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,000
program do you sell that um with the

368
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,199
revenue do you apply it back onto the

369
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:51,839
farm or do you give the crops to nearby

370
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:51,839
communities as part of food security

371
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,160
yes on the on the

372
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,320
one for farming enterprise because

373
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,079
within the the area we've got the

374
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,760
farming enterprise which is the one

375
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,600
where we're planting the crops and we've

376
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,120
partnered with ebb and fresh they are

377
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,040
our off takers

378
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,160
they come and collect and sell and then

379
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:12,959
the profit is it's it's plowed back into

380
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,839
the area npo

381
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:18,320
so the the other one it's impacting like

382
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,639
the very same children's home they they

383
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,480
actually get produced from because when

384
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,000
we started we started with them and we

385
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,959
started as a food garden that we were

386
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,199
doing for them and then they saw the

387
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:32,160
way it was done and this that we've got

388
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:35,680
len that's available can you partner

389
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:37,680
with us and set up something in in in

390
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,399
the tlc children's home

391
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:43,279
so part of the impact that we make it's

392
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,440
actually ten percent goes to protect

393
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,839
of communities locally and then the rest

394
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,680
we we plow back into the npo from the

395
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,079
sales made with the partnership we have

396
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,079
with ebb and fresh who are aggregators

397
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,399
yeah it sounds like you guys have really

398
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,959
thought about it quite uh

399
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,560
extensively you know uh making sure that

400
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:03,600
you're covering all the blocks that

401
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:06,480
really farmers face as a big challenge

402
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:09,600
or a barrier to entry into uh the

403
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,959
agricultural sector um i know you are a

404
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,680
farmer as well and now you've

405
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:15,440
transitioned into a a a space where

406
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,759
you're helping other farmers teaching

407
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,720
them um exposing their businesses and

408
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,920
obviously

409
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:25,600
transferring skills to aspirant farmers

410
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:27,759
what have you learned um throughout 2021

411
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,959
and going into 2022

412
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,440
over

413
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:33,440
since you've started helping um all the

414
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,880
cohorts in the various stages of their

415
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,120
businesses

416
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,920
what have you learned from it from from

417
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:42,480
starting um your incubation program as

418
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,959
well as i am a citizen uh program what

419
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:48,160
have you learned around the farmers and

420
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:52,399
more so just uh um in general within

421
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,399
agriculture from a farmer's perspective

422
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,639
and wearing my head as a farmer this has

423
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,440
been

424
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:02,480
an amazing time because now as a farmer

425
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,720
we always wanted to start in isolation

426
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,120
and run your farm there on your own but

427
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,520
now with moving to african women in

428
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,760
agriculture where i collaborated with

429
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,400
five dynamic women

430
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:17,439
it it has actually opened my

431
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:20,319
eyes to a point that collaboration is

432
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:22,720
key if we want to build communities we

433
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:26,240
need to collaborate and the networking

434
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:28,319
that takes place as farmers has actually

435
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,559
grown to a point that i'm even

436
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,760
networking with women as far as the

437
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,240
northwest

438
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,160
because we we didn't leave it to saying

439
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,400
we are in counting we need to address

440
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,400
issues and how they it has actually

441
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,440
opened up for us to actually network

442
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:46,480
with with people as far as india because

443
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,880
i've just won the global award

444
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,440
for women in in in agriculture

445
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,679
addressing the sdg goal number two of

446
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,480
zero hunger and i'm finding myself

447
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,160
speaking to women in india who are

448
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,160
doing and how they

449
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,799
and this has opened up a door because

450
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,559
like i said with with with networking

451
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,320
we're not limiting it to the whatsapp

452
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,559
we're now saying let's work with apps

453
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,480
where we can empower each other

454
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:13,679
and reach other

455
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,440
actions and countries surrounding us as

456
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,559
south africa

457
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,360
well that's fantastic and

458
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:22,559
congratulations on your award i think it

459
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,919
definitely shows um of the efforts and

460
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,240
the work that you're doing on the ground

461
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,320
but before i let you go swangela what

462
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:31,520
three points can you give to aspirin

463
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,760
farmers who want to venture into farming

464
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,919
whether it could be crops

465
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,760
livestock poultry

466
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,600
what advice would you give maybe top

467
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,240
three things that you'd give to an

468
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,880
aspirin farmer who wants to venture into

469
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,880
agriculture

470
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,200
thank you my sister you know i always

471
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,679
say to to farmers that as a farmer you

472
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,760
must have the tendency to continue

473
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,360
despite all challenges that we're

474
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,640
currently facing

475
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:03,200
and and the second one is to actually be

476
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,039
there as someone who's a solution see

477
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,760
yourself as a solution what are you

478
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:10,559
bringing into the agrispace be a

479
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:13,360
solution in a community and also the

480
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:16,000
third one would be start wherever you

481
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,919
are what is the that's in your hand do

482
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,120
not limit yourself to say i'm waiting

483
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:24,160
until i have 10 million or i have a

484
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:27,200
funding from start as little as at your

485
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:29,440
back garden move on let your communities

486
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,120
know that you are farming in your air

487
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,200
if you say you are a farmer no one knows

488
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,679
where you come from that you are farming

489
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,240
it's a challenge so start

490
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:41,200
where you are and use as little

491
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,880
resources that as you move on and you're

492
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,120
speaking to other funders they always

493
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,200
want to know have you started something

494
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,960
where are you uh where are you currently

495
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,480
where are you moving to what are your

496
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,320
futures and don't be scared to dream big

497
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,480
i always encourage people to say dream

498
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,720
big don't limit yourself

499
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:02,080
i left my profession as an accountant to

500
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,360
do my passion of farming and i've never

501
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,520
stopped

502
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:08,640
i never stopped i started living with a

503
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:11,840
small garden at my backyard to actually

504
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:14,320
let me eat from the garden just outside

505
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:17,120
my house and then move on so i really

506
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:19,840
encourage people to say start where you

507
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:22,000
are and don't despise humble beginnings

508
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,840
because we always want to see

509
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,240
things happening at a higher level

510
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,679
without starting where you you you have

511
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,039
your footprint

512
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:33,760
wow so that's my my treatment to say

513
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:36,159

00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,159
and dream big and definitely have the

515
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,960

and how the valley chain works from a

562
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:18,159
spec requirement to an input perspective

563
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,520
and when you have to cultivate your own

564
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:23,039

565
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,679
