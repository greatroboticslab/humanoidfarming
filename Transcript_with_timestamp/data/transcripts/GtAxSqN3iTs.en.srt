1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:04,500
all right fig lovers this is Ross the

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,299
Fig boss in today's video we're going to

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,519
talk about growing fig trees in

4
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:10,679
containers and I think you guys are in

5
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:13,080
real special hands today because I have

6
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:15,360
dedicated a large portion of the last 10

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,460
years so learning as much as I can about

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,840
this very special fruit tree

9
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,539
the Fig

10
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,279
and I've also spent during this time a

11
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:25,140
lot of that time growing figs in

12
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,960
containers but also growing other

13
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,699
species of fruiting plants in containers

14
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,880
as well I've grown a number of different

15
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:35,280
varieties hundreds of different trees

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,440
in containers and I have a lot of good

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,760
advice I want to share with you guys in

18
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,640
today's video we're going to try to make

19
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,040
this as simple as possible in regards to

20
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,899
these fig trees so the first thing I

21
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,239
think that's really important

22
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:50,300
can you actually grow fig trees in

23
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,039
containers I know that's pretty simple

24
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:55,379
the answer is yes and I find that of

25
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,760
most of the fruiting species that you

26
00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:01,739
can grow in containers they do fantastic

27
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,840
the problem with the fig tree

28
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:05,580
in a container is that you met you got

29
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,220
to make sure that you put it in the

30
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,680
right size if it's too small of a pot

31
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,299
this is a two gallon size here it's

32
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,580
about eight inches by eight inches

33
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:16,260
you're not going to see great production

34
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,640
you're not going to see great fruit set

35
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,740
you're not going to see good fruit

36
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,840
quality and it's just kind of going to

37
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,880
be a waste of your time I find

38
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,400
if you're going to grow fruit fig trees

39
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,259
guys in containers you got to grow them

40
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,680
in at least a three gallon I mean look

41
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:32,939
at the difference in the size and the

42
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,680
productivity

43
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:37,020
between the two trees I just showed you

44
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,159
they're actually similarly aged believe

45
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,560
it or not

46
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,180
and this tree here in front of me is

47
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,040
probably going to produce close to 50

48
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,299
figs every year if you really know what

49
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,640
you're doing

50
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:50,280
versus the other size that may if I'm

51
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,920
lucky produce 20 or 25.

52
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,380
so that's a big jump from just a two

53
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,759
gallon size pot actually to a to a three

54
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,880
gallon size pot

55
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:03,119
and I would also recommend by the way

56
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:06,299
going in a larger size as you can handle

57
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,819
so I have five gallons in here I have 10

58
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:11,160
gallons in there I also have 15 Gallons

59
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:13,319
back on the other side of the patio

60
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,940
and those I think are great because they

61
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:16,620
obviously the trees produce more fruit

62
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,599
in that size

63
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,640
but those are more of my permanent fruit

64
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:22,500
trees my permanent fig trees in

65
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,560
containers because if I'm going to be

66
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,180
growing figs long term in a container I

67
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,280
want to make sure I have the a bigger

68
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,379
pot size first off they're going to

69
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,879
produce more fruit but also I'm not

70
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:34,500
going to have to typically root burn

71
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,120
them as often they're not going to

72
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,540
become as root bound

73
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,640
as quickly and in these smaller sizes

74
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,080
here like this three gallon we'll

75
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,360
probably have to root from this maybe

76
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,400
every other year every three years just

77
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,040
to maintain the health and the

78
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,040
productivity of this tree

79
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,739
also if I went from let's say a three

80
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,800
gallon size or a five gallon size which

81
00:02:55,739 --> 00:03:01,620
is going to produce about 75 figs a year

82
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,440
and then I went up to a 10 gallon I'm

83
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:07,319
gonna probably double my production so I

84
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:10,800
would go from 75 figs to 150. so the

85
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:12,900
larger I can go the larger I can carry

86
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,879
the better off I'm going to be the

87
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:18,420
problem is with a lot of us in zone

88
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:21,420
sevens sixes and fives we have to move

89
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:24,060
our fig trees in the wintertime

90
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,620
and really some zones Zone eights some

91
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,959
of you guys in zone eights may have to

92
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,659
move them as well if our fig trees get

93
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:33,300
below 15 degrees Fahrenheit

94
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:35,819
in the winter time we need to move them

95
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:38,159
away from those cold temperatures that

96
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:40,799
15 degree low maybe even around 10

97
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,019
degrees Fahrenheit is going to damage

98
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,780
the roots of our fig tree and

99
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:48,780
potentially kill it especially on the

100
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,640
low uh the lower Hardy varieties that

101
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,980
you guys may have everybody has a

102
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,019
different fig variety and so giving you

103
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,239
just that General recommendation of 15

104
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:59,640
degrees Fahrenheit would be the safe

105
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:01,560
number for all fig varieties you want to

106
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,900
make sure they are kept out of that cold

107
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,180
and so that's the beauty of growing them

108
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,739
in containers why would you even grow

109
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,900
them in a container

110
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:12,239
personally you need to be in either a

111
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,159
short season climate that you can

112
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,040
benefit by getting your fig tree awake

113
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,380
earlier getting it a head start and

114
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,720
making use of having a warmer soil

115
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,580
temperature

116
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,979
or you need to be living in a very cold

117
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,620
place where you just can't grow fig

118
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:31,919
trees in the ground and so that's the

119
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:34,080
main concern I have with the pot size

120
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,120
is that yes I would like to go as large

121
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,340
as possible to get as much fruit as

122
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,600
possible to also have to root prune

123
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,860
typically less

124
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,419
but

125
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,660
I'm gonna have to move it at some point

126
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:47,639
so a 55 gallon drum or a half whiskey

127
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,560
barrel might be too big might be too

128
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:51,360
heavy might be too much to deal with

129
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,520
especially if you have a lot of fig

130
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,380
trees so for me

131
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,660
the three gallon or the five gallon size

132
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:59,820
actually is perfect and if I have a more

133
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,340
permanent tree I like to go to the 10

134
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:05,880
but a 15 is almost a little too heavy

135
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:08,100
even for me to move so that's a big

136
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,560
lesson there

137
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,820
now let's talk about caring for them

138
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,759
because

139
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:16,919
we can't just have a tree in a pot and

140
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:20,400
expect it to do well one of the most

141
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:23,400
important things actually is fertilizer

142
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,759
this here is just a bag of slow release

143
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:29,520
fertilizer it's called florican

144
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:31,680
and you can also get this by so many

145
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,800
other names there is osmocote they sell

146
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:38,100
it at Home Depot there's classic coat

147
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,320
they're basically those little beads

148
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,479
that are different colors

149
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,160
they're very small

150
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,259
and these little beads here as an

151
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,660
example sit on top of the soil or mixed

152
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:52,020
in the top of the soil and they slowly

153
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:54,000
provide fertilizer to our fig trees

154
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:56,880
every time we water

155
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,680
and so this just makes it super easy I

156
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,500
mean you can't get any easier they've

157
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:04,020
already designed essentially on the bag

158
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:06,240
you'll read about the nutrients that are

159
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:08,520
in here obviously you want something

160
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,880
close to a 10 10 10 or as close as you

161
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,440
can get to a 10 10 10 or a 20 10 20 is

162
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,539
also really good

163
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,220
but they also include in the bag all the

164
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:19,500
different micronutrients that your trees

165
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,300
might need and so you essentially you

166
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,860
can just apply this and be done with it

167
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,360
I mean this is the really the simplified

168
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,380
version of it if you want to get really

169
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,960
technical

170
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:30,900
I would recommend going to the blog that

171
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,759
I mentioned before figboss.com guys

172
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,319
we have a whole different article

173
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:36,180
written there that's so much information

174
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,819
about fertilizing if you really wanted

175
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:41,520
to get in the weeds of it but this is a

176
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:43,440
one-time application that I do every

177
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,180
single spring to every container fig

178
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,460
tree you read the label on the bag

179
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:50,520
exactly how much you should apply

180
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:52,620
and that's it I don't worry about it uh

181
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,360
every time I water for a certain number

182
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,319
of months depending on the fertilizer

183
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,900
you buy

184
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:59,340
it provides fertilizer and I do it day

185
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,780
one of the growing season as soon as

186
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:03,660
they start waking up

187
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:06,900
the next thing in terms of care that's

188
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:08,880
really critical is water and so

189
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:12,900
I have all my fig trees believe it or

190
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,039
not hooked up to a automatic Irrigation

191
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,440
Timer

192
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:18,300
this is drip irrigation down there

193
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,099
see the tubes

194
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:22,620
and this timer just does it

195
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:25,259
automatically for me it's rather simple

196
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:27,720
even if I had a couple fig trees

197
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:30,120
I would still probably hook them up to

198
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,060
drip irrigation they go through this

199
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:35,639
tube here it automatically turns on and

200
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,919
then they're every single tree has an

201
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:41,280
emitter in the soil they're called spot

202
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,780
spitters and you can get those products

203
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,199
at uh

204
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:48,180
drip Depot is probably a good company uh

205
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:50,580
drip works I think is another one that I

206
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:53,220
recommend and they all have roughly the

207
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:55,800
same Parts same prices

208
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:57,840
and you can't go wrong uh what you want

209
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,840
to do is give your fig tree water

210
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:04,199
especially during the growing season

211
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:07,680
about a half gallon of water roughly

212
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:09,680
every day you can start off with a

213
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,400
fourth of a gallon

214
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,259
especially when the temperatures are

215
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,819
warm guys they need more more and more

216
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:16,740
water earlier in the season when it's

217
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:18,599
cooler and there's not a ton of leaves

218
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,919
on these trees just yet you don't have

219
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:22,500
to go crazy

220
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:24,840
but as the season goes on as it's 90

221
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:27,479
degrees out here today you got to give

222
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,319
these trees roughly a half gallon of

223
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:30,900
water

224
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,539
per five gallons of soil

225
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:36,060
now if you have a larger container

226
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:37,860
with more leaves bigger tree you may

227
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:40,260
have to expand that but start off with

228
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:42,240
roughly a fourth of a gallon

229
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:45,120
then go to a half gallon then maybe go

230
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,620
to a gallon and just from there you'll

231
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,500
have enough water to keep your tree

232
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:51,779
happy and healthy and that's roughly it

233
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,459
one of the most important things though

234
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:56,760
I'll mention

235
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:58,800
when it comes to Growing fig trees in

236
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,560
containers is the soil

237
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,200
because you could water your tree

238
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,360
actually too much especially when

239
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,720
they're young and that will lead to root

240
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,279
rot figs are very prone to root rot

241
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,440
and so what I like to do is actually get

242
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,300
myself a nice compost mix you can get

243
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,640
Pro mix by the way that's an easy one

244
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:21,120
just go to the store and get pro-mix

245
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:23,100
already mixed for you it's peat moss and

246
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,560
perlite a little bit of mycorrhizae in

247
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,720
there you're going to be set otherwise

248
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,279
get yourself some kind of compost blend

249
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,560
that's organic

250
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,660
that's a potting soil or a soil

251
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:37,800
conditioner typically you can add things

252
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:40,080
like bark vermiculite perlite rice holes

253
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,060
different materials like that because we

254
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,800
want to have somewhat of a well-draining

255
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,120
mix in containers we don't want to have

256
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,240
something real heavy we don't want to go

257
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:51,540
to our yards and just dig up our native

258
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,100
soil and put it in a container that can

259
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,440
sometimes be too heavy especially if

260
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:58,500
we're growing in a lot of clay

261
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,720
worm castings could be good compost that

262
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:03,899
you make can be good all these things

263
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,240
really help the drainage and the air in

264
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:09,839
our soil if we have good air we have

265
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,519
healthy soil and then healthy Roots so

266
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,220
that's really the key that's the main

267
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,779
things other than that just make sure

268
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,740
they're getting as much sunlight as

269
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:19,200
possible

270
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:21,360
the more the better and I would also

271
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,360
recommend especially early in the season

272
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,060
give them more warmth put them somewhere

273
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,339
like on your patio that has a lot of

274
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:32,519
radiating heat maybe it near your house

275
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:33,420
maybe near a structure maybe just some

276
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:35,760
way

277
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:38,940
near big boulders or something just some

278
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:42,000
way to warm up that soil and keep it

279
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:44,579
warm for as long as possible

280
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,279
the last thing I'll mention I for I

281
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:49,500
almost forgot about this is Mulch and so

282
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:53,339
wood chips are a great idea

283
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:55,200
to add to any Tree on top of the soil

284
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:56,160
I have wood chips virtually on every

285
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,100
tree

286
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:02,459
and I do this religiously in the ground

287
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:04,620
but also now in container fig trees as

288
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:07,140
well and this will just keep regulate

289
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,700
the soil moisture and also regulate the

290
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:11,399
soil temperature

291
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:13,220
especially in places like Arizona

292
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:16,740
West Texas

293
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:19,700
Southern California it can be very hot

294
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:22,980
we're in the South like Florida Georgia

295
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:25,260
it can be too warm believe it or not to

296
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,880
grow fig trees in containers so we want

297
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:29,339
to put that Mulch on top and that's

298
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,140
going to help really regulate that soil

299
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:33,180
and we're going to be Off to the Races

300
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,860
your trees are going to do great if you
