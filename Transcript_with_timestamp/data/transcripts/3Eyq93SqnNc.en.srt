1
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:35,820
all right thank you for the introduction

2
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:38,220
as he said I'm Cody and I'm an adjunct

3
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:41,460
at SDSU which which means they kind of

4
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,930
like me and I kind of like them but they

5
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,960
don't actually pay me it's the Dakota

6
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:56,670
Lakes research farm that pays me how are

7
00:00:45,960 --> 00:01:00,540
we doing at the microphone we need to we

8
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:08,340
okay now a little better okay thank you

9
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:15,350
Sarah do I need to move this around

10
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:15,350
maybe or maybe get this out of here

11
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:29,640
maybe we'll work a little better outside

12
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:31,409
okay so I consulted the Dakota Lakes

13
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,080
research farm I have for the past

14
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:38,220
several years now and it's been a

15
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:40,800
fantastic experience for me I wanted to

16
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:44,550
start things today just by recognizing

17
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:48,830
my grandfather who passed away this past

18
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:51,210
year he when he was 14 years old his dad

19
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:53,820
gave him the choice of buying some cows

20
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,100
and raising cows or he could go to high

21
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,210
school and he chose to to stay on the

22
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,550
ranch and raise cattle

23
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,550
and because of his hard work throughout

24
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:04,380
his life and his generosity his kids and

25
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:06,540
his grandkids like myself didn't have to

26
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,789
make that choice between the cattle and

27
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,769
going to college and so I just want to

28
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:12,599
wanted to say thank you grandpa and you

29
00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:14,879
know he's one of the many reasons why

30
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:16,860
I'm able to stand here today with with

31
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:21,720
education and with the background on the

32
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:23,760
ranch that I've got the impossible

33
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:27,090
burger you guys probably have heard of

34
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:30,480
this it's a it's a veggie it's one of

35
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:32,129
the latest veggie burgers right and when

36
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,349
you look at the picture the the whopper

37
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:36,150
on the left and the impossible burger on

38
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:37,590
the right they don't look a whole lot

39
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,630
different you know when they're

40
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,220
presented this way and I'm not here to

41
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,650
talk about whether it's a good idea it's

42
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:45,909
a bad

43
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:47,920
or good things or bad things about it my

44
00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:50,049
interest in it is something else and and

45
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,909
there's the question of why will people

46
00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:54,549
buy it and what does that mean for

47
00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:57,700
people who might be raising livestock or

48
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:59,379
raising beef in particular and number

49
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,450
one on this list I've got up there is to

50
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:03,970
save the earth if you look at the

51
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:05,920
website from the the company that

52
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,569
produces the burger they're very

53
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,129
straightforward about saying that's why

54
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:10,930
they're doing this because they believe

55
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:13,420
their product is better for the earth

56
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:17,049
they're saving the earth if we're eating

57
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:20,409
the impossible burger rather than animal

58
00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:22,269
products in our burger and like I said

59
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:23,590
I'm not going to go into what those

60
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:25,510
claims and whether they're they're

61
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,920
correct or they're not correct I wanted

62
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:28,750
to focus a little more on the other two

63
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,629
points the number two I've got there is

64
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,720
taste and then I've got the price you

65
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:36,700
know research has shown that people who

66
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,739
grow up eating grass fed beef prefer it

67
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,150
to grain fed and vice versa you grow up

68
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:42,609
with one thing you tend to like it

69
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,569
better and it's in my head I wonder if

70
00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:44,920
you know people who grew up eating

71
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:49,030
veggie burgers might actually prefer

72
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:50,199
that to the to a regular beef burger in

73
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,549
any case there are a lot of people who

74
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:55,000
do eat it there are people who like it

75
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:56,260
and so it's it's out there people are

76
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,859
eating it people are going to enjoy it

77
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:01,449
right and finally and not not not that

78
00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:04,120
everyone will but some certainly will

79
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:06,430
and then finally price if I understand

80
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,569
right right now the price is probably a

81
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:10,989
little bit higher than your regular

82
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:13,209
burger but this is a this is made in a

83
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:15,579
lab it's an industrial process and I

84
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:17,430
assume that they will get better attic

85
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:19,690
this is a pretty new product right

86
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,760
chances are they're gonna get better at

87
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:23,650
simulating the flavor of beef and the

88
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,150
eating experience of beef and they'll

89
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:28,810
probably get be able to do it cheaper

90
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:31,270
too and so what happens if they do get

91
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:33,849
that price point down to being the same

92
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:36,070
as a beef burger or less and they get

93
00:04:33,849 --> 00:04:37,539
the taste to be pretty close what

94
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:42,610
happens in what are people going to eat

95
00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:44,110
well I suspect we'll see a lot of a lot

96
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,520
of people choosing the burger right and

97
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:47,830
it might not be one or the other might

98
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,310
eat some one and some some beef and some

99
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:53,980
of the the veggie burger and right now

100
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:55,600
keep in mind less than 2% of the

101
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:57,910
our population in the States now they

102
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,950
say is involved directly involved in

103
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:02,530
agriculture so most people most people

104
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:03,670
are eating don't have a real clear

105
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:06,670
understanding of where their food is

106
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:08,980
coming from and the main choice that

107
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:10,960
they've got is something kind of like

108
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:12,580
this you know most of the beef is coming

109
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,070
through our conventional methods which

110
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,750
includes a feedlot and then we've got

111
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:20,260
you know the impossible burger on the

112
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:22,090
lab on the other side and when people

113
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,320
are presented with this choice some will

114
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:25,000
choose one some will choose the other

115
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,070
right that's that's the way it's going

116
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,260
to be but those don't have to be the

117
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:31,930
only two choices and that's what I'm

118
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:34,270
suggesting is another way that we may

119
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:36,100
produce some of our beef and I think

120
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:37,900
when the consumers are presented with

121
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:43,570
this choice that we'll get some more

122
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:45,240
people choosing to to eat beef and I'm I

123
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:48,760
want to put out there the idea of this

124
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:50,650
artisanal beef and I've got under there

125
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:53,850
wine coffee tea and chocolate those are

126
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:56,830
products that where this idea is already

127
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:58,510
is is already out there and I in the

128
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:00,190
back near the coffee there's a little

129
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:02,950
table set up there's a bottle of wine

130
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:04,840
and a box of tea back there I encourage

131
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:07,510
you to go back there read the labels on

132
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,580
those products because when you read

133
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:11,020
those labels you you find out all kinds

134
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,450
of information about how they were

135
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:15,070
produced what the soil was like and

136
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:18,310
maybe what the weather was like what the

137
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:20,050
guys name was who ran the vineyard what

138
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:22,060
this product is gonna taste like and you

139
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:24,130
get all this information before you even

140
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:26,890
you know open the bottle or the package

141
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:29,290
and I wrote there's some pieces of paper

142
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:31,000
there too I wrote up some examples of

143
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:35,950
what that might look like for beef in

144
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,960
central South Dakota and and I just the

145
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:39,880
idea the main idea is this sentence I've

146
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,560
got here down at the bottom tell people

147
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,740
how we care for the land and the animals

148
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,480
because if we're doing a good job of it

149
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,950
caring for the land of the animals we

150
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,560
want to communicate that message to

151
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:52,420
other people and chances are we can be

152
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,340
rewarded for it in the marketplace and I

153
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:56,170
think we can get a better price for the

154
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:57,400
products that were that we're producing

155
00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:00,430
because there are a lot of people in

156
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:02,710
this world who are buying food who care

157
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:05,350
about how it was produced and they care

158
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:07,720
about how we how we took care of things

159
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:10,110
and I think that along with this there's

160
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,790
the opportunity to develop some terroir

161
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:16,810
for South Dakota beef this is a fancy

162
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:20,200
word usually you see it with in relation

163
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:22,210
to wine and the idea is that the

164
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:26,110
particular environment where those

165
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:28,240
grapes were grown impacts the quality or

166
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:30,370
in the taste the particulars later of

167
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,650
the wine and right now we think of beef

168
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:35,260
mostly as a commodity where it's all the

169
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:37,870
same but I think there's a lot of

170
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:40,150
opportunity to develop particular you

171
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:46,030
know tastes or flavors or terroirs of

172
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:48,580
beef and market it that way so today I'm

173
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:51,580
gonna I'm kind of gonna talk about

174
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:53,320
several different ideas and I'm hoping

175
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:55,510
that in at the end they'll all come

176
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,310
together and it'll make sense why why I

177
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:58,630
jump around a little bit in it we'll

178
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,310
have this constellation that comes

179
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:04,630
together that was the marketing part Kay

180
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:07,780
now integrating livestock with crops why

181
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:10,900
in the world would we do that because as

182
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:13,060
you guys know having livestock around is

183
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,590
a lot extra work they can be a real pain

184
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:17,050
in the butt especially if you're trying

185
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:20,680
to calves you know during the middle of

186
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:24,070
a snowstorm and so why would we do that

187
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:26,710
well some of the reasons on the left

188
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:28,450
that I've got some of your standard

189
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:31,300
crops on the right I've got some forage

190
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:34,419
and perennial crops if you want if you

191
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:36,010
integrate livestock in your operation it

192
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:37,870
gives you a lot of it gives you some

193
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:41,410
opportunities for Biological and

194
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:43,450
economic diversity so you could these

195
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:45,010
forage crops I've got on the right you

196
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:47,980
could grow those even if you don't have

197
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:49,540
livestock but the livestock if you grow

198
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:51,070
them and you have livestock now you've

199
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:53,080
got an opportunity to harvest them and

200
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:54,430
make some money at at the same time so

201
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,190
if you believe that you need more

202
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:58,930
diversity in your rotations if you want

203
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:01,570
to put more you know you want to grow a

204
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:04,090
cover crop after the wheat that you had

205
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:05,350
after you harvest your wheat and you

206
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,880
want to make some money on it at the

207
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:09,100
same time and not just put all of it

208
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,690
back into the soil that's where the

209
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,090
livestock come in and you can you can

210
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:15,460
make some money on it and because if

211
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:17,459
you're if you're just growing these for

212
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:19,290
for hay and you cut the hay and

213
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:22,679
you sell it to your neighbor or to

214
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:24,660
wherever your export you just lost the

215
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:26,339
benefit that you had most of the benefit

216
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,019
you had from from growing that crop

217
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:30,119
because you didn't keep the nutrients in

218
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:32,999
the biomass the organic matter right

219
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:35,279
there on your farm so you get the

220
00:09:32,999 --> 00:09:36,660
opportunity for diversity and a couple

221
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,309
of these things here I have down to the

222
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,860
bottom alfalfa and switchgrass those are

223
00:09:38,309 --> 00:09:42,600
both perennials you have the opportunity

224
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:45,600
now to put some perennials in the

225
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:48,749
rotation and make good use of them why

226
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,490
would we want to do that well this is an

227
00:09:48,749 --> 00:09:52,350
amazing picture this is a big bluestem

228
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:54,029
plant you can see we're just a little

229
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:57,360
bit of green up on top and look at that

230
00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:59,759
massive root system below it this is why

231
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,429
we'd like to have perennials in our

232
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:04,800
rotation for those massive root systems

233
00:10:02,429 --> 00:10:08,819
that's one of the big reasons anyway and

234
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:11,670
in full disclosure these these plants

235
00:10:08,819 --> 00:10:13,470
were grown in special containers you

236
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:14,910
know that allowed them to get nice deep

237
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:16,290
roots and then they can harvest them and

238
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:20,639
wash the roots out and make a nice

239
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:21,990
picture so there is that but they didn't

240
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:23,790
just go out into the field and dig them

241
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,799
up but you know these perennial grasses

242
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,149
like these these warm season native

243
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:29,279
perennial grasses like big blue stem

244
00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:31,139
switch grass they can have roots that go

245
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:35,970
well beyond six feet under the right

246
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:38,999
conditions and so you know compare that

247
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:41,160
to our our annual crops which have much

248
00:10:38,999 --> 00:10:43,259
shallower root systems typically but

249
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:47,129
even if they do get their roots way down

250
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:48,809
deep like say a corn plant it that corn

251
00:10:47,129 --> 00:10:51,360
plants starting over every year so those

252
00:10:48,809 --> 00:10:53,819
roots even if they do reach a pretty

253
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,309
good depth there's very little of the

254
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:58,379
growing season that they actually get

255
00:10:56,309 --> 00:11:00,839
down to that depth whereas the perennial

256
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:04,079
has those roots down there all the time

257
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:05,249
once they get established so what are

258
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:09,600
some of the advantage of these deep

259
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:11,670
roots well nutrients going up so those

260
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,910
deep roots are extracting nutrients from

261
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:16,170
lower down in the sope soil profile

262
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:20,129
nutrients that your annual crop can't

263
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:21,779
get to and they draw those nutrients

264
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:25,649
back up incorporate them into their

265
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:28,019
bodies so so now after that perennial

266
00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:29,519
has been there what your annual crops

267
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:30,600
are going to be able to access some of

268
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:30,850
those nutrients that have been brought

269
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,630
back

270
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:37,300
to the near the nearer the soil surface

271
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:39,430
wine being one of those examples another

272
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:41,230
reason to have those deep roots is

273
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:43,509
bringing the water table down that's

274
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:45,370
something that people are probably more

275
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:48,160
interested in now than they were five

276
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:50,709
years ago with you know those deep roots

277
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,509
there they're gonna be able to access a

278
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:59,649
lot of that water that's your annual

279
00:11:52,509 --> 00:12:01,029
crops can't get to so now going

280
00:11:59,649 --> 00:12:03,130
transitioning a little bit from the

281
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:06,310
ideas to what we're actually doing at

282
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:11,259
Dakota Lakes native tallgrass plantings

283
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:14,170
and we can point to an example of where

284
00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:15,670
some of this idea came from in Argentina

285
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:18,250
there used to be a traditional practice

286
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:20,920
of having seven years of crop an annual

287
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:22,899
crop followed by seven years of a

288
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:26,470
pasture and so these pastures typically

289
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:28,089
would be a grass legume mixture and and

290
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:29,500
so they go back and forth and that's one

291
00:12:28,089 --> 00:12:32,230
way they would maintain some of the

292
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:34,389
fertility of the soil at Dakota Lakes

293
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:36,130
we're trying something it's a bit

294
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:38,139
similar except we've got 15 years of

295
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:40,959
crop followed by five years of perennial

296
00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:42,639
pasture now we just started this and so

297
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:46,329
I can't say that these are the magic

298
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:48,490
numbers that it's 15 and 5 right but we

299
00:12:46,329 --> 00:12:50,889
believe that this is going to really

300
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:54,279
benefit the soils that we have in this

301
00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:56,199
rotation during those 15 years of

302
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:57,759
cropping we still have a crop rotation

303
00:12:56,199 --> 00:12:59,769
where so as you can see here we're gonna

304
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:02,079
go from winter wheat to corn or sorghum

305
00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:04,540
and a cool season broadly so we do that

306
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:10,300
for 15 years and then we transition into

307
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:12,069
the perennial now this is so this is a

308
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:14,290
picture of our switchgrass so the

309
00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:15,850
perennial that we've used so far this

310
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:17,769
first time around has been switchgrass

311
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:20,500
it's for the most part it's a

312
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:23,170
monoculture of switchgrass half of it

313
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:25,480
half of the field we designated for seed

314
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:28,329
production this year and harvested seed

315
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:31,329
off of it the other half we grazed and

316
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:33,819
we've grazed that for two or three years

317
00:13:31,329 --> 00:13:37,420
now you can see the cattle out here in

318
00:13:33,819 --> 00:13:38,980
July advantage by grazing of course is

319
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:42,930
that the nutrients are going back to the

320
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:42,930
soil in the organic matter

321
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,630
now one of the challenges with putting

322
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:52,060
that perennial in and only having five

323
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:53,920
years of of having that perennial in and

324
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:57,010
remember our objective of putting it

325
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,840
there is to benefit our soil now when

326
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:00,790
you start a perennial like a switchgrass

327
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,530
or something that first year a lot of

328
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:04,180
times they only get about yay big even

329
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:05,560
if you've got you know good conditions

330
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:08,380
and you're good a good stand you might

331
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:10,120
not get much growth second year they're

332
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:12,130
getting bigger but they're still not at

333
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,710
say maximum capacity

334
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:17,980
so there's establishment year down

335
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:20,530
second year we're doing okay but now

336
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:22,480
we've got two years gone by and we

337
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:25,270
haven't done anything for our soil yet

338
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,470
in fact because of the low productivity

339
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:29,140
in the first year I wouldn't even be

340
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:30,970
surprised if we returned less biomass

341
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:33,940
than usual so that just leaves us over

342
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:37,660
three years to this five year of a

343
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:41,050
perennial to try to to really do a lot

344
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:42,910
of good stuff for the soil and we're

345
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:45,550
choosing we chose switchgrass it's it's

346
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:48,190
a high biomass crop and it also has a

347
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:49,720
high carbon to nitrogen ratio so idea

348
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:51,610
there being that we're gonna put a lot

349
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,830
of carbon back into the soil to build up

350
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:56,260
that soil organic matter but we only got

351
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:58,720
three years to do it so something Dwayne

352
00:14:56,260 --> 00:15:01,450
and I have talked about and we've tried

353
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,090
out is try to accelerate that at that

354
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:05,380
establishment process a little bit by

355
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:08,590
planting the switchgrass

356
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:12,190
in a year when we still have a grain

357
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:16,030
crop there so what we did last year was

358
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:17,830
we we planted two rows of wheat and then

359
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:21,130
a row of switchgrass two rows a wheat

360
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:23,290
and a row of switchgrass we also tried

361
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:25,690
putting the wheat and the switchgrass

362
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:27,850
together in the drill and planting them

363
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:30,400
all at once and then the other thing we

364
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:32,380
did we planted the wheat and then we

365
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,240
came back later and planted the

366
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:36,400
switchgrass overtop after the weed had

367
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,590
already come up and that last treatment

368
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,930
it appears that we we did damage our

369
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:43,600
wheat yields with that all three

370
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:45,160
treatments I went out there and counted

371
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,010
switchgrass plants which was rather

372
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:50,980
tricky because they're they're pretty

373
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:53,350
little but it looks to me like we

374
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:55,060
probably got a pretty good amount of

375
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:56,470
switchgrass out there in all of those

376
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:58,480
cases

377
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:01,240
not to say that you might not have to

378
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:04,270
come back and receive some but this this

379
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,620
coming well this growing year now when

380
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,970
things start greening up again I'll be

381
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:08,950
going back out and checking on

382
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:09,510
winterkill and that to see if the

383
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:11,560
switchgrass

384
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:13,690
survived because it you know we didn't

385
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:19,060
get very big especially being there

386
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:21,550
under that wheat canopy this is a

387
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:22,810
picture of a mixture of switchgrass and

388
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:26,530
big bluestem

389
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:28,990
this is on some heavy clay soils and a

390
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:32,200
pretty shallow soils heavy clay and this

391
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:33,670
picture was actually taken in 2018 which

392
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,200
was wet and a lot of parts of South

393
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:38,110
Dakota but it Dakota Lakes it was

394
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:40,810
extremely dry and it was just amazed me

395
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:43,660
how much productivity we got out of

396
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:45,880
these native warm-season grasses even in

397
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:48,910
a drought a year like that and this

398
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:51,790
picture was taken in July end of July

399
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:54,040
and it's it's headed out here and so is

400
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:57,580
in terms of quality I mean you can see

401
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:59,260
the cattle are here grazing this is not

402
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:01,380
great quality at this point it would be

403
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:05,050
better to graze it earlier in the year

404
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:06,730
but you know also depending on your

405
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:09,970
objectives if your objectives is to

406
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:11,680
return a lot of biomass to the soil it

407
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:15,280
can still meet that objective even if

408
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:18,340
the quality's low and so right next to

409
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,830
that we had some degraded rangeland and

410
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:23,320
I say degraded you know it didn't

411
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:25,210
include these warm season grasses there

412
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:27,790
were some native grasses some exotic

413
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:30,040
grasses and I just went out there and I

414
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:32,320
took some samples to check on the

415
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:35,320
productivity 3,600 pounds of

416
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:38,080
productivity at the on the native range

417
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,550
and about double that where we had

418
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,710
planted the switchgrass and the big

419
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:43,810
bluestem just amazing what they could do

420
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:46,900
now in terms of quality from a new

421
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:49,960
animal nutrition perspective the the

422
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:52,330
neither one of these is very good but

423
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:55,120
the the switchgrass and big bluestem was

424
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:58,450
was very poor quality but a key factor

425
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,980
here is this is taken on July 26th so we

426
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:02,440
wouldn't expect it to be very good that

427
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:04,990
time of year

428
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:08,380
another thing I like to do on the farm

429
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:10,270
we've got I want a lot of the field

430
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,830
margins we have switchgrass planted and

431
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:15,070
so you know we've got the field over

432
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:16,780
here switchgrass over here and in this

433
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:18,400
particular case we've got smooth broham

434
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:20,860
growing back here you can see it's it's

435
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:24,010
brown and it's headed out the date here

436
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:26,080
is July 8th of this past year and I'll

437
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:27,760
go a lot of times to these areas on the

438
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,250
farm and try to make a fenceline

439
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,620
comparison you know side-by-side because

440
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,730
a smooth brown that you know that's

441
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:36,610
something we have in a lot of our

442
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:39,160
pastures and if you've got cattle you

443
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:41,200
know you know it's really good forage

444
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:43,630
early in the year cattle love it it's

445
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,250
high-quality but what happens as you get

446
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:48,310
in you know towards the end of June into

447
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:49,660
July you know it gets mature same thing

448
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:51,940
with crested wheat grass you know

449
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:54,130
they're great early in the year but we

450
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:56,230
don't have enough cows to graze all that

451
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:58,780
lush green grass we have early in the

452
00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:03,820
year we get into summer and then it's

453
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:06,880
not much good anymore so on this date on

454
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:08,080
July 8th when I took these samples one

455
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,940
either side of the fence

456
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:13,900
the switchgrass was three and a half

457
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:15,730
percent higher in crude protein than the

458
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:18,460
the smooth Brown was so that's that's a

459
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:20,200
big advantage now typically you would

460
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:22,330
think smooth bromes a better quality but

461
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,640
again it all has to do with the date

462
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:27,010
because at this time the the smooth

463
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,930
Brome was already mature this and the

464
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:31,990
switchgrass is kind of just getting

465
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:34,360
going in June and here in early July

466
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:36,610
it's still high quality so we've got

467
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:39,520
some good good quality for the cattle to

468
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:41,110
graze that time of year I made a similar

469
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,880
comparison for the past several years

470
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:45,520
I've made a similar comparison in the

471
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,400
ditches by Dakota Lakes switchgrass and

472
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:51,010
big bluestem on one side smooth Brahm on

473
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,480
the other side this year I actually

474
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:55,930
didn't find very much difference in

475
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:58,780
quality again this was in early July but

476
00:19:55,930 --> 00:20:00,700
in past years I usually find in early

477
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,140
July the switchgrass and and big

478
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:05,680
bluestem are a little better than the

479
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:08,620
smooth bromb but in all these years I

480
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:10,870
find I will find that the we're getting

481
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:12,370
more productivity out of the big blue

482
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:15,010
stem and switchgrass than the smooth

483
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:15,920
bromb and that's you know in early July

484
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:18,860
that's the case

485
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:21,260
but they're not done growing if I waited

486
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:23,540
until later there'd be an even bigger

487
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:24,980
gap in terms of productivity for getting

488
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:28,600
more productivity from those tall

489
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:28,600
grasses rather than smooth broma

490
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:35,000
okay so now transitioning those are some

491
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:38,200
more of the planted stuff now

492
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,270
transitioning to a pasture situation

493
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,830
three years will ago Dakota Lakes rented

494
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:46,060
the pasture that's right across the road

495
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:48,730
from the farm and this pasture had been

496
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:51,800
continuously grazed for a long time and

497
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:54,650
mostly dominated by exotic cool season

498
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:57,410
grasses like crested wheat grass and

499
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:59,300
smooth bromb some we have some

500
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:04,030
cheatgrass and some Kentucky bluegrass

501
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:07,180
out there too and so we wanted to

502
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:11,510
transition it from that into more of a

503
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:13,700
more of a native dominated pastures so

504
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:17,060
specifically looking at putting things

505
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:18,800
in like the big bluestem and so in order

506
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:20,480
to do that we were tried a lot of

507
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:23,240
different strategies so we set up

508
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,970
experiment where we we sprayed out with

509
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:29,060
glyphosate so going north south we'd

510
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:32,960
sprayed with glyphosate or atrazine or

511
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:35,630
both or no spray at all and in this

512
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,100
picture you can probably you can make it

513
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:40,030
out I think that you know there's a

514
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:42,860
brown strip here and a green strip here

515
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:45,140
brown strip you know so you can tell

516
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:49,190
where those strips are so we sprayed out

517
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:52,190
and then and and I don't I don't I don't

518
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:53,690
want to advocate spraying good going out

519
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:56,390
and just killing everything in native

520
00:21:53,690 --> 00:22:00,290
range land that's I have to give that

521
00:21:56,390 --> 00:22:02,150
disclaimer because this I as a rangeland

522
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:04,790
guy I definitely don't want to suggest

523
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:07,310
that this is a case where we pretty much

524
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:09,110
had exotic species and I think a lot of

525
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:10,880
this land where we did it may have been

526
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:13,280
go back land it was probably farmed at

527
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,020
one time so mostly there wasn't a whole

528
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:18,350
lot of native that was that was left

529
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:20,660
there to spray but so we've got the

530
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:23,720
spray treatments going north south and

531
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:25,490
then we seeded going east west so what

532
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,800
we end up with is a big checkerboard of

533
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:29,020
treatments we did a mixture of grass is

534
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,850
mostly big bluestem

535
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:32,530
and then we did that also with some

536
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:34,600
forbs or some broad Leafs and then we

537
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:37,420
did areas where we didn't seed anything

538
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:40,150
and after and those first two years were

539
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:43,090
just bone dry at Dakota Lakes 17 and 18

540
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:46,420
and we saw very little results from that

541
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:48,760
but this past year we finally got to see

542
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:51,280
some of those grasses coming that we had

543
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:55,000
planted and what it looks like now is

544
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:57,160
that you know after three years where

545
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,870
the story's not over but so far what I

546
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:01,930
can tell you is that where we sprayed

547
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:04,570
glyphosate and where we drilled we had

548
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:07,030
fairly good success at getting some

549
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:10,860
noose grasses established there but if

550
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:12,970
we only drilled or if we only sprayed

551
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:18,040
neither one of those treatments really

552
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:19,720
worked and we did do one other thing one

553
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:21,760
other change in management besides the

554
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,410
spraying and the seeding and that's the

555
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,660
grazing so rather than the continuous

556
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:28,090
season-long grazing we've been moving

557
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:30,130
moving the cows in this particular

558
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:32,500
pasture sometimes more than once a day

559
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:34,660
in other cases you know maybe a day or

560
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:36,910
two and we don't do that all year long

561
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:39,610
we don't do that all the time but eat

562
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:41,260
with this this rapid grazing even that

563
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:43,660
was not enough to you know to bring

564
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:45,550
those species back on their own over

565
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:48,610
three years so there's kind of a lot of

566
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:50,740
caveats there I don't want to say it can

567
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:53,590
never happen but I think that this this

568
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:55,750
particular land where we were working we

569
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:58,090
didn't really have big bluestem there to

570
00:23:55,750 --> 00:24:00,070
begin with - I don't know that if we

571
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:03,580
even had a seed bank left - for it to

572
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:08,290
come back on its own and one exception

573
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:12,220
to the rule of having to spray and drill

574
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:14,470
both is that we there were some areas in

575
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:18,010
the swales you know some wet areas if

576
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:19,840
you follow along these where the lower

577
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:22,120
places in the in the landscape where

578
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,830
it's wet some big bluestem that we

579
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:27,870
planted did come up there

580
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:27,870
even without herbicide in those spots

581
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:34,180
and what's circled there you probably

582
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:37,780
can't really make it out very well but

583
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:39,670
that is a big bluestem plant that's not

584
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:41,830
very big you know it's only about this

585
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:43,360
big and if there's a lot of that out in

586
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:44,710
this pasture and so I

587
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,660
think that over the next year or two

588
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:48,490
we're gonna see a lot more but the

589
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:50,470
chances are you know if we continue to

590
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:52,540
get a little bit of rain chances are

591
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:56,200
this is project is gonna look more and

592
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:57,670
more successful as time goes on three

593
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,679
years really isn't enough to judge it

594
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:01,390
and this picture is in here just to

595
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:03,040
basically show that there's a lot of

596
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:05,890
diversity out there in this pasture

597
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:11,920
which as an ecologist that's something

598
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:13,720
we always like diversity ok similar

599
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:16,510
issue but a little bit different site

600
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:19,000
now Dakota Lakes just this past year got

601
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:21,910
a lease on the land between the farm and

602
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,309
the river and so this is was the core

603
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:26,530
land now the game fish and parks has it

604
00:25:24,309 --> 00:25:28,540
and there's a little spot there that's

605
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:29,950
just beautiful it's full of Indian grass

606
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:32,740
which is one of our native warm-season

607
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:34,780
grasses and Maximillian sunflower you

608
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:36,520
can see them here but this is the real

609
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:38,830
exception to the rule most of this land

610
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:41,169
is just like that pasture dominated by

611
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:45,309
the exotic grasses that we wish we

612
00:25:41,169 --> 00:25:46,960
didn't have so much of it and I I loved

613
00:25:45,309 --> 00:25:49,630
this picture because I took it on

614
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,270
October 3rd and most of the landscape is

615
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:54,160
brown and and you know there's no

616
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:56,410
flowers to be seen but this Maximillian

617
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:58,090
sunflower if you're interested in you

618
00:25:56,410 --> 00:26:00,429
know wildlife and pollinators where else

619
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:05,710
are you going to find flowers like this

620
00:26:00,429 --> 00:26:07,210
in October so one of the things we're

621
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:09,040
doing there we're trying to get those

622
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:11,950
grasses back and we're doing the rapid

623
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:14,350
grazing thing again and what we do what

624
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:16,780
we're focusing our grazing early in the

625
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:18,850
year in the spring because these are

626
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:21,610
those cool season grasses we're trying

627
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:23,320
to hurt them right and tip the scales in

628
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:26,110
favor of the warm season grasses that we

629
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:28,360
planted so we grazed this several times

630
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:30,340
really early in the year and the other

631
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:34,600
thing we did is we broadcast some seed

632
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:36,730
out there and then we just just did that

633
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:39,220
we also broadcast seed and rolled with

634
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:41,890
some bales out over top and then we also

635
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:43,390
drilled some spots and so you know this

636
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:45,250
is what it looks like in May or after

637
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:49,540
right after we've rolled the bale out

638
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:53,110
there here is in July there's still a

639
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:54,669
lot of it visible and and even into

640
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:57,340
September a lot of that bales still

641
00:26:54,669 --> 00:27:00,490
visible in some places it was on

642
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:03,310
pretty thick and so to this point we

643
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:05,380
don't have many of those species that we

644
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:06,850
planted if not many of them have come up

645
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:09,040
I you know I looked around and I did

646
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:11,260
find a few plants you might even have a

647
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:13,750
picture yeah I'm holding one there you

648
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:17,140
can't really tell but there are a few

649
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:19,120
out there but Isis I'm hoping that a lot

650
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:21,130
of those seeds are still viable and as

651
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,620
the bail breaks down maybe we'll get

652
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:26,860
more of it out there and those bales we

653
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:28,720
used bales of mature switchgrass and big

654
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:34,900
bluestem so there was a lot of seed in

655
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:37,990
them as well okay now I'm gonna

656
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:40,510
transition to front front while all

657
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:43,270
those perennials to the lives the

658
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:46,150
cropping side of things but being an

659
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:47,440
ecologist even when I transition to the

660
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:49,990
cropping side of things I start you out

661
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,840
with a slide with bison and grass on it

662
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:55,210
right because because if I'm gonna talk

663
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:58,420
about a cropping system and trying to to

664
00:27:55,210 --> 00:28:00,310
design it for wherever your farm happens

665
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:01,600
to be I think the FIR the place you need

666
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:03,520
to start is think about how mother

667
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:06,370
nature did things there and learn

668
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,930
lessons from her right and so you know

669
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:09,490
this is a picture that could be taken in

670
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:11,980
a lot of places in South Dakota we've

671
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:14,320
got grass and bison and so you've got a

672
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:16,360
diversity of plant species in this

673
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,100
picture you've got some of them that are

674
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:20,140
green some are brown so some are

675
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:23,830
actively growing some are not we've got

676
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:25,780
an herbivore eating it this this and we

677
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:27,760
could imagine that there are they're not

678
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:29,440
in the picture but the antelope are just

679
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,240
over the hill and the rabbits are hiding

680
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,280
in the grass and the you know we've got

681
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:36,600
all lots of different we've got lots of

682
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:39,670
diversity both plants and animals and

683
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:41,050
this is what built up our soils right

684
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:45,190
this is what gave our soils fertility

685
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:47,890
and if we think about the flows of

686
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:49,960
nutrients here there wasn't there was

687
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:51,520
hardly any export right because the

688
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:54,190
animals eat stuff and they're not

689
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,840
shipping it across the ocean to another

690
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:59,980
country they're not we're not taking

691
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:03,940
stuff very far away and that's a that's

692
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:05,650
a real key factor and if we dive into a

693
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:08,050
little bit of the details of that if we

694
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:11,440
talk about nitrogen for instance there's

695
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:14,379
a lot of nitrogen in the atmosphere and

696
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,330
gets into the soil plants can take it up

697
00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:18,490
this is a picture of a lead plan which

698
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:21,129
is the legumes like enough alpha or P or

699
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:23,340
soybean you know it's gonna along with

700
00:29:21,129 --> 00:29:26,200
the bacteria it's gonna fix nitrogen

701
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:29,799
when that nitrogen or when that plant is

702
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:32,620
consumed by the animal in fact very

703
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:34,929
little of that nitrogen stays in the

704
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:36,730
animal almost all of it is going to

705
00:29:34,929 --> 00:29:40,990
leave the animal in feces in urine and

706
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:45,100
go back to the soil and if we look at

707
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:49,210
what those actual percentages are we've

708
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:51,759
got the the retained nitrogen and this

709
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:54,009
is on pounds per acre here so it's only

710
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:56,559
about a pound or two per acre retained

711
00:29:54,009 --> 00:29:57,519
and this you know to do to put numbers

712
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:59,860
to this sort of thing you have to make

713
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:03,490
some assumption so I said 10 hit 10

714
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:05,470
acres per head for six months and what's

715
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:08,470
the nitrogen that's retained well if you

716
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:10,120
have a growing animal nitrogen is a key

717
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:11,500
component of muscle right so that's

718
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,210
where most of that nitrogen is going to

719
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:15,190
end up so if you've got a you know a

720
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:17,740
stock or calf or something out there

721
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:19,539
that's growing that's that the nitrogen

722
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:22,120
is going to that if you've got a mature

723
00:30:19,539 --> 00:30:24,879
cow her she's not really changing much

724
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:26,559
in weight so she's not keeping a lot of

725
00:30:24,879 --> 00:30:28,840
the nitrogen but if she's got a calf at

726
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,639
her side and that calf is growing that

727
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:34,629
cat when that when you sell that calf

728
00:30:30,639 --> 00:30:36,909
you're taking nitrogen away right but

729
00:30:34,629 --> 00:30:38,980
it's not very much it's not very much

730
00:30:36,909 --> 00:30:41,409
nitrogen relative to what they ate most

731
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:44,409
of what they the nitrogen they eat stays

732
00:30:41,409 --> 00:30:47,500
in your field or pasture in the form of

733
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:50,250
urine and feces all right now suppose

734
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:54,669
you put that calf into a feedlot instead

735
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:56,289
well if we again we have to make some

736
00:30:54,669 --> 00:30:59,139
assumptions so what I said here is well

737
00:30:56,289 --> 00:31:02,049
suppose you had a 500 pound calf and you

738
00:30:59,139 --> 00:31:04,480
fed him to gain at a rate of 2.1 pounds

739
00:31:02,049 --> 00:31:07,360
per day now that's a pretty low gain for

740
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,919
a feedlot but but let's just so so

741
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,600
basically what I'm giving you is a kind

742
00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:12,970
of a baseline scenario kind of a

743
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:16,990
best-case scenario if you want to feed

744
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:20,320
that calf and you have no waste so again

745
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:22,809
that's not realistic right it's going to

746
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:25,110
take 56 pounds of nitrogen so you're

747
00:31:22,809 --> 00:31:27,059
going to take 56 pounds of nitrogen off

748
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:29,820
field and bring it over here to the

749
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:33,780
feedlot to feed the calf and that's

750
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:36,090
best-case scenario at the same time that

751
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:38,220
that and when I say you're taking it off

752
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:40,559
you know you're taking it off in the hay

753
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:42,990
or the grain or whatever you're feeding

754
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:46,620
that calf that's how much nitrogen you

755
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:48,559
need if you don't waste anything you're

756
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:51,030
also taking off a lot of phosphorus and

757
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:53,340
the nitrogen you can get back from the

758
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:54,780
atmosphere the phosphorus you're not

759
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:57,929
getting it back from the atmosphere it's

760
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:59,070
gone once you take it away and and then

761
00:31:57,929 --> 00:32:01,950
you're taking off a lot of organic

762
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:04,500
matter too now in contrast if you look

763
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:06,240
over here if you these are what the

764
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,799
numbers look like if rather than taking

765
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,150
it from the field and giving it to the

766
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:11,160
calf in the feedlot what if you took the

767
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:12,690
calf and you put him over here in the

768
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:14,730
field so everything he eats all the

769
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:18,360
manure and urine and everything is going

770
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:20,370
back onto the land well when he's after

771
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:23,429
six months that calf has grown and

772
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:24,720
that's why you're still taking away some

773
00:32:23,429 --> 00:32:26,760
of the nitrogen and some of the

774
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:30,480
phosphorus and some of the organic

775
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:32,760
matter but you're keeping a lot more on

776
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,919
your land and if we take a look if we

777
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:37,559
just subtract these numbers like 56

778
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:41,010
minus nine and six minus two I've got

779
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:43,140
that on this next slide what's the

780
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:44,520
difference well 47 pounds of nitrogen if

781
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:46,830
it cost 30 cents a pound

782
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:49,530
you know that's worth 14 dollars how

783
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:52,549
much is the phosphorus worth 340 and

784
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:57,720
this is elemental phosphorus not p2o5

785
00:32:52,549 --> 00:33:00,090
so you've got $17.50 roughly worth of

786
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:03,090
nutrients just in nitrogen of phosphorus

787
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:05,130
and then organic matter I know it's very

788
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:07,470
valuable but I didn't put a number there

789
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:09,600
because I know whatever price I put in

790
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:11,130
for it was going to be wrong so I don't

791
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:17,880
want us to forget about the value of the

792
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:19,650
organic matter so with that in mind then

793
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:22,919
that to me that presents the challenge

794
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:24,480
of that I've got stated up here how long

795
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:27,510
can we keep our animals and the

796
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,160
nutrients that they eat on the land so

797
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:32,780
to me that's that's the question that's

798
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:34,650
the challenge that we have to look at so

799
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:37,740
specifically what are we doing at Dakota

800
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:38,940
Lakes this is something that we're we're

801
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:41,220
just beginning to try

802
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:43,200
these are electronic feeding stalls and

803
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,830
they're actually designed to be used in

804
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,660
a dairy

805
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:47,640
if we flip around and look at them from

806
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:50,520
the back this is the end that the cow

807
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:52,920
would come in so she walks in there this

808
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:55,620
Green Deal reads an electronic ID that

809
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:57,330
she's got on her hanging from her neck

810
00:33:55,620 --> 00:34:00,780
and it says oh this is you know Cal

811
00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:03,420
number 326 and today she's gonna get her

812
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:05,040
Ashton of its a pound of corn and then a

813
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:08,430
pound of peas and a half a pound of

814
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:11,010
soybean meal and it's so it's tailored

815
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:12,570
specifically to this animal so if I've

816
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:14,190
got a sixteen hundred pound cow out

817
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:17,340
there and I've got an eleven hundred

818
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:19,290
pound cow out there there they can get

819
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:20,640
different amounts of supplement based on

820
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:23,730
their needs same thing if I'm trying to

821
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:26,400
fatten calves out on on field and and

822
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:27,450
pasture and I've got it you know a six

823
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,010
hundred pound calf and a nine hundred

824
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:30,840
pound calf with different nutrient

825
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:35,490
requirements they can get different

826
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:39,390
levels of supplement and the way we've

827
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:42,240
got three right up here there's one two

828
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:44,430
three of these little black things with

829
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,990
the yellow sticker on them that's that's

830
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:48,990
where the feed comes down so we can

831
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:50,970
actually provide three different kinds

832
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:55,980
of supplement in any combination that we

833
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:58,290
want any mixture that we want and we

834
00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:00,180
envision that these things will move

835
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:03,090
around field and pasture with the cows

836
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:06,990
and that's where this comes in Duane and

837
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:09,060
Jim Jim's our fabricator Jim's they've

838
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:11,130
been working on designs Jim has mounted

839
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:13,680
this solar panel on top of an irrigator

840
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:16,320
and so we envision that this will also

841
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:18,780
have shade on it it'll pull those

842
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:21,570
feeders around we may have the water a

843
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:23,220
point getting pulled around with it we

844
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:27,180
eventually maybe we can build other

845
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:31,200
things on like scales and fly control

846
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:32,760
things like this and if we can because

847
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,220
if we can move this around the pasture

848
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:38,160
we can get better grazing distribution

849
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:40,110
and we can get we can have that urine

850
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,390
and the manure spread out all over the

851
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:44,220
pasture all over the field rather than

852
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:47,450
having it all end up in the you know the

853
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:50,760
one spot where you set the feeders right

854
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:52,349
so with any with any luck we'll have

855
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:55,979
this operating

856
00:35:52,349 --> 00:35:58,460
time this summer now what have we been

857
00:35:55,979 --> 00:36:00,869
doing visiting to kind of run through a

858
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:04,829
year in the life of the cattle at Dakota

859
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:05,999
lakes here what kind of what are they

860
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,529
eating at different times of the year

861
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:09,690
and what what's the quality they're

862
00:36:07,529 --> 00:36:12,180
early in the year we start on those

863
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:13,950
exotic cool season pastures the crested

864
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:18,180
wheat grass and the smooth bromb they're

865
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:21,660
very very good that time of year and

866
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:23,549
then we as we get into June and July we

867
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:25,710
tend to we transition more to our tall

868
00:36:23,549 --> 00:36:28,559
grass our native tall grass species like

869
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:30,509
the switchgrass and this one in this

870
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:33,599
particular picture you can see we

871
00:36:30,509 --> 00:36:35,759
actually interceded some peas and it was

872
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:37,799
a kind of basically a cover crop mixture

873
00:36:35,759 --> 00:36:40,559
into the switchgrass they didn't

874
00:36:37,799 --> 00:36:42,749
actually graze this until early July but

875
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:44,819
I can tell you they they really enjoyed

876
00:36:42,749 --> 00:36:47,549
being out there with the combination of

877
00:36:44,819 --> 00:36:52,710
the tall grasses and those cover crops

878
00:36:47,549 --> 00:36:54,989
it was a good diet in this picture when

879
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:56,670
we are grazing the tall grasses we we

880
00:36:54,989 --> 00:36:58,380
prefer to move the fence pretty

881
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:59,549
frequently and you can definitely tell

882
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:03,299
in this picture where the fence was

883
00:36:59,549 --> 00:37:06,539
yesterday right right there and at this

884
00:37:03,299 --> 00:37:08,099
point it's July 30th the quality of this

885
00:37:06,539 --> 00:37:10,799
is quite low the crude protein is

886
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:13,469
getting to be down pretty marginal even

887
00:37:10,799 --> 00:37:14,880
for a dry cow and so it may require this

888
00:37:13,469 --> 00:37:19,410
time of year may require some crude

889
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:22,019
protein supplementation another thing we

890
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:24,749
did in the middle of the summer was on

891
00:37:22,019 --> 00:37:28,789
the the pivot corners we had some cover

892
00:37:24,749 --> 00:37:30,869
crop swaths and we grazed those and

893
00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:32,579
being that it was in the middle of the

894
00:37:30,869 --> 00:37:36,329
summer you can see dates down here going

895
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:38,400
from late July to late August it was hot

896
00:37:36,329 --> 00:37:39,749
and it was humid and those are great

897
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,989
conditions for breaking down organic

898
00:37:39,749 --> 00:37:44,969
matter right so I was wondering what was

899
00:37:42,989 --> 00:37:46,769
going to happen to the quality of these

900
00:37:44,969 --> 00:37:48,450
swaths over the summer and that's why I

901
00:37:46,769 --> 00:37:50,819
took samples at several different times

902
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:52,589
and you can see that for crude protein

903
00:37:50,819 --> 00:37:55,200
you know we lost a couple percent points

904
00:37:52,589 --> 00:37:57,210
of crude protein and tdn that's the

905
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,819
energy content stands for total

906
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:01,589
digestible nutrients so that's the

907
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:04,410
energy or the calories you know it's

908
00:38:01,589 --> 00:38:05,020
what you need to put pounds on to on an

909
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:06,850
animal

910
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:08,830
and we can see you can see we lost some

911
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:15,160
quality there too just over the course

912
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:17,800
of a month as we get into week Ave in

913
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:21,880
August and September and on this

914
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:24,580
particular field this is a dryland field

915
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:27,100
not irrigated and we got to forage crops

916
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:30,580
off of it and so the first forage crop

917
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:33,850
was we bailed up and set aside and in

918
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:36,040
fact before we bailed it we while the

919
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:38,170
swaths were on the ground we went

920
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:41,890
through and we drilled the the next crop

921
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:45,040
which was the German militancy here in

922
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:46,870
the foreground and so then when we were

923
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:49,180
ready to graze it with our cows that are

924
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:52,390
calving we started putting the bales

925
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:54,250
back out onto the the field and so

926
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:55,810
they've got a mixture of you know they

927
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:58,450
can graze the bales and they've also got

928
00:38:55,810 --> 00:39:01,270
some of the German millet we moved the

929
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:03,760
fence every day for this too so we kind

930
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:07,300
of ration it out little by little and it

931
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,710
worked very well this year with rain now

932
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:11,590
this is a picture taken from the same

933
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:14,290
spot last year when it was very dry it

934
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:16,360
did not it didn't work quite as well but

935
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:17,680
we got the first crop we got the bales

936
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:20,920
but we didn't have enough moisture to

937
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,990
get that second forage crop the idea was

938
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,610
the same in fact I think I think the

939
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:29,230
previous two years it did not work very

940
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:32,320
well this year worked excellent so back

941
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:35,110
to this year or to 2019 this is the same

942
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,910
field from the other direction you can

943
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:39,310
see you know all the manure that we're

944
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:41,950
leaving behind here just what we wanted

945
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:44,470
to do they also had access at the same

946
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:48,340
time to some standing corn to graze and

947
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:51,220
as you can see we that was we fed a lot

948
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:53,080
of soil we fed the cows with it but we

949
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:55,030
fed the soil quite a lot to a lot of it

950
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:56,590
gets trampled but they I think they had

951
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:58,210
just gotten into this area so they would

952
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:59,890
be able to clean that up a little bit

953
00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:01,270
better I mean the cows would eat a

954
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:04,270
little bit more of it that's on the

955
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:05,950
ground there and the other thing is that

956
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:08,410
they we gave them some switchgrass

957
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:09,640
there's a so at the same time they had

958
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:11,620
access to all three of these different

959
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,930
crops and the switchgrass at this time

960
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:15,730
of year it's not that good of quality

961
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:18,160
and so it's providing it's more of a

962
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:18,800
bedding sort of probably but it was

963
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,680
interesting to me

964
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:24,260
see that they still ate some of it and

965
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:25,910
it just goes to show that I mean we all

966
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:27,560
like some diversity in our diet even

967
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:29,000
chocolate cake if you hate it for every

968
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:31,310
meal every day you get tired of it

969
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,240
eventually and cattle are no different

970
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:36,110
you know they like to have some

971
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:38,180
diversity in their diet moving into

972
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:40,070
September now we grazed a standing cover

973
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:42,470
crop and the quality on this was just

974
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:50,150
fabulous you know 26% crude protein and

975
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:53,060
64% digestible nutrients okay now where

976
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:54,170
as we're getting close to the winter one

977
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:56,770
of the questions we've been asking in

978
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:59,930
the last couple years is about

979
00:40:56,770 --> 00:41:03,140
fertilizing or not fertilizing our cover

980
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:06,920
crops and this is a picture from 2018

981
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:08,660
and I put this in here because you can

982
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:10,610
really see the difference between the

983
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:14,140
you know fertilize and not fertilize you

984
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:16,460
can see these strips out there however

985
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:18,770
when I actually went out and took

986
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:21,830
collected the samples I couldn't find

987
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:23,840
very much difference in in yield between

988
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:24,260
the fertilized and the non fertilized

989
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,990
strips

990
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:29,780
you know sometimes our eyes can be be

991
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:31,250
deceiving but another thing but there I

992
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:32,660
mean there's definitely some impact

993
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:34,640
there or I mean you can see it you can

994
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:36,530
see that there's some impact but it was

995
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,840
not as dramatic as you might think and

996
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:40,760
in fact the statistics said that there

997
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:44,870
really wasn't a difference in how much

998
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:46,880
grew but another thing we noticed is

999
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:50,390
that where we've fertilized we see this

1000
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:51,710
we got green up again so the Fertile I

1001
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:54,740
the strips that had been fertilized

1002
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:56,210
after we swath they they they grew and

1003
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:59,210
greened up and where we had not

1004
00:41:56,210 --> 00:42:03,500
fertilized they did not but that didn't

1005
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:05,470
really add a whole lot of biomass to the

1006
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:09,410
equation in terms of forage or soil

1007
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:13,160
health so we did it again this year and

1008
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:15,320
this year it besides going out there by

1009
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:18,380
hand and cutting stuff and weighing it

1010
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:21,280
and all that I also used a drone to take

1011
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:24,290
images and we got you know the regular

1012
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:29,290
visible light images we also use some

1013
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:31,730
near infrared cameras and calculated a

1014
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:32,799
NDVI which is supposed to tell us how

1015
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:35,900
much is out there

1016
00:42:32,799 --> 00:42:37,939
and so I did both the drone and the hand

1017
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:40,489
sampling and on this particular field

1018
00:42:37,939 --> 00:42:42,739
which is not irrigated you can see the

1019
00:42:40,489 --> 00:42:45,169
yields that we've got here 3,000 pounds

1020
00:42:42,739 --> 00:42:47,209
per acre fertilized 2,400 pounds per

1021
00:42:45,169 --> 00:42:49,849
acre not fertilized but whether I

1022
00:42:47,209 --> 00:42:51,619
collected my data with the drone or by

1023
00:42:49,849 --> 00:42:54,529
hand the statistics say there's no

1024
00:42:51,619 --> 00:42:57,859
difference there that was hard for me to

1025
00:42:54,529 --> 00:42:59,719
believe and I'll get a little bit more

1026
00:42:57,859 --> 00:43:01,160
into that in a minute but the other

1027
00:42:59,719 --> 00:43:03,890
thing we see is that the fertilized part

1028
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:05,959
had a little higher crude protein and so

1029
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:08,119
that's also beneficial but again the

1030
00:43:05,959 --> 00:43:09,199
statistics didn't didn't support me

1031
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:13,910
there and saying that there's really a

1032
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:16,999
difference but statistics aside we've

1033
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:19,729
got a 25% increase here going from not

1034
00:43:16,999 --> 00:43:21,559
fertilized to fertilized and if we

1035
00:43:19,729 --> 00:43:23,779
calculate just on the non fertilized

1036
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:25,429
part it costs us 62 dollars per ton if

1037
00:43:23,779 --> 00:43:26,929
we assume that we had to hire someone to

1038
00:43:25,429 --> 00:43:29,449
go out there and do all the field

1039
00:43:26,929 --> 00:43:33,319
operations and that and bought the seed

1040
00:43:29,449 --> 00:43:36,380
and everything 62 dollars per ton using

1041
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:38,390
custom rates and then if we if we

1042
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:40,369
consider that we put on 45 pounds of

1043
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:43,880
nitrogen and the extra forage we got for

1044
00:43:40,369 --> 00:43:46,729
that the use of fertilizer it cost us

1045
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:49,489
$59 per ton for those that extra tonnage

1046
00:43:46,729 --> 00:43:53,390
so neither one of these is bad a bad

1047
00:43:49,489 --> 00:43:54,499
price for the quality of this forage we

1048
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:55,609
did the same thing on one of our

1049
00:43:54,499 --> 00:43:59,659
irrigated fields

1050
00:43:55,609 --> 00:44:03,019
it did get irrigated one time 3/4 of an

1051
00:43:59,659 --> 00:44:06,019
inch is all and on this field the yields

1052
00:44:03,019 --> 00:44:07,880
are very similar 3,100 pounds of 2200

1053
00:44:06,019 --> 00:44:09,829
pounds very similar to the other field

1054
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:11,929
to the field that was not irrigated at

1055
00:44:09,829 --> 00:44:13,309
this time though the statistics support

1056
00:44:11,929 --> 00:44:14,509
the difference and they say yeah yeah

1057
00:44:13,309 --> 00:44:16,239
there really is a difference you know

1058
00:44:14,509 --> 00:44:18,949
the fertilizer really did something and

1059
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:22,729
we see it in the crude protein also and

1060
00:44:18,949 --> 00:44:26,059
so cost per ton for the non fertilize is

1061
00:44:22,729 --> 00:44:28,130
similar you know $68 per ton to produce

1062
00:44:26,059 --> 00:44:30,949
the non fertilized but then with the

1063
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:33,049
addition of fertilizer it cost us forty

1064
00:44:30,949 --> 00:44:35,209
dollars per ton the cost of that

1065
00:44:33,049 --> 00:44:37,729
fertilizer to produce some extra forage

1066
00:44:35,209 --> 00:44:41,359
so again good prices for this high

1067
00:44:37,729 --> 00:44:44,029
quality forage so what we do with it

1068
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:45,609
then this is following wheat we've

1069
00:44:44,029 --> 00:44:47,259
planted this cover crop

1070
00:44:45,609 --> 00:44:50,349
and we're planning to graze it over the

1071
00:44:47,259 --> 00:44:53,019
winter and we swath almost all of it and

1072
00:44:50,349 --> 00:44:54,970
if we have the cows eat the swaths Duane

1073
00:44:53,019 --> 00:44:56,559
also left some standing strips this year

1074
00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:58,749
so we can make a comparison between the

1075
00:44:56,559 --> 00:45:01,150
swaths and the strip's but mostly it's

1076
00:44:58,749 --> 00:45:03,130
just the swaths you can see 11 days

1077
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:05,739
later this picture I took now a lot of

1078
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:10,450
the green has faded out of that out of

1079
00:45:05,739 --> 00:45:12,549
that standing crop and me a lot of you

1080
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:14,619
are probably familiar with this but with

1081
00:45:12,549 --> 00:45:16,480
the way we prefer to move the fences

1082
00:45:14,619 --> 00:45:17,829
over the winter is with the irrigator so

1083
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:21,099
we don't have to be moving posts all

1084
00:45:17,829 --> 00:45:23,980
along you can see the the white wires

1085
00:45:21,099 --> 00:45:25,930
those are our hot wires there they're

1086
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:27,789
hanging from the irrigator and so you go

1087
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:29,200
out there and you press the button on

1088
00:45:27,789 --> 00:45:31,390
the irrigator and it moves your fence

1089
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:34,239
four or twenty feet or whatever so we've

1090
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:37,059
got the swaths running one direction and

1091
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:39,279
the fence running perpendicular to it

1092
00:45:37,059 --> 00:45:41,650
like this and we just move that fence

1093
00:45:39,279 --> 00:45:44,440
along the line so the cows get an extra

1094
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:45,609
20 feet or whatever the number is you

1095
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:49,450
know every day we just give them a

1096
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:51,190
little bit more ration it out to them if

1097
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:52,660
you take in a tour at Dakota Lakes

1098
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:55,960
you've probably been on top of our calf

1099
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:57,309
shelter here on the backs that you can't

1100
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:00,220
see in this picture about the backside

1101
00:45:57,309 --> 00:46:03,279
of it there's a piece that we can flap

1102
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:08,140
down and then it covers up the backside

1103
00:46:03,279 --> 00:46:10,239
the calves can get in there here you can

1104
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:13,839
see the defense is back here in this

1105
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:15,640
picture and this undisturbed snow right

1106
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:18,039
here the cows haven't been there yet you

1107
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:20,190
can see yesterday this is the area they

1108
00:46:18,039 --> 00:46:22,660
were working in and so here's a swath

1109
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:25,230
you can see this swath in the foreground

1110
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:27,670
that they were eating and they haven't

1111
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:29,079
bothered the snow near as much in

1112
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:33,249
between and then here's another swath

1113
00:46:29,079 --> 00:46:35,680
the cows are they do a fine job of

1114
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:38,140
finding it and if you think about the

1115
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:40,390
grazing the swath versus grazing the

1116
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:42,970
standing if you've got a 20 foot swath

1117
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:44,980
or you take all that 20 feet and you

1118
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:49,480
condense it down into two feet right and

1119
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:51,160
now if there's no snow that doesn't make

1120
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:53,349
a whole lot of difference but once it

1121
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:55,539
starts to snow and cover that up now the

1122
00:46:53,349 --> 00:46:58,660
cow only has to search these two feet

1123
00:46:55,539 --> 00:46:59,540
where the swath is right and so the kind

1124
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:02,120
of the action

1125
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:04,070
does she she reaches down in there and

1126
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:05,720
she kind of takes a bite and at the sit

1127
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:07,880
and then she actually picks her head up

1128
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:09,830
she kind of flips some of the snow to

1129
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:11,270
the side and she reaches down she picks

1130
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:12,650
it takes a bite and she kind of flips

1131
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:14,810
them and so he's almost like she's

1132
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:17,780
tunneling along where that swath is

1133
00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:19,790
moving the snow to the side and because

1134
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:21,500
we're moving this fence every day she

1135
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:22,820
can see where that swath was yesterday

1136
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:25,100
and she knows where to look for it

1137
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:28,010
tomorrow now you get a bunch of new snow

1138
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:29,480
or if it you cross over on top sometimes

1139
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:31,070
you might have to come through and help

1140
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:33,410
them out a little and maybe drive over

1141
00:47:31,070 --> 00:47:35,060
top and they can see where it is or they

1142
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:36,650
so they can kind of get in there get

1143
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:39,080
that first bite in there and start

1144
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:41,300
working at it but they don't they don't

1145
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:44,930
come at it from above they come at it

1146
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:48,130
you know from the the side horizontally

1147
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:48,130
and they work through it that direction

1148
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:51,860
the cat you know the calves even get out

1149
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:53,240
there and do it because we're fall

1150
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:56,480
calving so we've got the calves out

1151
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:59,900
there eating swathes - so I did the same

1152
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:01,580
thing here as I did during the summer

1153
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:04,040
with those swaths I went out every month

1154
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:06,800
and I collected quality samples to see

1155
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:08,660
what's happening and of course during

1156
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,850
the winter we expect it to be preserved

1157
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:12,470
better than during the summer so with

1158
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:15,230
those cold temperatures we expect the

1159
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:18,020
quality to be maintained versus the the

1160
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:20,330
hot humid summer and and that's pretty

1161
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:22,700
much what we see we lost a couple

1162
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:24,440
percentage points just like in the

1163
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:26,900
summer but it took three months to lose

1164
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:28,310
it rather than one month and the

1165
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:31,880
difference between the you know one of

1166
00:48:28,310 --> 00:48:33,020
these is standing one is swath well you

1167
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:34,580
know there's a little bit of difference

1168
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:37,070
here but there's a lot of variability in

1169
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:39,590
the data not not much difference between

1170
00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:42,410
them in terms of quality the difference

1171
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:45,860
I think is mostly in the cows ability to

1172
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:47,240
get to it I also measured the tdn again

1173
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:49,250
remember this is the energy or the

1174
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:52,850
calories that's in it and we see a

1175
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:55,550
decline over these several months but

1176
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:57,560
and this is one field I collected the

1177
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:59,420
data on another field - and if we look

1178
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:01,910
at this second field the loss of crude

1179
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:05,000
protein isn't much at all same with the

1180
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:07,850
the energy not a whole lot of loss of

1181
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:10,790
energy so we can see that we do lose

1182
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:12,859
some quality in these swaths over the

1183
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:18,440
winter but it's not real dramatic

1184
00:49:12,859 --> 00:49:20,599
and it's better than the summer so

1185
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:22,670
besides giving the swaths every day we

1186
00:49:20,599 --> 00:49:26,930
also give them some some corn residue

1187
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:28,309
every day and the the swaths are

1188
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:30,829
high-quality and if that's all the cows

1189
00:49:28,309 --> 00:49:33,279
got it would be a great diet the corn

1190
00:49:30,829 --> 00:49:35,569
residue is not as good at quality and

1191
00:49:33,279 --> 00:49:37,609
but it provides some fill and they do

1192
00:49:35,569 --> 00:49:40,549
find some some ears in there that the

1193
00:49:37,609 --> 00:49:42,410
combine missed and so you put those two

1194
00:49:40,549 --> 00:49:43,970
together the diets not as good as what

1195
00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:45,619
we'd like the cows to have over winter

1196
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:48,249
and so we also give them a little bit of

1197
00:49:45,619 --> 00:49:50,509
supplement which could be in the form of

1198
00:49:48,249 --> 00:49:54,259
flaxseed meal soybean meal that we

1199
00:49:50,509 --> 00:49:58,069
produce on the farm could also be you

1200
00:49:54,259 --> 00:50:03,920
know it could be corn or peas or lentil

1201
00:49:58,069 --> 00:50:07,190
sorghum this is another drone image that

1202
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:09,589
I took and this is on a a corn field you

1203
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:11,660
can see this spot up here where we had

1204
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:14,329
some really wet soils this year and all

1205
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:17,359
this this part of the field is on the

1206
00:50:14,329 --> 00:50:19,519
right that got planted later because it

1207
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:21,019
was wet and so from the drone imagery

1208
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:22,910
you can definitely see those differences

1209
00:50:21,019 --> 00:50:25,700
and this is this is supposed to be

1210
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:30,109
telling us where we had more corn or

1211
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:31,549
less corn right I also have cages out

1212
00:50:30,109 --> 00:50:34,039
there with that we don't let the cows

1213
00:50:31,549 --> 00:50:35,539
into because and I do this on a lot of

1214
00:50:34,039 --> 00:50:37,460
the fields where we let the cows graze

1215
00:50:35,539 --> 00:50:40,640
to find out what kind of impact they're

1216
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:43,369
having and so I thought and I go out

1217
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:45,680
there and I harvest with I do some hand

1218
00:50:43,369 --> 00:50:47,299
harvesting or some small plot combines

1219
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:49,339
to harvest those and try to compare

1220
00:50:47,299 --> 00:50:52,099
yields to say well if we had a cow out

1221
00:50:49,339 --> 00:50:53,839
here last year you know is it hurting

1222
00:50:52,099 --> 00:50:55,460
our corn yield is it hurting our soybean

1223
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:57,079
yield and so far I haven't been able to

1224
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:58,910
find any differences so this year I

1225
00:50:57,079 --> 00:51:00,890
enlisted a drone to help me out

1226
00:50:58,910 --> 00:51:07,489
and the drone couldn't find the

1227
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:09,440
differences either so so I'm I have not

1228
00:51:07,489 --> 00:51:12,109
been able to find evidence of the

1229
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:16,789
grazing hurting our yields at Dakota

1230
00:51:12,109 --> 00:51:18,589
lakes and I so so how do I explain that

1231
00:51:16,789 --> 00:51:20,230
I know some there are some people who

1232
00:51:18,589 --> 00:51:24,170
have said that they have had trouble and

1233
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:25,580
I I don't have a scientific study where

1234
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:27,650
I set this up to make the compare

1235
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:29,420
and yet but I suspect that what's

1236
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:30,950
happening is it's the particularly that

1237
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:32,570
we're managing things at Dakota Lakes

1238
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:36,620
you know these soils have been in

1239
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:39,170
long-term no-till for decades and the

1240
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:42,290
way we graze those cover crops is first

1241
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:44,150
we have a wheat crop and we harvest it

1242
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:46,730
with a stripper head and this is a

1243
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:48,770
picture of what the soil looks like you

1244
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:50,900
know we have I mean look at that you

1245
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:53,660
mean it's just completely covered with

1246
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:55,550
the straw from from the wheat and then

1247
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:58,930
we've we've got our cover crop in here

1248
00:51:55,550 --> 00:52:01,580
and the cover crop gets gets swathed and

1249
00:51:58,930 --> 00:52:03,650
concentrated in one spot but that ground

1250
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:04,820
is still covered with the wheat straw so

1251
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:06,500
when our cows are out there they're

1252
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:09,260
stepping on that armor the wheat straw

1253
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:11,390
is the armor and the other thing is

1254
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:12,860
we're moving these fences everyday right

1255
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:16,060
and so they're never staying in one spot

1256
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:18,830
for a long time and if we do get really

1257
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:21,020
soft soils you know it's some moisture

1258
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:23,450
and the soils are not frozen well tend

1259
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:25,910
to move the cows off of that field and

1260
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:28,340
put them into a perennial grass area for

1261
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:29,720
a while and feed them some bales but

1262
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:31,250
even if they're you know if everything

1263
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:33,620
doesn't always work out perfectly it's a

1264
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:35,060
you know the Dakota Lakes it's a real it

1265
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:36,650
so even though we do a lot of research

1266
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:38,690
there we have this challenge as everyone

1267
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:40,400
does and sometimes the cows are on the

1268
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:41,930
field when it's the soils a little bit

1269
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,750
soft you know and you can see some hoof

1270
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:46,430
prints but even then we're moving that

1271
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:49,160
fence every day so they're not camped

1272
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:52,580
out in one spot beating that soil to

1273
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:55,370
death for a month at a time and I so

1274
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:57,910
that's what I that's the speculation as

1275
00:52:55,370 --> 00:53:00,830
to why we're having the success we are

1276
00:52:57,910 --> 00:53:02,390
so that is the end of my presentation

1277
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:04,850
and but I just wanted to post this

1278
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:07,790
question up here again at the end the

1279
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:09,830
challenge that I see is how long can we

1280
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:13,370
keep our animals and then nutrients they

1281
00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:15,500
eat in our land and I hope that the all

1282
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:18,680
those stars form the constellation the

1283
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:21,140
marketing part and the the read the beef

1284
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:22,460
label in the back you know how that if

1285
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:25,250
we can get a higher if we can get a

1286
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:27,470
premium for doing the good things we do

1287
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:29,150
for the land and keeping the cattle on

1288
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:29,800
the land and the nutrients on the land

1289
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:32,110
and there again

1290
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:34,360
matter on the land hopefully we can we

1291
00:53:32,110 --> 00:53:38,340
can bring that all together so I should

1292
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:38,340
have time for a few questions at least

1293
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:54,970
if there are any yes sir on the question

1294
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:56,580
was on the shields pastor when we did

1295
00:53:54,970 --> 00:54:01,690
the grazing how many head were out there

1296
00:53:56,580 --> 00:54:03,610
we have thirty cows and so you know from

1297
00:54:01,690 --> 00:54:08,110
year to year plus or minus thirty cows

1298
00:54:03,610 --> 00:54:11,410
and the whole that whole pasture is

1299
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:14,170
around eighty acres but that part where

1300
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:16,630
we're doing the experiment we tent we

1301
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:18,910
have them in paddocks that are less than

1302
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:21,610
an acre like the smaller some of the

1303
00:54:18,910 --> 00:54:24,630
small paddocks are about two-tenths of

1304
00:54:21,610 --> 00:54:28,300
an acre and then the larger ones are

1305
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:31,390
about four times that I think so just

1306
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:36,120
just under an acre so 30 cows and in

1307
00:54:31,390 --> 00:54:38,620
that area so it's not it's not as

1308
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:42,490
intensive as some of the really high

1309
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:46,030
stocking rate mob grazing but it is much

1310
00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:48,390
more intensive than typically what you

1311
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:48,390
would see

1312
00:54:52,190 --> 00:55:00,750
any more questions okay thank you very

1313
00:54:58,849 --> 00:55:08,100
much going right thank you

1314
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:08,100
[Applause]
