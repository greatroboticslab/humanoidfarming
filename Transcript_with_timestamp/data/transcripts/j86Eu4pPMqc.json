  "text": "thanks for stopping over at lumni Acres a guide to Modern homesteading self-sufficiency and freedom in today's video we're going to talk about the seven Essentials you need for starting and raising happy healthy chicks the number one thing you're going to need for keeping your spouse happy when raising your chicks in your basement or your house is the mother hen you heard me right this is the mother hen it's just a cardboard box but it's important so when you're raising chicks ducks or turkeys in your house at night they chirp and they make a lot of noise when you want to go to bed so you take your mother hen you put it over the chicks and they're quiet as can be they'll sleep through the night nice and sound they don't make a peep until morning comes and you take the box off and they and they see it's morning time you might be thinking it's kind of cruel to put a cardboard box over your chicks but in nature what do they do the mother hen sits on the chick so this is more of a comfort to them and quiets them and makes them FAL happier so trust me it's kind of like swaddling a baby you wrap a baby up nice and tight and it likes it it's like being in the womb so the mother hen cardboard box is the same thing to the baby chicks don't forget it then you're going to need some kind of waterer you got a big Bell one like this or you got a little one a lot of these depend on how many chicks you're doing if you're only doing five to 15 that's big enough if you're doing 25 this is big enough to start out but once they get bigger they're going to be drinking more water so you got to get a bigger gallon water we put a little bit of apple cider vinegar in our chicken water to start and it just helps build up their immunity then you're also going to need feed we use organic chick stutter non-medicated that's totally up to you something you need to do research on for yourself if you want to do organic nonorganic non GMO and if you want medicated non-medicated we don't use medicated we've never had an issue not using medicated but I know some people feel one way or another so that's fine that's your call it's your family it's your chickens it's their your eggs it's their eggs you're going to be eating and it's the meat that you'll be eating so it's totally your decision then you're going to want some different feeders this one again is a little bit bigger so if you have 25 more chicks you don't want the bigger one you can just have the little on fill up the Mason jar you can buy the plastic cup that goes on it you fill it up with feed we just use a Mason JY you fill it up with feed screw it on and then dump it over they all work really good the next thing you're going to need is you're going to need a heat Source when we raised our chickens last year we didn't need a a heat light we just kept the chicken pan right near the woods stove and that kept them more than warm enough throughout the whole growing season till they were able to go outside we never once Ed the heat light if you are going to use a heat light make sure you got the right the proper light keep the cage on so it doesn't get too close and start a fire I'll I'll give you an up close but we use a ceramic heat bulb when we need it or you can get an infrared one I don't like they say not to use the white cuz it blinds the chicks the red ones I personally don't like looking at a red light it drives me bonkers so do I want my chicks to have to look at a red light all the time I wouldn't want it so I'm not going to make my chicks do it I got the ceramic heat Bal another preference it's totally up to you that's why I don't use the red one I'm going to leave a link in the description below for Amazon that shows all the items that we have here and you can purchase them through the link and the best part is when you buy all the stuff from Amazon they'll throw in the mother hand for free woohoo sorry for all the noise in the background it's 50\u00b0 out today all the snow is melting and that noise you're hearing is the Brook running but it's not quite Springtime here yet but it's getting close to the time where we're going to start thinking about getting some more chicks here so that's what made me think about making the video today so another thing you're going to need is you're going to need a pen to raise them in and depending on how many chicks you plan on Staring at once depends on how big of a pen you need to raise them we got this water tro that we use so we're doing like 25 birds or more once they get big enough we'll stick them in here most of the time we just use pine shavings for beded you can use newspaper that works really good shredded paper really whatever you have if you can get shredded paper easy or if you got a shredder use your own paper save some money and then compost it afterwards we're only raising a few chicks at a time or a couple of ducks I just grabbed this old dog pannel we have set it up and use this then you got the problem then you have the problem it's opened on the sides then if you leave the sides open the chicks just push all their bedding out so one little trick I do I just RI the cardboard the length I need it and zip tie it up on three sides I leave the front open thanks guys for watching I hope you like the video if you did give it a thumbs up don't forget to subscribe and this is the way that we raise our happy healthy chicks here and grow them into nice healthy hens and get some great fresh organic eggs this right here to me is freedom we don't have to go to the grocery store and depend on everybody else to get this nice delicious food for us we'll see you right back here next time at lumni Acres a guide modern homesteading self-sufficiency and freedom
