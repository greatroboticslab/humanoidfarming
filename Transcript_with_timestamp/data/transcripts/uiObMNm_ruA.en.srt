00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:05,960
hello my friend welcome to the farm life

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,640
today we will explore great solutions

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,519
for results from the garden to your

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:12,880
table guava is not only famous for its

5
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:14,679
sweet taste but also rich in nutrition

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,119
that we will introduce the billion dooll

7
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:19,160
guava growing process applying modern

8
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:23,439
agriculture technology to bring top

9
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:26,679
quality guava let's start the discovery

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:29,800
process the nursery in janga County

11
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:31,720
Taiwan is where guava cultivation Begins

12
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,640
the the process of growing Pearl guava

13
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,800
begins with the selection of healthy

14
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,120
guava

15
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,000
Sprouts these Sprouts are carefully

16
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,079
planted to ensure that they are firmly

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,800
attached to the soil which is important

18
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,800
for their early

19
00:00:45,199 --> 00:00:49,039
growth when the Sprouts are about a

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,120
month old they are ready to be

21
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,800
transferred to the farm Fields where the

22
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,399
rayol work

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,480
begins each Sprout is planted by hand

24
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,199
it's essential to maintain a distance of

25
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:04,199
5 to 6.5 feet between each guava tree

26
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:06,560
this spacing allows for proper growth

27
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,920
and ensures each tree gets the necessary

28
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,759
nutrients without competing with

29
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,560
others after planting the guava trees

30
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:16,400
are equipped with a drip irrigation

31
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,520
system which is crucial for their growth

32
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,000
this system efficiently delivers the

33
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,960
right amount of water directly to the

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,200
roots water is sourced from nearby pumps

35
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,240
and filtered to remove impurities

36
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,600
ensuring it is clean and safe for the

37
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,840
plants nutrients can also be added to

38
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,520
support Healthy Growth helping the trees

39
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,640
Thrive as they

40
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:39,840
develop the drip irrigation system a key

41
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,720
aspect of Agriculture technology

42
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,560
conserves water while supplying

43
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,560
essential hydration to the guava

44
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:50,920
trees regular maintenance is required

45
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:54,040
for proper growth including pruning and

46
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:56,560
shaping when the tree is 4 months

47
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,719
old the grass around the trees is

48
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,880
regularly pruned to prevent competition

49
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:04,719
for nutrients and keep the plantation

50
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,960
clean pruning encourages better growth

51
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,160
by allowing the tree to focus its energy

52
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,239
on fruit production rather than removing

53
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:14,000
unwanted branches improving air

54
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:16,040
circulation reducing the risk of disease

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,440
and promoting healthier growth an

56
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,680
important stage in guava cultivation is

57
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:23,080
preparing the tree for fruiting D an

58
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,920
important stage in guava cultivation is

59
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:28,280
preparing the tree for fruiting when the

60
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,480
tree is ready to bear fruit farmers will

61
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,120
wrap the guava after cutting the tops of

62
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,440
the branches this directs nutrients to

63
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,120
the fruit ensuring that the guava grows

64
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,959
large and sweet which is essential for

65
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,159
quality in recent years Taiwan has

66
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:46,239
become a leader in producing highquality

67
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:49,080
guavas with over

68
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:52,239
34,500 Acres of guava Orchards spread

69
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:55,200
across the island each year Taiwan

70
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,440
harvests more than 440 million pounds of

71
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,680
guava with the most popular variety

72
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,440
being the Pearl guava weed management is

73
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06,040
also important for tree

74
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,120
growth highquality Pearl guavas are

75
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,400
produced by allowing only one fruit to

76
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:13,720
grow per Branch a selective process

77
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,280
common in Japan that enhances fruit

78
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,959
quality the guavas are then wrapped in

79
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:22,640
nylon bags which protect them from Birds

80
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,640
insects rain and excessive sun exposure

81
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,280

growth the wrapping ensures that the

84
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,599
guavas develop without external

85
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,799
interference resulting in a more

86
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:37,040
consistent and higher quality product

87
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,439
the ripening period is about 1 and a

88
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,200
half months depending on the season

89
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:44,599
during summer when rainfall is abundant

90
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:47,239
guavas are more susceptible to damage

91
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:49,959
making wrapping even more

92
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:51,959
crucial meanwhile branches are

93
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:54,720
periodically pruned to maintain tree

94
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:56,920
health and promote better fruit

95
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,040
development production pruning is

96
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:02,400
essential for managing tree growth and

97
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:05,079
directing new nutrients to developing

98
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,840
fruits as harvest time approaches

99
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:09,360
Farmers check the sweetness of the

cultivated by over 3,000 raisin Growers

194
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:58,960
to supply all of the raisins in the US

195
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,280
2/3 of this production is consumed in

196
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,280
the US and Canada while the remaining

197
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:07,879
third is exported to nearly 50 countries

198
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:10,680
primarily in Asia and Europe raisins are

199
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:12,840
made from seedless Vitus Viner grapes

200
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,599
which are typically sundried on trays or

201
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,560
left to dry on the

202
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:21,039

Thompson Selma Pete Fiesta and

204
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,479
duvine growing grapes starts with

205
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,120
digging holes to provide optimal

206
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:30,479
conditions for the vines many farms now

207
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:33,000
use mechanical technology such as hole

208
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:36,680
diggers to create uniform holes

209
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,479
enhancing efficiency and saving time and

210
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:41,479
effort selecting the right cultivar is

211
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:43,959
the most crucial step in raisin

214
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,279
and weather choosing the appropriate

215
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:54,040
variety optimizes raisin yield and

216
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,880
quality while reducing growing risks

217

typically made of wood or metal and

238
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:49,720
standing six to 8 ft tall they should be

239
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:52,800
installed before planting allowing Vines

240
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:54,360
to be tied immediately afterward wire is

241
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,519
attached to the stakes to promote
