biotechnology often raises questions

198
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:03,000
about safety and ethics however rigorous

199
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,759
testing and Regulatory Frameworks ensure

200
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,919
that biotech products are safe for

201
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:10,039
humans animals and the environment

202
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,520

203
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:15,479
play a key role in addressing public

204
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:17,039
concerns despite so many challenges

205
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:19,199
there are still a lot of opportunities

emerging Innovations like Gene drives to

225
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,600
control pests or synthetic biology to

226
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,360
create entirely new biological systems

227
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,720
could revolutionize farming these tools

228
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,480
will be essential in building a

00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,519
final thoughts biotechnology and

233
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,240
agriculture is at the Forefront of

234
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,519
innovation addressing critical

235
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,959
challenges like food security climate

236
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,440

agriculture is not just about growing

242
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,120
more food it is about growing smarter

243
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,760
healthier and more sustainable food for

244
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,959
a growing global
