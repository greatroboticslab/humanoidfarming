1
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,400
Agriculture and

2
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:31,119
biodiversity this is a highly important

3
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,360
subject when man stop traveling 12,000

4
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,800
years ago and started having many babies

5
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,600
invented Agriculture and breeding and

6
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,840
this disrupted the ecosystem there could

7
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,239
be um human beings without agriculture

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:46,399
but there can be no humankind without

9
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:50,360
agriculture man needed to feed the

10
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:52,920
population and uh in the fields in the

11
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:55,039
19th century man stopped mixing wild

12
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,440
plants and cultivated plants in the

13
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,960
fields then everything

14
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:04,199
changed uh irrigation was invented

15
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,439
plants were selected genetic work

16
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,600
started in sensive aromy with high

17
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:10,600
levels of pesticides insecticides many

18
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,040
babies were born and the human

19
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,400
population is multiplied by three

20
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:17,159
between 1950 and today and the

21
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,880
agriculture had to keep pace and what we

22
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:24,040
thought was the ideal situation started

23
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:28,320
being challenged in the 70s and

24
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:31,720
80s the dark clouds started accumulating

25
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,280
over humankind best icid insecticides

26
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:36,000
soil pollution destruction of pollinator

27
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,320
insects pollinator insects are

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,159
absolutely vital because except for a

29
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:45,320
few plants such as cereals uh many

30
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,560
plants are pollinated fruit and flowers

31
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:51,320
and if we lost them the loss would be

32
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:53,360
180 billion a year to pay the women who

33
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,880
would have to uh replace bees and

34
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:59,439
pollinate plants manually so this is the

35
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:03,399
challenge we can't increase uh arable

36
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:07,119
surface we have to stop wasting water

37
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:09,599
and uh we have to uh try to suppress

38
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:12,040
pesticides uh decrease the use of

39
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:15,599
fertiliz fertilizers used biodiversity

40
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:18,959
to maintain uh Manpower in agriculture

41
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:22,920
not too much mechanization we have to

42
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:26,080
allow Farmers to work and be proud of

43
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,800
their job because uh the fact that we

44
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,000
lose agriculture in the mountains is

45
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,400
also a sign of loss of biodiversity and

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,800
when we talk about biodiversity I'll

47
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:38,400
give you a case there was uh rice

48
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:40,519
dwarfing a viral epidemic in 2007 and

49
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,040
obviously this had an impact on millions

50
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:45,640
of people in the local population it was

51
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,680
necessary to test 6,300 varieties of

52
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:51,400
rice to find one lost in a Himalayan

53
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:54,599
Valley that resisted the virus now

54
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:57,640
nowadays this species is cultivated over

55
00:02:54,599 --> 00:03:01,680
100,000 square kilometers in Asia this

56
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:05,280
is biodiversity um at it best bringing a

57
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:08,879
response a reply to a problem and a lost

58
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,400
Himalayan Valley rice species allowed to

59
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,000
solve the problem so we need to PR bi

60
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,560
preserve biodiversity in plants and

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,159
animals we need to control the animal

62
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,599
population there are far too many cows

63
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:23,480
on Earth 1.5 billion cows far too many

64
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:26,840
we need to respect nature we need to

65
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,799
create agroecology intensively and also

66
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,239
organic growing but we can't grow plants

67
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:35,000
organically everywhere we simply want to

68
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:37,879
make sure that we need to feed seven and

69
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,439
very soon 9 billion human beings on

70
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:43,680
Earth providing uh protein and also uh

71
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:46,200
Distributing uh the resources better

72
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:50,400
across the world this is a huge

73
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,400
challenge Agriculture and biodiversity
