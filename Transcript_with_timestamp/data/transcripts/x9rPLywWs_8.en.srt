1
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:32,230
excuse the mess this is just kind of our

2
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:36,070
collect all I saw everything that I know

3
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:39,720
I'll need eventually gonna have a safe

4
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,720
dry place to put everything

5
00:01:19,780 --> 00:02:10,789
our old nesting box in need of some

6
00:01:22,850 --> 00:02:13,220
repair we're gonna be putting three

7
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:15,680
pieces of strapping on here to secure

8
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,709
the nest box so I need to drill three

9
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,709
holes

10
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:41,360
these are self tapping sheetmetal screws

11
00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:43,159
but these holes being rounded you try to

12
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,510
get the self tapper going it's telling

13
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:46,909
to slide all over the place if you

14
00:02:44,510 --> 00:03:07,670
pre-drill it first with an 8 inch 8 inch

15
00:02:46,909 --> 00:03:12,170
bit it works a lot better four and a

16
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:16,760
half inches to get it level that's going

17
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:19,180
to be too much I think let's see what we

18
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,180
can get

19
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:29,830
then we're going to be screwing a 2x4 on

20
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:32,150
edge just using these urban quick crimp

21
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:33,950
clamps in order to get through the

22
00:03:32,150 --> 00:04:02,600
chicken wire you just got slide off the

23
00:03:33,950 --> 00:04:09,050
yellow which is gonna flush up the

24
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:22,250
bottom end I'm just using two inch deck

25
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:25,850
screws and for the next one I'm just

26
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:31,100
going to flush it with the top putting

27
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:35,540
it on each side so we have three pieces

28
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:40,280
of strapping 61 inches long two pieces

29
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:44,080
of 2x4 48 inches long and now we'll go

30
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,080
ahead well mount the nesting box

31
00:04:52,050 --> 00:05:00,760
okay but one screwing on one end so do

32
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:02,880
like this in first over here pick up on

33
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,880
that

34
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:34,050
this is a nesting box that was given to

35
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:36,000
us you so this will be our third time

36
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:38,790
setting it up and I had this back piece

37
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,440
I took it off come to find out we need

38
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:43,230
it it holds the bottom pot of the

39
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:45,030
nesting box in place luckily I still had

40
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:48,380
it in the back of my truck I had a made

41
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:48,380
it to the dump yet to throw it away

42
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:17,750
this back here has an lip on it screw it

43
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:21,259
all back in I'll show you what we need

44
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:33,229
that little lip for so this part of the

45
00:06:21,259 --> 00:06:35,570
tray that's setting that's it holds out

46
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:40,090
of place is this I'll whip this is

47
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:40,090
the lip on this side then we got these

48
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:46,669
so I've enjoyed having the pigs out on

49
00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:52,130
the pasture all summer moving on twice a

50
00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:53,750
day and fun they get all excited every

51
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:57,500
time they get on fresh grass to see what

52
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:59,479
they can find but now we're getting
