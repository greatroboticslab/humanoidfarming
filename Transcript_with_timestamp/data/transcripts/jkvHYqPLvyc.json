  "text": "Kesava peels are byproducts of cassava processing recognized as a potential feed resource but wasted constituting a major environmental nuisance within and around processing centers due to drying constraints traditionally drying is done on bare floor over a period of two to three days in the dry season to get a marketable product peels dried in this manner are not marketed at their potential prices due to quality concerns relating to contamination by aflatoxins as well as poor storability due to improper drying as a result farmers and the feed industry do not have access to processed peels of desired quality in sufficient quantities in 2015 CGIAR scientists working in its research programs on roots tubers and bananas humid tropics and livestock and fish developed an innovative processing method that reduces drying time to six to eight hours yielding high-quality products that could be used to feed ruminants and mono gastrics there is every indication that processed peels of high quality are in great demand from the feed industry as such this provides an opportunity to mitigate feed scarcity while cassava peel processors who adopt the innovation are able to generate additional income there is thus a potential to convert millions of tons of an environmental problem into a valuable resource for food production and in doing so also create a new industry that offers new income and employment to participants in cassava processing 80% of whom are women this video explains how to achieve the best results from this innovation cassava peels use for processing should be free from contamination stumps large woody tubers soil and other foreign materials must be removed from peels before grating to protect the rasp ER from damage fresh cassava peels should always be used as stored peels begin to ferment and become soggy and slippery which makes them difficult to grate once sorted the peels are grated to reduce the particle size to facilitate deep watering and drying peels are harder to grate than tubers so they have to be grated three times to achieve the desired size grated peels must then be packed in plastic woven bags in small quantities of 8 to 12 kilograms the bags are then folded halfway and neatly stacked one above the other in a metal frame for pressing a desirable stacking height leaves sufficient room for inserting a hydraulic jack wooden planks which ensure the uniform distribution of pressure are used to separate the stacked bags and the hydraulic jack application of pressure through the jack results in rapid water loss dewatering results in water loss of almost 50 percent by weight of the starting material press bags are then allowed to stand overnight to ferment the result is an intermediate product the cassava peel cake with a 38 to 42 percent moisture content wet cassava peeled cake can be fed as is to cattle sheep goats and pigs it can be stored for seven days without spoiling and thus could be transported and marketed over long distances within that period to produce dried mash intermediate cassava peel cake is loosened by grating to improve the granularity of the material and improve its flow through a sieve sealing separates the loosened cake into a fine fraction lower in fiber higher and energy content from a coarse fraction higher and fibre lower in energy content resulting in fine and coarse mash process mash is then dried six to eight hours by spreading on commonly available surfaces for example concrete slabs and plastic or metal sheeting on rainy days the saved material can be toasted in a metal pan once dried or toasted the material should be between 10 to 12 percent moisture and can be bagged and stored for a period of four to six months without any spoilage flash drying is also an option in the industrial case it is important to remember that all machines and processing areas must be kept clean hygienic conditions are imperative to prevent fungal contamination and ensure quality three major high-quality cassava peeled products are created by this process wet cassava cake for cattle sheep goat and pig feed that has a shelf life of one week dried fine mash which is suitable for poultry pigs and fish dried coarse mash also for cattle sheep goats and pigs the dried high-quality cassava peel mash products have a long shelf life of between four and six months processors can choose an appropriate drying option depending on weather conditions and the facilities available to them",
