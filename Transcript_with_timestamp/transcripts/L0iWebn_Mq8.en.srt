00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:07,240
I'm Phil bden I'm the agronomist with um

00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:11,880
pulse Agronomy

00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:16,760
Australia uh X pulse Australia and X

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:20,080
DPI uh I specialize in Pest Management

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:23,039
Farmers should be um monitoring um at

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:26,720
the moment particularly for

8
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:30,359
aphids The Usual Suspects of um green

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,680
peach aphid and cabbage aphid uh we

10
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,800
often see at this time of year and the

11
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:38,079
one of most concern is green Peach aord

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,719
because it's high chemical

13
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:43,480
resistance and also the fact that it

14
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,680
will transfer virus very quickly into

15
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,239
into

16
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:50,520
plants um in general though you know a

17
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,960
lot of these aphids are pretty well

18
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,800
controlled by a lot of the natural

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,800
enemies yeah you should be seeing uh

20
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,920
evidence of parasitism you know from the

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,239
parasitic wasps

22
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:09,520
uh you might see Lady Bole ly hoverfly

23
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:13,439
ly and lacewing ly that are are um very

24
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:16,280
capable of keeping uh those uh Apen

25
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:19,840
pests in check uh if you're not seeing

26
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,680
it though um well I guess you have to

27
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,000
make a decision whether you need to

28
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,360
spray uh the current recommendation uh

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,600
would be for one of the soft chemicals

30
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,840
um uh pamore

31
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:37,000
transform um are the two that are are

32
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,360
currently um used with with good effect

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,520
they don't affect um uh the beneficial

34
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:46,040
insects the with the latest canala

35
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,159
varieties that are often very vigorous

36
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:53,439
you those varieties can often outgrow

37
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:56,439
damage but um yeah it's just a matter of

38
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,600
uh monitoring regularly uh to see what's

39
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:00,399
in the crop I mean that's I guess the

40
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,600
basic principle of

41
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:07,640
integrated Pest Management is out there

42
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,840
monitoring regularly uh systematically

43
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,800
so that you you know what's you know

44
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,840
what you're dealing with in the

45
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:20,000
crop grazing can have an effect on uh

46
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:23,560
keeping pests in check but it's

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,519
usually uh when the grazing pressure is

48
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:31,280
very high yeah so you'll still have

49
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:33,680
residual pest numbers after grazing so

50
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:38,840
that's when it's important like to to

51
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:40,760
just go and uh monitor regularly uh to

52
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:44,480
um see what you're dealing with in in

53
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:47,560
the field after grazing and then you

54
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,720
know after grazing farmers are often top

55
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:55,760
dressing so that's getting the crop off

56
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:58,400
um to a um higher growth uh rate um as

57
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,239
well that can help and you know with a

58
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,159
lot of the current varieties that are

59
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:07,000
very vigorous they will outgrow any

60
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:09,879
damage so very rarely that at this time

61
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,120
of year that we need to intervene with a

62
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:16,480
chemical getting back to our basic

63
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,519
principles of integrated Pest Management

64
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,840
it's out there checking regularly

65
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,159
monitoring that you uh so you know what

66
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,319
you're dealing with then you can make

67
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:29,040
decisions about whether there

68
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:31,959
are um natural enemies there that are

69
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:37,200
keeping it under control or whether you

70
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:40,480
have to use a um a chemical um and or or

71
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:43,560
other management um

72
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:47,560
tool there are lots of resources

73
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:51,599
available uh the most um high-profile

74
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:54,760
one is probably PESA which is a uh a

75
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:57,360
service that's offered by uh Caesar

76
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:00,519
group from Melbourne University and that

77
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,680
relies on uh farmers and

78
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:04,760
agronomists uh sending them information

79
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,360
whenever they

80
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:10,360
see uh you

81
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,760
know anomalies in crops or they they

82
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:16,199
want identification done uh they have a

83
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:20,560
very good service and that's usually you

84
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:22,680
know taking a photo of any uh unusual

85
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,240
occurrence they might see in a crop

86
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:29,560
whether it's distorted leaves or you

87
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:32,160
know signs or symptoms of the pests and

88
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:35,600
they need it identified it can be done

89
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:40,759
through pests or through local Land

90
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:46,039
Services uh with um their um local uh

91
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:50,080
agronomists and they will send it on to

92
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:52,560
uh well Caesar or myself or someone to

93
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,919
get it get it identified so there are

94
00:04:52,560 --> 00:05:00,320
resources there uh there's quite a bit

95
00:04:54,919 --> 00:05:02,639
of um uh written material there uh notes

96
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:08,880
for example which is a

97
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:12,199
GC uh resource on on on the website um

98
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:15,039
and pulse Australia website is still

99
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:19,560
active uh they can they can be used to

100
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,560
uh help with um PES identification
