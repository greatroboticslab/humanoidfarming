  "text": "[Music] [Music] hello everyone welcome to jadam in this episode I'll talk about how to use and store the jadam natural pesticide here I have prepared jadam wedding agent Jam sulfur and jam herbal solution with this combination you're getting the perfect natural pesticide for your garden and for farming and in this video I'll show you how to mix all the solution in a proper way this is Jam herbal solution which is the extract of any herbs with insecticide repellent effect herbs that are often used are peppermint Rosemary lavender Jerusalem Arch choke and broen and recently we have been testing Cosmos plant and it is showing significant results with all this plant you can control from AIT to might but above all our most favorite plant is Ginko until now because there is not a single path that we won't be able to control with this plant all the details and the ratio are listed in my book Jam organic farming and the new book Jam organic pest and Disease Control briefly speaking it is very straightforward to make plant extracts all you need is to boil the plant for five hours and more detailed information is spoken in my lecture so please click the link of to see the lecture video the first thing I would like to talk about is how to store The herbal solution once you're done with the boiling the herbs pour the solution in the bottle to put it in a sideway so that it can be vacuum sealed in this way you can store The herbal solution for a couple of years but the problem is when you opened it for use because when it contacts with the air the properties of the solution start to change gradually which causes decrease in its insecticidal function an easy way to identify that the solution is usable or not is the air pressure of the bottle due to the fermentation but to make sure the best way is to drop small portion of jam wedding agent before any use in different Beaker once you drop the jwa if the color of the GH s doesn't change that means it is still good for use and another problem is how to store an opened bottle properly even if you put it into refrigerator the changes cannot be stopped so the best way is to get the help of ethanol there are usually two types of ethanol sold in the market one is with 84% Purity and the other one is with 99% purity when you are using 99% ethanol add 15% of ethanol from what is left over and 84% with 25% with the help of ethanol you can increase the shelf life of J herbal solution even in atmospheric temperature when none of the herbs are available near you you can also use sodium hydroxide as an alternative solution for pest control with sodi hydroxide you can treat a problem of scale insects and snails however I do not recommend constant use of this substance because of the concentration damage jwa is recommended to use around 200 to 600 mL for 20 L and 5 to 15 L for 500 L JS is 40 ml to 60 ml for 20 L and JHS is 200 mL to 600 mL for 20 L recently we have been receiving a lot of questions from flower and gardeners about our Jam solution so let me elaborate on how to combine all three solution for Pest and Disease Control this this is the sprayer that I use for testing the solution before the field test this particular brand of spray is my favorite due to its longl lasting durability it cost little more but this is a product worth a check out since we are testing one liter of small amount measuring the ratio also must be calculated with the shring before doing the mixing process please do use soft water it is mandatory to achieve its full capability and now let me show you how the natural disinfectant is made I I'll measure 800 ml of soft water first I will add 10 mL of jam wedding agent next 2 ml of jam sulfur and now it is complete this yellowish human urine like liquid is natural disinfectant it can treat dowy MW powdery MW and anthra no speaking of anthros you can also control this just by increasing jwa as you can see Jam's natural Pest Solutions are very easy to do with the best effect on past and Disease Control and by adding Jam herbal solution it becomes allpurpose natural past and disease solution then I'll add a little more water to make it one full liter best thing about Jam natural Pesci side unlike any commercially available chemical pesticide Jam natural pesticide is very safe to use there will be no big problem even it is contacted on our skin so you can also just wash the fruit to eat right after spraying datam natural Pest solution is all about combination of jwa JS and JHS to increase insecticidal effect all you need to do is the increase the amount of jwa and JHS and for disinfectant increase JS but make sure to perform concentration test in advance for JS before spraying to the crops in this way you can control almost all Pest and disease you can add additional sodium hydroxide and red clay powder for scale insects and snails let me show you how to add them just add the sodium hydroxide in the beaker with water to melt it down this is very useful for scale insects an additional red clay powder is for increasing the penetration effect first add the water and steer a couple of times then let it sit for a while until the layer is cleared out and collect the surface of the red clay powder to add it into the bottle with this simple solution you don't have to worry about Pest and disease that occurs during farming but make sure to use it all before 3 days however when you are adding sodium hydroxide the solution can irritate your skin when it makes contact so please be aware of that I've also listed all the detailed videos on how to make all of this it is also stated in my book so that you can read one for yourself thank you for watching and I'll see you guys in the next video [Music] [Music] [Music]",
