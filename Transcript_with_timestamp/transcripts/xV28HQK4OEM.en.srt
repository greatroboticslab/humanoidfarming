00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,559
Hello, my name is Ta. You're tuning in

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,759
on the Central Florida Garden Show.

5
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:18,960
Today we are learning about peanuts.

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,640
This is a peanut. They're called runner

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,359
peanuts.

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,840
They called runner cuz they run around

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,080
like watermelon.

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,960
They grow in the south, Texas, Alabama,

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,200
Georgia, and Florida.

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,280
And today I'm going to show you how to

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:40,559
plant them. These are worm castings

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,239
from Sunside Hydroponics.

15
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,399
And I'm going to show you how to amend

16
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,399
the soil.

17
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,470
[Applause]

18
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:46,800
And that's how you plant peanuts.

19
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:51,200
Bye-bye.

20
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,440

21
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,960
