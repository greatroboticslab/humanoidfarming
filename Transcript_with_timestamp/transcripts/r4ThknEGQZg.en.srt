hey what's up garden friends jeff here

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,599
tropical plant party has everybody doing

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,600
hope you're good i'm great i am getting

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,320
ready to work on my drip you think this

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,600
is for you

11
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,520
i think everything's for you it's not

12
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,720
for you yeah i have

13
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,640
an extra zone left on my timers

14
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,320
i'll show you all this when i get to it

15
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,080
and i thought it would be a good idea to

16
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,840
use that zone to run to the ostrich

17
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,239
ferns that got planted in the

18
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,320
the shade garden not too terribly long

19
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,000
ago so i'm going through my basket here

20
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,480
sorting pieces out i'm going to need

21
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,879
this this is what you use to attach the

22
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,719
half inch drip line to the timers or to

23
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,480
your faucet whatever you're using

24
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,079
i don't have any strainers or anything

25
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,840
like that but i'm not on

26
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,000
well water so i don't really need to

27
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,320
worry about that i have tons of teas

28
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,039
do you guys anybody else have their huge

29
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,559
drip i always use tons and tons of teas

30
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,320
gonna need the punch tool

31
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,559
this is necessary in order to make the

32
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,960
connections to the lines

33
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,479
and then i need to find where is it i

34
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,560
have my drip heads here these are

35
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,720
adjustable drip heads and the only thing

36
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,760
i'm missing are the adapters which are

37
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,280
really

38
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,080
really important here we go quarter inch

39
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,280
couplers i'm going to need more than

40
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,520
four so i'm gonna go do some digging

41
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,799
and then maybe you can hang out while i

42
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,840
get this drip set up oh and i need

43
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,200
clamps

44
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,799
i'll talk about why all this matters

45
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,280
here in just a second toby you haven't

46
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,840
said hi yet say hello toby

47
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,119
all right okay that's enough now i had a

48
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,640
bunch of stuff that i was getting ready

49
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,200
to plant up but

50
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,159
i realized i haven't really talked about

51
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,320
drip

52
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,320
on the channel before i've like talked

53
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,240
about how i have things on drip

54
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,520
but never really the process or what i

55
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,560
do with it so i thought that would be a

56
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,960
good thing to

57
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,960
vlog so last night i went ahead and i

58
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,880
took the half inch tubing

59
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,320
and i stretched it out i went and i put

60
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,920
it around the base of this palm tree and

61
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,159
then i pulled it all the way over there

62
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,920
as you can see it's coiled very tightly

63
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,600
as you undo it it just looks like a big

64
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,119
spring so i went ahead and i did that

65
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,079
pulled out way more than i need to use

66
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,799
right now

67
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,200
but that's okay i'd rather have too much

68
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,200
over

69
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,039
too little that's for sure i'm gonna go

70
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,879
ahead and make my cuts get the right

71
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,680
length and then get that new sprinkler

72
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,440
zone set up

73
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,120
all right so i've got a line run goes

74
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,599
all the way back here behind the grill

75
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,879
then it comes around the front goes

76
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,080
behind the maple

77
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,520
and i have it basically running so it's

78
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,120
right in front of all these different

79
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,280
ferns i've got my length

80
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,120
just about how i need it can you see you

81
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,120
see this look at them

82
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,800
i mean they look better than they did

83
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,800
before they have new growth but the

84
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,120
sprinklers just don't hit over here

85
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,239
and since these are newly transplanted

86
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,120
just seems smart to go ahead and get

87
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,959
them on to drip

88
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,000
that way they'll establish well and i

89
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,680
don't have to mess with them anymore

90
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,160
it's a pain getting my garden hose over

91
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,879
here so over here is my little

92
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,400
area that's just a disaster i'm redoing

93
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,400
my drip system

94
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,440
completely next year so i'm not going to

95
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,599
go

96
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,879
too crazy here with what i'm doing i

97
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,680
just don't think that that would be

98
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,120
smart

99
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,319
but for the time being just since i

100
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,560
can't spend a lot of time

101
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,080
out in the heat or in the sun watering

102
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,440
that'll be different next year but for

103
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,200
right now

104
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,800
this is just going to have to do so i

105
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,040
have two different timers here

106
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,080
and this one has an extra zone on it so

107
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,840
does that one

108
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,920
this timer runs on bluetooth which is

109
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,360
kind of nifty so i can just take my

110
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,000
phone out make any adjustments that i

111
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,159
need to

112
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,920
i can't wait to get all this pottery

113
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,959
over here cleaned up i finally have an

114
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,760
area set up to store all my extra

115
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,040
pottery

116
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,680
so i'm gonna be able to get this whole

117
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,879
area cleaned up i cannot wait to do that

118
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,840
this is a hose end adapter pretty simple

119
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,560
to use you just

120
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,040
push this end in this piece screws down

121
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,440
and then

122
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,400
this piece right here screw that end

123
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,840
right on here you can see i've already

124
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,200
put some plumbers tape on here

125
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,040
these things tend to they leak like

126
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,200
crazy

127
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,480
make sure that this is on there nice and

128
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,879
tight

129
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,560
don't want there to be any slack don't

130
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,519
want to be on crooked

131
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,760
sometimes i have to come through and

132
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,959
make adjustments and see one of these is

133
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,920
dripping there's a puddle here that's

134
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,439
not supposed to be there so i'm gonna

135
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,840
have to check on that in just a minute

136
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,560
now we put a clamp on the end and here's

137
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,120
that

138
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,159
clamp this is very simple drip is very

139
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,720
very easy

140
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,560
slide it down on one end make a bend so

141
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,239
that there's at least

142
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,280
three inches that's probably too much

143
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:18,639
doesn't need to be that much but it's

144
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,680
not going to hurt to have too much

145
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,360
and then you just slide that up there

146
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,880
and that's it that's how you end the

147
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,040
line right there

148
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,040
so simple now i'm going to tap into it

149
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,800
add my drip heads and this will be done

150
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,320
and to actually get it set up so that it

151
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,040
functions as drip this is where the

152
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,360
punch tool

153
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,160
comes in necessary you can see this tool

154
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,080
here if it will focus come on now

155
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,240
has a spiky end on it just fits around

156
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,360
the hose push down really hard

157
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,280
that'll stamp a hole into it pull it out

158
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,520
and you take these couplers right here

159
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,800
with this punch tool you just snap those

160
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,560
couplers right into the end

161
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,320
this makes it so much easier so you can

162
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,960
just use the punch tool to push that in

163
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,720
there

164
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,720
that'll lock that right into place just

165
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,120
how it needs to be then i take my

166
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,360
quarter inch tubing right here this fits

167
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,199
right onto the top of that coupler

168
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,960
just like so and then i put an

169
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,560
adjustable drip head

170
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,039
on the end of that does not want to

171
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,800
focus i like the adjustable

172
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,080
drip heads a lot just because well

173
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,680
they're adjustable

174
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,039
i don't have to be too specific with

175
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,680
making sure i'm using the right ones

176
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,120
with these

177
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,560
and you can see i put that out nice and

178
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,000
low because i don't want the water

179
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,440
shooting into the crown of that fern

180
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,840
and i'm going to go ahead and do that

181
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,400
down this entire length and that's it

182
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,840
done pretty simple main thing usually

183
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,039
you want to make sure that you keep the

184
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,320
drip heads where they're punched into

185
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,759
the half inch

186
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,440
generally you don't want them any closer

187
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,840
than about eight inches to a foot that's

188
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,000
just

189
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,680
best for pressure i've had them closer

190
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,720
together than that before and it wasn't

191
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,720
an issue

192
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,919
and then i'm just gonna kind of play

193
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,360
around with the settings on because you

194
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,199
got to twist the tops on those to make

195
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,320
sure the flow's right and

196
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,160
that's it see simple so easy all right

197
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:56,639
so i actually i went ahead and i moved

198
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:58,720
the line from here to over there because

199
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,080
this isn't working talk more about that

200
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,680
in a minute i think melnor jumped the

201
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,120
gun with these bluetooth timers

202
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,199
i have it set up over here so i'm going

203
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,240
to run it manually

204
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,560
real quick which is sometimes a little

205
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,759
bit

206
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,919
tricky for me to remember how to do

207
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,240
there we go one two three

208
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,280
do five minutes make sure it turns on

209
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,000
wait for the click

210
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,000
okay hit it okay first there we go

211
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,120
there's the click

212
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,960
yes see so see that that's why i

213
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,120
got to go through and check them looks

214
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,160
like there are

215
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,479
at least one of these that didn't hold

216
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,479
on

217
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:35,039
very well this tubing is kind of

218
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:37,039
flexible too i got like discount tubing

219
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,720
usually it's more firm so this is

220
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,919
probably going to be a

221
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,840
theme for all of these so i might switch

222
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,520
out the tubing at some point but

223
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,000
that's the point testing it out so i'll

224
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:51,199
reattach that i have these set to

225
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,560
run like high they are on very high

226
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,319
right now because i need to

227
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,319
saturate the area it's pretty dry but

228
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,800
right now i'm going to have these set to

229
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,520
run

230
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,120
three times a day early morning early

231
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,960
afternoon and then just a little bit

232
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,000
later than that just to really make sure

233
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,240
this whole area gets

234
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,520
saturated because the soil dries and

235
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,880
drains very quickly

236
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,120
and just for right now probably for the

237
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,360
next probably two to three weeks i'll

238
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,800
keep them running every single day

239
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,039
unless it rains and then i'll shut them

240
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,319
up

241
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,919
that's just because i really need to get

242
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,080
these ferns established and then i'll

243
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,680
probably dial it back to every other day

244
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,280
i would like to turn them down just a

245
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,720
little bit so you can see that it looks

246
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,240
like it's not running

247
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,080
but it is it's just coming off the end

248
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,240
of the stake so

249
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,199
they don't need to be up quite this high

250
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,280
when i wasn't looking through the

251
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,960
viewfinder i realized that they were up

252
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,759
a little bit too high but like i said i

253
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,280
do want to make sure they're getting

254
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,720
heavily watered so i might just

255
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,800
let it be that way just for a couple of

256
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,440
days all right so that was one

257
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,520
very simple way of doing things with the

258
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,199
half inch line i like using half inch

259
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,720
line the thicker hose because you just

260
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,919
get more water pressure

261
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,759
you don't have to do things that way

262
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,879
those with smaller applications see this

263
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,639
right here

264
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,960
this is a hose end fitting for quarter

265
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,479
inch tubing so you don't have to use one

266
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,560
of those big thick lines

267
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,160
and this works really well i've used

268
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,759
these on many other things i even think

269
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,520
i have a couple of these still set up

270
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,560
for areas where i only needed a few drip

271
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,479
heads

272
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,479
and it's it works well but with those

273
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,680
you're going to need a lot of these tees

274
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,680
it's kind of like putting together a

275
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,599
puzzle working with drip in general

276
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,280
is sort of a puzzle which is kind of fun

277
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,800
it gets frustrating

278
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,039
for me but that's usually just dealing

279
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,199
with the timers because i haven't found

280
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,199
a brand that's like fully reliable

281
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,879
i've been using them for many years but

282
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,639
over here i have kind of an example of

283
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,080
what i was talking about with this

284
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,000
puzzle actually i'll turn these on so

285
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,360
you can see a little bit better yeah at

286
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,719
one point

287
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,880
not too long ago i had one of those

288
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:40,399
bluetooth timers over here too

289
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,399
and uh broke stopped working luckily

290
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,519
i had one of these laying around this

291
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,640
one though

292
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,720
has been giving me a little bit of

293
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,000
trouble but it looks like today it's

294
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,040
decided to work so i don't really know

295
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,959
what that's about

296
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,040
so this is the zone i have set up for

297
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,399
basically this entire bed and some pots

298
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,240
i'll walk you around with that once i

299
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,120
get this turned on there we go so this

300
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,600
is my

301
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,360
zone two it goes pretty much mostly to

302
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,959
this alexander palm in a few other areas

303
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,040
you see all these heads in here

304
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,640
i have them all set up onto one line

305
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,640
right there with the t

306
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,800
in it and that t goes down to one of

307
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,640
these half inch lines

308
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,240
down there by my feet which look funny

309
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,920
throw squished up just that one line i

310
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,320
was able to come through

311
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,440
make a connection make another

312
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,839
connection

313
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,120
and then make another connection until i

314
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,080
have full circle

315
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,519
of these in here because this is a

316
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,480
really big palm tree but this is what i

317
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,800
was talking about

318
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,080
about having to sort of do your own

319
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,360
little puzzles that way

320
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,160
i actually think it's more time

321
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,160
consuming to use the faucet adapters

322
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,839
that run off the quarter inch tubing

323
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,120
but it's each their own you know maybe

324
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,160
you only have a few plants you need to

325
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,080
get set up

326
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,360
and then that works just fine but for

327
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,080
larger applications

328
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,800
it's not always the most practical and

329
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,880
this wasn't

330
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,880
hard to do it wasn't hard getting all

331
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,040
these set up like this but

332
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,880
it just seems so much easier to just pop

333
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,560
a line down into that half inch hosing

334
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,880
but for something like this

335
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,920
it was necessary and even my pool pots

336
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,360
which don't look good

337
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,760
because i told you that other timer

338
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,880
broke and by the time i figured it out

339
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,160
it's too late for some of the plants

340
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,200
unfortunately

341
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,000
but same thing this line right here runs

342
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,600
over there

343
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,200
i have another head around on that side

344
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,440
i have two running on this mule palm

345
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,360
two on that one and then a beige line

346
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,600
that's very hard to see it runs over

347
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,279
there and taps into the half inch tubing

348
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,360
now i wouldn't do this if i had children

349
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,320
around or just anybody who might trip on

350
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,360
it but i mean

351
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,880
that's not something i have to worry

352
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,360
about ideally there would be a water

353
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,880
line tapped in right there but

354
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,279
champagne wishes i just don't think

355
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,959
that's necessary and i could also just

356
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,079
not have a wine on here and hand water

357
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,000
but i'm not supposed to be out in the

358
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,440
heat y'all know what's going on the

359
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,320
health thing so

360
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,839
that's why those are set up like that

361
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,200
why was i showing you the one where the

362
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,839
timer had broken the plants look

363
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,240
terrible here's a better example

364
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,000
drip it's amazing isn't it these plants

365
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,360
look great and there's the head in there

366
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
this one i believe

367
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,800
both of these edinity palms this one

368
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,680
this one over here

369
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,240
should both have three heads in these

370
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,560
pots

371
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,680
yeah there's one right there another one

372
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,720
right here and then one that wraps

373
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,320
around that other side

374
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,920
it's a lot but they're sitting out in

375
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,680
the sun almost tripped

376
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,040
they're sitting out in the sun and this

377
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,079
pavement dark

378
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,959
gets hot i mean you can see it's a

379
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,720
pretty effective

380
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,240
works really well this doesn't mean that

381
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,920
i don't hand water still when it gets

382
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,600
really hot out i still come out

383
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,600
make sure that these get a drink even

384
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,240
with the drip because sometimes with

385
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,079
drip

386
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,000
you'll end up just having zones that are

387
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,519
moist instead of having even moisture

388
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,360
all the way around the reason we use

389
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,160
drip one is just easier it's less time

390
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,320
watering

391
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,680
and then you have water moving directly

392
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,640
towards the roots

393
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,680
of the plants because that one visible

394
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,760
right here

395
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,440
kind of visible you sort of see it so

396
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,880
that water is going right onto the soil

397
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,640
and then right down to the roots

398
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,720
you're not getting moisture all over the

399
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,320
foliage now where i live

400
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,399
that's not really a problem there are

401
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,399
usually issues with fungus and

402
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,519
whatnot if the foliage gets wet at night

403
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,600
time but

404
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,440
it's still nice because you can use less

405
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,720
water and have more effective watering

406
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,399
that way just want to make sure that you

407
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,079
haven't set to run long enough so that

408
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,760
the plants are being watered

409
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,360
thoroughly and that it's not just a

410
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,399
light watering so you get shallow root

411
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,160
development

412
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,839
and weird wonky-looking plants and that

413
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,880
kind of heats the purpose right

414
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:17,279
once upon a time i had my drip also set

415
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,839
up to a fertilizing system and that was

416
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,279
amazing i spent two and a half hours

417
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,279
fertilizing today

418
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,320
that's too long that's that i don't want

419
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,160
to keep doing that but i want to

420
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,560
fertilize once a week because i haven't

421
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,760
really

422
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,880
like i said before you know what's been

423
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,480
going on out here i've really been able

424
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,279
to take care of things so i'd like to go

425
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,200
ahead and

426
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,040
since there's like i don't know five

427
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,600
weeks left that i can fertilize out here

428
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,200
before

429
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,440
i need to back off because of the fall

430
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,079
temperatures it just makes sense to get

431
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,320
on that

432
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,000
now and make the most of what i can with

433
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,320
the plants so my point there was you can

434
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,800
hook

435
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,839
fertilizer injection systems up to these

436
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,040
as well

437
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,279
good idea to make sure you have a

438
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,880
strainer i don't have any strainers

439
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,480
they're like little screens and it's a

440
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,120
good idea to use them i just don't have

441
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,240
any

442
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,639
the screen that goes in between the male

443
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,480
end

444
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,560
of your timer or faucet whatever you're

445
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,399
using and then this piece right here

446
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,600
that just keeps debris minerals and

447
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,959
things like that from getting into your

448
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,600
lines and then clogging up your drip

449
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,839
emitters

450
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,680
i have been asked to do videos on my

451
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,040
drip before and i've never done it

452
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,440
largely just because

453
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,279
i know i'm gonna get the same question

454
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,720
over and over and over again which is

455
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,880
how do i set up my timers and how often

456
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,639
do i water it

457
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,000
i don't know i i couldn't tell you it

458
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,440
depends on where you live depends on

459
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,959
your soil depends what kind of plants

460
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,800
you have um

461
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,160
it's that's a little bit more of a

462
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,160
tricky side to this

463
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,160
sometimes i found i'd have to kind of

464
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,800
play around with getting the timer set

465
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,639
up

466
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,079
and seeing how the plants are doing i

467
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,760
usually start off low

468
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,160
so they're not getting watered for very

469
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,880
long and not too terribly often see how

470
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,399
they do

471
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,160
and then i bump it up from there if

472
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,399
necessary which it usually is in st

473
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,680
louis missouri it gets very hot here

474
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,440
during the summer it's been unusually

475
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,480
cool here the past few days which has

476
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,839
been nice but

477
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,720
typically july june july august and

478
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,000
september are

479
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,760
pretty toasty 90s and lower hundreds

480
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,959
with a good amount of humidity

481
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,560
so a lot of watering is necessary hence

482
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,480
the drip and i was trying to think if

483
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,920
there were any other

484
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,440
parts that i would recommend always

485
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,480
making sure you have on hand if you're

486
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,279
setting up drips or

487
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,560
couplers very necessary especially if

488
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,880
you're tapping into a half inch line

489
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,639
then

490
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,399
it's not it's a necessity you have to

491
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,360
have those punch tool i like punch tools

492
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,000
that will make the hole

493
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,600
and that you can snap the adapter in

494
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,880
that piece we just talked about so you

495
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,760
just pop it right in i already showed

496
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,199
you that

497
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,399
makes it so much easier a good punch

498
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,839
tool does make a big difference

499
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,160
something to cut your lines

500
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,120
also nifty to have around oh and then

501
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,360
after a thought

502
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,519
this half inch tubing it's not very

503
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,720
forgiving it doesn't flex well

504
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,480
and once it has a bend or a kink in it

505
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,120
it's usually there forever it's really

506
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:50,160
hard to get it out so it's nifty to have

507
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,399
couplers on hand these couplers you just

508
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,560
make a cut you get the kink out and then

509
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,800
you rejoin the tubing together

510
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,240
that's very nifty so it's always a good

511
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,519
idea usually to have a couple of these

512
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,720
laying around if you have

513
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,720
a lot of angles you're working with

514
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,399
where it might get kinked or to actually

515
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,079
have like 90 degree angle

516
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,760
couplers which they do make i don't have

517
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,320
any to show right now

518
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,199
but that way you can get your half inch

519
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,240
tubing

520
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,839
to that way you can get your half inch

521
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,440
tubing to go around sharper angles and

522
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,959
stuff like that because like i said it

523
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,959
doesn't have

524
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,240
any forgiveness it doesn't bend well so

525
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,120
those are also important things that i

526
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,800
kind of i left out

527
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,199
that i'm actually i forgot to mention

528
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,600
that i'm editing see all the editing

529
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,440
stuff going on here oops that's one to

530
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,360
make sure i remember to include that in

531
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,639
the video because it is important these

532
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,519
things they kink

533
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,639
very easily and then here they are goof

534
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,680
plugs see that

535
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,040
goof plugs so sometimes you make a hole

536
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,120
in the wrong spot

537
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,560
on those half inch lines or maybe you

538
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,160
have to move an adapter

539
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,440
that's when you use these they've gotten

540
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,079
kind of dirty they've been sitting out

541
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,000
but it's just

542
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,759
a little plug it's just like it sounds

543
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
so if you mess up then you can just pop

544
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,519
that

545
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,120
in place of that hole so you just have

546
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,000
like a geyser water shooting out of your

547
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,440
tubing

548
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,199
those are good to have around and then

549
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,360
the t's i always have tons of tees

550
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,880
around because i'm always having to

551
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,720
find different areas i need to run a new

552
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,800
drip off of now i'm

553
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,920
actually uh i'm not gonna say relieved

554
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,839
that i realize that the

555
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,079
other timer is broken this is actually a

556
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,399
new one looks just like that other one

557
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,320
i don't think i'm gonna set it up though

558
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,000
because this this is a replacement to

559
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,560
the one that was over by the

560
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,160
alexander palm that broke and now the

561
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,360
other one's broken

562
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,800
so i think i'd rather just send these

563
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,920
back and not have to keep messing with

564
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,839
that i have been

565
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,440
really confused as to why these

566
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,160
colocasias have been so

567
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,600
incredibly thirsty and it's be the

568
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,600
drip's not running on them

569
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,279
and i was gonna check that and i hadn't

570
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,240
gotten around to it but now i know for

571
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,800
sure that that's

572
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,639
not an issue i need to worry about i was

573
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,399
going to run a whole nother drip line

574
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,079
back behind all of these plants and it

575
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,120
just it wouldn't have been fun it's not

576
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,880
something i wanted to do

577
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,560
actually i guess i am i guess i could

578
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,959
say relieved to just know that i just

579
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,320
need to put a new timer on that zone

580
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,480
although it'd be a lot easier to run a

581
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,240
different drip line then i also was

582
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,120
going to talk about why i like the

583
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,160
variable drip heads this is a better

584
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,319
representation

585
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,679
of that the adjustable dripper stakes

586
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,559
you see it you see it

587
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,240
you know what i'm talking about you've

588
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,919
been looking at them this entire video

589
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,319
the downside to these has

590
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,559
always been that they're kind of pricey

591
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:19,600
this little three pack right here from

592
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:21,760
the big box stores like five six

593
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,640
bucks that's a lot of money they come

594
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,959
with a

595
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,480
adapter on them which is nice it just

596
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,799
snaps right off of them so you can

597
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,600
pop it right in but that doesn't make up

598
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,000
for the cost

599
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,760
however on amazon you can get a pack of

600
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,919
50 for 9.99

601
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,200
i will say some of them didn't have the

602
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,960
little adjustable heads on them which

603
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,000
makes them kind of useless but i have

604
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,200
extras of those so

605
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,640
it's okay that's the only thing about

606
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,360
these adjustable heads that i

607
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,799
don't like is the cost but that makes up

608
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,120
for it right there

609
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,080
otherwise usually people would use i

610
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,080
used to use

611
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,919
just emitters you hook to a little stake

612
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,559
and it just kind of dangles over the

613
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,480
plant

614
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,480
and they range from like a quarter of a

615
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,039
gallon a half a gallon a gallon

616
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,679
of water per hour something like that

617
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,080
the reason

618
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,120
i don't use those anymore is because i

619
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,760
have so

620
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,840
many different timers set up as it is

621
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:15,120
right now i have 14 different zones

622
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,720
and if i end up with an area that is

623
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,480
being underwatered say we have a heat

624
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,799
spell or something like that

625
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,160
with 14 different zones running they

626
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,840
can't run at the same time because i

627
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,880
don't have enough water pressure

628
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:29,039
so i have to have a little bit of leeway

629
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,400
i try and space each zone out by five

630
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,640
minutes apart so

631
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,679
this one runs it from seven to seven oh

632
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,640
five then i'll set

633
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,679
zone two to run at seven ten so there's

634
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,240
like a five minute gap

635
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,240
in case i need to increase the time but

636
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,880
with those regular drip heads you

637
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,320
have to bump the time up if they're not

638
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,360
performing well enough or switch to a

639
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,160
different head

640
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,919
so if i needed more water in an area i

641
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,240
would have to increase

642
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,160
zone one by like another five to ten

643
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,520
minutes or something like that

644
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,000
and that just becomes cumbersome when

645
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,280
you're working with 14 different zones

646
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,720
it's it's too much it's kind of a

647
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,120
headache so that's why i like the

648
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,640
adjustable heads because then i can just

649
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,160
twist them and they'll let out more

650
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,600
water for the duration

651
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,200
or if we're having a wet spell that i

652
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,400
can go through and well if we're having

653
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,840
a wet spell i'll probably just set the

654
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,360
timers to be off

655
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,280
and there are rain sensors you can put

656
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,640
on these too which is nifty

657
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,000
i haven't messed with any of those

658
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,600
because i keep having to replace my

659
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,559
timers because i can't find timers it'll

660
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,880
last a long time

661
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,760
i've mostly just used melnor in orbit

662
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,520
and uh

663
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,360
the thing with melnor even though i'm

664
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,559
not having good luck with these timers

665
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,600
which is a shame because i was really

666
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,280
looking forward to doing a video on

667
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,080
these bluetooth timers when i first set

668
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,160
them up

669
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,600
i was so excited about them like i said

670
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,000
they jumped the gun they're not ready

671
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,000
the

672
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,400
software was glitchy it was neat because

673
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,360
you could set like pictures to each zone

674
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,360
which was fun

675
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,720
because it just made it easier really

676
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,760
but the issue was like

677
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,760
if i had zone one set for like my

678
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,360
gingers i take a picture of my gingers

679
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,360
and then i'd run zone one

680
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,360
then i'd open up the app and it would

681
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,360
say that zone two is running

682
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,799
when it's not zone one's running but

683
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,120
that it would show that the

684
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,880
like that it just it wasn't working well

685
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,360
and now just in general

686
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,960
these things keep breaking so it's not

687
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,240
there yet but there are other bluetooth

688
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,679
timers out there there's lots of other

689
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,600
brands of timers out there

690
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,440
this is just what i've been working with

691
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,400
but the thing i most about melnor is

692
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,000
whenever i've had

693
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,679
issues with their timers over the years

694
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,120
i've called them and they've sent me

695
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,559
replacements and their customer service

696
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,760
has always been really great this isn't

697
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,840
sponsored just saying that's been my

698
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,840
experience so that's just

699
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,679
where all that stands there's all the

700
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,080
drip stuff this isn't all of my drip

701
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:35,200
stuff that was just a rundown on me and

702
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:37,120
my drip systems i have tons of drip

703
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,919
supplies over the years you build up i

704
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,760
have

705
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,960
like little tool boxes for them i have

706
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,360
entire giant

707
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,960
totes like you know the big big like

708
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,520
storage totes just

709
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,039
overflowing with drip supplies somehow i

710
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,880
always end up having to run to the store

711
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,679
because there's like just one part i

712
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,360
don't have

713
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,960
which is usually more of an issue with

714
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,039
the micro

715
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,240
misters or the micro irrigation stakes

716
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:01,360
let's talk about those now

717
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,200
micro sprayers these little

718
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,799
jets right here i'm really more

719
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,000
referring to the stake

720
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,320
right here and then the different

721
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,080
emitters you can put on them right now

722
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,640
this has a 360 i believe is what it's

723
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,080
called

724
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,760
so it will put out lots of streams of

725
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,799
water that come down from it

726
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,960
put that in there so you can see i'm

727
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:21,280
talking about so they come

728
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,960
down and it will broadcast more evenly

729
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,760
to the plants as opposed to

730
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,799
fanning out the ones that fan out are

731
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,480
really nifty

732
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,840
these types of emitters these usually

733
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,520
have an adjustable knob on them so you

734
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,280
can adjust the flow rate the different

735
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,440
heads are very easy to change they just

736
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,880
screw and unscrew from this collar right

737
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,039
here a little bit more pricey

738
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,400
i mean they're like a few bucks a pop

739
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:43,039
but these are great

740
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,760
if you have to water a larger area you

741
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,280
know you saw

742
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,760
how big the fan spray was on those

743
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,760
adjustable heads this is more for if you

744
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,480
have big garden beds or something like

745
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,440
that

746
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,760
really nifty for larger areas and here's

747
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,159
like

748
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,039
an example package of just like assorted

749
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,720
heads

750
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,760
that so you can get like 165 180 320 fan

751
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,919
sprays

752
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,200
that's nice because sometimes you have

753
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,960
an area where you don't

754
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,559
want everything watered or maybe you

755
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,039
have like a sidewalk or something like

756
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,200
that

757
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:13,679
so you wouldn't want a circle spinner on

758
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,840
it and i don't think i have any

759
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,440
circle spinners as i was just talking

760
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,039
about how i have so many things

761
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,640
i run out of the circle spinners locks

762
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,080
they use a lot of them there are large

763
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,480
ones and small ones

764
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,120
and it's just like it says it'll do a

765
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,679
fan

766
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,320
a big fan area and water everything

767
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,720
within that

768
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,520
circular area that's just another way to

769
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,679
go with drip

770
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,080
i use both i use a little bit of

771
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:38,559
everything really

772
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,159
hey tobes how you doing toby so as far

773
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,919
as the timers are concerned

774
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,919
i know i've already talked about these a

775
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:46,159
whole bunch but just in general

776
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,600
i do i don't know where it went hence

777
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,840
part of the problem right now

778
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,200
but i do have a plastic tote with holes

779
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,559
cut along the side for ventilation that

780
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,919
i try to keep over these so that they

781
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,720
don't get drenched with water when it

782
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,480
rains

783
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,320
and to help keep the sun off of them i

784
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,919
remove them in the winter time

785
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,760
also depending on where you live in the

786
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,520
winter time it is usually a good idea to

787
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,679
blow these lines out with like an air

788
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,120
compressor

789
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,480
this probably won't come as a shocker to

790
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,000
anybody but i've never done that and

791
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,840
i've never had a problem

792
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,520
but i make sure that all those heads i

793
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,000
use are wide open

794
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:18,640
when i get these shut off and i get the

795
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,600
lines off the timers and have everything

796
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,080
pulled apart so essentially they're not

797
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,240
blown

798
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,240
out but there's room basically for water

799
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,159
to expand should things freeze

800
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,440
yeah it's good to keep them from being

801
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,200
exposed to the elements i know

802
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,480
this looks like a mess but it's a lot

803
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,320
there's a lot going on here

804
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,080
i'm pretty sure as soon as i'm done

805
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,600
recording this i'll think of

806
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,840
lots of other things that i should have

807
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,600
mentioned about the drip irrigation

808
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:44,080
i just kind of wanted to do a rundown on

809
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,080
what i do setting up that new zone

810
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,600
and like i said that zone setup extreme

811
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,360
i'm not always going to have them open

812
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,440
those drippers open that wide to keep

813
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,120
things drenched that's just

814
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,480
for a few weeks to get those ferns

815
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,919
established and before things are

816
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,880
starting to warm up so

817
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,559
they need that right now but otherwise

818
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,320
that's kind of the rundown in the gist

819
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:05,440
of things i am going to get a

820
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,640
new timer get that zone over there fixed

821
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,520
and i am looking at getting a new

822
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,840
fertilizer

823
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,320
injector to set into these systems

824
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:15,120
because like i said two and a half hours

825
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,960
it's a long time to fertilize and i had

826
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:20,159
to refill my little handheld thing

827
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,760
six times too much took too long i have

828
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,120
been doing it for this long so in a

829
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,480
while the sudden i've decided that i

830
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,039
don't want to

831
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,000
do it by hand anymore but for the brief

832
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,400
period of time

833
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,600
when i had an injector it's like a

834
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,960
bottle that

835
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,720
hooked into everything and had a line

836
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,720
that ran through it that was really

837
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,320
nifty and i miss it but they're just

838
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,360
they're kind of pricey the one i had was

839
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,440
really cheap

840
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,559
so it didn't last very long if i get

841
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,520
another one i want to go with one a

842
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,440
little bit nicer like one of the

843
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,559
dosatronics one of those sorts of things

844
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,279
so

845
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,640
wow there it is i was going to plant up

846
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:53,200
some things in this video but

847
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,039
it's already long enough so maybe

848
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,360
there'll be another midweek vlog

849
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,559
like i did last week we will see or i'll

850
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,720
just do it next week

851
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,480
i don't know but everything's looking

852
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,000
pretty good out here the plants are nice

853
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,440
and happy and healthy with the exception

854
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,960
of the annuals like you saw before that

855
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,520
i haven't gotten planted yet which i

856
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,360
have

857
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,960
mostly rounded up got into the gorilla

858
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,559
cart i'm gonna throw together some

859
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,880
hanging baskets and just start tucking

860
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:16,000
these away i'll thumb the process it's

861
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,360
not gonna be anything mind-blowing

862
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,200
because the plants are

863
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,799
and they look terrible i got them back

864
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,000
in march and april and they're still in

865
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,559
their little nursery cans they look

866
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,400
horrible

867
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,679
but it'll be fun to get those planted up

868
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,679
and i

869
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,360
think that should be everything like i

870
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,720
said i'm sure i'll think of more things

871
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,400
it's what the comment sections for

872
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,640
though comment down below

873
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,919
any tips tricks suggestions what are

874
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,640
some things you do with your drip

875
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,559
systems

876
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,080
i think it's really great that and the

877
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,840
nice thing about youtube is that

878
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,159
people can make these videos make these

879
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:46,080
plant videos and then

880
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,520
sometimes hopefully if something doesn't

881
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,799
get covered somebody might mention it

882
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,120
down in the comments

the melnor thing not working out for me

895
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,799
this year but i've used them for a long

896
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,559
time

897
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,919
haven't had issues until this year with

898
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:17,760
these new bluetooth timers and their

899
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,440
customer service has been pretty great

900
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,039
they've also used orbit and their timers

901
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,679
worked really well too it's going to do

902
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,440
it though

903
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,039

comment down below

909
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,919
tips tricks suggestions with the drip

910
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,279
irrigation it's always nifty to have

911
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,400
that extra input you can see right here

912
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,400
i have a sprayer

913
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,480
this is a wide area one thing i didn't

914
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,760
mention is make sure that that's not

915
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,640
going to spray into the crowns of plants

916
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,559
and rot them

917
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,640
i should have said that that's that's

918
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:49,600
important don't write your plants out

919
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,159
ah my social media is linked down below

920
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,880
i use

921
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,000
instagram way more than anything else

922
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,840
really that's pretty much all i use

923
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
these days pretty much

924
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,760
just instagram look at how the sun's
