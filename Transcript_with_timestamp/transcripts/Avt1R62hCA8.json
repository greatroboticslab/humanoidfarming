  "text": "[Music] hello everyone thank you for having me and thank you for joining us today and um today I will be uh focusing on a little more on the surface part of the so compaction and trying to give two different studies that I had experience before with the manure so Erin kind of explained quite a bit about the compaction and I'm just going to move you guys a little bit more towards the Manu applications and its effect on uh compaction and um Rel some some related so properties so the first work I will be presenting is going to be from South Duda and and the second part of the work second part second work is going to be from the Wisconsin and the Wisconsin one has sendy souls in the in the in the field so there are going to be some similarities to those areas in the east coast but if have deep sendy soils and hard pains in it in each cost then these impacts of the manure on on the compaction and other soil properties could be could be more limited than what it is in in this in this presentation so three different things I want to highlight here that I think they are really important uh for manure application and especially when we focus on the soil property changes especially from the physical perspective would be the type of the manure and handling an application and also interaction with other uh management practices like tillage or field traffic uh because the distraction factor from the disturbing disturbing agents like tillage or or any other field operations uh may be greater than what we actually add as an organic met and trying to expect positive relationships with or positive effect on soil compaction so poultry manure or Hawk manure or or cattle manure they're all having different characteristics but within the cattle manure the beef manure and da manure also has different characteristics they have different nutrient contents different moisture levels that I kind of categorize them in two different categories like nutrients and also physically like moisture and these are really important for manure application and and expecting the changes in so properties is because they have different nutrient content and when you apply the manure you calculate according to nutrient contents like nitrogen or phosphorus and they also have different moisture levels so the application amount of the manure is going to be different in dairy or beef so for instance here let's say we are applying according to phosphorus or nitrogen you can see greater numbers in beef manure but when you look into moisture you will have greater moisture in Dairy means to reach the same level of the nutrients that amount of the manure you need to apply is going to be much more in Daily and also because of the moisture that's going to be even more so just keeping those mind and those in mind and pipe is really important handling application is important but then in the second study we will be digging into uh some other factors that is playing the critical rule for those changes so improper manure handling or or or spraying or exercising of the application can lead to so compaction so it is important to consider the the how much field traffic we are causing and and so condition like we just me Aon just mentioned about soil moisture is is really important especially when you're focusing on compaction and and also application rates how much manure you are adding there uh that that could be even more concerning when you think about the environmental perspective but focusing on the compaction how are you applying that manure are you applying the solid manure on the surface are you incorporating with the tillage or are you just applying like in the picture here on on the snow and in liquid form or you're just Drilling in or injecting in the liquid manure those are really important factors to consider and depending on the objective of of the work so next I want to talk a little bit about the manure management uh for enhancing the soil resilience here we have some different pictures of the different size of the Aggregates and we also have organic met playing critical rule so there are different factors there but I want to categorize in three different category one is increasing the sole organic matter and we know so organic matter has an impact on the soul structural development so the second one is soul structure having a better weather Soul structure usually help and also the root growth having the living roots in the system those are the three different things that many could incorporate like supporting more vegetation growth or increasing the organic matter and improving soil structures so we have different aggregate sizes and those has different pores and particles together and and also you can see even here in much detail we have different pores in in even smaller sizes and incorporating manure in in the system can can lead aggregation or increasing the organic matter but at the same time we need we need to consider that soil structure is also playing a critical role there and those pores are the where we store the nutrients and those are the where we store water and and we also need to understand that organic met could be a binding agent between particles and it can also take place in in creating of those pores so strategies to minimize the compaction would be choosing the appropriate equipment trying to avoid the field traffic and also monitoring the soil moisture level that's really important and having the heavy equipments in the field when it's moist we just saw from the a in Stall that is really really important timing and soil conditions and and also uh incorporate manure properly are you going to do a reduced Dage just to incorporate the manure are you going to spray it on it or liquid form they're all really important as I just mentioned in in the previous slide too so the first study is going to be about um different three three different rate of the menu replication rate and we have two inorganic fertilized replication rate and a control and for the manure PM is representing the phosphorus based manure application is a recommended rate for satoda and NM is a nitrogen based manure and hm means High manure which means it's double rate of the NM basically so this two two times nitrogen we are adding in the system with the a then we have nitrogen fertilizer where we add nitrogen only for corn and then we have high fertilizer where we support other nutrients like phosphorus pottassium zinc and sulfur as well and control there's nothing no no manure no inorganic fertilizer and we did this study in two different sides which da manure and beef manure are the one we used for for each side and they were in s theota and all my grass for this work is going to be color coded so green is going to representing manure and orange is going to represent in organic fertilizer and control is gray and increasing the it of the color in each uh in in figures they are going to be representing the increasing the rate of the menu replication so basically what we have seen here focusing a little bit on the surface 0 to 4 in that manure application did decrease the B density and increasing the rate also decreased that and when we move into the second depth is a subsurface 4 to 8 Ines we see slightly changes in back density but effect is limited compared to surface dep means the impact of the menu is is slowly moving in deeper profile but we are still very close to surface so the the another property that I'm going to show uh soil structure really important about the compaction and having more aggregation having more pores in the space is is really important we have seen improvements in in Manu application again increasing the rate has better so for the surface manure has a great impact on improving so structure in subsurface it seems slowly moving and this is the effect after 14 years both bity and aggregate stability was 14 years of the application of manure and we have seen some negative effect from the fertilizer even though they are not significantly different numbers were a little low compared to control in previous years this was not visible too much but when we move forward to like more 14 years level and we have start seeing this more and more so impact of the manure is is there in in aggregation too so we talk about B density and soil aggregation so of course they are all related to pores and bigger pores especially are going to be a good story today we have in the second work too and water infiltration is heavily depending on that right so we have seen an increase in water infiltration uh due to the manure impacts and we don't see that effect from the fertilizer applications again don't forget the color codes and looking into organic matter comparing different years so previously we were looking looking into different deps right now in general we are looking difference between between the years so one year after we start we have no seen seen no impact from the manure in organic fertilizer and we come when we come back after 14 years we we we see a much more impacts from the manure and it has been increasing the so organic matter and increasing the rate of manure application also increases all organic matter level so the next I'm going to show here in this graph same thing with so organic matter nitrate nitrogen also show similar results you know the nutrients can be responsive in shorter time than the soil structure or other soil properties we have seen a greater impact with increasing the rate after 14 years in organic fertilizer there were little move but differences are not significant and we have seen same trends for other nutrients as well I'm not going to put the figures for them here but just want to sum highlight that other nutrients were also showing the similar trends that nitr nitrogen or or so organic matter so the next is pH uh there's a huge database behind this data this slide so I just want to summarize here for pH manure showed different reaction in different fields the the pH show different reactions to manure application in different fields when the pH level was high like 8 8.5 manure tend to decrease that pH and when the level of the pH was low about 5.56 level and manure tend to increase that pH level and but when we look into inorganic fertilizer we know their pH level is low so it's we always seen a negative effect of the inorganic fertilizer no matter whatever the level of the initial pH is electrical conductivity probably one of the negative effect of manure when we apply in a really high rate this rate is crazy like 17,700 pounds per acre that that's that's too much and um and also we have seen inorganic fertilizer has has either no impact or decreasing and only highest rate of the manure has increased electrical conductivity but we are still in the safe range right 78 is is a good number for especially Souls like in s Dakota has good structures and good organic met levels uh I think the numbers are okay still so how about Biologicals uh and we have seen support to fi and nitrogen and carbon based enzymes like uas and metag glucosidase and we haven't seen any impact on bacteria because of the manure application but fungi population and and also some enzyme activities were were increased again why we are talking about all this properties together because when we talk about the soil health and which is focusing on soil compaction or soil physical properties we have seen a quite a bit correlation between soil Health scores and crop yield in xais here we we have the so Health scores from left to right is increasing and crop in the Y AIS from bottom to up is increasing and you can see it's kind of a not completely linear but very close right so we have seen control right here and then we have two inorganic fertilizers and three manure so manure is definitely helping the so Health scores right but when we look at in the crop yield fertilizer and low rate of the manure has not not that much significant differences uh but when we look at so Health score fertilizer is not significant like high fertilizer and control they are not significantly different so it seems the increasing of the manure rate like you can see from the lighter blue darker blue and green like here we can see increase both from the crop yield and so held as a summary graph it's showing that high rate of manure is also supporting crop yield as well so that was the first study we mainly focus on the different type of Manu application and in here in second study I want to highlight a little bit about the disturbance factors with manure or without manure so we had a no till and conventional teal systems in in Wisconsin and in on a slope and we had the manure incorporation with solid manure or or liquid manure and since we first study was solid manure let's let's focus on solid manure too so we can kind of have some comparison there uh and we also sample different times like before tillage before planting after planting summer before harvesting and after harvesting so that way we can see the impact of the Agricultural activities right like planting Impact Summer impact harvesting impact tillage impact with and without the manure scenarios so here the blues are going to be tillage and intensity of the color is going to be manure or no manure so as we can see in the Box density we had a greater box density in noal systems and manure did not differentiate this was very common in most of the so properties in in Wisconsin in more Souls uh we have seen greater impact from the disturbance agents like tillage or AG any agricultural activity that add more traffic in the field or or erosion sometime we had some some data to measure that too so disturbing factors due to the agricultural activity were always having greater impact than manure having impact in in the sols so in here we can see B density was much higher in in in Nal system again uh I only showing the surface depth but we have this all the way down to the 40 50 CMS which is around 16 18 inches I I believe so you're welcome to ask more detail if you are focus on the deeper Soul profile so when we look into aggregation again tillage is making the huge difference especially in the bigger Aggregates so is effect of the disturbance on bigger Aggregates is great and even but we can also still see some of the significant differences for menure Edition and which is the orange here is has manure and blue doesn't have manure you can see some shift in the big one too in in different sizes so when we move from the planting for example this one was before planting to the harvesting the responses are changing under manure and and no manure but when you go in the smaller Aggregates those response kind of constant between the different timing but effect of manure is there same thing in the noil has has an impact but tillage impact is much greater than adding manure in in the system because it's kind of disturbing so here x access we are going from planting to harvesting from left to right and here on on on the y axis we have soil micropores so you you can just kind of this is the convention till no manure you can kind of see here from the planting to the harvesting this is the year one and this is the year two and you can see a decrease from the mcro P so we have a quite a significant effect on Agri paral disturbance on the on the micropores presence in the soils or proportion in the soils we have a very clear impact of harvesting that is decreasing the micropores proportion we also have a very clear impact of the tillage on them and when we look at the scenario with the manure we still have those effect in conventional till systems but when we look into no till system we see an increase so the agricultural disturbance is not as intense as in conventional Tails so we start seeing the positive effect effect of that in in in this study so again effect of the manure is still limited but in in in tillage or disturbance effect is is more clear and you can see that from the starting points that there's a significant difference and ending points there are much different so the the effect of activity in in field is is quite significant but when we look into microor we don't see that even though they starting the same level and changes in the micropores proportion doesn't change too much so it shows that disturbance is more effective on the on the on the bigger pores in in in the system and this also shows in water release so when we look into more into smaller ports or moisture content in different pores there we can see a significant impact of the manure so especially in the noil systems dark blue is representing solid manure and lighter blue is no manure you can see there's a significant effect even in in in small smaller pores compared to compared to bigger pores uh but tillage effect is still there it is still there same thing with the carbon content we have seen differences from 0 to 6 in no differences 6 to 12 in we have increas if we have an effect of tillage for example no till no manure conventional till no manure significantly different but when we look into conventional till systems even though tillage has effect and manure also shows an effect on it so manure has effect on organic carbon or organic matter in in both studies we have seen this so looking into more stable organic carbon or or or active organic carbon we have found the relationship between the active organic carbon and bigger Aggregates which are being heavily Disturbed compared to smaller ones and we have seen more stable organic carbon in smaller Aggregates I think that was something really important to know that so for the conclusion this is an inner layer surface of the aggregate uh I thought it's a good slid for conclusion and we can see different port sizes here with different shapes and with different sizes and we sometimes have the port there continuous we have so particles around it with different colors and with different elements in it so focus on this rectangle because most of the data I'm going to show is from here so when you when you look into Elemental distribution is you can see from the top to bottom the the these are the most representative elements here they they are in this area and from top to bottom the the proportion is decreasing and we can even map them and we can look at into different pores and different elements and see which one is higher in the system you can see like lighter color means we have more of that you can see Iron this this particle is in Iron this particle is calcium and we have calcium around here too I I I'm focusing on calcium because we have seen a quite a good correlation between calcium and so structure stability and and aggregate sizes in in the system so they they definitely play a critical role and menure has all these in it including so organic matter carbon nitrogen different elements and so just consider them when you're applying manure and and in the questions that what you are expecting so I am a and an assistant professor and so management extension specialist I'm in North Car State University and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions [Music]",
