  "text": "hey hey everybody it's jeff from cackle hatchery i wanted to talk a little bit about some tips today when you get your baby chicks from cackle hatchery uh they arrive in boxes kind of like this or they might be bigger our main topic today though is making sure you get your baby chicks off to a good start there's a big difference between hatching out baby chicks at home under a hen or an incubator versus getting mail order checks okay chicks that have hatched at a hatchery or the chicks that go to feed stores uh you know they've been through two days of of transit so they have lost some body mass they've been stressed and they require a lot lot more heat on arrival than let's say you're taking some chicks out of your incubator okay so there's a big difference on how you want to start your baby chicks out when you're getting a mail order uh baby chicks through the mail so we say that you have to have in order to have success you need a brooder reflector lamp something like this one it's got a guard that you take off and put on it so if it ever happens to drop it won't start a fire these are relatively cheap you pick these up anywhere we really recommend to have a a red bulb you can have a light uh bulb if you want to but these will put out the uh and warm the air around the chicks not only warm the chicks but warm the air around the check we usually recommend 125 watt for every 25 chicks and then of course they got to have a lot of room to get away from the heat but you want about a hundred 105 degrees at the floor level for the baby chicks so uh when they arrive their body temperature is is low and they don't have it in them to raise their body temperature up so their normal temperature is around 104 so you've got to figure out and artificially warm their bodies up to that temperature so they'll start getting active starting to eat and drink so that's real important so may order chicks require a lot more heat than if you're taking chicks out of your brooder or out from underneath your hen if you have a gqf these are really good brooders too for mail order chicks it has a heating element in here that heats up really hot and uh it's got a thermostat on it and so you know if all your chicks are huddled right here they're too cold if the chicks are kind of sleeping around this area they're just right if all your chicks are way up to the front of the brooder then it's too hot and you need to lower the temperature so as your chicks grow they're going to take less and less temperature now after five generally more like seven to ten days you want to try to figure out a heat source that does not produce a light okay so we want to get your chicks off of having 24 7 light so this is where these come in handy uh after seven to ten days uh you know you could install one of these for the chicks i've got several different brands here there's other brands i'm not trying to leave out any other brands it's just that these heat plates do not heat the air and they're a lower temperature and they don't produce a light so that's good later on but you cannot use these on arrival for baby chicks i mean i'm you you can have success but you've gotten really lucky if you have in the past so these are more for chicks after uh you know like i said seven to ten days for mail order chicks if you've got an incubator at home and you're hatching your chicks out you can probably have success with these uh but we got one brand here there's another brand basically again it's a heat plate that does not produce a heat source that heats the air so but there's several different brands here so the theme of this short video is for mail or chicks we're not talking about when you're hatching at home we're talking about when you are ordering chicks through the mail day old baby chicks you cannot start them off with a heat plate like these okay they have to have you know a good heat source that's gonna heat the air around them and uh so that's uh the theme of this uh video and we thank you for listening this is jeff at cackle hatchery hope you have a blessed week",
