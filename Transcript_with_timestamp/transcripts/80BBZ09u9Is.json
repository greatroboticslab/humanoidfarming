  "text": "i'm gonna host welcome everybody uh this is the last of six uh seminars that we've organized as part of a webinar series on targeting and community networks and anti-poverty programs and we're very happy to have uh marcel fashion give the last seminar um marcel was the first person to teach me about development economics way back when at stanford in graduate school so it's always great to see him and he's going to share some of his work on mobilizing p2p diffusion in bangladesh marcel it's all yours thanks a lot well it's a great pleasure to to be uh to be uh talking to you guys um this is work with uh joint work with assad islam who i believe is uh attending abdul malek who also said he would be attending and devayan pakrashi um and it's a second paper we've uh done together about uh basically about how to um to promote the diffusion of agricultural technology and focusing on a specific technology called systems of rice intensification sri which has [Music] the advantage and drawback that it doesn't include it doesn't require additional input so it's an advantage for for for also because you don't run into issues of uh people having liquidity constraints or things like that um but then the downside is that it's actually a difficult technology to master and so people uh the difficulty with this technology is um how to to train farmers in applying it okay and so of course you could try to train all the potential beneficiaries or put because you know if you don't know who's going to benefit from it you can try to train everybody but that's obviously going to be costly and so with brac we've been trying to break in bangladesh we've been trying to find ways of of targeting many beneficiaries if you want the farmers who would benefit from this innovation of targeting them better the first the first article we wrote about that which we tried to get we trained some farmers and then we asked them to recommend to refer basically um all the farmers they thought would benefit from the from the training so that was the first step we did that kind of worked and it didn't really work like the way we were expecting we were expecting the the referred trainees to be adopting you know to be better adopters basically we basically better targeted and that's that's not really what we found so this time we tried another approach which is um you know has a long history in agricultural extension which is is basically based on the idea of a model farmer uh but we try to improve it basically so but if you remember the model farmer the extension agent comes to the village and says i can't i can't you know teach everybody so i'm going to uh to select some farmers who i believe are role models for others who are also more receptive to innovation and i'm going to train them and then i'm going to hope that this will then naturally diffuse through an unspecified process through the the local population okay i'm sure they are more more more structured ways of doing it but that's kind of a a rough characterization of what the model farmer approaches and um so what we try to do here is we're going to try to we're going to start from that and um but instead of hoping that these these model farmers um you know do viral marketing basically they basically become your your champions your marketing agents for your for your for your innovation uh we're gonna actually ask them to train two farmers we're gonna assign them these two farmers when we say okay you know you're gonna train jack and jill these are the two the two trainees were assigned to you and there you go you know um [Music] try to do a good job of it so that's the that's the basic idea that we have our intervention is basically taking trainees people who have received this one day course on uh on sri from brac and we're gonna assign them to other uh farmers who could have been trainees could have been black trainees uh but we're going to say well what do we can we go can we what what fraction of the effect of brac training can we achieve by asking this these trainees to themselves teach other farmers that's that that's the logic so each each of the so we call them teacher trainees sometimes they call them teachers for short but obviously they are not school teachers they just asked to teach other other farmers in our experiment can i ask a clarificatory question please so how much uh experience do these teacher trainees have with the technology before they're expected to train others no they don't have any they don't have any ex experience with the technology so you set the experience so they have been they received a one-day training from black and then they are asked to you know can you teach the the the instruction list that you you have been [Music] you know told and to talk about uh to these two other people and people take a quiz and so basically we're going to be we're going to be comparing adoption between teacher trainees and trainees and of course we also have control farmers who didn't receive any training we have control farmers in the treated villages where some people receive the training we also have control of uh farmers in villages where there was no training whatsoever so i'll talk about that in detail in a minute but that's the that's the way we're going to try to see whether um whether this model uh transfers knowledge so we're going to quiz the the trainees the teacher trainees at the end on what they're supposed to be learning and we're going to teach the the students of these uh teacher trainees who did not receive the brag training i'm going to quiz them about about their knowledge as well and then we're going to see whether they have you know we we also have uh we know that uh the the average farmer who has not been trained does not know what sri is in this particular part of the world so it's not it's not like they would not naturally know what it is and then we also look at adoption um of the recommended practices later on and we which is measured by brac and then we also um have a deadline survey where we measure uh agricultural outcomes like profits and yields so that's the that's the basic idea i'll go through the to the intervention more detail in a minute um there are some villages we incentivize the teachers to basically we thought maybe if we incentivize them they would do a better job so they are incentivized to teach um to the test so basically they they've already taken a test and they're told well you will test your students uh using the same quiz and then we'll we'll give you an incentive if they answer the quiz questions well so that's basically testing whether they can they can convey these key information about sri to their to their students and uh we hope that that knowledge and translates into into a higher adoption adoption and then you know from the model farmer idea this modern farmer idea so remember the the key idea of that model was that this person was a role model for the farmers and therefore the other farmers would want to copy him or her so we thought well maybe we can emulate that as well i mean here so the way we did that is that we ask in baseline we ask each of the farmers in our sample to to list at most five other farmers in in in the list we given them whom they would regard as as role models basically whom they would basically whom they would consider as sources of valuable information for for agricultural technology so that's the that's the idea and um and then basically in a way i'll explain where we you know remember each teacher trainee gets two students assigned to him they're all male um so and one of them is going to be someone who has who has nominated that farmer as a role model who has listed him as a role model and the other one is someone who is not normally anything as a role model so that's the idea and the idea is based on this smaller farmer idea is that it's a role model therefore it's going to work better in terms of diffusing the innovation from teacher trainees to those farmers that nominated them to those farmers that regard them regarding teacher training as a role model so that's the that's the key idea um and and this is done through an algorithm i'll describe in a minute so that's the basic idea of what we do um in terms of and i'll explain that the experiment more detail obviously in terms of just to remind i'm sure some of you already know what uh this system perhaps even better than i do what the system of rising intensification is but my understanding of it is basically it's a set of different practices that have to do with transplanting the way you do the transplanting the data transplanting and especially things like spacing thinning and the way you water the plant the regularity of the water in the plant and so on so this is space they have to be basically spaced further apart from each other and and there's going to be more thinning that what farmers would normally do and as a result these these single plants that survive grow bigger and they get they get more grain so that's that's the logic of sri as far as i understand it now you can see there's no you know these are all practices there's no um inputs required so there's no there's no purchased inputs i mean uh that are related to adoption of sri so that that means several things um it means things that if it was a fertilizer or a new seed or a new pesticide or something farmers could in principle go to the to the seller of this input and ask them you know what should i use on my rice how should i use it how should i apply or when there's no such thing here so we don't have to worry about contamination of our sample by some external agent who comes and gives them information about this technology okay so that simplifies our work it's it makes uh eliminate it reduces contamination from external uh actors or vendors in this case um it also means that you don't you don't have to worry about externalities through input markets i mean if you if you introduce a new uh and use a new fertilizer let's say and uh there's a whole value chain has to bring this fertilizer to the villages and only you know nobody only you are the only one who wants to buy it you know chances are you're not going to find it because the the traders are not going to find it useful to bring the fertilizer to the village just in the off chance that you might buy this one bag of fertilizer so they it's so they're going to be networking externalities in the sense that you know the more people are buying it the more it will make sense for um sellers of agricultural inputs to stock it and therefore you would have and you will have more information and the other farmers will have more information so you get into this kind of system of externality so we don't have to work that the problem with that is that that would break sudvas so so i mean we're already looking at diffusion which is something that's very already by name by nature kind of breaks breaks and subverts somewhat so we we we don't want more to have to worry about more violations on server uh that we have to could there be an effect on the quantity of inputs that they purchased i'm wondering if you have to space out yeah you will look at that but we're not introducing any new inputs yeah but we'll look at that yeah um the the main thing though is it's it's i would people sometimes describe this technology as more labor-intensive it's it seems like we just because the farmers have to go and visit the field sometimes more often but really it's more management incentives intensive they have to be more careful and they have to also change the way they were doing things but they would they have to measure they have to count how to thin properly and so on so they it's a little bit more scientific and so as a result it's a bit more demanding in terms of attention and care and and a bit harder for the farmer to delegate so uh that's the sense in which it's more demanding on the farmer so that's the idea so but these things again means that if it's it's about management it's not something that will diffuse naturally through observation you can't just copy people oh he has a new iphone i'm going to have it on your iphone you can't just copy people's behavior just by by observing what they're doing so you have to really be taught how to do it so that's the that's the idea uh of this there's going to be some diffusion happening and naturally of course people will talk but it will come you know the hope is that it all comes from from the training that uh uh brag does and then the way that this diffuses then to students and perhaps then eventually to some other people in the village and as we will see later there's very good command contamination across villages so which again confirming that people don't seem to know this technology before [Music] now i'm not going to spend too much on this slide but but there's there's obviously a very large approach on diffusion of innovation here i've picked a few uh papers that uh that are more in the development economics literature reasonably recent papers um so that but it is of course a much larger literature behind it uh including of course in marketing uh because you know diffusion of new products these are innovations so there's there's going to be some some lit the larger on that and basically the base the basic the main message of the signature is that sri is not for everyone you you need to be a dedicated farmer to benefit from it if you're not um up to snuff let's say if you're just like uh somebody who does it because they can't earn an income from something else you might not naturally benefit from it because it's actually demanding in terms of of understanding what's going on in the field so that that's the sense in which it's not a technology that we expect to benefit everyone and therefore it's a technology for which targeting is important you know you have to be able to i think you want to economize uh on the cost of training by focusing your training on people who will benefit from it so that's the idea um of course there is also a larger picture on p2p transmission which is what we are trying to uh achieve here and of course more generally on the role of social products proximity in in viral marketing so i'm not gonna you know these are just a hand just a very small number of papers been citing here so let me if if there are no more questions about the no questions about the setup the context i can delve into the immunity delve into the experimental design as i said it's with brac um we've selected a hundred villages uh from these two districts uh rank poor and bagura in uh bangladesh um and the way that brac works um as far as sri is concerned they go to these when they arrive in a village they start by identifying or 30 potential sri adopters and these are people who obviously have to grow rice otherwise there's no point and they have to they have to be large enough in other words more than one decimal i forgot exactly it's in the paper but the lower limit but they're trying to find these intermediate farmers who have enough uh uh land that they grow to to to signal that they're actually farmers not just uh gardeners if you want and they also not too big okay so they kind of live in this intermediate uh size so they kind of uh generally poor people but they are a little bit uh more focused on rise than than some of the very small ones um and if the village is too big and they have more than 30 and basically what they would end up doing um not necessarily here but what they would end up doing is kind of to say this two groups of 30 and then there was like one in the eastern part of the village one of the western part of the village because you know it's a densely populated country so you you get uh sometimes you get large villages so they would do that so basically they and that's that's how they proceed um in their sri training campaign so we we wanted to to kind of and we didn't want to change that because we wanted to be policy relevant we wanted whatever we whatever we introduced whether we find we wanted this to be immediately you could slaughter into the normal strategy the mobile practices of brac in the country so that was the idea um and also we you know because they're not stupid they they they also want to save on uh the economize on on on train waste wasting training time on on people who never adopt we hope that through that system we the 30 farmers they identify are probably farmers among whom the property sales option is higher it's not 100 by any means but it's it's it's higher so that's the idea so basically uh let's focus on those people um and we're going to be looking at diffusion be among that group we start with the baseline questionnaire on the household composition in pharmaceutics it's a fairly light baseline and then we assign 60 villages to treatment and the 40 remaining ones to control in control there is no sri brak intervention and then in the treated villages um a selected number of teacher trainees uh farmers uh receive one day training in sri okay and uh of the 60 villages selected for treatment there's 30 that are also assigned to an incentivized teacher treatment assist a treatment whereby the teacher trained trainee um is is gaining a compensation for training students that depend on their performance in the quiz while in the other 30 villages the teacher trainee receives a fixed uh compensation per per student relates to logic and if you look at the more precisely what is the how does this compensation uh constructed well they get a fixed fee if you want a participation fee of uh for 300 taka or four dollars and then in the incident device treatment they get 250 taka additional per student at the end of the teaching week and then another uh they get they are given a week to train them because i'm expecting them to be training them uh every day all the time but you know you have to give them some time for them to meet them so that's the logic of it and you don't wait too long so there's no point um and then the incident question yeah yeah how are the people how are the teacher training selected i i'm getting to that it's the next okay get into that right right away anyway so that's the easy part explaining the this kind of uh incentives is basically you get a fixed amount and then you you lose something every time the the the your student uh answers the quiz wrongly um so now let's let's talk about the assignment rule um so as i explained earlier in the baseline in the treated villages each farmer nominates up to five as role models with the opinion leaders over our models and then we have these 30 farmers and then we we have to assign them into to four different roles basically some are going to be teachers they're going to receive the training some are going to be receiving nothing at all they're going to be the non-students they're going to be going to be able to look at if you want and an incentivized unorganized diffusion and then we're going to have the students and there are two types of students the students who nominated so remember there are two students for a teacher trainee one who nominated a teacher trainee as a opinion leader a role model and one who did not nominate that particular teacher training so that's how it's uh so they have to be assigned to these four groups how do we do this so we start by picking uh six teacher trainees so those are going to receive the black training and um this we did um by dividing so remember once we get the five nominations per nominating farmer per per each of the 30 farmers we can look at who they nominate right so maybe all of them nominate albert so then you know albert will be nominated by you know it will have 29 nominations and then uh you know maybe dilip is going to have 28 or something so you you get a sense of and then some people will have none so basically we basically divide the the the 30 farmers into those that received uh above the median number of nominations and those that receive less than the median number of nominations that's the and then among the those that are above the median we select four teacher trainees and the others we select two digit training so this is basically stratified sampling right we had a variable where we collected ourselves it's known to us we do sampling is stratified okay so they don't they don't have the same based on their observable characteristics as baseline they get slightly different probabilities of being assigned to a particular treatment okay so we'll have to correct for that when we in a minute because that that that that stratified sampling which is not pure randomization now what about the other 24 farmers so then we have assigned these six people at random the way they are explained so you're left with 24 farmers we know we want 12 students and 12 non-students and then we want six students who are matched with a teacher that they nominated and six students who are matched with somebody that did not dominate so how do we do this well we do this using an algorithm this algorithm is a mechanistic so it just basically you can think of the of the algorithm as um you start by randomizing all the farm the 30 farmers in the village then you you know based on that reshuffling of the farmers you picked the four the first four who are above the median in terms of nomination and the first two who are above the median uh below the median in terms of nomination these are going to be the teacher trainings so now that you have the teacher trainings you start looking among the the the 24 farmers for farmers who nominated them farmers who did not dominate them and so and you go through the list you go through the list of farmers in the order they've been shuffled until you finally allocate everybody so the the order in which they've been shuffled will determine the order in which they are considered by the algorithm to be assigned to a teacher or not does it make sense so that means marcel it seems still seems like it's not going to be very random if for each of the teachers you have to find one student who nominated them because maybe for some of the teachers there was only one or two students who nominated him right if i'm understanding the algorithm correctly yeah yeah but that's enough that's okay that's okay yeah i don't think there is a village where we we had the problem of uh of selecting uh a teacher who was nominated by nobody i don't think it happened because this is an issue that we raised at the beginning but this didn't occur okay so you always find they be nominated by at least one person uh one other question i mean when they are asked to nominate somebody as a role model are they you know one criterion could be who who do you think is going to be the most successful in adopting the technology himself the other is who is going to be the best teacher and those two need not be the same sure so what what is your understanding of what you know what they think of when they say role model um well i mean you will see it actually this has no effect okay so we we can talk about what they meant maybe they didn't mean anything it's possible um but the wording was basically whom would you be look i mean the word the wording is not in it is phrased in terms of agricultural technology so who who would you be going to for information about the new agricultural technology that's the basic idea now it may be that they they just go to their neighbor so it may be that this person is not particularly knowledgeable about it but that's that's that was the intention the intention was to identify someone who was perceived as a as a more at least by by the student farmers by perceived as someone who would be more authoritative that was the the intention and so the idea was that if he's more arthritic of you you probably would will listen more to what he says we might do better on the quiz and you might also um follow this person's example more therefore and therefore um if they adopt you might adopt it uh adopt as well in fact we're going to be testing for those things in the in the paper but before i go to that to the the more substantive issues of the paper which i actually where the interesting stuff is i need to be i need to basically address this issue of um weights i mean clearly this algorithm um generates different probabilities of being assigned to one of the four treatments for each of the 30 farmers and um and so you might think well wait a minute i mean i know how to deal with this problem if it if it's stratified sampling because it's stratified sampling i just look at the stratification ratio that i use and i correct for that using weights but here you say well wait a minute i don't i don't know it's just the algorithm it's a black box what but the thing is that the algorithm you can reproduce it that means me as many times as you want you can reshuffle the farmers rate again use your philosophy again right again right again wait 500 times look at how you know of these 500 times how many times does albert gets assigned to be a teacher and how much does marcel get assigned to be a teacher and that that becomes your probability of assignment right the problem is going to be if there is somebody who's always assigned to be a teacher somebody who's never assigned to be a teacher then you you think well wait a minute those people i can't compare because they uh you know they basically i don't have people who are um so i i would look at that i'll have to check that this is not the case because those people then would have to be taken out because they they never they have zero chance of uh the account constructor you can't construct a uh a sampling weight for that right it's infinite basically or zero so that's uh well i'll get back to 90 minutes but that's the that's the id but the main the main the main thing here is that it's going to rule the rule-based deterministic aspect given a certain ordering of farmers in reshuffling of farmers and it follows a rule so it's and this rule is entirely based on things that we observe at baseline just like if you were doing stratified sampling you have some kind of baseline information on the people and then you're going to organize your sampling based on that so it's not it's not about selection on observables they're going to be things that are correlated with these observables for sure but uh but uh we that's why we need to correct for uh for sampling weights but so that's the idea um so as i said we've got four types of treated farmers um two types of treated villages incentivized teacher and non-study vice teacher we only have one type of control farmers and basically what we'll do is we compare say teacher trainees to control farmers or teacher trainees to non-students or um and so so that's the that's what we're going to be doing so let's talk a little bit more about this assignment treatment type fine so remember this assignment treatment is under our full control there's no there's no self-selection whatsoever we assign them is based on observables which we have at baseline and uh it's it's it's based on an algorithm which we can replica use to replicate many times the the the the assignment process so that's the key so basically we can we based on that we can as i have explained we can reconstruct what the what the probability of being assigned to the to each of the four treatments uh would be for any particular in fact for any individual in the sample we can do this individual by individual okay and so that way we can recover the probabilities so let me show you just how it works in practice so let's say you have two populations untreated and the control the the normal way of measuring the average treatment effect would be just to look at the mean of the treatment and the mean of the control if they have been randomly assigned to it and if there's it's there's no ratification whatsoever you just take the sample mean okay now in our case we can't do the sample mean we're gonna for the for the for the for the so this is this is people assigned to a specific treatment so we're going to to basically use inverse probability weighting so that's that's something you already know so you know we we this is the pro this is the the probability that somebody would be assigned to this particular treatment we normalize this by case or which is the sum of these uh pi so that you want to normalize because you want this thing that is saying the probabilities is one for everybody in a particular unit you want this thing to be one over one right so that cancels out and you you back to the standard uh mean everybody i had a question i mean this all makes sense to me but if you're going to re-weight to try to make it in some sense representative then why didn't you just randomize at the beginning and then you don't have to deal with the weights i'm just curious about you know the decision to stratify in this way and then to re-weight it back to the random representativeness no but no but the uh no that is uh why do you stratify a sample in any any you know when you ever solidify a sample it's because you want to be able to compare to populations in this case we wanted to compare nominating and non-nominating we wanted to compare uh teacher and the other so we wanted to be um and the big the big challenge was nominating and non-nominating because we didn't control who's nominating who so basically that's the that's the way we uh we ended up approaching it right but the cost is you get a higher variance and i mean the greater variance in the weights reduces power in some sense right so yeah but i can see the trade-off right no i just i agree with that yeah i agree with that but we we've been having enough power so so my interpretation is that you wanted to try to understand the mechanisms as well and if you're trying to think about mechanisms i mean what i would be inclined to do is to well there's obviously heterogeneity let's say that people vary in skill which and there's just essentially one kind of skill you know you're better role model or not and there's information about your skill that's in the in the population so you ask people and uh you know to nominate people so you try to elicit community information about skill but you've got that fundamental heterogeneity and there could be a second order of heterogeneity which is that the effectiveness of you as a teacher also depends on the skill of the student so it could be math specific so what you want to do is estimate you know for any pair of skills for the teacher and the student you know how effective is the transmission of diffusion going to be so that's what you're going to try and back out uh then uh you know i presume that this this design will get at that uh because you've randomized and then you've got a third dimension of randomization which is the uh the incentives for the the teacher yeah that would have rationalized the design and and all the effects that you want to isolate i imagine that that's at the back of your mind yeah it's at the back of the mind i i didn't for this paper we didn't we didn't write a model i i confess we didn't write a model no we just focused on the i yeah we just didn't do it for this paper um and maybe i should have added i mean there's some discussion of that in the in the paper maybe i should have added some slides about that but i thought i was just going to talk talk you into it as i was going i was presenting the different pieces of evidence i have um but you're right so so you raised several points here so there's one i remember which is the what about much specific gain so remember maybe you maybe you saw the paper i wrote with demo about that these are kids who are assigned to to do a course a math course with one other kid in a chinese school and so there we actually looked as at to at the math specific game but then they it was easier much easier because everybody was in pairs they were just assigned randomly by design to another person there was no there was no need for a matching algorithm like this like we did here which is basically randomized matching and so there we could see whether you know if a less abled kid kids match with their more able kid whether whether the the less able kid learns more it turns out they do actually and the the more able kid doesn't seem to learn less so so that was actually a good a good result for that um um so that's an example of uh uh of lo so i know but here we go we're just gonna be looking at the average so i'm not i don't i don't i don't ambition to identify pay white because i don't have a as you you're right i don't have very good um identification there so i i don't want to make any any statements about that it's not that i don't think it's important it's just just that i i don't think i'm very i'm a very strong terrain there so i'd rather avoid seeing that um i suspect you the way you stratified you have the identification but you may be not be having enough power i i don't know about that but we'll see about power i i think we have power and we actually um cluster standard errors at the village level so we we have a hundred villages so it's fine so i mean it's not like we've been very uh conservative i mean you know that's not not for the average treatment effect but for the the heterogeneous treatment effects we don't have heterogeneous treatment effects i know i know if you did if you did what i was suggesting write down a model and try to identify the heterogeneous treatment effects to understand the mechanism you may be underpowered to estimate the heterogeneous treatment effects oh yeah yeah yeah so i understand okay but you're mainly talking about power for the average treatment effect which is fine yes yeah that's good that's true that's very true um okay so i've explained this you can also using you the same once you since you recalibrate these means to be representative of the control village population you can also compare them to each other so once you have recalibrated them you should compare them so you can compare one group of treated with them to another group of treated um i've already explained this i mean the easiest way to explain how you recover the priorities the easiest way to uh to understand it is that if you think that each person is a different x vector so then you you would uh you know run a bunch of simulations i think we've run 500 simulations so you would run um let's say first simulation dilip gets assigned to be a teacher and so therefore it's one zero zero zero so that's one sample and then in another sum in another simulation it gets assigned to be a nominating student so he's here and then he's there okay really do this for other times some of them get frequencies frequency how often does dilip get to be a teacher you know maybe a lot of times so therefore he's going to be you know he's over represented if you want in the in the teacher population so we're going to want to weigh his to re-weight the teacher population so that he gets less weight that's the that's the idea so that's how this is done here all right now the thing you have to worry if you do that the thing you have to worry is that people who never get assigned to a particular role because then then as i said they they basically um don't have a kind of comparable person so so this is not what we get so these are basically the these uh these normalized probabilities that the weights that we are using and the sum and and so you know they are of course centered on one which is the mean and it doesn't even reach 0.5 and it doesn't go it you know the couple observations above couple people above uh above two but very few so basically the the range of values of these of these weights is not crazy it stays within a relatively narrow range and so that means that um the rewaiting we are doing is not is not is not insane okay so it's not like one person is 99 of the time always a teacher and then you you take his inverse sampling where he's going to be one over 99 and so it's going you know it's going to be so it's going to be very large no it would be it would be a 99 over one so it would be very small okay anyway so the so that you you want to look to whether you have very large value very loose one value so you don't have that so that's actually quite uh quite encouraging balance there are lots of tables about balance in the in the paper they are only the appendix um balance across the different types of treatment and there we we don't find any problem with balance note that we do balance uh controlling for sampling weights and we also cluster standard errors by village so so we try to do this the same way we would perform the rest of the analysis so this is the this is the first table i have these are just descriptives and well a bit more than the scripture i have some have some tests but the first part of the table if you want the first half the table the top half is about um perhaps uh you know issues of possible interest one is uh you know how do people score on the test whether the test has got um actually should be zero to one to eight the test has eight questions so they could either answer them all wrong i think you should say zero to eight or they could answer i think nobody does that but they could they could answer all of them right then the average is about seven so they're pretty good at remembering what the correct answer is this is on in general note that we didn't ask these questions in the controlled villages but we know from uh from other observational data that they don't know much about sri um and this is just another variable we use is whether they can uh answer the three main questions correctly and you get they get 88 of farmers who can treat farmers intrigued not not 3d farmers farmers in treated villages can do that in terms of nomination remember they could make up to they could make up to five nominations they actually make make nearly all five of five nominations so it's very stable we don't have to worry too much about some of them nominating one because he's the only one who matters and then some nominating five like nearly everybody nominates five so that that helps us as well and now we already have i can already show you some of the average uh treatment effects uh or at least the the means the the the means in each of the samples so because i i have the means in the control villages these are these are the the the adoption variables that i have um this is just basically comparing control villages to treated villages these are means village level means okay i'm of course i'm going to be looking at more than that but so the first variable is basically whether barack estimated that the farmer has adopted at least some of the practices of sri and in controlled villages by you know about two and a half percent of the farmers in that village are estimated by brackets uh so basically less than one farmer um while in treated villages about a third of the farmers okay this is across the whole village um in terms of the proportion of land and of course that that is massively significant uh we have three thousand i forgot to tell you the sample size but we but you know you have 30 farmers times 100 villages where you have 3 000 farmers all together so this kind of difference across 60 villages versus 40 villages you know it's certainly significant um proportion of land is just a percentage of the of their cultivated acreage uh that is uh that is on which sri uh practices have followed um so that's uh that that's there again you get you see that uh in treated villages you get a much bigger proportion these are the number of sri principles adopted on the plot in central villages actually they they are recorded as you know adopting 1.4 but that could just be that they by chance uh adopted one of those uh one of those uh practices but very few of them adopt more than one so there's basically it's it's a means it looks like a high mean but it's not the same practice that every farmer adopts right so they basically randomly adopt certain things without knowing that this is called sri um very few of them this is very important very few of them actually follow the the the transplanting rule which is about the age of the seedlings very in control villages very few of them um follow the recommended distance between bundles the places where they transplant the rice um but it's it's exactly quite a bit higher in in in treated villages even though this still remains very low but they still don't like to follow the age of the ceiling so it's certainly not complete adoption and then [Music] and then in terms of number of seedlings per bundle you have a bit higher at practic you know this practice is already kind of uh somewhat there even in control villages but even there is higher in uh treated villages so that's that's in terms of practices well actually the so that you see we're not it's not like you say you know have you adopted this fertilizer meaning have you used this fertilizer of any of your of your fields here you have you know uh a whole bunch of uh six main recommendations from sri recommendation and basically what is being tracked here are the main recommendations that they make these are this is the data that we have on agricultural performance at end line we have yield value of crop output input costs labor costs um total cost and profits and here these are all in so this is in kg per decimal a decimal is a very small unit of uh len land land area used in uh in bangladesh um and these are bangladeshi taka per decimal so these are in local currency and you can see there are differences uh like for instance it's about 30 some taca difference here uh here there is there's very basically if anything is slower in terms of costs uh it's the same in terms of labor cost on average and it's the same in terms of total cost so there's a little bit of a higher value of output and so you get a little bit of higher imputed profit okay so that's the and these these things are significant there's also something significant this is even that is significant even though it's reasonably small so these are all average comparisons so now we we haven't divided uh uh farmers and treated villages into the different treatment categories so let's let's do that now so here we've divided them into teacher training immediately student non-nominating student and non-student these are the control means that i just showed you a minute ago and these are the adoption levels so you can see immediately that that you know the teacher trainees adopt a very high probability uh about 70 percent of them the the this are the dependent variable is is is uh it takes a value 100 if they adopt and zero if they don't adopt so that each coefficient is easily readable as a percentage point um and remember the baseline level of adoption is very small so so everybody here is significantly above that that that that value so they're all all quite significant once you and then if you start looking at the at the rest of the table you get lots of uh lots of stars so basically you know even here where even in control villages is you know close to 18 of the farmers who follow this practice anyway but then you get a much higher much higher these are these are you you know you have to add 18 to 17 to get uh how much a non-nominating student uh how much if he follows the number of seedling cabernet that's the way to read it so that's the intercept if you want are these about just the plot on which they're doing it or the plots on which they're doing it or is it right so here here all the plots are included so this is basically a regression that runs by plot uh that's why there are some in there more than 3000 observations because farmers could uh could mention up to three plots they collected information up to the three biggest plot decorative information on that and that's basically what the focus of the study is because brac is not gonna go and visit all your little tiny little thing so they basically focus on up to three plots per farmer and these tend to be the biggest ones and rice could typically be included so that that's okay so that's the that's the way it's done um so so basically the the lesson from this is that yeah with but pretty good effect on on all these practices on adoption as measured you know in a really relatively generous way here um compared to uh farmers in controlled villages so that's the that's the first lesson and then if you look well you know these numbers are different so what about this number compared to this one what about this number compared to this one and so on so what about this number so what so here we just basically using these regressions so for the first column we use this regression and we just do these pairwise t tests you know this is the coefficient of teacher trainee significantly different from the coefficient of nominating students so basically we do these pairwise comparisons to see whether there's a difference in treatment effects and you can see that when we're comparing teachers and students you always get these are p values here so we just report p values um since it's a test and so they basically they are they are more adopting than other people you can see lots of zeros everywhere these zeros everywhere here you see teachers are clearly overwhelmingly adopting more sri in terms of the students um you can see that both both students you know all of them is like also nearly all uh there's one two here but other than that they've pretty high a pretty low p value so i get a high uh significant effect that they they're more likely to adopt than non-students in treated villages okay so it's not just that there was some kind of diffusion in the whole village and they benefited from it it's that they basically the fact that they were targeted by our intervention through a teacher a trainee to receive a summary instruction it actually made them more likely to adopt these sri practices um there is the only place where it is except for this one which is borderline significant i would say everything else here is not significant so basically this idea that we we had which is basically behind the model farmer logic the idea that people would pay more attention if they are matched to somebody they look up to somebody they regard as an opinion leader as a as a as a source of valuable information um and so if this was the case you know being matched with a model farmer somebody you regard as a as a model makes you more likely to adopt what they tell you to do what they teach you then you would expect this number you would expect all these numbers to be positive and significant they're all negative yeah thankfully they're not significantly negative but they're all negative except for this one's just borderline but marcel the the teacher trainee has been nominated by somebody right they're all above media nominations isn't it no no no no no no no there's four above media and two below media okay so is this coming from the above median or the below median or is it the same no matter which so what i'm trying to get at is i think your interpretation was it doesn't you don't have to be a model farmer you're equally effective at disseminating i think is what you were saying but but i'm saying that out of six four were considered uh modeled by by a larger number of people right so i may not have nominated them but my neighbor nominated them so they're probably still pretty good yeah yeah it's a good idea we could do that we haven't done that but we could do that we could compare we could do that that's that that goes in the direction of what the lip i was mentioning earlier basically looking at the yes we could also i mean we haven't done that we of course we have the the whole network of uh recommendations so we could see whether extend you know how much variation we have in centrality for in degree centrality in this case in centrality or even a more sophisticated measure of centrality yeah this is this is something we could do yeah yeah this is a good suggestion thanks thank you um okay but in terms of uh being matched to somebody you didn't nominate doesn't seem to disadvantage you here so but i see what you hear what you're saying and you say well maybe it's because you know what if you have been matched with somebody who was nominated by lots of people maybe that that's that's what the role model would be okay okay so i for that i need to document the fact that what is the variation in centrality and uh because if there is not much variation in centrality everybody mentions their five neighbors and basically everybody is the same there's no there's no central paper but it's a good yeah it's very good point i will do that we'll do that if you will add to the paper thanks um okay so this is now again looking at the average three no i have to be careful because i only have 15 minutes left um the average treatment on on agricultural performance these are now in log because you know there's noise in the data especially these values is always noise so if you take a look it kind of dampens a little bit the the upper tail and you don't have to wins horizon all that so so the the the news is that in terms of yields you get you get slightly higher yields so basically seven percent higher yield for teacher training four percent for the five percent for the students and in terms of profit they get about four you know the teachers i get about fourteen percent high profits nine percent and fourteen percent um compared to the control so so there is a there is some benefit that that is uh that is you know achieved through that it's not just that they learn to to to mimic what had been told uh they also actually benefit uh from that so that that's the good news um so now we we so that's that's all about average treatment effect so now i want to focus a little bit more about uh i want to do a little bit more one is the i want to compare the students depending on whether their teacher is incentivized or not so basically the this is the mean for unincentivized uh teachers and this is the the mean the additional increase in score um in the quiz of of students who have been assigned uh to an incentivized teacher training and you can see there's a little bit significant or you know mindless significant uh improvement in in and it's a little bit stronger if you look as to whether they answer the three main questions correctly um so that means that incentivizing the teacher seems to have induced the teacher to do a slightly better job in teaching them uh to the test of course in teaching them to to take the test okay um and this is whether we also looked as to whether it has an effect on the teachers so basically do the teachers do better on the test because they they taught uh they know you had to teach the test there we don't see well there's a positive but if you know coefficient here but it's definitely not significant and you can see that the teachers do in general very very well on the test okay so it looks like they were paying attention uh knowing that they're going to be teachers not doesn't really depend on them being incentivized um this is um um this is the effect of or rather the absence of effect of so you see that if you incentivize a teacher the students do a little bit better on the test does it translate in higher adoption the answer is no so the yeah we have slightly the point estimates are very the small nothing is ever significant there is a very large relative to the coefficients so basically there is no that incentivization did not induce more adoption okay and it also did not induce more adoption by the teachers the reason why we worry about that is is uh because in the other paper the one we did on referrals what we found is that the farmers who referred all the farmers um the other farmers kind of learn about that they know that they've been referred oh you know marshall you referred me okay and then so marcel suddenly decides oh me now he's observing me is he you know he knows that i referred him so maybe i should put my money where my mouth is so basically you know i better adopt a little bit or maybe pretend to adopt a little bit so that i don't completely don't look completely silly to have recommended this person for training otherwise he would say why did you send me something completely useful to do something completely useless panel sorry so so that's why we we we just looked this to whether they don't do that here we did not induce excess adoption by teachers by incentivizing them which i think is good news [Music] now so this is about incentivization this is about the other treatment whether you are assigned to a teacher that you nominated or not so does it affect the performance of the student on the quiz well there's a there's a point estimate which is positive here but it's definitely not significant same thing here this is very small so basically the answer is no the fact that you are assigned to somebody you you regard as you listed as a role model doesn't affect how much you learn from them even on the quiz and this is what happens um on your adoption itself if anything there's one one thing here that's negative but uh which i kind of already saw before borderline significant at ten percent level but other than that it's all it's all negative and so yeah let's just confirms what we already looked at before what about mediation analysis it's going into a bigger direction of um heterogeneity analysis so so here basically we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna think about what could be the process by which the teacher is um is inducing adoption is it because he's transferring more knowledge and this knowledge is useful for adoption okay well you have to know what the practices are before you can actually follow them and be measured as following them or is it that people follow the example so basically you know if the if the teacher is adopting and maybe he can can take the the trainees to the field or at least he can talk them through it on the field so that so that's the so to do that basically we thought well why don't we put um [Music] that should not be so this is the incentivized teacher trainee and then we thought well if it is uh uh no this this is not this is the quiz performance of the something here sorry i think this is not the teacher's value it's the the student's value of the so basically if if the effect of um [Music] is no no this is okay sorry sorry i got confused for a second this is the effect on on the on the the the students performance in the quiz this is the student and the quiz and basically students whose teacher does better on the quiz also do better on the quiz so basically there's some transmission of knowledge from the teacher to the student so teachers who learn more translate more to their to their students even controlling for the fact that the teacher may have been incentivized so we control for that so that here's a control we're just looking whether the transmission is through or at least some of the transmission is through knowledge transformation the teachers who learn more transfer more to their to their um to their students and this is by nominate the same thing by domination status so again you know is also there um this is the effect of the of the quiz score on on adoption and so basically you look as to whether this has an effect on adoption as well and so you get you get a couple significant terms there but other than that it seems to be pretty flat and the same thing is reproduced if you if you compare nominating students non-nominating students instead of comparing incentivized uh teacher training students to non-instant device teacher training students so so basically what this says is that performance on the quiz score uh of the teacher just just has some some transmission to uh uh to to adoption suggesting that knowledge is is one of the channels of transmission as you would expect i mean you would hope this is true but but now we have to look at the other thing which is um um examples teaching by example so so here we go we're looking at the teachers value of the the corresponding adoption measure so basically are people more likely to adopt is if the teacher adopts are there people more likely to plant on a large proportion of their land if the teacher does that and so on so basically we you can see that in all these cases that these things are are positive the only exception being this one where teachers are already quite high start with so so there's nothing perhaps a bit less variation there but so what you find is that it's basically the evidence that both channels are operating here one is that if you are taught by a better teacher someone who is paid more attention to the course knows more you do you adopt more it's a channel of transmission and you're also better you also know better on the quiz and and then the other thing is that if the teacher adopts you you seem to be more likely to follow his example so these two things are there so the last thing i'm gonna do um in the three minutes i have i should have stopped earlier but um um so we also would like to know whether inviting trainees to be a teacher has an effect of of on their adoption okay not relative to their students but relative to trainees who would not have received this task of training other students so fortunately we have this other uh experimental events you know it's also an rct and in that experiment we have a whole batch of um trainees who are randomly selected among the 30 farmers and we're only trained they only receive the training so we can kind of compare them to the to the teachers so that's basically what we do in this in this first comparison here and what you find is that so p2p the me is basically means that you were in the in the teacher training experiment and not in the other experiment what you find is that so if the average adoption in um of the of the uh of the randomly selected trainees in the other experiment was 36 then among uh our teacher training you know we know it's it's like close to 70 so it's basically 34 higher than that okay so that's that's the idea so basically what you get is that um inviting people to be teacher training makes them adopt more okay um and it doesn't necessarily do that for the for the food you know if you these these other comparisons are not more significant but perhaps the surprise is that um the the student farmers if you compare them to or to to to other trainees they're not that you know sometimes a little bit less sometimes a bit more but they're not massively different from people who actually receive the black training which i think is quite remarkable these are these are people who have not seen any bracket uh training agent so they basically all they've learned about sri is from other farmers and and their adoption and behavior in general is relatively similar to to people who in the other um in the other uh experiment received and trained directly from black we did we do a small back of the envelope cosmetic analysis the details of the calculations are in the appendix we get a we estimate a social return of two points basically you value the profits and so on and compare it to the cost that we have incurred and you know you get a two point two and a half dollars per dollar invested in the program which generates a rate of return social rate of return 150 which is not bad it's lower than what we got in the other experiment but the other experiment um suggested that um if you incentivize me if you push people they tend to over adopt so they basically you kind of induce them to experiment with uh with the technology and then everything experimented they discover it's not for them it's too difficult for them and then they withdraw from the technology the year after we noticed that so here by inducing more people to adopt with you know it's great we have induced lots of people to experiment but as as we said not sri is not for everybody and so so as a result maybe there's excess if you want excess experimentation i don't know if it's success but lots of people experiment who don't necessarily benefit from it certainly not in the first year they try it so that's the that's the kind of the general uh lesson here and maybe i should i should stop here and if there's still time for some questions if people still have questions have any questions from the audience so marcel just to follow up on dilip's earlier question you don't really look at heterogeneity with respect to any characteristics of either the teachers or the students no yes and is uh and is that because of lack of power or lack of data or or lack or you think it's not really identified it's probably due to perceived lack of patience for it by editors and referees i think that's the thing oh you are picking winners you go you have 27 heterogeneity tests you just report the one that gives you a big kick and so and then in any case it's not uh it's not as it's not experimentally assigned and so on on so we tried to but i think that the but you have given me some suggestion for for uh i really liked the suggested suggestion earlier about looking at uh nominations i think it's a very good suggestion and we should do that in the paper because it really fits in the paper and it fits in the motivation of the paper and uh it's it's of course related to what dilip was saying as well so yeah i had i had another sort of broader question here it's i mean can you reject the uh story where there's just one kind of heterogeneity which is uh skill and denominations basically were a way to identify the more skilled farmers and the students themselves were selected by brac on the basis of something which i probably assume is related to farming skill so you've already got a pre-selected you know high-skilled farmers and then within them you're selecting the most skill and they just happen to be teachers so can you reject the hypothesis that it's just about selection of skill that all this teaching stuff is you know it's not doing anything uh i mean of course yeah there's some diffusion obviously uh but you know but basically you know it's not nothing to do with skill and teaching or anything like that i mean it's just skill in picking up stuff that's now generally available in the village no but i mean that's fine but but it's not true that we have only selected as teachers those that were the most skilled as measured by the number of nominations they received with four four people among them you know but it was biased in favor of the people with high nominations so i think you know doing what sujata was suggesting is a good idea is you know actually why not just look at the number of nominations that you received and just look at you know how performance varied with that uh that that would be one way okay yeah i can do that i can do that but remember in terms of the test itself i mean we have corrected for the stratification so so i don't think that's the that's that's i don't think that is invalidating our results because we have we thought about it it's a different interpretation i'm just saying i'm not disputing the statistical validity of your results it's just a question of what what you think is sort of going on underneath and whether teaching has anything to do with it yes so in the first experiment the one with the 182 whatever villages where you didn't ask them to teach but did you select them the same way it was simpler because we were not trying to match but uh okay so the the the guy can so in that experiment the the start is the same we take 30 brac shows up picks their 30 farmers because that's the way they they kind of line up farmers for sri training so they kind of identify them and then they keep them and they then they bring the the training agent so so and they train them in groups of 12 so basically we basically randomly selected 12 farmers of the 30 and assigned them to for the first training session and then at the end of the training session each of them was asked to so there were 18 farmers left on the list so before they left they say oh before you leave and because they get paid their little stipend so before you you know here's a list pick a name on the list as to who would most benefit from uh the brock training so they basically look at the list and say oh okay i can see uh albert's on the list so i'm gonna mention albert and then the next person comes and say oh i'm gonna mention albert two no no look it's already been crossed you can't mention albert anymore you have to mention someone else okay i'm going to mention juja so they basically mentioned simon basically then you can see the people who have been so in that paper we actually use that order if you want to see the bottom line is that um they did not they did not recommend on average so everybody they recommend 12 people out of 18. so normally you should you should you know the six worst farmers at least able farmers or least skilled farmers should have been dropped out of the list so they you should basically see that this selected sample of 12 out of 18 farmers should be better than the 12 randomly selected farmers right because the second sample is a is only two thirds of the 18 and they've been selected to be the most skilled farmers so you should see that they are adopting more because they understand what's going on and they they get more more benefit from it that's not that what we find at all so the reason i was asking was i was wondering if that helps you answer dilip's question about whether there's something about having to teach that makes you a better adopter yourself but you can't actually answer that question because the way that these teachers those guys were selected is different it's random they're not both being selected the same way then some get to teach and others don't get to teach it's not as simple as that i mean everybody could have been selected to teach everybody has a probability of being selected if you are of the 15 above median you have uh four out of 15 chances if you are above the 15 you have two out of 15 chances everybody could be a teacher and we correct for the probabilities of of you being being a teacher yeah yeah that i do understand that okay i think we're a little bit past time so uh i'd like to thank myself very interesting presentation and i'd like to thank i also want to thank the staff at iems who have been coordinating the webinars for all six seminars so that's carla who's managing today carla chan and joey chu who's uh the manager at ims i think it's been really well managed so you know silent applause and uh this was obviously a second best event in lieu of having a workshop in person uh but i think it's been really valuable in the world of covid to still be able to have some intellectual exchange and bring you know leading people working on common issues of interest so i want to thank all the participants yeah i appreciate very much you having me i really enjoyed it and thanks for the excellent comments thank you thank you
