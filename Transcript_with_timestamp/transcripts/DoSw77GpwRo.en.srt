2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,840
We're doing something a little bit

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,360
different today. We're working over 300

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,799
goats. Got our hands full. We're going

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:17,039
to dive into some details of goat

6
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:19,279
ranching with the Pokeet family. Joe

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,039
Poke and his wife and their two

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,000
daughters doing something that's very

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,279
important. We're going to work their

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,640
goats today. Babies, Billies, nannies,

11
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,960
all of them. And they're going back out

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,960
in the pasture.

13
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:42,840
[Music]

14
00:00:51,239 --> 00:01:06,350
Okay. Yeah.

18
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,159
This kid right

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,159
[Music]

20
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:28,680
here. This kid's already been working

21
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,680
together.

22
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,079
You got you running the gate. Okay.

23
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,840
So Kevin, my stepdad, and Joe Pokeet

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,680
work together for the Noble Foundation.

25
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,080
If you don't know a little about Kevin,

26
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,800
Kevin is the goat and sheep guy. Always

27
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:34,239
has been. been into the sheep and goats

28
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,879
business for uh probably ever since he

29
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,599
was a kid. Um and then Kevin does some

30
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:43,200
stuff with goats at the Noble Foundation

31
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:46,000
and works with Joe Poke. But this is Joe

32
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,640
and his wife's little side hustle about

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,840
a pound. Yeah.

34
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,840
They eat her up at cell.

35
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,560
If she If she's lame, I'll catch her.

36
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:12,480
She's just struggling with her horns.

37
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:15,360
Okay. Now, we know obviously there's a

38
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,159
huge difference between working goats

39
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,920
and bison. Definitely a lot more

40
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:23,200
hands-on experience when you're working

41
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,599
the goats, but honestly, it's not that

42
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:29,040
much different other than you're dealing

43
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:33,120
with a,000 lb animal versus anywhere

44
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:37,040
from 60 to 100 lb animal. It's same sort

45
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:39,519
of process. So once we kind of corral

46
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,159
the goats and get them from one big pin

47
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:45,519
to a smaller pin and even into another

48
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:48,159
smaller pin from there is where you have

49
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:51,680
to sort the nannies away from the kids.

50
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:54,959
All of these goats today are getting

51
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,040
proper vaccinations just like we would

52
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,360
when we're working the bison. So, if

53
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,439
we've got calves, they're going to get a

54
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,000
couple of different vaccinations that

55
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:08,599
those are one time vaccinations for

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,599
their whole life, such as black leg.

57
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,760
Oh, I can handle that.

58
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,560
Yeah, we got we got

59
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,680
these baby goats are getting the same

60
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:51,040
thing. So that's why they're kind of

61
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:52,720
separated. And also most of the mills um

62
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,759
are going to get banded. And this is

63
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,800
part of the meat industry in goats. And

64
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,639
so this is pretty standard uh when you

65
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,639
have when you're working females and

66
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,360
males. The boys, if you're not selling

67
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,199
them for a breeding goat, then they're

68
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,280
going to be used on the meat side of

69
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,840
things. obviously for grazing and stuff

70
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,680
which is what the pes are doing in this

71
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,120
but in order to make a profit off your

72
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:20,240
animals you've got to either sell some

73
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:23,680
for breeding or meat and in this case

74
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:26,240
this area of the United States the goat

75
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,720
meat and hair sheep meat is becoming

76
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:32,400
very popular and is a growing industry.

77
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,639
So, just as a farmer raising crops or a

78
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,280
bison rancher raising bison, you've got

79
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:40,240
to be able to pay your bills, pay for

80
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,080
your fencing or feed or any of that.

81
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,400
You've got to be able to sell some

82
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,360
animals to make a profit to pay those

83
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,440
bills. And it doesn't matter how many

84
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,680
animals you have, whether it's 300 or

85
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,400
you have 10.

86
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,199
Okay. So, I don't know anything about

87
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,840
the ear cutting. It's just male. Female.

88
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,000
Oh boy. I wasn't sure either. Male,

89
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,319
female. I don't have a I didn't get my

90
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,319
tags in time. I would have tagged them,

91
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,120
but then I know cuz we're going to have

92
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,639
another flock of them here. Yeah. So

93
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,759
then I know which way we work these

94
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,680
ones. Yeah. And so what? Left ears. Left

95
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:19,199
ear. Left ear is female and right ear is

96
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:23,960
male. Okay. Is that right? It's a thing.

97
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,960
It's a thing. That's the way the doies.

98
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,960
You want to pet this? Okay.

99
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:36,800
Nice to meet you.

100
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,720
What do you think, Brooks? They work

101
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:43,800
good. They're cute, aren't they? So

102
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,800
cute. Don't touch that. It's a owie.

103
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:51,840
Two or three times.

104
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:54,639
So cute. How old? Oh gosh. Probably like

105
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,000
a couple weeks. Okay. Yeah. Or wait, is

106
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,000
this the umbilical part? Oh, yeah.

107
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,280
Probably a week. A week. I was going to

108
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,759
say they're small. They're so tiny. No,

109
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,720
I like this one. I just They don't like

110
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:09,680
This is more wormer.

111
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,240
It's a It's a different worm than what

112
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,440
we're given before. Okay. I get a

113
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,199
different class of worms in them.

114
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,680
Gotcha.

115
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,720
That's Is it targeting one specific?

116
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,160
Probably, but I don't know.

117
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:26,160
Well, I wouldn't either.

118
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,160
So,

119
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,280
Feisty little sister here. Yeah.

120
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,160
Might do hurt too. And

121
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,160
yeah.

122
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,639
black or that big do. It's the big

123
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,759
black. No, I think it's the big dough.

124
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,919
This one right here. Yeah, it's that

125
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,440
big.

126
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,490
Just her feet are pretty. You want to

127
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:24,019
look at her feet or No, just her

128
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:24,019
[Music]

129
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,479
Yeah, I go ahead.

130
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,479
Yeah, let's just put a

131
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:47,200
little I This one doesn't work. Third

132
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,160
time down here.

133
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,160
He's like

134
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,080
Yeah, I don't think it's going to get

135
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:58,160
out. But that's a we need that other So,

136
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,560
what did you just give her, Kevin? Sore

137
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,360
mouth vaccine. Sore mouth. And then

138
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:06,640
that's just a dewormer. No, no, no, no,

139
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:09,760
no, no. That from here is a great angle.

140
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,760
You can see the sorting of the nannies

141
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,240
versus the kids.

142
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,040
As you can see here, it's very important

143
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,440
to have good equipment, a good handling

144
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:23,519
facility so you're able to sort out your

145
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:26,320
animals in a efficient way. Nannies,

146
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,160
Billies, kids, and you can work them

147
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,760
properly and then let them back out into

148
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,839
the pasture. These animals are not in

149
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,120
here for very long and they're being

150
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:37,279
handled in a short amount of time. Just

151
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,920
like in the bison industry, you've got

152
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:42,240
to have good equipment. And Joe here set

153
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,320
up the pins perfectly and I think

154
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,760
everything went great. C and D, which is

155
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,640
for clustial peripheres. C and D. This

156
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,360
one actually does B and tetanas. Mhm.

157
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:57,000
All the above. All the above. Okay. B is

158
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:59,760
like overeating disease. Okay. C is

159
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,240
like uh

160
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,640
what's type C? I can't remember. Oh,

161
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,040
it's like a like a sour gut thing, I

162
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,560
think. I can't. Yeah, it has. I can't I

163
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,240
know D knee is like overeating. Yeah, D

164
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,440
is overeating and then the tea is just

165
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,760
straight. Used to everybody give

166
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,079
straight. Now they mix. You can still

167
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,160
buy. Oh, you're good. I was just

168
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,399
listening

169
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:22,519
to

170
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:26,240
straight kill.

171
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:28,320
So, they will get that now in the

172
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,000
spring. Will you redo it like in the

173
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,120
fall?

174
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,720
Probably not.

175
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,920
Just depends like so we do it now. So

176
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,640
hopefully they pass a little bit

177
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,440
immunity to the bread ones. Okay. Cuz a

178
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:42,240
lot of these hopefully are bred to kid

179
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,200
here in another two months. So we want

180
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,160
to give it to them now. That way the

181
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,240
kids can get it and then when we

182
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,440
vaccinate the kids it's they're a little

183
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,120
more protected against it. Sure. Unless

184
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,959
claustrdia isn't everything like it's

185
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,800
everywhere. And so I don't know is

186
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,399
that's like a that's that's what we're

187
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,839
vaccinating for is the claustrdia

188
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,200
peripheres and there's different strains

189
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,959
of it and it's like just lives in the

190
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,040
soil. It's everywhere. It's not

191
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:05,399
everybody has it. It's in your gut

192
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:08,320
microb, you know, microfllora and stuff,

193
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:10,720
but when you get stressed or if you have

194
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,079
a inflammation of some kind, then it'll

195
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,720
take it's a bacteria. It'll take over

196
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,079
and cause problems. Gotcha. Gotcha. Did

197
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,079
you do this one already, Jesse? Yes,

198
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,079
sir.

Golly.

201
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:38,800
Kevin lease pokeet some of these billies

202
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,519
and they can spread their love. It just

203
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:44,480
be like Big Joe being rented and going

204
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,880
to somebody else's property. Same thing.

205
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,560
This is just another way to make a

206
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,760
profit off your animals. You can

207
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:55,279
actually rent or lease out your billies

208
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:57,959
and other producers can use those

209
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:02,600
billies. Different genetics, different

210
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:02,600
breeds for their own benefit.

211
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,320

Isa, you want to let them out? Did you

222
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,279
give them this? The two little ones.

223
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,639
Little ones. Were those worked? Yeah,

224
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,160
they already had 10. I think they got

225
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,839
worked already. Okay. They're the

226
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,839
They're the escape artists, I think.

227
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,839

Mom. Help me. No.

235
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,120
All right, here it is. The last big

236
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,519
group of goats that are going to work

237
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,680
today. Kind of takes a team effort on

238
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,519
something like this. Instead of using a

239
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,760
pusher like we would for the bison,

240
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,920
obviously way more dangerous situation

241
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,240
when working bison. But as far as the

242
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,800
goats, just kind of coring them and

243
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,199
pushing them and funneling down into a

244
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:58,880
smaller pin and obviously into another

245
00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:01,440
smaller pin. Same thing that we would do

246
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:04,079
with bison. Goats will be goats. And if

247
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,880
there's one animal I would compare bison

248
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:09,760
to. I compare them to goats all the

249
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:12,360
time. As far as behavior goes, they're

250
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:15,440
just so curious. They're so

251
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:19,160
nosy. Just like a goat. I think bison

252
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,160
are just as nosy.

253
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:25,880
[Music]

254
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,880
trying to find his little

255
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,399
turn the whole way and then straightened

256
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,399
up in the

257
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,639
I'll just ask. Okay. So, Joe's here and

258
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,759
one of the questions that I think is

259
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:04,240
important uh for me, people have talked

260
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,320
to me about using, you know, we have our

261
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,000
bison and they're after the grasses. One

262
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:11,600
of the things that people always mention

263
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,680
is using goats for cleanup that the

264
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,279
bison don't eat. Can you talk about

265
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,959
multiecies grazing? Joe does this

266
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:21,279
full-time already for the Noble

267
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:23,360
Foundation and then as a side hustle,

268
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,759
too. So, I mean, he's got a lot of

269
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,000
experience. So, what what's your opinion

270
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,759
of of the using the goats? So, I'm

271
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,240
fairly new to goats, too, only in the

272
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,920
last 3 or 4 years, but you can see

273
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,399
pretty quickly the impact they have on

274
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:39,040
the land. And the good thing is a lot of

275
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:41,920
this land hasn't had goat impact, so

276
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,079
it's really primed for it. and they they

277
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,959
would prefer to eat the brows and the

278
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,480
forbes and you know leave the grass. So

279
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,959
when we mix that with a large room like

280
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,920
bison or cattle or something it the

281
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:55,440
symbiosis the nature symbiosis is

282
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,680
apparent. You know it's it's pretty

283
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,839
obvious. So at this place here we've got

284
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,199
at least we there's a lot of a lot of

285
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,959
brush that we're trying to beat it back

286
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,880
a little bit. So we're stocked pretty

287
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,480
aggressively but that's on purpose to

288
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,079
help open some of this up and then of

289
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,720
course we let everything have adequate

290
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,079
rest to grow back. So the way it's split

291
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,280
now, this is kind of the open half and

292
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,039
then the wooded half is over there. So

293
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,280
we graze them over here in the winter.

294
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,720
And then what's been really cool and we

295
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,640
should go I go take you around and look

296
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,959
at it. But what's really cool here is in

297
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,319
the winter we just had this rested for

298
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,640
an entire summer. So there's a lot of

299
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,160
dead native grass. But the little three

300
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,919
and fourt tall cedars, there's nothing

301
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,679
left of them. They destroyed every one

302
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,480
of them. Yeah. Well, you can even look

303
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:37,760
right here behind you. Oh yeah. And you

304
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:40,160
can see what four or five feet tall.

305
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,760
There's no green underneath those trees.

306
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,200
And it's not because I mean we're pretty

307
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,679
early into spring too, but this is

308
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,160
that's the browse line. Yeah. And right

309
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,840
now I usually have them a little more

310
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,320
fenced in. Right now we're just trying

311
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,559
to get around everything very fast. So

312
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,640
they have a big area which is not how we

313
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,880
manage it normally, but just the kind of

314
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,400
context we're right now. So they kind of

315
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,240
get this and they get to pick at the

316
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,080
brush over there and there's not enough

317
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,600
just to lock them on it. So yep. But

318
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,880
they're getting all this really emerging

319
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,240
stuff. And you're absolutely right.

320
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,160
They're there. Definitely a browse line

321
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,400
here. And that's only from, you know,

322
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,799
the 30 days the brush has been growing.

323
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,679
That's crazy. Yeah. And the cedar tree

324
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:19,120
thing, too, is like bison will they're

325
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,919
not going to eat it, but they're going

326
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,600
to whip it so bad and they can break it

327
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,679
and it eventually die. But a goat's

328
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,880
going to come through and gnaw on those

329
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,160
those things. And once they lose their

330
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:32,320
needles, they're I mean, they're dead.

331
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,919
They're going to die. And and and they

332
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,440
the goats really prefer that in the

333
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,559
winter time. It compliments their diet.

334
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,919
You know, there's a lot of tannins in

335
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,160
cedar, too, and that helps kind of with

336
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,640
the parasites, keeping them clean and,

337
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,919
you know, healthy. So, you we can I can

338
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,360
Let's go over my truck and I'll show you

339
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,880
some stuff. Show you. Yeah. And there's

340
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,640
definitely some cedar trees that they've

341
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,760
killed just from eating all the needles.

342
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,559
But, too, some of the bigger ones,

343
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,320
they've rung the run the bark and done

344
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,320
the cadium cadmium or cad can't

345
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,600
remember, but they get in that layer of

346
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,960
the bark and that that's going to kill

347
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,320
that tree. Kills it too. Yeah,

348
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,160
absolutely. And we're not trying to kill

349
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,160
all the trees, but no, this is a a

350
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,559
jungle. It's kind of unmanageable. So

351
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,440
goats can open that up and we can, you

352
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,880
know, we might have to do some

353
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,400
mechanical intervention to open the

354
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,559
canopy up to get some more native

355
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,160
grasses growing because, you know,

356
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,919
ideally we're in the cross timbers eco

357
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,160
region, right? So we want this to be a

358
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,679
cross timber savannah. Yes. Scattered

359
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,880
trees and lots of grass. And they're

360
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,480
going to help you get they're going to

361
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,120
help you clean it up enough where you

362
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,280
can see, okay, we need to get in here

363
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,160
with maybe a skid steer. That's right.

364
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:33,120
You know, and and do that. So, so the

365
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:36,160
other thing is to me I think the goat

366
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,640
thing is becoming a more approachable

367
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:41,760
side hustle and maybe full-time for some

368
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:46,080
people. Um, not only if it's multiecies

369
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:48,080
species grazing, but it they're just

370
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,440
they're they can be difficult like

371
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,960
keeping them in your fence, but no

372
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,600
different than bison. Keep them happy

373
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,919
and fed, watered, all those things. But

374
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,840
just you know, like it's a business.

375
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,080
It's a little side business now. And I

376
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,240
think it's more approachable

377
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,240
um now because I think more people are

378
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,960
saying, "Hey, you can use these animals

379
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,559
to clean up your property." And as long

380
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,720
as you got good fencing and all those

381
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,720
things, keep them happy, you can run a

382
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,960
business off of it. That's right. And

383
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,440
you know, the way things are today with

384
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,360
the barrier to entry to getting started

385
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,919
in agriculture is really, really high.

386
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,919
Right. Yep. Mostly capital. But you

387
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,679
know, we're we're first generation

388
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,960
ranchers and we've been doing this

389
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,720
professionally. I've been doing it

390
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,360
professionally for somebody else for

391
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,720
over 20 years. So, we're not new by any

392
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,559
means, but we're still first generation

393
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,720
trying to make our make our run at it.

394
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,000
And I always get always thinking saying

395
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,679
like you got to be willing to do what

396
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,679
other people aren't willing to do. Yep.

397
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,159
And lots of people would rather just

398
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,600
have cows and I want to have a ranging

399
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,080
business. Yeah. So, if the goats are

400
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,440
going to help us do that and it wasn't

401
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,720
without it work, you know, somebody told

402
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,799
me that you get paid to learn how to

403
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,400
keep goats in. And I always thought that

404
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,640
was funny because I' I've spent more

405
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,080
time working on the fence here. Yeah. I

406
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,840
mean, there was four or five months of

407
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,400
just working on the fence even bothering

408
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,760
us and but knowing just from my

409
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,360
experience at work, too. Just knowing

410
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,480
that that was important. Yeah. Don't

411
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,000
have to be chasing them around.

412
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,039
Absolutely. I want to show you a couple.

413
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,640
Yeah. I want to Well, I want to get

414
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,720
some. Of course, cedars. They all know

415
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,559
that. They all know that I hate cedar

416
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,760
trees. Yeah. Let's go. Let's get my

417
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:19,159
truck and I'll go show you. Okay. Let's

418
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,159
go look at them.

419
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:31,159
that has just been gobbled up. Like

420
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:34,039
there's nothing left of those

421
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:37,520
cedars. Nothing

422
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:40,960
left. And now that tree instead of

423
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:44,640
having I don't know 8 n 10 cedar trees

424
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:47,360
taking water, you've got a big one big

425
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,720
oak tree oak tree that can can get some

426
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,120
more water and it creates a better

427
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,880
habitat for whether turkeys want to

428
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,360
roost there or not. Yep. Haven't got up

429
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:58,720
there high enough. But if they need to,

430
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:01,679
they could stand up, push that thing

431
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,720
over, and eat it. I've watched them do

432
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:06,240
that if they have

433
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,760
to. That's pretty cool. Little one in

434
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,159
the back. They were barking that one.

435
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,039
Yeah. So, they are knocking the bark off

436
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:16,240
of it. That is so

437
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:20,400
cool. Yeah, that's good stuff. So, this

438
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:23,200
is something that a bison will not do.

439
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:26,320
They do not won't browse off these type

440
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:29,280
of trees, but what a bison will do is

441
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,200
rub and rub and rub it. Rub until

442
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,720
they're all broke and then they snap and

443
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,720
then they're dead. Yeah, it looks ugly

444
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,559
for a while until it rots away, but

445
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,600
yeah, all of those right here under this

446
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:41,600
big old oak tree. Pretty cool. Yep,

447
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,960
there is.

448
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,480
All them cedars. Look at all those

449
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,720
cedars. Yeah. And they're ripping the

450
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,440
bark off that one over there. Yeah.

451
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,440
Yeah. So, and that was really good feed

452
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,000
this winter for them. Absolutely.

453
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:57,600
Balances the gut and they're getting

454
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,480
what they need. And then I guarantee you

455
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,320
before you put these goats in there, you

456
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,919
couldn't see that green grass on the

457
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,720
other side. Oh, for sure you could. This

458
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,640
was all completely covered and now

459
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:12,240
wildlife can go in and out of there

460
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:14,320
100%. Yep. We're big on on deer habitat,

461
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:18,559
too. And Yep. You can go over here on

462
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,559
stuff that doesn't have a goat in

463
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,520
So here, this is what we'd call more

464
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:30,039
than likely field fence. Starts out low

465
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,799
or it starts out small here and it gets

466
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:37,360
bigger as you get to the top. And this

467
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:40,320
one is only going to be 36 in tall, 3 ft

468
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,880
up here on the side of my hip. This is

469
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,880
your typical goat

470
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,880
fence. And

471
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,559
As long as you got plenty of forge, you

472
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,960
keep them happy. They don't need to jump

473
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,600
over anything. Could also keep predators

474
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,880
out as well, I

475
00:23:54,600 --> 00:24:01,679
think. You think this helps

476
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:03,039
uh keep coyotes out? Yeah, you can find

477
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,159
them. So, like here, little crawl

478
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:08,799
spaces. This was a this is just a wash,

479
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,960
but I put a log in there, you know.

480
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:14,000
Yeah. But goats will get out there, too.

481
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,679
So, yeah, they will. across the fence.

482
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,159
You can see the Yeah, that's a good way

483
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,159
to look at

484
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:24,760
it. So, this

485
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,440
is

486
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:31,320
obviously Joe's. Look at

487
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:34,720
this. All of the

488
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,720
growth, all the

489
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:39,200
underbrush. You I mean, you can't see

490
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,960
through there at all. And then you come

491
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,720
over

492
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:46,640
here and I you can see 30 40 yards in

493
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:50,000
there to the other side. You can see the

494
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,760
browse line and this is only 4 months

495
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,840
having them in here. Four months, you

496
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,240
know. Yeah. Not continuously. They they

497
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,320
grazed this in December and then they've

498
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:02,000
had access access to it now for probably

499
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:04,640
the last two weeks. So, it's had a

500
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,360
little bit of rest, but yeah, definitely

501
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,799
definitely a major difference between

502
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,840
the two sides.

503
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:13,520
Absolutely. Yeah, you can see all the

504
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,520
way through there. That's so cool. Yeah,

505
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,679
we just saw a goat and deer can see

506
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,039
that. And yeah, pigs and or whatever

507
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:22,080
else, you know, whatever wildlife you

508
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:23,919
want. Turkeys, quail. I mean, they're

509
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,880
more determined to run through some of

510
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:28,000
this stuff now. Yeah. And forage and

511
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,039
Well, they have a chance to. I mean,

512
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,880
they can pick their way through that,

513
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:33,919
but it's just kind of a a jungle.

514
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:37,400
Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't want to go

515
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:40,159
through that. Yeah. Me either. So,

516
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,600
yeah. This looks awesome. Looks really

517
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,520
good. Something I've learned about the

518
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,159
bison, too, in places like this. I was

519
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:50,559
like worried, do I need goats? Do I need

520
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:52,320
to put goats in some of our um brushy

521
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,000
areas or our tree lines? You know,

522
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,320
thought about doing that. But what the

523
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,679
bison have done is they're just big and

524
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,840
broad and don't care. They just

525
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:02,159
bulldoze. They just bulldo through there

526
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,159
and you you'd be surprised they'll go

527
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,760
through and nip at stuff for sure, but

528
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,080
they'll just blow through there and

529
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,480
create and open it up. It's kind of

530
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,880
surprising. So So the next issue we have

531
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,120
is we can see what's going on here now,

532
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:18,080
but there's still not very much sunlight

533
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,279
getting through the canopy. So, like all

534
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,679
these little trees, we're just gonna

535
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:25,120
have to come in here mechanically and

536
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:27,279
open open the canopy up. Yeah. You know,

537
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,919
you leave the big and Yeah. Leave the

538
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:33,440
big oaks and pecans and stuff like that.

539
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:35,760
But Yeah. And so, traditionally, all the

540
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,440
unullet would have handled that way back

541
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,559
when. That's right. But when you put a

542
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,799
fence up and then you don't manage it,

543
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:44,720
you take away from, you know, what

544
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:48,159
nature would have been doing hundreds of

545
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:51,039
years ago. take the unullet away and

546
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,720
then all the shrubby stuff that a a deer

547
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:57,440
or an analopee that were here back in

548
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:59,120
the day or elk and y bison would have

549
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,279
wouldn't have let any of this stuff

550
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,200
happen and then you don't manage it and

551
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,640
then here's what happens or fire too or

552
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,400
fire. Yeah, that's I was fixing to say

553
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,080
like these big these are big honey

554
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,799
locust and stuff and yeah, they're

555
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,880
they're good they can be good fodder for

556
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:15,919
wildlife too but they'll take over an

557
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:18,559
area pretty easy too. fast. They'll do

558
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:20,480
it fast. They can be invasive. Yeah. So,

559
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:22,240
you when you put a fence up, all that

560
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,600
changes if you don't manage it. But I

561
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,480
would almost guarantee you that this was

562
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,760
all peanuts or cotton at some time. Oh,

563
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,600
I mean, look how big these oak trees

564
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,360
are. Yeah. There's not big oak trees

565
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,200
like that out in the middle. And then

566
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,120
there's a lot of there's old wheel line

567
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,200
wheels here and all aluminum pipe. So,

568
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,960
you know, this wasn't always a forest.

569
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,400
Like, that's the main argument is like,

570
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,159
well, you're letting nature go back to

571
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:44,559
what nature wants to do. This was

572
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:48,000
probably plowed in the 30s and 40s. It

573
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:50,520
was peanuts. Yep. You know. Yep. Yeah.

574
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,440
There are some big trees in here. And

575
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:55,600
then over

576
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:58,480
time it can happen. Yep. This is what

577
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:00,480
this is how it goes. And so you just got

578
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,240
the deer or whether the hogs too that we

579
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,320
have now, but all the analopee are gone,

580
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:07,520
all the bison are gone, all the elk are

581
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:10,159
gone. And so you can kind of follow up

582
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:12,480
or add in the goats and this is what you

583
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:17,440
get. That's right. I like it. Thanks,

584
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:20,080
Joe. Yeah, it's good stuff.

585
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:23,279
That is a big old tree in there. Is that

586
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:26,279
a pecan? Is it? I've never looked very

587
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:30,399
close at it. Look at

588
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:30,399
her. Little fresh set right

589
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:39,880
there. Little bitty

590
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,600
Brooks. Well, Brooks, Marissa, and I

591
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,440
want to personally thank the Poke family

592
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,559
for inviting us out to do a little goat

593
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,080
ranching today. I hope you guys learned

594
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,200
something new about goat ranching. I

595
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,000
know it's a little bit different than

596
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:02,320
biceing, but it's great to compare those

597
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,120
species and you can kind of imagine the

598
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,279
same thing the goats can do and what the

599
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,840
bison can do and what those type of

600
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:11,520
animals were doing historically on the

601
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,960
great plains. You can thank all the

602
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:17,440
unullet, goats and bison, deer, elk, and

603
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:20,320
all of them that kept the great plains

604
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,840
wide open and full of native grasses. I

605
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:24,880
want to thank them for letting us a

606
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:27,360
video today and showing their operation

607
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,960
and what they do. Great people, great

608
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,480
little family. I love what they're

609
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,760
doing. Thank you guys for watching us.

610
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,320
We'll see you guys soon. and rankable

611
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,320
boss ranchion.
