  "text": "[Music] yeah hello my name is aim doberan I'm the deputy director general for research of the international rice Research Institute or Erie and the gentleman besides me here is Lee wild he's the head of our experimental station and what we want to do with you in the next few months is actually learn how to grow a crop of rice not just any crop of rice we want to do it in the best possible manner we can think of you now we are scientists so we do a lot of research and we believe that we know a lot about rice and how to grow it in different parts of the world and we have lots of recommendations for farmers and extension workers we often call them best management practices you can find them on on the internet on our knowledge bank and extension materials in books and scientific papers but what we really really want to do is try to practice what we preach because often we as scientist may come up with uh things that you know don't really work in practice or sometimes you wonder why aren't people using them so that's why Lee and I have decided well why don't we do it ourselves as much as we can do our ourselves because some of the things we may not be really qualified to do but we'll try okay we will we will be [Music] qualified well this is day one of the great challenge so and our first job today is to level the field now Lee why is leveling the field so important and how do we do this for wet seed rice you're dealing with a with a Seedling that is 2 days old young and very fragile and there's the two most important criteria you've got to meet early are water control and weed control and in some ways they're one and the same so by leveling you can ensure that each each seedling has a consistent amount of water or a consistent lack of water depending on what you're trying to achieve at the time so we really think leveling the field is the very first and most important step probably to get a good crop established particularly if it's wet seated dries as we want to do in our agom challenge this year yes we're targeting a high yield and for a high yield we need a good establishment density we need a good number of plants in the field so we need a good survival of and and uh growing of the the seeds that we we will put out with the drum seeder in 2 days time and leveling is definitely the found Foundation upon which a good high yield is built when you grow rice of course as a farmer you have to choose a variety to grow so we have chose in a variety called n RC 222 or in the Philippines it's also called locally TU beun 18 but it is actually an eerie variety so it has also the Eerie designation IR r i54 now why did we choose this it can yield with good management easily six seven maybe even more tons per heor and it is a relatively new variety we play a lot of emphasis on this because more recently released varieties are better adapted to the current climate and they can therefore have better adaptation to the yield potential situation the environment that we have nowadays this variety was released in 2010 and that just that factor using a more recent variety can often give a yeld advantage of 5 to 10% well we began with certified seed now this seed has been germination germination tested and it tested it greater than 90% uh it was soaked uh put in water 36 36 hours ago and then drained about 16 or 17 hours ago and incubated for that length of time it's it's got a short uh route and even on some it's got a short uh shoot already so this is about ideal for for using a drum cater that we'll we'll touch on shortly the rout and shoot could be a little bit longer and it' still be okay so we've got a few hours to spare which might be helpful yeah um and the seed is is uh ready what are we going to do Lee I suspect the conclusion is we're not going to drum suit um this is the depth of our mud so as such the the wheels of the drum seeder sink too far into the mud and hence the the metering units sit on the mud and fail to function as metering units do we do the a few a few met out ahead once you okay just control control just little little little little little FES like like this you want to you do like that yeah see okay Lee on a scale 1 to 10 uh what do you think we've accomplished in terms of spreading our seed uniformally I think when we started the field we were barely five but overall I think I'd give us a seven or an eight the uniformity is quite good uh we're aiming for a plant density of 50 plants a square meter and there's plenty of seeds in the field spread uniformly to achieve just that we can lose a few seeds and we'll still be t i i I had a lot of trouble initially I was I think looking too much on the ground trying to sprinkle seed in little patches you know and but later I think I got the swing you know like the broad swing looking straight ahead walking and through I'm I'm quite hopeful that I improved over time but uh we'll see in the week I guess what emerges what we have here is an area that's that's representative of the the higher areas of the fields the areas that were that were well drained so this probably represents 50 to 60% of the field the the drainage was good the access to oxygen for the developing seed has been good it's germinated quickly and strongly it's got uh a green shoot very quickly and its third Leaf is already appearing this is uh wet direct seeding as it should be done these plants are happy now what we have here is an area that's representative of the the intermediate Zone shall I say when we seated it was too wet it was a little bit too wet and gradually during the week it gradually dried out but it was still wetter than we'd like it to be and you can see the seedlings are much smaller they've had to fight for survival for much of the week but they are establishing and they'll be okay even though they're slow The Establishment density is lower but overall it's an acceptable result so the seedlings were unhappy but now they're okay what we have here is an area representative of are of complete failure the area areas like this may be five somewhere between 5 and 10% of the field stayed wet all week they've only just become dry uh that was too long for the rice plants so here we have an area that's completely devoid of rice seedlings all the rice seeds have died so what we have is an uneven feel fi a non-uniform field the drier areas have grown really well the intermediate areas have grown okay they'll be okay but the wetter areas uh have been complete failures so 5 to 10% of the field we're going to recede to give it that second chance true uh being seated almost a week later will mean it matures a little later but rice does have a habit of catching up by the time you get to flowering and harvest so I'm not that concerned I think in hindsight we were seduced by technology we looked to the laser leveling laser guided ler equipment when in hindsight I think the small equipment the the equipment invented here in the Philippines would have given us a More Level field so um don't always assume the high-tech path is the most effective one so we're reating small areas just the wetter areas the the drier areas where the rice is okay that soil is now too dry it won't uh seed successfully the rice Roots won't penetrate the soil so there's no point putting seed there anyway we're focusing purely on those small very wet areas with no rice in them at all now I'm also thinking over here looking around here there's an area with a rat fence over to our to my left and now that that can be good because if you do have a rat problem last year there was a rat problem just here it's good to have what we call a trap crop where you plant an area early about 2 to 3 weeks early and then have traps with multile capture traps entrances right there so the rats are go in but can't get back out again particularly after the fellow period the rats there's big disturbance during the fellow period And The Working of the soil so the rats then get move out of get moved to the edges and they agregate and that's the best time to manage them how we have here trappy the rat and trappy is is used often when I talk to Farmers and we will show that they will enter into the Trap here and he'll Force his way through and rats yeah trap is big but see how they sort of crunch down and rats can do that as well the only thing that limits a rat they they can disate their shoulder shoulders what it's the width of their head which indicates as the how big the the hole is that can get in and with a mouse you push a finger in a mouse can get into a hole with a rat it's more sort of a probably a large thumb so it's usually about 12 mm if you got a hole bigger than that then the rats can get through and so often you know you don't need a very big opening here the rats will force their way through what do we know about birds and their interactions with suited R here in the Philippines and elsewhere in Asia often it's it's using of what you've got here the flags to just caus a bit of of disturbance not I have seen not far from here where they have a little like a little windmill a little ratchet on it making a noise and that's suppos to keep the birds away as well so it's it's looking at at noise as a deterrent we came up after many years of research with tools that farmers and extension brokers can use and I'm going to use one of these tools here so what I have here is a small tablet computer it runs the Android system and we have on this little tablet uh an application or app as they're called nowadays uh that we released uh last year for farmers in the Philippines as a first example it's called nutrient manager rice or sometimes also nutrient manager mobile and it's very simple to use it's all touch screen here as you can see if you don't have a Android smartphone like this you can also use it through a normal phone and call a toll-free number in the Philippines and all it does it's asking you 12 13 14 questions about your field so after I've done all this voila comes out a fertilizer recommendation [Music] this is a horrible [Music] S one of the first issues with water management is wet seated rice currently is really sensitive to water if you have too much water the the seeds die and uh so that's why you need really good leveling and secondly it's why we really need to get anob germination tolerance into rice seeds so that the technology is less difficult and and less risky for Farmers so this field was lucky after it was established there was where a few showers of rain which kept it going nicely I don't think it's been irrigated yet but I could just of flying fer and so the ideal thing next will be to irrigate to wash the fertilizer into the soil uh one way to reduce the amount of irrigation water we apply to rice is to do what we call alternate wetting and drying so this means we flood the field then we let the water disappear we let the surface dry down and then we re irrigate again and that anybody can do alternate wetting and drying but the question is how do you do it safely so that that you don't lose any yield because rice is so sensitive to Too Much drying so over the years ER has done a lot of research and and they've found that if we let at the soil dry down below about 10 or 15 kilop pascals uh soil soil water tension at about 15 cm below the soil surface the rice suffers but 10 or 15 killer pascals probably doesn't mean anything to you and it doesn't mean anything to Farmers some really nice work with this really simple field water tube which just shows you where the water table is you could pull it out I think yeah I'm P out can yeah yeah 15 cm from the bottom so you should push it into the mark you go a little bit further it doesn't matter okay how often do we think I need to come out and check the well it depends on the weather for a start and uh it's but at least once a week right tce once a week yeah [Applause] [Music] now today we're measuring the plant density in the field the plants have started to tiller so it's getting a little bit difficult to count but it's still okay I'm using a 0.1 squ M or 1/10 of a square m ring manufactured from some garden hose I stole from my wife uh throw the ring at random preferably over your shoulder that guarantees fairly random and it's several locations so you get it representative of the field and the results we got uh averaged about 13 plants per per ring or 130 plants per square met but the lowest was one plant per ring and the highest was 32 so there's a lot of variation but I still think we're okay uh Pinar do we need to worry about insect at this early stage do we need to spray no why not at this stage the the insect damage is can be completely compensated for by the plant so normally the things you get at the early stage are things like Leaf folder little bit of leaf folder and wh maggot wh maggot actually is the biggest problem this time of year but as the plant grows it just it just disappears because the plant as the leaves get thicker the maggots can't actually eat the leaf but you know I I keep woring I see things on the leav like this here and know some chewed on it this is a wh maggot that's a wh maget in there nothing to worry about no problem no problem it is yeah in fact this is even light it's not even uh you know a normal infestation of world magget what is this here there's a some egg M on it here whatever yeah these are these are probably some sort of paracoid that has sorts of wasp cocoon and these are beneficial again so it's good news uh these will fly off there about 40 of them there so they'll fly off then and parasitize things like Leaf folder um larve or um other caterpillars so they're again a beneficial insect fin bar I saw already saw a few lady Beatles is what I would call them are they are they playing much of a role at this early St they're also very important they're also feeding on on the natural of the the herbivore insights so they eat eggs mainly um also good uh predators of apids and also the dragonfly there's a lot of dragonfly flying around one of the things when you think about insects and rice you have to remember that in the water another problem generated by rice is mosquitoes and the dragonfly Lara live in the water they have a very big uh strong jaw and they pre on the dragon on the uh mosquito larae so they're keeping your mosquitoes down so really there's a whole ecosystem here functioning to keep everything in order I mean one really has to look hard to see all these things I see a little spider web here and which some some little insects are caught in there what are those these are those that are flying around these are the decomposer so they're again uh beneficial and spiders are very important uh predators of things like plant oppers mainly plant Hoppers so but but you know when I look around I see lots of crits here know insects of all kinds of little things flying or crawling or so is that one of the reasons that some Farmers think they have to spray because they see all these insects but a lot of people don't understand what they these insects are doing so a lot of people when they see these swarms of midges for example that are decomposing the the material they think it's a PL and they'll spray uh the same with the wh maget one of the biggest problems with world maget is that it it induces Farmers to spray but we never see any yield reduction the same with um uh Leaf folder [Music] now our crop is finally starting to exert itself it's within a week of Maximum tillering so it's it's growing quite strongly now and a lot of those gaps that we've had to live with for several weeks are finally starting to fill in so we're feeling better uh this week we're going to take the opportunity to talk about uh what I would call the biotic influences on the crop and making an assessment of it so that's how uh animals plants funguses invol viruses how how they're interacting with the crop both beneficial and not beneficial I have with me here Nancy Castillo who uh who is a specialist in assessing uh rice crops for for the biotic influences and the level of injury that's coming from it and Nancy and I will will step through the process of assessing the rice crop for insects for um for weeds for and for dis diseases both from viruses and funguses so uh in we go so next week what we intend to do is that we will be collecting data on injuries caused by animal pest animal pest uh uh refer to insect pest snails and rats and then we will be also assessing injuries caused by diseases um viral disease bacterial diseases and um um fungal diseases and then we will be also uh assessing uh injuries caused by weeds since this is direct seeded rice so we have here a quadrant what we call as a We call we we consider some kind of a magic weapon so this is equivalent to one heel and transplanted rice so we we would actually be sampling um for for diseases and in and uh and uh insect injuries we will be using um 10 quadrants we be sampling from 10 quadrants and then we would be also uh taking uh um we will be sampling weeds from three areas each area would be about 1 M by 1 M so we would be assessing weeds relative to the height of the canopy and we will be recording the type of weeds that we will find so we have a sweep net yes this is a sweep net we use this for uh counting the flying insects in this case mainly Green Leaf HPP ERS uh Green Leaf Hopper is the vector of tongro for the topping method we have this small a pan here with water it has a little detergent and we use it for counting sucking insects like uh plant Hoppers white back plant Hoppers Brown plant Hoppers and in other in in the surveys we do in other parts of the Philippines we also catch rice bugs okay okay um black bugs rather so so with these these magic weapons next week when the crop reaches the stage of Maximum tillering yeah you'll make an assessment uh according to our yeah our data sheet and then again uh in the reproductive stage in in the grain filling and mature mature stage uh we'll make another assessment that should give us a good idea of what biological things have done uh both for and against our our rice crop yeah it's now about 45 days after sewing so as you can see uh the crop starts elongating so we have hit pretty much the the end of the tillering and um it's now time for the crop to develop more biomass so you can see it's got a quite a few nice looking tillers here in this place and stem starts allocating now so we're coming then gradually closer to what will then be the next stage pacle initiation when they uh the next thing that we we also did today like we said last week already ny's team just uh went through around here and they just did an assessment of all the uh different kinds of crop damage might have had so diseases insects weeds Even Rats so we'll see what they have found out but they went across the whole field and stopped at about 30 locations and assess what what we've got there so that'll be interesting information and a bit more objective than what we saw ourselves sometimes we are getting biased by thinking okay we've got this problem and this problem this problem but they've done it in a very systematic Manner and we will see uh what they have so but when you just sort of look around uh the whole field here so from the distance uh it starts looking actually quite Okay so we've got a pretty good uh dense uh green canopy building up so if we can supports us now with enough nutrients and good water management and we don't run into more best problems we should be okay [Music] 60 days after sewing so the crop is uh moving into heading stage you can see it's getting quite tall so what I'm doing here today is I'm going to check whether we need a little bit more nitrogen so just looking at it I have the feeling that there are some places where it gets a little bit yellowish and we know that right now we need a lot of nitrogen because the picles are formed and we want to make sure that there's no limitation of that important nutrient so the tool that I'm using for this is this uh Leaf color Shard which has four different shades of green and uh it should guide me whether I need an extra little bit of nitrogen or not so what I'm basically doing is I'm walking through the field and I've been taking about 15 20 readings at different places and whenever I hit the spot I'll basically take a leaf the uppermost Leaf I'll put it on the chart in the middle of the leaf and I find the green shade that matches the color of the leaf uh best so this one here is matching perfectly the shade number three and that basically tells us that we're getting a little a bit low already yeah but I have to take of course many readings because there's some variability in the Lea and I've done this now so I've just finished this uh and I've concluded that on average my Leaf color chart reading is actually less than three so it's between 2.5 and three in many cases so that's why I've decided to put on an extra amount of about 25 kg of nitrogen as Ura at this stage and that should probably complete our whole fertilizer application regime other than that at this stake of the crop there is really nothing we can do at this point I saw some Wheats coming up here and there uh no insect damage really that I'm worried about right now so our decision to not spray any insecticide so far seems to work out and the rest now we need to wait and hope for more sunshin so that hopefully we'll still get some kind of decent yeld [Music] so we start with a visual estimate of of how ready the crop is and we we we first look at the the proportion of yellow grains the proportion of straw yellow grains now Martin has suggested an ideal amount for Harvest would be 80% yellow now in front of me here we always have a issue as to whether it's representative or not it's probably 50 to 60% yellow something of that order it's not not quite ready yet now a more objective and professional way to assess how uh how ready the crop is will be to measure its moisture content yep and this is one way to do that this is a moist meter So-Cal moist meter it measures the resistance of the crop which is uh basically dependent on the moisture content and you have a small sample tray so you take a a sample from a panicle at least at 80% of the of the grains should be STW yellow that basically says 80% of one panicker getting representative is always a challenge there's no a challenge so so uh you take a small sample like this fill it in there and then uh what you do with this instrument basically you crush it oops can I give you this it you turn the knob and crush it turn it all the way to the end and then uh you measure the resistance and that gets translated in the reading of the moisture content and it this case it's 21.6% now what we're going to do is mix The Greener one I've I've I've harvested and because this is a very small sample it's not really representative neither for small plot nor for the field so what you have to do is you have to in one location you should to different at least three different measurements so now in this sample for example you have a lot more green grains than in the previous one so the reading should be a lot higher 27.9% and you would take at least three samples and then you have a button here where you can average the readings and then you get the average reading for that uh location and then what you have to do is basically also measure in a representative way in the field because the the crop doesn't mature evenly everywhere in the field so Le is just getting a sample from another location doing my best to stay on my feet trying to find a green [Music] one it's probably semi respectable yeah so there's still a lot of straw particles in there not very well thresh um what you want to have is only grains in there and it should be basically just one layer of grains or a little bit more than that so we crush it again take our reading 27.7 and we can't do an average because I just did that and we only have one more reading in the moment so it's well and truly above 24 might be 27 28 29 something like that yeah in there we measured around up to 30% so so I think it's probably around 28 29 we're facing the final tricky decision to irrigate or not to irrigate that is the question so we're considering how moist the soil is now how moist is the soil now moist right we're considering what the weather's like what's the weather like hot dry and we're considering how long we'd expect until we Harvest and our consensus is about 10 days to 2 weeks something of that range it'll be close to 2 weeks time before you're back to do the D so we need this to last to to finish properly I think it needs the two weeks but it's moist it's heavy clay and we do want our combine to stay on the ground not to explore the underground I vote keep it dry yeah I would have if it was an experiment and I knew that we would be doing hand harvesting I would put on another irrigation just for safety but we need to figure out that we have to come in with a combine and so the carrying capacity of that soil will be the deciding factor and we can't delay Harvest because we see some lodging coming in so I go with the majority vote yeah I agree so no more irrigation let's see but I pray for a little bit of rain tonight maybe well on racing pattern I think you'll probably have that have that wish granted so there we have it we won't irrigate again and we'll it'll be in approximately 2 weeks we'll come back and harvest about my second yeah I was on a trip last week and then Lee sent me a note that we had 70% lodging to when I came back uh yesterday afternoon the first thing I did was rush out to the field and then this is what I saw that's a lot more than 70% so it's basically a complete mess now lodging uh I guess I can be many reasons for this but probably the primary reason is uh we've had a broadcast Zone crop which is not anchored very deep in the in the saw we had unnecessary rain now I would say unnecessary rain and you can see it's all lodging in One Direction here so we must have had some wind too I don't think we had too much nitrogen although that obviously sometimes contributes too so what we're going to do now Lee we're going to harvest it so as I explained in in an earlier clip there's one one crucial Advantage if we if we take this section of crop here it's lodged but there's still some air space under the crop there's 3 or 4 in of of air space under there and that's a crucial difference the combine the combine won't have too much trouble as long as we're careful um if it gets flatter than that then we are in real trouble and that's that's the concern ideally we probably should wait one more day but there's already threatening looking clouds over there so I think it might be time to act before it gets any worse yeah and we had another rain yesterday afternoon so I'm getting nervous too it is still quite wet underneath here but uh as long as we get through with the combine and pull it up well I think we have no choice let's try it the whole yeah I think we need to get a initial cut yeah yeah initial cut and then after that you could do yeah you could have some operation it is easy did you just you just POS I know I know yeah so that's that's nice not perfect but nice I had a lot of trouble going that [Music] way we've harvested the rice now we're at the business end where we Mill the rice into a product to eat so uh the first thing that happened after we harvested the rice is we took it to dry it it was at a moisture content of about 21% from memory and we took it and dried it in a flatbed dryer down to a moisture of about 14% so Mountain's going to uh measure the moisture content of a sample before our eyes and hopefully it's what our climate is yeah so I can't actually measure the sample uh that that has been in the mill because uh it's already mil but I have another sample here and uh the ideal moisture content for for Milling is between 13 and 14% and uh so the first step would basically be to measure the moisture content and this is an example for a moisture meter the Eerie moisture meter you you put a small sample of grains in there and then you crush them and then by measuring the resistance it gives you the moer content and this uh basically tells you that the the sample that we have is still too wet we couldn't use that for Milling so that's more than 16% it's more more than 14% than in this case and and uh basically this would also tell us if it's right for Milling between 12 and 14% or whether it's right for seeds what happens if you Mill it when it's wetter than 14% if you Mill it wet then the grain is very soft and and we get a lot of damage in the in the Rice Mill by uh basically the the machines are crashing crushing the grains and and so you're Milling would be a lot lower and what if it's too dry if it's too dry then it's too brittle and again you get uh because of mechanical stress you get more cracking uh because it's so brittle and again you get more more losses okay okay and for the drying there are different options uh the this grain was dried in the flatbed dryer uh and but the flatbed dryers are very simple technology that can be locally produced and produces reasonably good quality but then there also more sophisticated dryers like we have one over there which is a so-called recirculating batch dryer which allows us to produce really the optimum quality of of the Patty before we do the Milling after the the grain has been dried uh to the appropriate moisture content it's it's then delivered to the mill and the first stage is the dehulling where we have two rubber rollers set at a a very close clearance to each other and one roller is traveling just a little bit slower than the other roller and that that abrasion motion that that pins motion removes the husk from the rice it then goes on to a gravity table which then in a in a horizontal reciprocating motion uh it's on a slight angle and that successfully removes the the held rice the H brown rice from the rice that was not successfully helded and the rice that was not successfully H goes back to be DEH again after that it goes through three stages of polishing an abrasion stone polisher a friction polisher and then you also have a choice of a Mist polisher if you want that final shall I call it Sheen uh for a really quality uh quality high quality product that really looks as desirable as it tastes and there's one final process after the polishing process it's then it's then graded for size both through a rotary sifter and through a length greater and that separates the whole rice from the broken rice the final stage in a sophisticated Rice Mill is the color sort which is an ingenious piece of technology that that runs uh streams of of of milled rice grain in a in a single grain stream uh there's there's sensors that sense the color of individual grains and if the color does not is not white enough basically that could be from poor Milling it could be because it's a foreign object like a stone there's nothing as much fun as a stone in your rice uh a a short sharp jet of compressed air will remove the Grain and so the those that final high standard sorting processes is quite a common process in in high standard rice meals and then hence you have the finished product uh whole grain WellMed rice with a known quantity of brokens in it and that's really the objective of the whole process [Music] the good news is we made a profit that's good not a huge profit but a profit so we grew 5.24 tons to the hectare of rice and we valued it at 14 pasos per kilogram here in the Philippines which is equivalent to about 30 us cents or $300 per ton of Patty rice in summary I have these figures are particularly visible to the film we earned $440 from the field we spent $350 growing it so we made according to this $84 in profit which at least pice for the coffee we're drinking and a fair bit more well that's for the field but uh if we extrapolate this to a whole Hector which is what a normal farmer would probably have so that's a net profit of 335 per Hector so is that a normal profit is that what a farmer would be happy I think it's uh um probably quite common particularly if you have deep well irrigation to and pumping cost to cover yeah if you are an irrigated Farmer in the Philippines who um has access to Canal water of irrigation scheme steam water the typical profit is probably more like $500 per Hector and that's what I remember measuring once so we are below that but that's primarily really the reason um is because of the high irrigation cost which probably explains as you look across the rice growing world that dry season rice is generally confined to those locations where water is easy and cheap to access yeah it has to do exactly that yeah good I think that wraps it up um we've not become rich at least we haven't lost money I think we've learned a lot yeah we have so we'll promise to do better next time right Cheers Cheers [Music] o",
