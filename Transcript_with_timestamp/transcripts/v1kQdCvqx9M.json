right off top of his head i'm going to go with about 5000 degrees but whatever and today we're laying poly pipe in the field behind me [Music] okay what what does poly pipe do um it helps water our fields helps water here okay helps water your fields and what field will we be watering um don't know the exact name of it but bean field a bean filled all right well um do we actually need that today or is that just to keep some no people back because we'll be needing this try and just check and just want to make sure for my safety um all right so before we lay i mean do we need to get stretching do we need to be limber for this what no you're just gonna be walking to the other end of the field okay you're not gonna do it okay i'm gonna get my toes and i'm just gonna limber it this way and this way you know feel free to join in any time that you think okay all right that's fine all right what is this um it's um a pivot from where the pipe comes out of the ground okay so this is like our water source yeah so the well over there is sucking out of the ground and there's a pipe that brings it up here and okay and this is the poly yeah that we're laying all right so what are we going to do we're going to follow this tractor cisco uh-huh and he's going to be making a ditch underneath there and it's going to stretch it out across the field and then about this row and that row will get water but this row won't okay okay all right and what are we going to do behind it um i got to put dirt on it so it doesn't blow off all right well why don't i follow you you can show me how to do that and maybe i can give it a go maybe yeah would you be cool with that yeah all right cool all right so we're trying to water from this side of the field because there's a hill slanting that way and the water will fall down there okay but we're going to lay it across this way for it to go that way all right all right let's see this let's take some dirt all right so this takes a this takes a lot of concentration no that i mean what did you say no you're walking on a poly pipe yeah but there's like dirt everywhere i mean i guess i feel like this is i'm just waiting to eat it you know well if you eat it you'd probably have stitches in your chin okay that's good chill chill do you have you ever fallen doing this yes okay that makes me feel better [Music] five steps put a shovel of dirt on the pipe all right let's do it you switch like right here yeah is that enough probably just a shovel you're making this look a lot smoother we sure did pick a hot day didn't we yeah it's good in hot day too that's half of the work [Music] half the work cool cool cool all right i'm gonna grab some of that water [Music] all right jackson what we got here today it's a well it pulls water out of the ground to put it in our poly pipe so we can pop them all right so what we just laid down water is about to flow through it and that's all coming from here yes so what do we what do what what do you have to do to make this flow you just turn a lever he turns it on that's it you just turn it on you turn it on water shows up all right and we're about to go pop what do we call it a popper a popper is what you have yes this is not a medieval weapon this is an agriculture icon i don't know popper yeah all right so you're gonna show me how we do the popper next yep all right well let's go do it [Applause] no idea we got adult kid farmer john over here do you know that was gonna happen yes on that weld down there that's what it's called right yeah we laid the poly pipe and that water is pushing through here okay and then what we take that poker that you had yeah we gotta find that thing and we basically poke holes in here and that's so the water shoots down that way anything else we need to know about this like what what's happening down there what's cisco doing down at the uh he's holding water pressure down there so the water can't go past him okay okay anything else about this are there certain hole are there certain size holes yeah there's a bunch you can have an inch half inch all the variations and it depends on how long your field is so if you have like a really short and skinny field you could do like an inch hole but if you had a long field like we have here we're doing half inch today so when we're done when you're done with this poly pipe when you're done watering filled what do you do with it oh we recycle it you recycle it make the world a better place [Music] figure words of are better than me being over there [Music] good hard day's work jackson yeah yeah but we're not nearly done wait what why are we still not done no i gotta rest a day to go oh all right well i think my job's here it's done thank you so much for helping me like polly pot it's been good i'm gonna go uh hit your ride somewhere over there you",
