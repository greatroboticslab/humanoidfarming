1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,840
with the rise of food prices and glow

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,720
production we are seeing it more and

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,200
more how essential it is to grow your

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,880
own food to have a garden today we're

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,599
going to show you

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,800
how easy it is to take the back breaking

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,560
work on having a vegetable garden

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,600
if you have a vegetable garden you know

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,960
exactly what is going into your food so

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,480
no tractor

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,279
no problem

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,240
here is a plot of land that's never been

13
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:33,840
plowed or tilled before

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:36,000
except for about 85 plus years ago

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,920
and my grandfather did it with a mule so

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,640
we can consider that this land has never

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,640
been plowed or tilled before

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,399
here on to the east coast we have not

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,000
had any cold weather this has been about

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,239
one of the coldest days we have and you

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,280
see i have a flannel shirt on

22
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,000
but

23
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,760
saying that the grass has not died it's

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,079
got a lot of greenery this is a lot of

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,680
thick grass so it's definitely going to

26
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,320
have to be plowed up

27
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,079
now you should this is january you

28
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,960
should have it piled up at least you

29
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,479
know maybe two months prior to january

30
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,159
it would be a new ground but

31
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,560
nevertheless it's not about the time

32
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,799
frame it's about going ahead and getting

33
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,400
it done today that's what we're going to

34
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,159
do so a gentleman is going to come in

35
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,280
and help me get this plowed up it was

36
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,400
supposed to been played up two months

37
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,280
ago but

38
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,439
uh you know i just had to pull him in

39
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,280
and so he's going to take care of that

40
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,439
after we get it plowed up after you get

41
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,000
your ground plowed up and tilled up then

42
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,759
what you want to do is do a ph test you

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,600
want to put lime in there you want to

44
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,600
put fertilizer in there of course you're

45
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,520
going to have to get some rocks maybe

46
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,520
and some sticks and some roots out you

47
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,240
know get it out but the next year it'll

48
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,640
be so much easier i have a garden i've

49
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,280
had for four years and last year it was

50
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,759
so productive i had hardly any grass

51
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,880
into it because the soil is so good so

52
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,040
rich

53
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,600
but i don't have to deal with the rocks

54
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,439
and the sticks and it's just really easy

55
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,560
once you get your garden going it's not

56
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:02,240
as hard as you think but you do have to

57
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,479
put time in it

58
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,560
what you put in it into it is what you

59
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,920
get out of it how much time you put into

60
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,920
it is how much you're going to get out

61
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,000
of it you put some time into it you're

62
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,760
going to get a great harvest if you're

63
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,080
not able to have

64
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,440
a garden plot maybe it depends on where

65
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,879
you live or maybe a smaller one you

66
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,440
wouldn't believe how much food a smaller

67
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,959
little raised bed would put out

68
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,400
but maybe you're considering a

69
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,800
greenhouse

70
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,040
so let me show you my greenhouse that's

71
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,560
under construction only thing is lacking

72
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,519
is the wiggle wire

73
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,519
and the plastic

74
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:46,480
so here's the greenhouse

75
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,400
and this is good for like you know

76
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,480
when our time growing when you can't

77
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,480
really get outside you're unable to

78
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,120
really get outside this is this will be

79
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,879
a really good benefit so check out my

80
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,080
video how

81
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,319
to build a low side wall greenhouse now

82
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,360
some people may say this is overkill

83
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:08,239
but i live in a hurricane zone so within

84
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,519
that we got to make sure that the uh

85
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:13,680
greenhouse doesn't go rolling so

86
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,760
with this being such a thick grass here

87
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,640
and never been plowed tilled anything

88
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,400
done for it for years and years so it is

89
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,599
pretty much new ground

90
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,239
um

91
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,400
many people take roundup and they kill

92
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,959
the grass before they go in and plow now

93
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,159
i would not advise that because you are

94
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,080
what you eat

95
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,159
that roundup goes in the soil yes it'll

96
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,920
kill the grass but it goes into the soil

97
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,080
and your plants get all its nutrients

98
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,120
from that soil and it goes into your

99
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,920
plants

100
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,799
so the easiest route is really to take a

101
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,200
tractor if you don't own a tractor then

102
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,000
you hire someone like i did to make it

103
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,000
so easy and so practical that you can

104
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,120
just move forward with it

105
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,040
then

106
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,519
after you do your ph put your lime in

107
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,760
your fertilizer in you can cover it up

108
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,400
and finish smothering out this grass

109
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,080
the reason of enlarging my garden plot

110
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,120
is because last year i ran into the

111
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,720
problem because we're running into

112
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,560
different seasons now we don't really

113
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,840
know how the season is going to do but

114
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,640
here onto the east coast of north

115
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,560
carolina we got enormous amount of rain

116
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,680
and it rotted the garden peas and the

117
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,000
potatoes and it took three times for the

118
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,079
garden piece me to get them even come up

119
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,320
now garden peas they do not like the

120
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,840
heat so when the heat starts rolling in

121
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,400
they quit

122
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,199
at the same time the potatoes you know

123
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,720
they was two months late and so with

124
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,560
time they were supposed to be out of the

125
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,440
ground it was time to plant something

126
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,240
else also so i run into a little problem

127
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,960
there so i feel like i need to expand my

128
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,360
garden out so the possibility i won't

129
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,280
have that little problem there if there

130
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,320
is a problem

131
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,880
what i did with the garden peas

132
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:56,720
it was time to plant rattlesnake beans

133
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,639
and like i said check out that video on

134
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,039
how to plant rattlesnake beans the most

135
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,280
productive bean i have ever grown and

136
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,440
definitely will grow them again got some

137
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,680
dry beans got some seeds for this year

138
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,919
and they were just awesome but when the

139
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,000
garden peas was coming up of course

140
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:14,320
garden peas you have them on the trellis

141
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,360
somehow a trellis because they're going

142
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,759
to run

143
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,080
in so is the rattlesnake beans with the

144
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,680
rattlesnake beans it was time to plant

145
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,680
them they was two weeks late getting

146
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,840
into the ground so what i did i just

147
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,240
went on the other side of the the garden

148
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,840
peas and i planted some seeds

149
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,680
and with tom the garden peas couldn't

150
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,639
take the heat anymore it was time to get

151
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,560
them out the rattlesnake beans was about

152
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,560
four to five inches tall and then

153
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,360
suddenly they took off

154
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,360
but

155
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,039
if you have a bigger space then you

156
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,560
don't have to run into problems like

157
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:49,360
that another good idea i did was also is

158
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,720
that i made my garden like a raised bed

159
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,680
i planted my

160
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,919
rows closely together no more than about

161
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,199
two feet now within that you have to go

162
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,199
in there constantly and trim out the

163
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,880
leaves which i did and you throw them to

164
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,880
the soil which it goes back into the

165
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,240
soil which goes back into your plants

166
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,639
it's just a matter you just got to keep

167
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,680
up trimming the leaves but also with

168
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,720
that benefit what created was that the

169
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,800
grass

170
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,880
there was no grass it just was pretty

171
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,520
much smoldered out any grass smothered

172
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,280
out any grass that was trying to come up

173
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,680
with the soil being really healthy and

174
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,520
nourishment it was just it didn't really

175
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,160
take on the grass

176
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,080
but once you get your garden going once

177
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,000
you get your plot going

178
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,400
and you get the grass out many people

179
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,360
don't understand you have to keep the

180
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,960
grass out how much time you put into it

181
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,960
is how much time you're going to get out

182
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,720
once you really get all those grass

183
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,880
roots out then you're not going to have

184
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,639
a big big problem

185
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,120
or if you don't have the time you can

186
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,360

her homestead to help her prepare a

202
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,919
garden on ground has not yet been tilled

203
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,000
at least uh there's no record of it ever

204
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,400
having been tilled

205
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,599
75 plus years ago

206
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,759
my grandfather did it actually 85 plus

207
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,880
years ago guys and that's

208
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:39,360
predates me yeah i wasn't around yeah me

209
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,639
either but you know what guys it's still

210
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,120
new ground

211
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,360
it's for all practical purposes this is

212
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,440
new ground yeah he actually plowed it up

213
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,440
with a mule so back in the day

214
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,120
they had to grow their own food if they

215
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,879
didn't grow up grow it

216
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,360
they didn't get it we're going to be

217
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,759
plowing with approximately 23 mules

218
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,800
today oh wow there's a little more than

219
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,960
your grandpa oh yeah absolutely

220
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,479
absolutely he would be amazed to see

221
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,720
this

222
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:10,319
so uh we have new grass we've got uh a

223
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,160
soil that hadn't been turned for many

224
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,919
many years and we're going to do it with

225
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:18,720
a a machine a john deere tractor 23

226
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:22,720
horse john deere 10 23 e

227
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:25,199
and an economic piece of tillage a disc

228
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,080
a four foot wide disc they cost about a

229
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:31,360
third the price of a of a good tiller

230
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:34,479
and uh obviously a a pto driven tiller

231
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,599
is preferred it's the the right tool for

232
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,399
the job

233
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:41,120
but it's not economical

234
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,360
so we'll do it today and a few more

235
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,120
passes a little bit more time but just

236
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,000
as well in the end result

237
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,000
so

238
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,600
actually this ground was supposed to

239
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,640
should have been plowed about two months

240
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,640
ago

241
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,800
and um so we're in january right now but

242
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,480
thank god that he's coming in to get

243
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,240
this straightened out but one of the

244
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,240
things that amazed me when you was

245
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,880
talking about roundup because i don't

246
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,519
put like to put round round up into my

247
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,519
soul because you are what you eat but

248
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,360
you told me something about roundup and

249
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,160
the seeds what the farmers do can you

250
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,560
talk about that sure sure to some degree

251
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,240
farmers will frequently use a roundup

252
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,440
ready

253
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,120
plant

254
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,440
a seed that

255
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,519
allows for the use of roundup to kill

256
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,880
off the weeds the undesirable plants

257
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,000
while the desired crop grows through the

258
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,880
roundup

259
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,360
wow

260
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:37,279
wow so i'm i'm very much into i want to

261
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,839
say organic but sometimes what you think

262
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:42,160
is organic is not organic that's why

263
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,640
it's so essential for us to start

264
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,880
growing our own food don't you agree

265
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,880
well sure sure right you

266
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,600
you know what you have

267
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,440
when you've grown that product from uh

268
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,240
from a seed yeah

269
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:59,040
to a fruit to a vegetable yeah so what

270
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,200
is your experience on growing um gardens

271
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,399
have you what is your experience i was

272
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:07,120
always the laborer i was the uh hard

273
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,440
worker the mule the mule from many

274
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,240
gardens yeah so i've been gardening all

275
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,680
my life ever since i can remember

276
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,800
one time i said i'd never have a garden

277
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,560
because we we had to raise what we ate

278
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,800
and uh but there's something about it

279
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,560
when it when you are a true homesteader

280
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,480
or you're a true gardener it's into your

281
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,160
blood and you cannot get away from it

282
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,959
somehow way another you got your hands

283
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,600
into the dirt so today guys we're

284
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:33,519

the first thing i'm going to do is

288
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,680
create a border

289
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,360
i could do this with paint with string

290
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,519
or i'm not doing either one of those

291
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,279
today i'm just going to use the disc i'm

292
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,360
going to draw a straight line from end

293
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:57,269

you've seen him doing his job here and i

307
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,720
want him to explain to you what he was

308
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,959
doing

309
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:24,160
yeah so my name is bryce rogers i i work

310
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:27,440
with intelligent design

311
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,959
we just picked up a tractor and

312
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,600
not very much equipment we were trying

313
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:33,920
to get a job like this done with really

314
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,279
cheap equipment or at least cost

315
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,360
effective

316
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,200
the soil was super hard and it just

317
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,399
wasn't getting it done so we had to pick

318
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,639
up a tiller

319
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,120
and a tiller on the back of a tractor

320
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,519
like this took care of this in a little

321
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,160
over an hour yeah yeah

322
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:53,279
we tried to hit it up again today

323
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,279
we had a lot of rain over the past few

324
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,040
days about 100 percent

325
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,800
100 and uh

326
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,880
you know we're gonna get stuck we can't

327
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,800
even steer so our lines are going all

328
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,320
crazy and stuff and we can't even steer

329
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,200
because it's so muddy

330
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,959
um

331
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:11,519
but a tiller took care of even the roots

332
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:13,680
it acted almost like a stump grinder i

333
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,079
had no no problem with the roots and i

334
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,720
was i was really pleased with that a

335
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:21,680
frontier tiller

336
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,200
so the the old disc arrow will work on

337
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,680
soft soil

338
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,040
uh not the hard compact

339
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,360
soil

340
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,680
so what areas do you actually work out

341
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,760
of how far do you go out you know what

342
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,000
is your expansion of your work

343
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,160
predominantly i work out of jacksonville

344
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,320
jacksonville is my home base uh so i'll

345
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,560
hit up the surrounding areas of

346
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,320
jacksonville north carolina

347
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,399
i got a couple customers in wilmington

348
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,199
that have been really good customers so

349
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:52,160
i come down to wilmington frequently and

350
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:54,240
uh and i try to work in multiple jobs

351
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,399
when i end up driving this far it's an

352
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,920
hour and a half drive so yeah an hour

353
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,680
and a half to come out and until the

354
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,519
garden probably wouldn't be profitable

355
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,000
for either one of us yeah but i'm

356
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,600
