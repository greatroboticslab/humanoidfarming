flexible horizont onal double rod that

100
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,639
strikes the canopy and shakes it to

101
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:39,080
release the grapes in some regions

102
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,320
machine harvesting can reduce labor

103
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:44,280
costs by up to

104
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:46,720
75% these machines move through the vine

105
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:50,000
rows shaking The Vines so that the

106
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:53,039
grapes fall onto a conveyor belt after

107
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,600
being collected impurities are removed

108
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:57,759

mechanical or hydraulic system to lift

165
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:39,680
each seedling from the tray and plant it

166
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:42,360
into the soil the robotic arms move

167
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,080
rhythmically ensuring each seedling is

168
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,440
planted in the correct position when the

169
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:50,360
temperature is cooler and the fruit is

170
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,879
less likely to get damaged farmers use a

171
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:55,879
pole with a net to pick the mangoes

172
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:58,120
ensuring that they don't fall and Bruise

173
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:00,879
they leave a bit of stem on the fruit

174
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:04,280
which helps it to stay fresh for longer

175
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:07,680
mango trees can grow between 30 to 40 ft

176
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:09,960
tall making harvesting tricky farmers

177
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,000
use ladders or equipment to reach the

178
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:15,800
fruit at the very top of the tree each

179
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,879
mango is picked by hand and placed in

180
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:21,240

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,519
fruit by size and other color sensors

191
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:53,839
that measure ripeness packing and

192
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,800
transporting the mangoes are critical

193
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:59,800
stages requiring careful handling to

194
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:03,839
avoid reducing the fruit's market value

195
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:06,160
stored at a temperature of 9 to 10° C

196
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:10,000
mangoes can maintain their quality for

197
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:13,680
up to 21 days mangoes are a rich source

198
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,959
of vitamins minerals antioxidants and

199
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,800
fiber this valuable fruit is widely

200
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:22,000
exported to International markets giving

201
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:26,000
Farmers the chance to tap into the

202
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,399
global trade opportunities in 2023

203
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,040
Global grape production reached 28.4 m

204
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:35,200
million tons with China and the US

205
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:37,519
leading the world California is famous

206
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,120
for its wine and the excitement that

207
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:42,440
comes with harvest season the warm

208
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:45,640
Autumn months bring ideal weather for

209
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:48,959
grape harvesting by August the grapes

210
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:51,720
begin to ripen the most noticeable sign

211
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:55,000
is the color change across the vineyard

212
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:58,000
green grapes turn yellow sometimes even

213
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,360
red while red grapes shift to a deep

214
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,760
purple at this stage The Grapes also

215
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:08,240
increase in size and become softer grape

216
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:10,800
Harvest typically begins 30 to 70 days

217
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,760
after the fruit is set during this

218
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:17,040
period we see an increase in sugar

219
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:19,959
content and a decrease in acidity within

220
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:23,480
the fruit harvesting begins early in the

221
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:25,959
morning with workers picking row by row

222
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:30,120
most wine grapes are best harvested

223
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:32,880
around 22 to 24 bricks hand picking can

224
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:35,440
often yield better results skilled

225
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,160
workers carefully cut each cluster and

226
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,839
place them into containers while

227
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:43,160
removing any sunburned or rotten grapes

228
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:46,639
Vineyards that opt for hand picking

229
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:49,440
usually priori as quality over quantity

230
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:52,160
at the winery the grapes are separated

231
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,760
from the stems and leaves to prevent any

232
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,399
bitterness during

233
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:59,480
fermentation next comes the crushing

234
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,600
process using the mechanical presses the

235
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:05,200
grapes are then left to rest and

236
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:08,600
fermentation begins within 6 to 12 hours

237
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:11,560
converting all the sugar into alcohol in

238
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:14,839
regions with particularly hot climates

239
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:17,720
Farmers often Harvest grapes at night in

240
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:19,959
the cooler conditions Pickers can ensure

241
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,920
that all the grapes are at the same

242
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:24,959
temperature wine makers in warmer areas

243
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,920
typically pick grapes at night to

244
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,959
preserve their Aroma and prevent

245
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:32,360
spontaneous fermentation high quality

246
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:35,519
grapes harvested this way lead to better

247
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:38,480
wine lower energy costs and higher

248
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:41,160
efficiency Farmers start sewing eggplant

249
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:44,200
seeds indoors around 10 weeks before the

250
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:48,360
last frost date the seedlings will grow

251
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:50,519
when the soil temperature reaches 60° F

252
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:54,480
Farmers plant them with a maximum

253
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:58,279
spacing of 24 in between plants and 2 to

254
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:01,320
3 ft between rows eggplants thrive in

255
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:03,959
nutrient rich well- drained soil

256
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:06,480
mulching can help eggplants grow strong

257
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:08,760
in the spring adding bright colored

258
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,680
straw mulch in the summer helps to

259
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:15,600
reduce heat buildup eggplants prefer

260
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:18,760
soil with a pH of 6.5 and need one to 2

261
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:22,320
in of water each week eggplants can be

262
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:24,519
harvested around 70 days after sewing

263
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,480
they can quickly become overripe and

264
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:30,560
bitter so check them every 1 to 2 days

265
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,600
to see if they're ready overall the best

266
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,440
time to harvest eggplants is from

267
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:38,000
Midsummer onwards around July to

268
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:41,160
September when the skin of the eggplant

269
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,079
is shiny and smooth they are ready for

270
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:46,839
Harvest Farmers cut a section of the

271
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:49,519
fruit stem it's important to handle the

272
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:52,839
eggplants gently during Harvest as they

273
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:55,560
can be easily bruised careful selection

274
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:58,959
is crucial to ensure that only the best

275
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:02,079
eggplants move on to the next stage once

276
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:04,560
the baskets are full workers transport

277
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,880
them to the Sorting area here the

278
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,680
eggplants are carefully arranged and

279
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:12,760
sorted harvesting eggplants can take

280
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:15,800
several days to a few weeks and regular

281
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:18,959
harvesting helps increase yield like

282
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:21,680
cucumbers eggplants are very sensitive

283
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:25,360
to temperature when temperatures drop

284
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:28,120
below 50° Fahrenheit it can damage their

285
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,760
texture and flavor eggplants can

286
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:33,320
typically be stored for 1 to 2 weeks

287
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:36,279
after harvest as long as they are kept

288
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:39,000
properly at processing facilities

289
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:41,680
eggplants are turned into delicious

290
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,079
products they are cut into bite-sized

291
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:48,639
pieces seasoned fried and combined with

292
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:52,839
sauces to create rich flavors watermelon

293
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:55,600
Vines spread 6 to 8 ft within 30 days

294
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:58,680
after 2 months the first watermelons

295
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:02,320
will appear finally the crop is ready

296
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:05,399
for Harvest within around 3 months due

297
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:08,800
to varying pollination times not all

298
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:11,800
watermelons ripen at the same time as a

299
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:15,160
result Farmers often need to harvest the

300
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:17,000
same field multiple times one team of

301
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:19,600
workers goes ahead to cut the

302
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,480
Watermelons from The Vines then turns

303
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,320
them over to indicate that they are

304
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:27,519
ready a second team of workers then

305
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:30,279
collects the cut watermelons from behind

306
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:33,279
they form a watermelon conveyor line and

307
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:36,199
load the melons onto trucks for packing

308
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:39,320
Farmers must be extremely careful not to

309
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:42,240
scratch or damage the fruit to avoid

310
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:45,079
skin abrasions and rot harvesting is

311
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,880
done only in dry weather after

312
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:50,120
harvesting Farmers place the Watermelons

313
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:52,519
with the bottom side down to prevent

314
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:55,199
sunburn they are carefully placed in

315
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:58,079
trucks lined with soft fabric and dry

316
00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:02,040
grass or straw at the bottom temperature

317
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:04,399
control between 10 to 16° C helps keep

318
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:07,480
the watermelons in the best conditions

319
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:10,720
and extends their shelf life sugarcane

320
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:14,440
farming provides over 19,000 jobs and

321
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:17,720
nearly $4.7 billion annually to the

322
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:20,639
economy in southeast Asian countries

323
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:23,440
sugar cane is grown by local farmers on

324
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:26,480
small plots of land and harvested using

325
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:29,079
traditional methods farmers use hand

326
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,680
knives or cutting blades for manual

327
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:34,839
harvesting this requires skilled labor

328
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:37,440
improper harvesting can lead to a

329
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:40,759
reduced sugar yield and problems during

330
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:44,800
the Milling process typically farmers

331
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:47,440
will harvest a crop every 3 to 5 years

332
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,079
after harvesting the sugar cane is

333
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:53,160
bundled together the farmers then

334
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:56,160
transport the bundles to the train once

335
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:59,360
the train is fully loaded it departs for

336
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:01,839
the sugar processing plant sugar cane is

337
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,440
chopped into smaller pieces before being

338
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:07,199
crushed then put in large roller mills

339
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:09,680
to extract the juice the juice is

340
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:11,560
processed to remove impurities through

341
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,399
coagulation and

342
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:17,120
sedimentation this process produces raw

343
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:20,600
sugar by separating sugar crystals from

344
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:23,480
the surrounding Molasses for every 100

345
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:27,120
tons of sugar cane produced about 12

346
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:29,120
tons of sugar are produced however most

347
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,560
of the sugar is produced from from

348
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:35,920
mechanical harvesting about 50% of the

349
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:38,600
sugar cane in the US comes from Florida

350
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:42,600
the Florida sugar industry has an annual

351
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:45,240
income of over $800 million with a total

352
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:48,360
economic value of over 2

353
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:51,759
billion mature sugar cane can grow up to

354
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,920
10 ft tall farmers use mechanical

355
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:57,079
Harvesters to collect the cane from

356
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:59,160
September until January mechanical

357
00:16:57,079 --> 00:17:02,639
harvesting reduces the average

358
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:06,400
harvesting time from 32 hours to just 6

359
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:08,959
to 12 this increased efficiency leads to

360
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,959
higher yields and greater profits for

361
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,959
Farms
