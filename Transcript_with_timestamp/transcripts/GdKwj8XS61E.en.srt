1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,580
seaweed is something you might try to

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:07,080
avoid at the beach but a team of

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,480
researchers from the Sunshine Coast

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,059
thinks it could be queensland's next Big

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,040
Industry a trial of seaweed farming off

6
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:16,859
the southeast Queensland Coast is

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,800
showing promising results

8
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,420
in moreton Bay an oyster Farm is trying

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,619
something new

10
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,740
seaweed

11
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:28,500
we farmed about 125 kilograms of seaweed

12
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:31,140
or around 10 000 sushi rolls were small

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,540
plants are put into Nets and attached to

14
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,840
Oyster lines growing into a floating

15
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:38,880
Forest of seaweed sausages in a joint

16
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,340
project between the University of the

17
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,980
Sunshine Coast and water provider Urban

18
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,660
utilities it's quite tough to grow

19
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,300
oysters it takes around about three

20
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,280
years and with climate change and

21
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,840
increasing water temperatures there's a

22
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,760
lot more risk of operation around

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,559
disease so they were really Keen to see

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,199
if they could diversify into other

25
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:01,199
products it could be queensland's next

26
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:03,719
Big Industry used for more than just

27
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,240
Sushi we know that seaweed can be fed to

28
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:09,240
cattle there's even people exploring its

29
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,820
use in sustainable packaging so Plastics

30
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,100
the 30 million tons of seaweed is

31
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,200
produced worldwide each year and

32
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,479
forecasts show Australia has the

33
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,540
potential for a billion dollar industry

34
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,000
within the next two decades the two-year

35
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,979
trial has had environmental benefits too

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,540
for every ton of wet seaweed that we're

37
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:29,520
pulling from the bay we're pulling out

38
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,740
about one and a half kilos of nitrogen

39
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,020
as well it remains to be seen whether

40
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,600
large-scale seaweed farming would be

41
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,640
commercially viable in moreton Bay but

42
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:43,040
from Little Things big things grow

43
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,040
