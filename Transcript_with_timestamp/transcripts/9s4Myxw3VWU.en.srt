00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,120
welcome to the northwest weekly agri

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,560
updates i'm sally baumain livestock

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,039
officer with the northwest local land

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,199
services ag advisory team

6
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,600
coming to you this week from the shelter

7
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,760
of a hayshed because it seems every

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,119
tuesday the weather is atrocious at the

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,359
minute

10
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,199
this week i just wanted to touch base

11
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,200
and talk about bloat so i'm going to get

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,559
a lot of um

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,360
inquiry and i suppose concern um

14
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:42,879
about bloat for this spring uh there

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:46,160
seems to be a huge amount of clover

16
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:48,480
uh in the pasture paddocks and also the

17
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,399
loosens really on fire at the minute and

18
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,719
whilst that's awesome um and i guess

19
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,600
sign of a cracking spring it can be

20
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,600
really scary from a bloat perspective uh

21
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,520
especially given the value of cattle at

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,440
the minute

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,680
bloat's a hard one because there's no

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,080
magic bullet to controlling bloat

25
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,680
unfortunately we saw bloat capsules go

26
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,200
off the market

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,439
a few years ago

28
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,360
and they've yet to return so romansen

29
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,240
does have a label claim for bloat uh but

30
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,000
you know

31
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,240
in a loose lick form

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,280
it really is difficult to get enough

33
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,439
into them but it can it can help so i

34
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,840
loosely that contains romance and

35
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,439
certainly won't do any harm but one um

36
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,720
they might be able to eat enough of it

37
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:35,040
to get the full dose to to claim bloat

38
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,200
control um

39
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,799
the other thing we can do if we have the

40
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,119
luxury of other feeds to graze for the

41
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,720
meantime is just hold off putting stock

42
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,119
on pastures until the clover and the

43
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:50,320
loosens in flour does tend to get a lot

44
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:52,720
less risky once it has flowered

45
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,960
so if you are in that situation it might

46
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,159
be worth worth holding off grazing for a

47
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,119
little while

48
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,600
um

49
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,040
if you're not uh introducing stock

50
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,680
gradually

51
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,240
so just allowing stock access to the

52
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,640
risky paddock for sort of an hour might

53
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,319
not even be an hour so please don't set

54
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,160
and forget put stock on there and really

55
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:16,160
keep an eye on them for those first few

56
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,160
days and see how they're going

57
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,720
and then also make sure the stock aren't

58
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,959
hungry when they go on so even stock

59
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,840
that have been successfully grazing a

60
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,080
high

61
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,879
legume content paddock a few hours in

62
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,959
the yards to do whatever and then return

63
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,840
to the paddock can be detrimental so

64
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,760
please let them fill up on on safe feeds

65
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,239
first

66
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,280
the other thing too is our pastures

67
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,680
can get a bit less risky uh as the day

68
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,120
progresses so

69
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,080
instead of turning stock first thing in

70
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,239
the morning give the plants an hour or

71
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,080
two to photosensitise and things like

72
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,080
that and

73
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,000
and that can help if you are in a

74
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,680
position where you've only got water

75
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,400
troughs in your paddock medicating them

76
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,400
with a bloat oil can be handy

77
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,760
unfortunately for a lot of people though

78
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,680
given the amount of rain we've seen

79
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,440
there's so much surface water about that

80
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,920
might not be an option

81
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,840
um but certainly

82
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,360
products that contain bloat oil can help

83
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,280
there's some licks and some blocks on

84
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,239
the market that that do contain that

85
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,000
product and it might be of assistance

86
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,519
the other thing to bear in mind is

87
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,599
sometimes bloat and pulpit kidney can

88
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,920
look the same in the end result which

89
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,640
unfortunately is an animal legs up in

90
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,879
the air and quite inflated

91
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,959
so five in one is not a particularly

92
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,840
expensive um

93
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:41,519
product to give uh so it might be worth

94
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,840
giving um stock a shot of that um if

95
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,319
they haven't had one uh in the last sort

96
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,840
of six to eight weeks and you are in a

97
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,480
high risk area

98
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,239
a shot might might help

99
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,519
and then a shot every six to eight weeks

100
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,560
after that

101
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:59,439
just for the pulpit kidney aspect

102
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,319
the custodial vaccines are really good

103
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:06,480
at everything else um but the nature of

104
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:10,080
pulpit kidney means that um even if it's

105
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,000
uh within the annual booster um

106
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,200
they they still might need a shot or

107
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,239
look at the product that's got the

108
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,130
longer the longer poppy kidney claim on

109
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:18,320
it

110
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:20,720
