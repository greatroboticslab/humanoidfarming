00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,000
19 pandemic has affected kenya's food

4
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,800
systems

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,760
directly through impacts on food supply

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,599
and demand

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,439
and indirectly through decreased

8
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,720
capacity to produce

9
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:33,280
and distribute food in response to that

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,040
the ministry of agriculture livestock

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,600
fisheries and cooperatives

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,960
is addressing food supply chain and

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,600
nutrition challenges

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,719
through the establishment of one million

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,600
kitchen gardens

16
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,760
in rural and urban households through

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,399
this 1 million kitchen gardens

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,440
the ministry is contributing to the big

19
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,199
four agenda

20
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,920
on the 100 food and nutrition security

21
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,600
by enabling households to maintain a

22
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,719
healthy diet

23
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,159
food safety is also an integral part of

24
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,799
food security

25
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,400
the ministry is therefore promoting good

26
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,799
agricultural practices

27
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,680
that are necessary for the production of

28
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,320
safe and healthy fruits and vegetables

29
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,840
in this video we will look at basic good

30
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,640
agricultural practices

31
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,080
that should be applied during production

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,080
and post-production

33
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:28,560
that help in reducing the risk of

34
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,560
microbial contamination of food

35
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:40,079
[Music]

36
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:42,960
agrochemicals are chemical products used

37
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,520
in agriculture to protect plants from

38
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,720
pests

39
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:50,240
and improve their growth they include

40
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:54,560
pesticides insecticides herbicides

41
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:57,280
fungicides nematicides and fertilizers

42
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,799
these agrochemicals are toxic to both

43
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,520
humans and pests

44
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,880
therefore extra precaution must be taken

45
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,000
when purchasing

46
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,959
transporting handling storing and

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,720
disposing them agrochemicals should

48
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,840
always be purchased at an

49
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,959
accredited source with a pcpb

50
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,720
license when purchasing always remember

51
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,640
to check the expiry date

52
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:27,680
manufacturing date and the mixing ratio

53
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:32,160
how do i put on my protective gear

54
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:37,840
which one comes first

55
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,840
so to put on my protective gear

56
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,440
i need to start

57
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:48,480
systematically

58
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:52,239
so i start off

59
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:57,440
with the overall after putting

60
00:02:52,239 --> 00:03:00,159
on the overall then

61
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,159
i put on

62
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:08,319
gum boots then

63
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:12,800
the goggles i put on

64
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:16,480
the mask after putting on the nut mask

65
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:20,319
i put on the headgear

66
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:24,239
and finally my gloves

67
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,239
while wearing my gum boots

68
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,879
i make sure the overall

69
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:34,319
is over the gum boots to avoid

70
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:38,159
chemical dripping into

71
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,360
my legs same with when i'm wearing my

72
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,360
gloves

73
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:46,640
i make sure that the gloves are worn

74
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:52,159
under the sleeves then

75
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:56,159
i am ready to mix my chemicals

76
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:59,599
different formulations are done

77
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:03,200
differently they are those

78
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:06,879
which are in liquid form if i'm going to

79
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:12,239
mix in liquid form

80
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:12,239
extra care needs to be taken because

81
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:22,160
but it's very easy for spillage

82
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:25,199
on my skin so what i need to do

83
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:28,639
i need to put everything ready the water

84
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:32,000
the measuring that i'm going to use

85
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:35,520
i need to put aside the spillage kit

86
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,440
under the spillage kit i need

87
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:43,520
a small bucket

88
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:47,199
i need soil or sawdust

89
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:51,600
or sand i need

90
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:54,320
a brush and i need a broom

91
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,360
for spillage kit this should be on

92
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,800
standby

93
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:02,479
as i do my mixing

94
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:05,600
now in the process of doing

95
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,400
the liquid formulation i take my

96
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,520
knapsack

97
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,880
and put one third of water into the

98
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,280
knapsack

99
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,479
the reason i'm putting water fast is

100
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:19,199
because

101
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:22,720
i'm avoiding the concentrated

102
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:25,840
chemical getting into the outlet

103
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,880
because if i put the chemical first

104
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,400
and it gets into the outlet the moment i

105
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:35,759
start spraying

106
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:39,120
i will cause damage to the target

107
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:42,960
of spray so after putting

108
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:46,479
the water i measure

109
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,280
the recommended quantity making sure i

110
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:51,120
do not

111
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:55,440
under dose or overdose then i add

112
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:58,400
into the knapsack then agitate

113
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,639
the knapsack after agitating the

114
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:06,800
knapsack

115
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:11,840
i triple rinse the measuring jar

116
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:15,600
and empty into the knapsack

117
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,919
after triple rinsing and emptying into

118
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:21,199
the knapsack

119
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:24,400
i fill up the remaining parts with water

120
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:34,160
agitate then now

121
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:36,400
i am ready to spray

122
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,319
harvesting at the right time can have a

123
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,639
big impact on crop yield

124
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,039
and quality there are different

125
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,319
harvesting styles depending on the type

126
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,560
of plant

127
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,639
in this video we will learn how to

128
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,520
properly harvest vegetables

129
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,479
in a kitchen garden this is a corn

130
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,199
garden

131
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,479
in our corn garden we have strawberries

132
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,599
cauli kales

133
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:03,039
spinach and kales

134
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:04,720
tsukumawiki the nomos kumawiki this is a

135
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:07,840
thousand heads

136
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,560
we are going to do harvesting

137
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,759
of some of the vegetables today early

138
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,960
morning harvesting

139
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:17,599
is best for most vegetable crops when

140
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:21,440
harvesting greens for salads or cooking

141
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:23,840
the best picking time is before 9 a.m

142
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,800
when the sun is too hot the plants will

143
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,000
have wilted

144
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,639
and that makes them difficult to prepare

145
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,360
so we are going to have an open basket

146
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,840
with the

147
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,240
which is well aerated so that our

148
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,080
vegetables remain fresh

149
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,360
and then we are also going to use a

150
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,360
sharp knife

151
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,720
we are using a sharp knife because we

152
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,599
want to cause

153
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,360
minimum damage to the plant if you use a

154
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,680
plant knife or use the hand it will

155
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,280
cause a lot of damage to the plant

156
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,879
and it will take a lot of time and

157
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,240
nutrients to heal

158
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:58,800
it may also be a source of contamination

159
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,520
for bacteria for diseases like bacterial

160
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,960
wealth

161
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:05,919
and the whole plant may die so

162
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,520
hold your knife we are going to harvest

163
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,840
the kali kales

164
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,280
the caulicells can be harvested once

165
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,960
they have from six

166
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,639
to eight leaves so we are going to

167
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,440
harvest

168
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,440
make sure you cut all the outer leaves

169
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:25,199
as you harvest you put in your

170
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,000
hydrated basket it could be woven or

171
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:32,000
plastic like

172
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
this one of mine continue harvesting

173
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,880
as you harvest you leave the stalks two

174
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,240
inches from the plant

175
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,320
to prevent diseases and

176
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,240
injuring the plant so that the plant

177
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,600
doesn't waste nutrients healing the

178
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,120
wound

179
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,320
eventually these left stocks will dry

180
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,959
off and just for

181
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,959
fall naturally and the plant will

182
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:57,120
continue growing

183
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,360
we have left at least four leaves you

184
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,800
leave at least four leaves

185
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,399
this these four big leaves are what we

186
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,839
are likely to harvest

187
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,279
next time so don't cut all the leaves

188
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:13,519
and leave the small ones

189
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:15,440
only remember the plant manufactures its

190
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,200
food through the leaves so you must

191
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,880
leave enough foods

192
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,880
enough leaves for the plant to

193
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,600
manufacture its food

194
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,040
continue like that until you do the

195
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,959
whole garden

196
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,320
so that next time you come you can

197
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,279
harvest again

198
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,120
alternatively you could do a few plants

199
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,920
next time a few plants

200
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,920
and continue with that kind of sequence

201
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,800
next time you're harvesting again

202
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,360
so that is our harvested plant i've left

203
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,320
at least

204
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,480
four big leaves so that the plant

205
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,120
continues maturing food

206
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,000
manufacturing food if you continue

207
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,480
harvesting like

208
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
that you're also giving enough space for

209
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,200
the new leaves to grow

210
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,080
harvest often some vegetables mature

211
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,880
very fast

212
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,480
therefore it is a good idea to stay on

213
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,880
top of harvesting

214
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,519
frequent harvesting can result in higher

215
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,480
quality

216
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,720
and better tasting vegetables it can

217
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,760
also encourage a large yield

218
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,040
and reduce wastage due to over mature

219
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:19,760
produce

220
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:22,480
so our our spinach now is well harvested

221
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:25,920
and we continue with that process the

222
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:29,200
remaining leaves can be harvested

223
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:31,360
like after two weeks or even one week

224
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,560
just make sure you leave at least three

225
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,720
to four leaves

226
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,839
that you can have us next time so we're

227
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,079
actually taking

228
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,000
all uh kenyans who would be then

229
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,120
interested to set up their their own

230
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,640
kitchen gardens

231
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,160
or home-based gardens within the

232
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,000
confines of their homes

233
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,480
we would then be able to you know

234
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,079
provide big technical support

235
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,839
