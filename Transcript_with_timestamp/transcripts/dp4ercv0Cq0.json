  "text": "the snow pusher or the snow plow which one's better which one do you need guys how we doing welcome to good works tractors today we're talking about a topic that is something i'm asked all the time especially this time of year the snow pusher versus the snow plow let's go over those strengths and weaknesses yes each of them have strengths and weaknesses we'll give you price points what they're good for construction design all that good stuff if you'd be so kind i'd love to get a thumbs up from you and if you haven't done so yet hit that subscribe button right underneath the video to get more informational videos like this one here if you're in the market for a tractor an attachment an accessory or maybe a whole package check out that description below all sorts of helpful links down there or head on over to goodworkstractors.com let's get to it let's talk about price for a minute here in most situations the snow pusher is going to end up being a little bit cheaper than a snow plow however that can vary and i do actually have a very price competitive snow plow here from tar river it's available in 60 72 84 and 96 inch sizes or widths there for compact tractors this one that you see here on a kubota l6060 is gonna be an 84 inch variant you can also get a 96 inch for this machine that'll be a good fit for it as well over here on the 4066r you're going to see an hla 2500 series 72 inch wide snow pusher some options to consider that will affect pricing on the snow pusher there's not going to be any hydraulic options so nothing to worry about there on a snow plow however you can get that set up with a manual angle or an optional hydraulic angle for an additional cost that is also going to require additional hydraulic capabilities on your tractor as well so keep that in mind the cost can really start to add up if your tractor isn't already equipped with those additional hydraulics on a snow pusher some considerations to take into mind are going to be something like a back drag right here you can get it with or without the back drag and if you're going to get a back drag you can add on a replaceable edge if you want to make it a replaceable steel rubber uhmw you have a lot of options there to consider but keep that in mind with or without and then your edges as well are going to drive the cost now i love these tar river snow plows they are well built i did a comparison last year comparing a tar river snow plow versus the frontier snow plow for example and the amount of steel that is in the structure back here that's behind the actual pushing blade itself is just incredible there's way more material here than what's on a lot of other snow plows and when you're plowing along you want to have the weight to get the momentum going and you also want to have that rigidity that structure there that strength to allow you to go through whatever you need to do to get the job done if we take a closer look right here you're going to see two beefy trip springs one on either side here that are just very substantial in case you do hit a lip or an edge and you need to have that release right there that's what that's going to be for you'll also see you have a skid shoe down here with shims that are adjustable one on the other side as well you're also going to have mounts one right here and one tucked underneath here to add on a hydraulic cylinder if you want to it comes standard in the piece of equipment now i love these hla snow pushers as well for a lot of reasons i've gone into a lot of depth about it they really stand apart from what else is on the market today including the huge background that's on here this big black piece of steel right here actually entirely closes off the top of the snow pusher on the smaller models once you get to a 2500 series you're still going to have roughly a 13 inch piece of steel right here that is way more substantial than the competition which is typically a three or four inch piece of steel to grab and accumulate all that snow in there on the inside you're going to see there's no cross braces in here at all you have a double panel sidewall construction that also welds right into a radius back on here so that radius back helps propel the snow forward keep it rolling forward so it doesn't stick there nothing wants to get trapped more of the snow is going to be released with this design some other great features included are going to be adjustable skid shoes so you can adjust them up and down if you want to get just above that plowing surface and not scrape your gravel off the driveway you can also add on a replaceable cutting edge if you want to to the back drag and of course the frame that attaches to your tractor whether it's a john deere quick attach it could be a skid steer quick attach it could be a global we can even get custom mounts if you even have a pinned on bucket all of those frames are going to be bolted onto the back of the snow pusher that way if you end up with a different piece of equipment down the road you don't have to buy an entirely new snow pusher just get a new frame bolt it up and away you go so let's talk about requirements what's needed for you besides having the piece of equipment here whether it's the plow or the pusher well with a snow pusher it really doesn't get any easier because all you have to do is hook it up take your bucket off all right take your bucket off or your forks or your grapple connect to the front end of your loader the snow pusher and away you go over here on the snow plow you do the same thing all right if you have a manual angle take your bucket off your forks all you do is hook it up if you're going to have a manual angle again at that point you are going to have to hop off the tractor anytime you want to adjust the angle this way adjust it that way you got to pull a couple pins out you know rotate it around put the pins back in and lock it in place however if you do have the optional hydraulic angling kit that you can add onto this system right here you can plug it in if you have the hydraulics on your tractor and then you can operate everything right up there from your operator station for me though i love simplicity and that ranks really high on my priority list and so that's where i really appreciate the simplicity of the hla snow pusher or snow pushers in general there's nothing else to worry about no angling anything no hydraulics no electric you just put it on there and away you go let's talk about how this equipment carries the load so over on a snow pusher as you're collecting and accumulating snow it's basically doing it in an even amount you know dispersing it all throughout here and capturing it you know wherever it falls but it's just going to accumulate in there and trap in there evenly now if you think about a snow plow whether it's a big old one or a small one you have your plow angled you're never really using your plow perfectly straight on so the load is constantly sweeping to one side and when you have your load sticking out as far as it is like this it's going to be a lot more difficult to try to steer your machine when you have a load especially on lighter machines on smaller machines your your subcompacts and your smaller compacts that don't have a lot of weight when that snow is constantly pushing to one side and you're having to combat that by steering this way and the front end of your tractor is sometimes wanting to lift up because of the amount of snow is pushing so you're already a little bit limited on traction to begin with and you're compounding that by having that off center load and one other thing to keep in consideration is the fact that you know your plow phase here on the pusher is sitting closer to the loader arm so it's closer to your machine it's going to allow you to maintain better control as you can see over on the plow right here your plow face is significantly further away from your the base of your loader arms here so what that does is it makes it a little bit harder to control a little bit harder to steer and get leverage with your machine now keep in mind we're talking about loader mounted plows you can get frame mounted plows for certain machines but for me that defeats the entire purpose while you have a loader on there most of us that have loaders on our tractors need to be able to use them year round and so if you get a frame mounted plow that means you have to remove your loader and then install all the hardware and the quick attach system and everything else to use the plow so getting something for your loader is going to be a lot more effective for most of us that we have to use a grapple in the wintertime or a bale sphere or a bucket or pallet forks or something else along those lines let's talk about the types of snowfall that these attachments can handle and that's going to be pretty easy pretty much everything that you can throw at it whether it's a small amount just an inch or two that you want to clean up so it doesn't turn into an icy mess or if you have 12 18 inches i know some of you guys just got 30 or 40 inches any piece of snow removal equipment is going to struggle with that so you're just making do if you get a monster mega storm you know that's 30 or 40 inches of snow you're just doing what you can to keep up it doesn't matter if it's the light fluffy stuff it could be the wet heavy stuff these hunks of steel right here are going to take that snow and move it wherever you want to one of the great features about this backdrag is the fact that if you have a big building like this or it could be a garage or it could be a retaining wall even some place where you can't push snow whether it's a pusher or a plow you can go up to that surface there rock this whole piece of equipment forward like you're going to dump your bucket out and then this right here becomes your scraping edge or your plow edge and you can go up to that that wall or that face and pull the snow away it's going to be all trapped inside this box there so it's very easy to do and very efficient to do one of the big questions i'm asked is i have a long drive what do you recommend or i have a big parking lot or i have a big landing area or maybe i have both what do you recommend as the right piece of equipment for me if we take everything we've learned so far from the strengths and the weaknesses of each one of these pieces of equipment my money goes to the snow pusher however you got to make your own decision if you have a long drive all right say six or 800 foot i sell both okay i sell pushers and plows plows i guess are more common right they've been around longer you see a lot more of them out there so that's kind of where people tend to gravitate towards it doesn't mean it's the right solution for everybody let me give you an example i've been in a few locations even my current place where i live right now where i've used a snow plow on the front of a garden tractor if you have an unrelenting winter where the snow just keeps coming guess what you can only plow so often to the side before you're gonna have to stack it somewhere anyway otherwise your driveway's gonna continuously close in on you and get narrower and narrower because that plow's not gonna go ahead and just keep dumping it over the top there's just nowhere for it to go so at some point and you're better off doing this early on is pushing that snow back periodically in sections off the driveway to the locations that you can even if you have a 600 foot plus long driveway you're going to have these same problems versus if you have a 25 foot long driveway you have to have some place to put the snow and that's where doing so with a snow pusher can be more effective than doing so with a snow plow and so basically with a pusher or a plow even on a long driveway you still have to push that snow straight you're going to have windrows with either piece of equipment and so where that efficiency comes into place is with something like a pusher here that makes cleaning up collecting those windrows a lot more efficient with a plow it's windrow after windrow after windrow i deal with it all the time when i use a plow at my house because that snow never is trapped by the far end of the plow it's going to constantly spill over you have to go back through and make one more cleanup pass if you want to however smaller volumes of snow that windrows normally are they're captured right inside this box here on a pusher so you collect it you move it where you want to you stack it up and it's done and again bear in mind with smaller machines maybe not so much once you get to an l6060 or into your utility tractor but those lighter machines are going to have a challenge steering while you're pushing all that snow with a snow plow so if you can keep that load centered with a snow pusher it could make your life a little bit more enjoyable as you go through the winter time now for talking about larger areas maybe it's a lot like what i have here at the shop maybe it's at home you've got a garage here maybe an extra garage or a barn or just a big landing area snow pushers really are the tool to use they're going to be a lot more efficient at trapping that snow minimizing the amount of passes you get the job done a lot quicker with a piece of equipment like this now as you might be able to tell i'm a snow pusher guy i just really love them and again for me it's all about simplicity and you can't beat that with a snow pusher however no matter what i choose to sell or recommend to folks i want it to be a good value above and beyond everything else so the tar river snow plows the hla snow pushers they just have that great combination of features price and quality that you just can't find with anything else that's out there so i hope you found this video helpful it gave you some good food for thought to help you make your decision if you're going back and forth i know it's a big decision that a lot of folks are trying to figure out on their own and this gives you some insight a different perspective maybe to think about it would really help me out if you consider giving me a thumbs up and maybe even leave a comment down below also consider hitting that subscribe button if you'd like
