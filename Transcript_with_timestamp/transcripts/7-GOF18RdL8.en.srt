00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,919
this video explains some of the finer

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,319
points for trap crop planting and

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,240
maintenance suitable for small farms for

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,320
details about basic principles and

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,920
effective layouts of mixed trap crops

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,679
please see videos part one and two

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,000
trap crops are not the silver bullet

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,320
solution to all pests while this video

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,160
explains planting method for nk 300

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,400
sorghum and prodovic sunflower for

11
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,080
leaffooted extinct bug management

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,400
research continues on finding most

13
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,480
suitable trap crops and varieties for

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,320
reducing other major pests of vegetables

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,320
like cucumber beetles and aphids

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,480
in the case of sorghum and sunflower

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,559
trap crops the sea head is the

18
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,559
attractive plant part in each case in

19
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,399
order to synchronize the availability of

20
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,800
the sea head with the occurrence of the

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,120
inset these trap crops should be planted

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,879
two weeks earlier than the main crop

23
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,440
small farmers can stagger plant with

24
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,680
multiple rows of trap crops sunflowers

25
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,480
take 70 days while sorghum takes about

26
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,480
100 days to mature

27
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,479
sorghum and sunflower trap crops should

28
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,400
be planted in april and may on good

29
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,159
quality soil planting the trap crop

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,720
seeds with the garden push type planter

31
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,640
is an easy process for sorghum we have

32
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,880
observed two plants per foot to be

33
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,200
adequate plant density and function as a

34
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,880
trap crop rose can be planted three or

35
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,400
more feet apart depending on the

36
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,240
available area

37
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:31,080
side dressing nitrogen for sorghum will

38
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,080
promote rapid growth of the trap crop

39
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,520
some trap crops can have poor

40
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,040
germination with too little soil

41
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,439
moisture

42
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,759
in alabama research running a drip tape

43
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,360
between sorghum rose worked really well

44
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,320
for this hardly low maintenance trap

45
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,280
crop

46
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,119
sunflowers also do well with irrigation

47
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,119
and should be planted on the outside to

48
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,759
arrest early season leaf-footed bug

49
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,759
migration

50
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,119
tomatoes and other main crops should be

51
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:12,000
planted as far from sorghum mk 300 as

52
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:14,239
possible to reduce shading

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,319
extra space is also necessary for

54
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:20,000
operating small foreign machinery like

55
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,920
tillers and sprayers between the rows

56
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,760
a trap cropping system is designed to

57
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,599
arrest leaf-footed bug migration and

58
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,840
large numbers will gather on sunflower

59
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,080
and sorghum heads keep a detailed record

60
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,160
of numbers by scouting the insects on a

61
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,080
minimum of 20 heads of the crop and

62
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,400
check the insect count on main crop as

63
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,879
well this would be useful for targeting

64
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,640
insecticide sprays on sorghum

65
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,400
target pests must be removed from the

66
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,720
sorghum trap crop to prevent large

67
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,560
build-up and migration to the main crop

68
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,720
one or two insecticide treatments with

69
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,480
synthetic pyrethroids like warrior and

70
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,959
mustang max are sufficient in

71
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,720
conventional farming systems organic

72
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,800
producers should target enemies with

73
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,319
approved products destroy the trout

74
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,040
crops at the end of the season to

75
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,720
prevent pest carryover

76
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,879
please attend a regional extension

77
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,640

79
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,599
production methods you can also

80
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,680
attend extension field days for hands-on

81
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,519
