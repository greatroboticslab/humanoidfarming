  "text": "[Music] welcome to a thrivable life a podcast that shows how Ordinary People can take everyday actions for a thrivable future where everyone lives in harmony with nature hi I'm cavia a project manager by profession and I am interested in learning about the impact we have on the environment in society and in turn how we are shaping by it and I'm Mike I'm a research assistant at Thrive with a background in political science and social policy I also have a passion for social and environmental sustainability and biodiversity and we are from the Thrive project the not for-profit Research Institute Think Tank and advocacy group kavia and I will be your co-hosts as we talk with our special guests about how we can create a world that is not just sustainable but one that thrives before we introduce this week's guest we would like to recognize Aboriginal and torr Islander peoples as the first people of this place now known as Australia as well as First Nations people across the globe and today's topic is something Our Guest is very familiar with this is sustainable agriculture we would like to introduce today's guest Le llo deini she has a bachelor's degree in physics and agrometeorology she has worked at a science and technology institution in South Africa she has completed her Masters in Business Administration at Edinburough business school in the United Kingdom and has a special interest in climate change and agriculture thank you for joining us today thank you for having me maybe we could start by just understanding what's the definition of sustainable agriculture in simple terms sustainable agriculture means farming to meet uh the demands for food production without destroying natural resources Land Air and most importantly water to irrigate and grow the crops or livestock that you have on your I know you uh have a background in sustainable agriculture how did you come about getting involved in the space uh actually the plan was not to uh go in agricultur sector I actually plan to study uh matology which was mostly influenced by my mom because my my mom worked at matology to but uh agriculture it's something that was always there at home my dad was a a teacher but on the side he plant crops we had uh a shink and cows chickens we basically farming on the side and we will sell to the community that we have people passing by our house they see they saying this crops and animals and then just come and B and uh like I said earlier the influence was more of what my mom studied so when I completed my metric um I applied University of Victoria to study materialy but then there was challenges with Finance because if I had to go out of the town that I've stain to go and study in another Province um it will actually more expensive so my parents were like can't you find something similar here at home that it's related and that's when I uh looked at uh the university that was in my area I see that they offer AGR matology that's when I was like it's the same it's the same as studying matology and at home we are doing farming so I pursued agrology that way yeah sounds like a blend of you know what you had seen all your life and somehow happened very coincidentally yeah it's it's basically my childhood everything was they influen most of my career what do you see as the need for sustainable agriculture like why do we need it and what's kind of wrong with the ways uh for at least quite some time it's it's maybe industrially done or it has been followed uh I think SU agriculture we have to ensure that we keep our we protect our resources so commercial farming it's good in a way that it provides uh food to people but now it also compromises on sustainability compromises on uh the environment now we have pollution and using Machinery that requires foral them so if we can try to at least um incorporate methods that are more sustainable providing food still providing food for people but without impacting their environment so I think it's important that uh we we consider those factors especially for commercial Farmers they are more on the commercial side of using more um energy consuming uh machinery and so uh it's important they also focus on uh bringing that sustainability aspect in their farming practices and you did mentioned about I think maybe it is challenging when you look at the way agriculture has been done until now uh in the sense that uh you know commercial agriculture probably uses a lot more resources and in cases where even for example Forest are probably uh being slowly removed uh to promote certain products which are extremely high in demand so in in such a situation of you know extreme high demand and then uh just the need for food increasing and variety of food increasing what are the different challenges that somebody who's trying to move into sustainable agriculture would probably face um the challenges that I think I've noticed among fers is um lack of knowledge a lot of farmers are not aware of what sustainable practices are for them to actually begin implementing that in their farming practices and some of them once they get the knowledge now they are faced with a challenge of funding how do I now get the money to get these uh resources that are going to help me to produce enough for people and and uh help me transition to uh sustainable agriculture shows those are the challenges and the other challenges that uh farmers face uh when it comes to converting to sustainable agriculture is the demand people are now used to uh conventional way ways of producing food so now when a farmer comes and tries to introduce food that are organically produced or um they didn't use a lot of uh chemicals you find that now they are only at a small percentage of the community so they're not getting a lot of buyers so now you find that the family like I still think I need to produce for me to I have a livelihood I still need to produce my my crops the way the the conventional way so and uh sustainable sustainably produced um food are usually more expensive than the the conventional produc food so people normally opt for that and it's really a challenge for Farmers so um then those are the main challenges actually with uh transition to a sustainable AG culture yeah and I think I've also seen uh for example certain organic products sometimes don't look or are not sometimes the same size in terms of specific species that work well as a conventionally produced one which look like that pict a perfect in some sense and I don't know if that also has has an impact because I have seen people who might not see a big price difference but they just don't find it goodlook enough to buy uh sometimes um not sure if that's an experience that you had too H yes yes I can agree with you with that and also the other day I I I got these wipes that said they were organic and then I realized I have to use them more than the conventional product so I thought maybe I would use those less but now I find myself using more of those products than the other ones yeah I just wanted to uh you know raise as well and question um you know the the fact when we're talking about obviously different organic produce and even as you were saying lot L lot small scale examples of of like you know farming you know in a small scale within a local community but I suppose another factor is as you was kind of alluding to the the quality of produce is things like efficiency and on that commercial level the efficiency of produce and meeting meeting demand from the public and you know having enough of um you know having enough resources uh you know products to to to feed a population Etc and how that kind of intersects with the you know sustainability requirements on that kind of mass scale obviously people can talk about organic F but on that sort of mass scale I think that must be one of the biggest challenges in terms of supplying uh demand within you know populations broadly and how what the the sustainability approaches are there so I'm wondering if that's something that could be uh noted as as needing more of a a revision um and you know more of a comprehensive one as opposed to what is often cited as as I I've noticed where people do talk about uh they they might ignore the need for um let's say approaches to preventing deforestation you know talk about say animal agriculture for example and the huge impact that that has on deforestation or water use Etc but people then point to small scale examples to kind of say yeah but this can be done in a way which is yeah more sustainable but obviously there are huge challenges given the the fact that uh in order for most uh supply for most people uh there is that well let's say that large scale commercial need you know of of agricultural uh for agriculture so I'm just wondering what the how how we could address those challenges and and how you would see that lot Lo the distinction between or or where in the African in the South African context how you would see local or community-based produce is that possible to supply populations broadly or is the commercial side needed and therefore needing to be revised in how it's done so it's done sustainably I think because now there's more people especially let me speak about South Africa because more people are now um in the city we do need more conventional agriculture to supply uh food but if people really stayed in their Villages and not move more to the city and I I think because what happens in rural areas and Villages people plant crops and they have animals and they would either sell those crops to the community so you find that you are think the community so now the the farmers the commercial Farmers don't have too much pressure on feeding the whole population because now people are also moving away from the villages to the city there's a demand now to feed these people who are in the city who are not planting crops in their gard and all that so that's why I think the the conventional farming has become prominent that way so there are still uh small farmers like for instance for me I always always tried for Farmers that I can go to to buy the food directly from themb and now in find the challenge now with them I think they also saw okay people now want naturally grown food and they don't want food that are produced conventional way you find that now the prices are now so high and then you realize when you compare them with the the prices at the Supermarket you realize wow I'm paying twice as much to get this Natural Glow chicken or sheep and that also discourages one to actually um support those small farmers who are producing sustainably grown chickens and other livestock yeah I'm just wondering yeah in turn the the you know the I suppose the reality faced with the world at the moment is the factor of you know our population growth and huge we've got what over 8 billion people on the planet now and suppose that comes into it as well that like historically you know thousands of years you know we've been able to live within sustainable parameters obviously but uh with that population growth and supply of food products to to the population there's obviously has to be some attempt that uh because of the huge scale of Agriculture required there has to have that revised approach and I think obviously yeah so I suppose um population is probably a big part of it as you said so many people are living in cities but that too is um you know just our human existence is generally has a big encroaching impact on the on the natural world yes yeah on the demand side I think that's one of the biggest challenges is having a market that's accepting organic uh you know food and also just given standard of living uh and just struggles with bunch of crisises we've had in the past I would say three to four years there is a you know costs attached to it but there are other challenges as well that we spoke about for Farmers U are there any solutions uh maybe technological solutions that are actually helping organic and sustainable practices going forward are there in examples that you want to share with us for actually for commercial even for for sustainable Farmers um I think now the usest technologies that farmers are using now is uh Precision agriculture where farmers are now using um drones and sensory devices to actually detect pirs checking whether the crops uh the field it has water or it's dry so it helps them um improve their farming practices so those that that is one of the technologies that I'm seeing happening as well as also artificial intelligence is is really gaining uh a lot of momentum in the agricultural sector farmers are using it to get early warnings of severe weather conditions like like these days we are having heat waves and um most farmers are complaining that crops are drying out so uh artificial intelligence can help farmers with um detecting severe weather conditions like droughts and floods which normally are some of the factors that uh influence Farmers production and artificial intelligence they can also determine the moisture content in the soil of the crops that they have planted uh whether there is enough water or less water so it improves the improves the farmer's irrigation system so the farmer will end up implementing smart irrigation systems that will let him know when to irrigate and when not to irrigate so in that way they are conserving water so use water based on what the crop requires so those are some of the technologies that are actually improving the agriculture sector yeah I think I think that's great that but there are ways technology can help especially today with digital technology moving at the pace that it is um and are there any actual practices that the farmers do which which have changed from a day-to-day perspective in the pursuit of being more sustainable on one hand like you said it's the use of technology to get certain data U or watering systems but what have they probably changed in how they do farming yes there are other farming practices that uh promote sustainable agricultures which uh requires Farmers to use less uh machinary less energy and these are for example no till practices no tillage so Farm you find that uh in conventional farming a farmer would use fossil fuel powered um vehicles to actually prepare their soil for plant but no tillage you don't have to use um fossil fuel consumption Machinery you just plant uh the the crops directly on the soil without having to alter or disturb the soil so no tillage is actually one of uh the sustainable methods that some farmers are using to eliminate um energy use and there's also crop rotation Farmers they basically PL crops uh not at the same area or piece of land consecutively every year so find that where you have where the land where you initially planted uh spinach for example we now change plant like pnut watermelon so it also helps retain the um soil health and not really affect the composition and the structure of the soil maybe while while you're at talking about practices um we can um mention how does having local products or Market have any impact definitely yes local products are actually good because you find that it takes a shorter time for to deliver these foods to the stores to the retail that so it takes quite a shorter time and the food are fresher and it becomes less expensive local agriculture supporting it's actually uh very sustainable and in some cases if you buy directly to the farmer you actually eliminate having to the farmer having to Now package um his uh her product so I think even my my dad CU he also supplies to one of the local Stones egg home they don't use packaging like you see in big retail stores just just you know fasten it with a rubber band and it's done it just saves a lot on packaging material yeah that's predominantly plastic in most places it's it's quite insane for example when you see a banana wrapped in a plastic which makes absolutely no sense uh no matter where I think it comes from and I think one of the other impacts I think we see that in terms of local products um correct me if I'm wrong are specific crops or you know way of farming that uh promotes uh more sustainable agriculture yeah it's really uh dependent on whether the crop can sustain the type of weather conditions so farmers normally uh they look at weather patterns and when they plan for farming in the next year they okay this year I might not I don't think I should plan or some in some cases they don't know what the weather is going to be like so but some of them have knowledge about how to mitigate on these severe weather conditions so crops like Maz where I come from in the Free State they can uh tolerate uh drought they can tolerate heat heat waves is a big thing in South Africa these days and sunflow it's also one of the crops that um can collect great drought and heat and there's other crops in other parts of the world like wheat I think even wheat and beans they do well in those conditions so and um yes and uh like I said earlier farming systems like crop rotation helps because if you are planting the same crop every year it but you might find that uh it's not going to survive in this year's weather condition so when you rotate your crops and not plant the same thing the crop might do well and farmers can also try to farm other crops that they haven't farmed before CU you don't know how they do in the type of soil your your farm is or the type of weather that uh will be there yes yeah I just wanted to briefly add to that and I just wanted to yeah briefly add I'm not certainly not an expert in agricultural sustainability but yeah one one interesting Innovation I'm aware of as llo was mentioning about new crops was uh or new you know approaches was the um phenomena recent phenomena of seaweed farming and just seeing how that has an extraordinary uh potential at least because there isn't that requ for fertilizer or water use you know for it to grow and it does have many uses including to supplement plastic you know bags you know it can be a plastic use as well as food food source uh for for different additives as well as protein but also um it is a huge um carbon you know source of carbon sequestration so it's really it's good for climate the climate and mitigating climate change as well so that's probably another just a little interesting point point I thought to to mention that um going forward you wonder to what extent that will be uh embraced given that it has a completely different uh sort of output and um way of being produced than most traditional agriculture obviously on land anyway yeah yeah and I think yeah Beyond land agriculture there's also other other things that we could probably grow what is needed uh to promote sustainable agriculture for me what I think uh consumers can do really to contribute to sustainable agriculture firstly they should um focus on eating what is in season buying what is in season that way we do not put too much pressure on the resources in fact we do not put too much pressure on Farmers to produce uh crops that are not season and that also helps the farmer to not put too much pressures on the resources because now they have to produce crops that are not in season because people now want if people can just eat what is in season and rotate crops like that I think it will contribute to sustainable agriculture and won't have to put too much pressure on our resources yeah and I'll probably just yeah mention um obviously being just being the consumer to be aware of of you know the the impact that um some some agriculture can have on the ecosystem broadly and um yeah to try and choose sustainably obviously plant-based approach is is helpful but yeah to choose sustainably broadly just to be aware of things like water use as well yeah and as well as particular particular businesses which might not be sustainable um in the in their operations as well yeah and I think just education broadly is not just for Farmers it's also for for consumers a lot of times like was saying um and I think we could also probably focus on the fact that there needs to be probably policies and just general promotion uh something that people from all walks of life can kind of come together and try and uh make a push in their local governments and their local uh agencies as well to ensure that there is some kind of policy and incentives that might help farmers really um focus and sustainable farming without losing you know their source of Revenue yes most defitely yeah and I think it's also important I remember a study particularly showing how incentivizing uh farmers and and having proper yeah policy guidance by governments for for uh you know moving towards more sustainable farming and particularly where it's particularly uh the current practices might be particularly bad but there does need to be leadership from governments and less um sort of governments adhering to short-term economic profits or you know GDP short-term benefits and looking more so the future of sustainability and and guiding both farmers and and consumers alike in that way and and the people uh people within the community the consumers putting pressure on governments uh to do so and to look at what is sustainable farming and what isn't and to put pressure on governments to lead in that way to to make it E easier for that transition yes thank you so much I definitely learned a lot thanks to and Michael for for talking together for this much time on this topic thank you for having [Music] me",
