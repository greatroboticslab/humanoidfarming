  "text": "uh pin bar do we need to worry about insect at this early stage do we need to spray no why not at this stage the the insect damage is can be completely compensated for by the plant so normally the things you get at the early stage are things like Leaf folder little bit of Lea folder and whal maggot wh maggot actually is the biggest problem this time of year but as the plant GR it just it just disappears because the plant as the leaves get thicker the maggots can't actually eat the leaf but you know I I keep worrying I see things on the leaves like this here and some things chewed on it this is a wh maggot that's a wh maggot yeah there nothing to worry about no problem no problem is yeah in fact this is even light it's not even uh you know a normal infestation of world maggot what is this here there's a some egg M on it here what these are these are probably some sort of paracoid that has so it's a wasp cocoon and these are beneficial again so it's good news uh these will fly off there's about 40 of them there so they'll fly off then and parasitize things like Leaf folder um larvea or um other caterpillars so they're again a beneficial insect fin bar I saw already saw a few lady beetles is what I would call them are they are they playing much of a role at this early they're also very important they're also feeding on on the natural of the the herbivore insects so they eat eggs mainly um also good uh predators of apids and also the dragonfly there's a lot of dragonfly flying around one of the things when you think about insects and rice you have to remember that in the water another problem generated by rice is mosquitoes and the dragonfly larva live in the water they have a very big uh strong jaw and they pre on the dragon on the uh mosquito Lara so they're keeping your mosquitoes down so really there's a whole ecosystem here functioning to keep everything in order I mean one really has to look hard to see all these things I see a little spider web here in which some some little insects are caught in there what are those these are those midges that are flying around these are the decomposer midg so they're again uh beneficial and spiders are very important predators of things like plant oppers mainly plant hoers so but but you know when I look around I see lots of crits here know insects of all kinds little things flying or crawling or so is that one of the reasons that some Farmers think they have to spray because they see all these insects well a lot of people don't understand what these insects are doing so a lot of people when they see these swarms of midges for example that are decomposing the the material they think it's a PL and they'll spray uh the same with the World mag one of the biggest problems with world magga is that it it induces Farmers to spray but we never see any yield reduction the same with um uh Leaf folder looking quite good Lee do you have any worries about insects when do we need to start worrying about them again a little bit in finbar's hands my knowledge of insects is not particularly profuse I'm probably more worried about the rats I think the rats have just given us an early warning over there yeah look at this it's all chopped off seedlings here whole SW chopped out which uh probably looks like red damage so some mean red went through here and uh basically created a total empty patch here just chopped off on the right on the on the surface here horrible not much we can do about that one",
