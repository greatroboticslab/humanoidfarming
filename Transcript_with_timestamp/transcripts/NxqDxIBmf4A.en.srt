1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,210
hey this is dave from voit smith

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,100
innovation and today we're gonna be

3
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,540
doing a video on the steps that we

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,919
recommend and the steps that we also

5
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,240
personally take for cleaning out our

6
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,889
liquid di series

7
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,500
these would be the steps that we

8
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:15,540
recommend obviously when we summarize

9
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,940
the units for storage over the summer

10
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,070
until next deicing season as we know

11
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,449
salt brine in itself especially the

12
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,039
additives that we run can be very

13
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:25,619
corrosive now it's really not an issue

14
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,180
with the the components of the system

15
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:29,160
itself I mean everything that we run is

16
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:32,040
either poly or stainless but there are

17
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,600
some sensitive electronics on the unit

18
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,309
and some parts of the engine that we

19
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,739
want to address before we let them sit

20
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:40,170
all summer the main point of concern

21
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:42,210
would be the electronics including the

22
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,100
servo valve and what can actually happen

23
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,660
is one these units sit the water

24
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,710
evaporates out and leaves the salt

25
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:52,260
behind and salt water is actually a very

26
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,670
interesting mixture because the salt can

27
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,280
actually creep out of places that the

28
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:58,140
water can't so it's very important that

29
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,859
we flushed all the salt water out of the

30
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,719
system and just make sure that the pump

31
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:05,519
electronics the valves everything are

32
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,790
clear of the salt so it doesn't sit in

33
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,010
there and evaporate out and leave a hard

34
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,930
solidified chunk of salt in the system

35
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,720
and really there's a lot of different

36
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:18,960
methods a guys swear by some guys will

37
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,400
use salt neutralizers and other products

38
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,860
for cleaning up the tank honestly we

39
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,960
just use water Dawn dish soap or some

40
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,280
type of other cleaner as long as we

41
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,229
flush the system out really well it's

42
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,360
gonna be fine so the first step that

43
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:32,579
we're going to take is obviously fill

44
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,170
the the tank up with water now we rinse

45
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:35,460
out the insides of the tank depending on

46
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,409
how the clean or dirty they are it's

47
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,119
just a good practice to have especially

48
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:40,619
if you're gonna be using the units for

49
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,049
may be watering going into the summer

50
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:44,430
herbicide applications but basically

51
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:46,409
what that entails is we just run a

52
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:50,610
garden hose up inside flush off the

53
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:52,409
sides of the tank and then we only have

54
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,579
about 300 gallons in this thousand

55
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:55,829
gallon sprayer that's gonna be plenty to

56
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:57,030
flush the system out what we're gonna do

57
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:59,040
now is we're going to go up there we're

58
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,450
throwing a little bit of dawn or

59
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,490
whatever you want to use to clean it out

60
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,799
and then we're just gonna let the search

61
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,820
them the system recirculate for a little

62
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,039
bit so we're gonna have the main tank

63
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,810
valve open and then you'll see the two

64
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:11,069
inch self oil line on our new models

65
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,120
here is actually how we're just going to

66
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:14,430
recirculate it around

67
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,989
we're gonna let that run for all good

68
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:17,690
five minutes just to make sure at the

69
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:21,360
pump and everything is cleaned out and

70
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:22,890
then and then from there we will be

71
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,930
pumping it out through the the boom the

72
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:30,090
valves and everything else so when we

73
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:33,330
get started on that oh yeah make a

74
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:35,340
bubble bath one thing to consider this

75
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:36,930
truck obviously has a hydraulic pump on

76
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,000
it but if you do have the gas pump on

77
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,620
your on your sprayer now it was a really

78
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,290
good time to throw in either a

79
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,360
stabilizer or some kind of fuel

80
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:47,579
treatment additive I'm a big fan of the

81
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,920
marine stable it's got the ethanol

82
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:51,200
neutralizers and it had really good luck

83
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,459
with that

84
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,260
just make sure that you put something in

85
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:58,549
there so if the carb doesn't get plugged

86
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,549
when sitting over the humid months

87
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:19,300
all right so we've let the tank

88
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:21,610
recirculate for a couple minutes here

89
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:23,470
and now the way that we're gonna clean

90
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:25,150
out our electronic system is by turning

91
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,340
on the controller itself in the truck

92
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,900
and what we're gonna want to do is flip

93
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,010
to manual mode because it knows that

94
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:33,580
we're not moving

95
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:35,260
take my hold switch off there and by

96
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:37,209
going to volume per minute now this is

97
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:39,280
the exact same method that you would use

98
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:40,570
if you're in a small parking lot or you

99
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,550
don't want to run an auto and you open

100
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,950
up the servo we're gonna open up our

101
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:46,209
valve what you can't tell right now it's

102
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,830
my boom sections are actually off and

103
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:49,780
the truck is off we're gonna open our

104
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:52,060
servo up wide open and then we're gonna

105
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,410
open up our three boom sections what

106
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:56,010
that's going to do is obviously flush

107
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:58,180
that water that we have through the

108
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:59,890
electronics and and out the boom

109
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,500
it's a good idea to clean up the boom to

110
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:04,030
four sitting just so that you don't have

111
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,860
any issues coming into the fall when you

112
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:09,090
want to use it again so we're going to

113
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,090
do that here fire up the truck

114
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:18,900
this will engage our PTO

115
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:22,320
and now we'll turn our food sections

116
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,940
and you can see opening up the servo 14

117
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,919
gallons per minute throughout the centre

118
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,620
boom I'm not gonna turn my side we've

119
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:31,949
done some actually in the shop right now

120
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:34,050
but you can you can pump it out this way

121
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:38,460
if you want to speed things up we're

122
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:41,520
actually just going to we're gonna pump

123
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:42,960
up through the two inch line here on the

124
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,389
truck itself just because we're inside

125
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,120
it's a good idea I did just flip on my

126
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:50,389
three lambu that way the control valves

127
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,949
for the boom sections got cleaned out

128
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:55,080
but in all honesty once we pump it out

129
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:57,720
like this we'll will be good for the

130
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,610
final steps of the procedure here okay

131
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,889
so we finished pumping out the the

132
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:04,080
contents of the tank just a few other

133
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:06,600
steps left here that that we want to

134
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,750
make sure that we recover one is we have

135
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,039
our filter element obviously usually you

136
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,600
don't mess with this a whole lot if

137
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,550
you're getting good flow and everything

138
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,960
your filter is likely fine but the end

139
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,880
of the season we do like to clean that

140
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,800
out again because anything we do now is

141
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,630
gonna be a lot easier when we we get

142
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,389
that unexpected snowfall in in October

143
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:27,300
so easiest way to do this just like in

144
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:29,599
the field you can drain your your filter

145
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:32,789
body so you don't take a bath with it

146
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:37,620
and also we're gonna pull the plugs on

147
00:05:32,789 --> 00:05:42,150
the pump itself and they're generally

148
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:45,470
gonna be pretty tight what this is gonna

149
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:49,910
do it's actually going to drain the pump

150
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:49,910
we got one more on the bottom here

151
00:05:51,500 --> 00:06:05,900
there we go okay now we got the bottom

152
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:07,700
plug out and you can see that there's

153
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:10,280
actually quite a bit of quite a bit of

154
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:12,110
product left inside there it's actually

155
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,700
pretty important to do because even if

156
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,920
you let your sprayer sit for a long

157
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:17,480
period of time during the winter what

158
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,800
can happen is actually that water can

159
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,320
evaporate out of the pump we've taken

160
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,580
apart quite a few pumps that we've had

161
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,260
sent back by customers that were

162
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,780
defective and and what you can actually

163
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:29,390
see is the line where the salt brine or

164
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:30,710
the was in it and the rest of the pump

165
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:32,480
is actually all salt and that can

166
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:34,040
actually be pretty pretty hard on these

167
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,840
seals in there because that salt will

168
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:38,270
get in between the seals and then you

169
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,760
have a very very abrasive surface when

170
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:42,740
that pump fire is up again so it's a

171
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,919
pretty simple process to do we'll even

172
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:47,270
do it during the season if our temps are

173
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,530
gonna fall really cold then we're not

174
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,570
gonna be the icing it might not had

175
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:53,270
enough additive in the system well drain

176
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:55,190
all the plumbing on them the exact same

177
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:58,160
concept as if you were you know draining

178
00:06:55,190 --> 00:07:02,060
plumbing in a house or or a garden hose

179
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:04,850
so that's about it for this we're gonna

180
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:10,040
pull this filter off just need a a pipe

181
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:12,740
wrench to do that and we actually

182
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:16,400
haven't even changed this filter yet or

183
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:19,070
you or even checked it so we'll be first

184
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,780
time you see what's actually in it and

185
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:23,990
you can see we actually have quite a bit

186
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:25,490
of junk in the air a lot of that is from

187
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:28,340
not cleaning out the tank when we pop

188
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:29,990
the bulkheads in it some of the sealing

189
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,700
agent but you can actually see how much

190
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:33,020
these filters can take we've been

191
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:36,050
running this I don't know we probably

192
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:39,800
have you know 5,000 gallons through this

193
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:41,150
truck and with all that being filtered

194
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,430
out we still didn't have any performance

195
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:44,900
issues so nice thing about these filters

196
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:47,240
all you do have to do is wash them out

197
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,220
and then install them the exact same way

198
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,160
that you took them apart so we're gonna

199
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:54,950
do that and then we'll put all this back

200
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,740
together here now one of the final steps

201
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:59,690
that I recommend if you do have a

202
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:01,940
gasoline engine make sure that you clean

203
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:04,280
everything up really well and then we're

204
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,320
gonna want to focus on putting some

205
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,660
penetrating oil or

206
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:09,940
fluid film wd-40 something on the engine

207
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:11,260
just so any residual salt that might be

208
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:13,570
there isn't going to cause any any

209
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:15,100
rustling issues with the the humidity

210
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:17,710
and the oxygen during the during the

211
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:19,420
summer one part in particular that we

212
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:21,730
like to focus on is actually at the

213
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:24,220
recoil cover where the flywheel and the

214
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:26,800
block meet most of the engine failures

215
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:29,620
that we see are due to that part seizing

216
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,470
up for some reason that main bearing

217
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:34,240
there or the the crank bearing must be

218
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,830
very susceptible to getting salt in it

219
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,500
when it sits and then actually will lock

220
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:39,940
the entire engine up it doesn't hurt to

221
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,860
put a little oil on the cylinder maybe

222
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:43,390
if you like to fog your engines with

223
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:46,290
some fogging oil that works really well

224
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:48,820
too but really at the end of the day

225
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:51,070
your equipment will take care of you the

226
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,720
way you take care of it so once you do

227
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,980
that to the engine the last step when we

228
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,110
pull it out of the truck is obviously

229
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:58,150
disconnecting the wiring and that'll

230
00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:00,670
just be our 10 pin connector that we

231
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:03,130
have that that goes from the cab to the

232
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:05,170
electronics here and make sure you put

233
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:06,610
some dielectric grease on that again if

234
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:09,060
there's any corrosion so you might see

235
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:11,650
use some electrical terminal cleaner and

236
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:14,290
get that taken care of dielectric grease

237
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:15,520
put the caps on usually the wiring

238
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:17,200
harness is gonna stay with your trucks

239
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,910
so make sure that you wrap that up on

240
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,880
your extension harness and put it in a

241
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:23,650
safe place if your controller is not

242
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,230
permanently mounted there are two spots

243
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:27,820
in the or for the wiring that you're

244
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:29,740
gonna disconnect and that entire

245
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:31,870
controller can come out of the cab for

246
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:33,670
you make sure you put them in a safe

247
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:37,630
place you know you can find them when

248
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:39,700
when next season comes around again yeah

249
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:41,590
just washing the the metal and

250
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:45,700
everything itself maybe if you want to

251
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:47,170
put a little oil or penetrating oil or a

252
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,970
fluid film again on the skid

253
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:51,010
touch up any spots it might be chipped

254
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:53,350
from rust just anything to help increase

255
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:54,520
the longevity of the unit but that's

256
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:57,370
pretty much it

257
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:59,440
really it all this applies to everything

258
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:00,940
that we have just make sure that you you

259
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,520
flush water through it made a little bit

260
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:06,910
of soap get all of the the valves and

261
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:08,560
everything opened up and your unit

262
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:10,680
should be ready to go for for next

263
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,680
winter
