  "text": "[Music] hey hey it's shake easter and i'm your host and the founder of casual cattle conversations a global rancher education company that strives to bring honest thoughts and conversations from ranchers and leaders to other ranchers be sure to follow cattle combos on social media to have more in-depth conversations around the ranching business and lifestyle brought to you if you are ready to take your operation to the next level and improve your lifestyle too send me a message about my rancher mine group rancher mines are monthly roundtable discussions for ranchers to learn from peers and experts and leave the call with actionable advice to make changes on their own operations with that let's see who our guest is today and what experience and advice they have to offer you to improve your own operation well thank you for joining me today i'm excited to have you on the show i know this is our first time talking but i have visited with your brother a little bit so to start off would you really share what your background in the ranching space is and how you got started uh thank you for having me shay um basically i'm a fifth generation cattle rancher in the northern part of chihuahua mexico uh our family moved here in the in the late 1800s early 1900s um and we've been ranching in this area ever since going on almost 100 years now but my personal background while i was born born at the ranch raised at the ranch um basically this is this is all i know uh when i first started actually managing the ranch i was fresh out of high school i mean it hasn't been that long i didn't go to college i didn't i didn't i didn't really want to go to college so um well the ranch was the second best thing to do um so so i started managing the ranch in 2016. um i'm only 24 years old and well since then i've i've we've started with more intensive grazing practices more regenerative grazing practices here at the ranch and we've been able to to maximize our profits by doing so how has the conditions of your pastures changed with these holistic approaches uh well we've been able to to increase our carrying capacity by three times uh three times as much so i mean that gives you an idea the the quality of forage we have now uh we we don't give any any protein i mean it's strictly grass grass fed uh beef i mean there's we don't give any other type of forage just the grass that we grow um during the winter we graze all we graze all year round um and and our area is a semi-arid uh area we get from anywhere from 15 to 18 inches of rain a year but we do have uh some some drought years like in 2020 we got four inches of rain and we could still uh double our carrying capacity with without having that much rain um so as far as our pastures i mean you can see the difference in a heartbeat um and well the the numbers are there to show to show that this type of management actually works and i mean it's for a ranch in this area to to to run as much cattle as as we do it's i mean it's it's one one in a hundred so um i mean that's our we've seen the benefits so what is your like stocking right now or what does your carrying capacity look like now that you you said you've increased the amount of cattle you can run by three times so what does that look like for you in this area people usually run from 12 hectares 12 to 15 hectares per cow per year we use the metric system in mexico acres would be about roughly 20 acres per cow per year and we're running three hectares per cow per year which is roughly about seven acres per cow per year wow so what what are your forage types there what are some of those um native forages uh we we mostly we have perennial uh grasses uh blue grama black drama red grama uh there's we we've counted up to 20 different types of species here at the at the ranch i mean they're all mostly all perennials we have very very very little annuals um the high quality forages that keep their protein year round and and with the right rest period it it really helps the cattle eat a better diet when when when you have i mean stockpiled forages it helps their nutrition like you can't imagine so there are multiple different ways to implement regenerative practices when you look at grazing what models are you looking at i'm sure you've kind of adapted it to your own ranch and what works as many people do but really when you say you are implementing regenerative practices what does that look like for you on a daily basis um here at the ranch we have over 500 packs give or take the five all those 500 products we we make them uh year round with poly wire everything we use is portable so it has our our our infrastructure is so portable we can pick up and move wherever we and at a very low cost so we build over 500 paddocks a year we move daily sometimes we even four or five times a day so it's highly intensive so we can get the best out of the out of our forage uh use it properly and and rest it properly also inside of those 500 paddocks we have a rotation of about 425 days of rest per paddock so i mean our per paddock we have a a time period we use it maybe six hours per for every 420 days so our our rest period is is is is what's making this work wow so you talked about how you're constantly on the move moving cattle how many employees how many people do you have working on your operation to manage this workload then um it's only me and i have one hired hand but other than that we're running i mean in between me and my hired help we're running over 500 cows and and we have about 200 stalkers here at the ranch you know so there's a there's there's quite a bit of work but i mean when you're organized and since you move them every single day it cuts down on your on on basically uh checking the cattle health-wise since you see them every day i mean it it simplifies everything most people think because of moving once a day it's going to be a lot more difficult but honestly it's a lot simpler than moving moving every 15 days or every 20 days and and your paddocks are a lot smaller so it's easy to get around your paddocks with poly wire in a day and just just keep it portable keep it simple and well i don't have that much help we have we have a well organized uh ranch well-fueled ranch i guess so what are some processes you've implemented to make putting up that poly wire faster easier just make the whole process more efficient um what we usually do is is make instead of having like your typical wagon wheel or or having uh something permanent uh basically we go with the what our land gives us so all our our all our fences go off of the terrain most of our our ranch is flat so basically we just build a small squares and then we have water in every single paddock so the water it's all piped we have a pipeline a two inch pipeline that goes throughout the ranch and from there when we're grazing the animals we can connect uh our portable water trough to to wherever we need wherever we need the pipe so the water for cattle so with that you know do you do any like you know lease out any recreation activities on the ranch or do anything on that front um in addition to this or do you just i mean is it just are you a commercial operation what does that look like for you guys uh basically it's it's a commercial operation what we do what basically it's cow calf and once we wean our calves we export them to the us so we export live cattle to the us other recreational activities we do there's a little bit of hunting i mean whitetail hunting uh uh turkeys um but other than that it's it's purely just cattle path so we might run a little stalkers here and there but um basically just okay so have these grazing practices benefited have you seen a large benefit in the amount of wildlife present the availability of hunting on your ranch yeah for sure i mean what what's happening we're basically building a micro climate here at the ranch that is helping is helping us with all types of wildlife biodiversity where we also work with a lot of conservation services uh basically any migratory birds that come to our ranch it's it's a conservation so we we can uh take care of of those animals that that need need that habitat and uh we've been working with uh the rocky mountain bird con conservancy for the past four years i think and uh basically what they do is take care of if all the migratory bird species that come from from the rockies down to the down to mexico and uh that that's a big part of our our our goal here at the ranch to to at least leave what what we have better than we than when we got in i think that's an awesome point to leave things better than when you found them and something a lot of ranchers try to do so with that kind of looking back at you know the types of practices you're using you know what resources do you go to to continue your learning you know what did that process look like as you got started who did you turn to for advice uh first i i turned to my dad obviously he he was when the holistic management movement came to mexico he was one of the first pioneers so i turned to my dad a lot and and also the savory institute helps a lot and ranching for profit i'm a love of x alumni from wrenching for profit which it help helps a lot when you're trying to run a business that well it's it's it's you're running a business off of what nature gives you um and and you're trying to manage you're trying to manage resources that that that can be be bettered uh improved um knowing how to do it is is key and i mean here fortunately here in mexico in chihuahua where there's quite a quite a few people that are practicing uh regenerative agriculture gender ranching whatever you want to call it there's a lot of people here in chihuahua in my state that um that are actually doing it and basically what we we we all have a group chat we just bounce ideas off of each other but um any any type of thing you want to learn i highly recommend to to take courses and and and learn about it well that's exciting so what mindset do ranchers need to have when they are starting to get into regenerative grazing and really embrace that style of ranch management i think they need to change the paradigm first i mean there's a lot of uh misconceptions of branching especially here in chihuahua a lot of people think it's too dry it can't be done here but they're just all paradigms you need you need to change and and once once you start actually uh moving daily and get the hang of it there's no better way to actually do it than doing it and and i mean your failures are going to be they're going to be um what's it called they're going to be it's going to be like your school i mean it's going to teach you how what not to do um but uh just changing your paradigms the way you think is it helps has has a lot to do with uh running a ranch this way well awesome do you have any last advice for those who are interested in improving their grazing methods or any last comments you'd like to share before we finish up today yeah i mean a lot of people get stuck on on yeah i want to do the change and but they don't know how to start the change um i would recommend getting getting a consultant having someone consult you for so so you don't make the same mistakes like i did or anyone else did and uh yeah some people might say the consultants are are expensive or they charge too much but he'll give you a helping hand once you start and then once you're once you have a consultant then then i i highly recommend uh keeping everything portable i mean there's no sense in in dumping a bunch of money when when you can actually do it with portable poly wire portable posts so so you're gonna basically be changing one thing for another you're gonna be changing sweat for an improvement or or changing money for for infrastructure so i i highly recommend just making everything portable the more portable you have it the more flexibility you have to graze wherever you can or or in points of opportunity throughout your ranch um but other than that i mean just it's time to change the way we think and it's time to change the way we ranch well awesome thank you very much for joining me today i'm excited to share this with my audience and appreciate all that you had to share thank you for having me shane and that's a wrap on that one be sure to let me know your thoughts on the episode and if you have any further questions around the topic take care and have a great day you",
