1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,520
everyone it's Ross in today's video

2
00:00:03,159 --> 00:00:06,799
we're going to be pruning some Stone

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,960
fruits uh we have just about everything

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:12,280
pruned now like we've done the apples

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:15,279
the pears the Persimmons the Jujubes the

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:18,320
figs all of it uh except for the stone

7
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:21,000
fruits and the European grapes and that

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,640
stuff you need to wait longer uh before

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,760
you can prune them sometime in early

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,840
spring um late winter and it's really

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,000
all about disease with the stone fruits

12
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,759
right we want to prevent that from

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,440
happening we want to make sure that in

14
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:39,480
the forecast it's not going to rain U

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,800
before we prune it's really important um

16
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,320
some other things I think are really

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,360
important that we're going to talk about

18
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,039
is knowing how your tree fruits okay

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,559
does it fruit on New Year's

20
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:53,960
growth last year's growth or 2-year-old

21
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:56,480
wood as an example so it could be

22
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,879
one-year-old wood 2-year-old wood you

23
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,239
know it could be any number of things

24
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:01,840
depending on what it is you guys are

25
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:04,720
doing I think that's really important

26
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:08,320
and kind of developing a strategy around

27
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,759
that um you can do this yourself right

28
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,000
um You don't need to follow guidelines

29
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:15,240
that I'm going to set for you guys or

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,520
guidelines that people have recommended

31
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,479
you can just do this your you know

32
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,920
figure out your own little path and do

33
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,720
this however you want to do it um every

34
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,280
tree is different every yard's different

35
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,400
so even though I'm going to give you

36
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,520
guys some recommendations I'm trying to

37
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,079
give you guys General recommendations

38
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,240
here

39
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,240
um these are my cherry trees behind me

40
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,200
they're semid dwarf we're going to move

41
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,880
over there to the asaya peaches in just

42
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:42,600
a moment but I want to talk about these

43
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:45,399
first um some things in particular we

44
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:48,399
have a nice little deer just the nicest

45
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:50,200
deer that comes through here and makes

46
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,360
its way this way towards the cherry

47
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,719
trees and inevitably every summer or I

48
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,479
should say every

49
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:59,520
spring he gets a little taste of them

50
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:03,000
and as a result I've removed most of the

51
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:06,280
lower growth so that was priority number

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,520
one um I also wanted to make sure

53
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:12,800
that these trees are not getting too big

54
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,519
I want to form a nice little canopy with

55
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,120
these um I want to keep them cuz they're

56
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:19,840
so close together here I want to keep a

57
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,160
lot of that growth out of the middle to

58
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,720
a minimum and have most of these trees

59
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,080
grow out in the other direction away

60
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,560
from each other um I kind of want them

61
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,800
to be bush-like have a a larger can

62
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,319
a dense

63
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,200
canopy um if I can and that's really the

64
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,120
goal of what I've been decided to do

65
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:41,800
this year and as you can see we've made

66
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,800
some nice little

67
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:47,239
Cuts nothing too

68
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,920
drastic but we did reduce the height

69
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:50,599
quite a bit because I don't want these

70
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,879
trees to get Too

71
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:57,239
Tall uh the sun about midday is

72
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:58,920
somewhere around here and if this trees

73
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:00,400
are too big it's going to shade out

74
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,400
what's on the patio

75
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,120
which would be the Potted figs and those

76
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,920
take priority over the cherries um one

77
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,959
thing about the cherries is

78
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:14,360
that store-bought quality actually is

79
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,879
pretty similar to Homegrown quality and

80
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,360
if I were to do this all over again I

81
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:20,040
wouldn't grow sweet cherries probably

82
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,000
would grow some other cherries like bush

83
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,239
cherries or sour cherries that are a bit

84
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,560
more problem free than the the sweet

85
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:30,720
cherries right the sweet cherries can

86
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,879
really get attacked by rot and

87
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,879
diseases they're not really the longest

88
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:38,680
live trees either especially in my

89
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:40,159
climate so you know it's all up to you

90
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,159
guys and where you guys live and your

91
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,599
situation but there are other things

92
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,200
that I would rather

93
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:49,360
grow um one thing I want to mention here

94
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,599
about the cherries is that they flower

95
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,599
in

96
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,680
clusters I can get the camera to focus

97
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,159
for you this is essentially a nice

98
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:02,360
little cluster of flowers here there's

99
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:04,599
about five to seven little buds each of

100
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:07,840
those will turn into a cherry and they

101
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:09,840
fruit on or they form I should say on

102
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,239
2-year-old

103
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,280
wood I guess they can probably form I'm

104
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,959
not entirely sure but they can form on

105
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:22,120
older wood as well but they'll pretty

106
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:24,000
much stay here for the remainder of

107
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,840
their lives I can come in here and thin

108
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,960
this out these little buds but for the

109
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,560
most part we want to be focusing on

110
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:35,160
getting a lot of this 2-year-old

111
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,720
wood and

112
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,880
limiting as much one-year-old wood as we

113
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:43,600
can so it's kind of a bit of a a problem

114
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,759
there um too much one-year-old wood

115
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,560
means we're going to have a huge

116
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,720
tree and too

117
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,080
much well there's no such thing as too

118
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,360
much 2-year-old

119
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,800
wood but we definitely want to make sure

120
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,800
that we're getting a nice little canopy

121
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,320
set up a permanent structure I think is

122
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,240
really what I want to come back to and

123
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,600
really keep these things under control

124
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,440
that way so that's kind of really the

125
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,960
basics of what I have decided to do is

126
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:13,960
prune out the lower growth for the

127
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,160
deer um kind of control the growth so

128
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,400
it's not growing into each other in its

129
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:22,520
own little respective

130
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:25,520
area and also keeping the number of

131
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:28,199
one-year-old wood kind of to a minimum

132
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,840
right I mean this is about you know a

133
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:32,319
foot of growth here maybe and that's it

134
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,280
I don't really want any one-year-old

135
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:36,600
growth more than

136
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:39,080
that um I mean of course it's going to

137
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,440
grow more than a foot every year but

138
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:44,000
we're going to keep it trimmed back to

139
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,720
about that and that way we'll form a

140
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,880
nice little almost as if we were poing

141
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:54,080
this in a way we'll form nice little new

142
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,400
branches here at a lower height than we

143
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,280
would if we kind of just let it do its

144
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,440
thing and let me show you guys the

145
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,280
peaches okay

146
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,199
the peaches are spy a you're not really

147
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,720
supposed to do this but we' we've done

148
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:08,880
it and these are my tips for this

149
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,599
because I think you need to really get a

150
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,880
little bit creative with these if you're

151
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:15,440
going to do this

152
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:19,400
um you can see here this is what we pred

153
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,400
out I left this here for you guys to

154
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,840
see this is only the 3-year-old

155
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:31,039
wood um obviously there's one-year-old

156
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:33,440
wood up here right two 2-y old wood as

157
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,520
well but down here this is where the

158
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,440
thick stuff is this is the 3-year-old

159
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:41,080
wood and this has just got to come

160
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:44,560
out and the reason for that is that I

161
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:48,840
can't really control the height of

162
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,759
this and recycle New Growth without

163
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,560
doing that so we made a we only made

164
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:54,160
three

165
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:57,280
cuts um that's really it I didn't go

166
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:00,319
crazy with these you can see we made one

167
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,240
there and then two on this red Haven

168
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,160
Peach right

169
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,680
there um peaches are a bit different I

170
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:11,080
want to I want to mention here they

171
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:13,479
fruit on one one-year-old wood the new

172
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,560
growth from last year and they form

173
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:18,160
these little

174
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:21,039
buds you can see that there really

175
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:24,199
perfectly um they'll form about two to

176
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:26,080
three different Buds and that's that

177
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:29,759
will be the flowers

178
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,039
whereas this Bud here is really just a

179
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,440
new

180
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:36,120
Branch um so you have to look at these

181
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,720
branches in a way and say okay how much

182
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,520
fruit do I have and how much do I want

183
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,080
last year I really thinned this out we

184
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,039
got to about a 100 peaches per tree I

185
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,280
think that's

186
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,720
reasonable for someone like me I don't

187
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:54,360
need to eat more than 100 peaches it's

188
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:55,879
nice to be able to share but um you know

189
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,800
this stuff down here is really going to

190
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:01,520
give me a nice little fruit set because

191
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,800
this really has a nice little density of

192
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,360
one-year-old

193
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,680
wood um and that's on the bottom tier

194
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,800
that we're looking at on the second

195
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,280
tier we've actually uh got a similar

196
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,800
situation but it's a bit more vigorous

197
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,759
right as you go up higher on the tree

198
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,720
you get more Vigor so I'm kind of

199
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:22,240
keeping a lot of the lower stuff because

200
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,680
that stuff's not going to grow all that

201
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,039
much it's not really going to get in the

202
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,240
way of anything too

203
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:30,199
drastic the second tier we may want to

204
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,120
thin this out a bit more

205
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:33,719
and really space this out right so this

206
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,279
is like let me give you an example this

207
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:39,080
is a nice little system of branches

208
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:41,919
here um this this whole thing that we're

209
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,880
looking at it's got 2-year-old wood it's

210
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,519
got some nice one-year-old branches that

211
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,399
will fruit for

212
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:52,000
me um we want to space this out between

213
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:54,240
another little section of 2-year-old

214
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,279
wood this is another good

215
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,760
example so by doing that we're keeping

216
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,680
them apart from each other they're not

217
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:04,279
shading each other other out we're not

218
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:07,040
encouraging disease we're increasing air

219
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:08,760
flow um it's just better off overall for

220
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,200
the

221
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:14,640
tree um and then we also need to do

222
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:17,640
something important where we select new

223
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:21,000
branches that will then become

224
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:23,920
2-year-old branches this system next

225
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,040
year so if we have a 2-year-old little

226
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:30,279
complex system of branches here this

227
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,320
will turn 3 years old next year and I

228
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:35,480
I'm going to take this out I may

229
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,880
keep on the lower tier I may let them

230
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:40,200
stay here for about four

231
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,120
years on the second tier it's going to

232
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,360
be 3 years and the same thing on the top

233
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:47,480
tier 3 years as well so any

234
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:50,800
three-year-old wood has to come out but

235
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:55,160
we also have to make room for new year

236
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:57,240
old New Year growth for that to become

237
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,000
something in the future right we have to

238
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:03,680
be thinking about the future we can't be

239
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:06,079
so short blindsided here that we just

240
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,839
completely forget about the fruit we're

241
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:11,320
going to have a couple years from now

242
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:13,279
you know that's really the goal of these

243
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,480
trees in my mind is that's what I'm

244
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:18,800
thinking about probably the

245
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:21,240
most we've got ourselves a nice form

246
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,440
okay that should be your number one

247
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,560
priority from the beginning but once you

248
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,279
get that form down now you're trying to

249
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:30,760
just manage the number of fruits that

250
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:33,680
you want so by doing this right by

251
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:36,399
selecting the the new wood so like if

252
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:39,000
this is a a nice little permanent Branch

253
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,720
here and this is a nice little permanent

254
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,680
Branch here one of these two would make

255
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:49,399
a really nice new system to turn into

256
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:51,160
this or to this the following year and

257
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:54,360
then if we wanted we could take out one

258
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:56,000
of these and then that way we would have

259
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:59,639
a constant

260
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,680
recycling of new wood and new system of

261
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:04,639
branches it gets a bit more complex as

262
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:07,279
we get a bit higher and things really

263
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:09,639
need to be pruned a bit more as we get

264
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:12,480
higher but it's a similar scenario let

265
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:16,040
me give you guys a good example

266
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,800
here this is 2-year-old wood and you can

267
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,720
follow this up and you'll see a whole

268
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,360
different system of branches up there

269
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,920
just like we saw

270
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:28,440
below right next to that is one-year-old

271
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:32,240
wood that has grown quite vigorously or

272
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:34,360
maybe it's even 2-year-old wood but you

273
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,120
can definitely see this one back here

274
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:39,800
this is basically just one little

275
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:43,000
shot of one-year-old wood this guy back

276
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:45,320
in there so what we can do is that when

277
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,320
this comes out next year cuz this will

278
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:52,760
turn 3 years old this time next year we

279
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:56,560
take this out this then looks just like

280
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:58,440
that and this will kind of replace that

281
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,920
right so that's all we're doing is we're

282
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:03,360
Recycling and you get over here into

283
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:07,560
this section these will

284
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:10,800
become new branches to eventually

285
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:13,920
become this 2-year-old section of

286
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:16,800
complex branches so that's all we're

287
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,839
doing that's really it in a nutshell and

288
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:22,440
uh I wish I could have said that in

289
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:23,720
shorter words and less time but uh there

290
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,680
you got

291
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:29,000
it all

292
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:32,160
right so again nothing really needs to

293
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,600
be too crazy but uh I did Summer prune

294
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,600
these trees a

295
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:39,560
bit um so with the connection of Summer

296
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,800
pruning and winter pruning we really

297
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,600
didn't do a whole lot to these trees

298
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,720
what I will do is I'll come in here with

299
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,560
hand

300
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:50,880
pruners and maybe take out a branch like

301
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:53,959
this where it's kind of in the way a lot

302
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:57,000
of crisscrossing branches look for

303
00:12:53,959 --> 00:13:00,360
damaged diseased or dead wood I don't

304
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,360
have any of that on these trees

305
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:05,519
um you know they're pretty young

306
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,320
but I think you guys kind of get the

307
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,440
idea here so hopefully you enjoyed this

308
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,639
one hopefully you learned something and

309
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,639
if you did please let me know down below

310
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:17,399
what you

311
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:19,720
learned and uh I'll certainly be willing

312
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:22,399
to um help you guys if you have any

313
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:24,920
