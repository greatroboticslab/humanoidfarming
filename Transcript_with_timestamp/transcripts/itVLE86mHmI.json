  "text": "[Music] hey y'all let me start by introducing myself my name is Wes white here at tick Creek Ranch we're social media content creators and we do all kinds of stuff here on the acridge we operated on 192 acres and as you can see we got some timber here on our land so roughly 2 years ago started working on a proof of concept now here we are many months later and what you see before you is what we call the log Hopper I saw it as an opportunity to hopefully design something and maybe some would say reinvent the wheel but it's a combination of a skitter SL logging Arch I feel that it really can help fill a knead or a hole that's in the market and for some of you folks out there now this is by no means going to replace a tractor if you want or need a tractor I'm not telling you you should even consider this this is a very specialized piece of equipment for a very specialized application where the Genesis that this came from is that I'm very ecologically and biologically conscious whe whether it be our pastures our cattle our horses or the forest floor I Like To Tread really light I don't like to leave any Trace if I can so that's kind of where this all came from we're going to go around and show you the features and functions of this and I love your feedback all right so we're going to start with the heart of the Beast here what we got here is a mile marker 5,000 lb winch and it does come with a full spool of wire now we're going to send it out like that to anybody purchases it but I would actually recommend unless you plan on yarding with this thing and if you do that hat you're going to probably want to add an external battery on top of this unit I wouldn't want to rely on the small battery that's on your ATV four-wheeler side by side whatever you got to be running this winch in a continuous fashion for long pull so this wire here I'll actually probably trim it down to about 20 ft it'll give us less wraps on the spool it'll make the job of the winch a lot easier and you won't have so much problem with biting and pinching cable it'll be a lot easier to Flat wrap so that being said this is how it will come it comes with its own wiring harness that you would just add to your side by-side ATV and then you'll be able to plug it in directly and run off the battery of the machine that you're pulling it with here we've got some grade 7516 chain and you can see we got three chain Keepers on either side the chain keeper is designed for just that okay I do not recommend don't ever ever suspend the load or the log off these chain Keepers the only reason I say that it's not the Integrity or any problem here that we would be worried about it would be this so if someone is rigging this up puts their hand in here like this and the load comes loose it will cut your fingers off this is a terrible pinch point so these are not for carrying load chain hooks boom that's how you'll suspend your load okay let's talk about what makes this machine more unique than pretty much anything on the market um this is not a new design and I'm not intending to say this is my own conception this is a very standard mechanical feature on a lot of trailers Andor military vehicles throughout the world I think a lot of you would know what a walking beam suspension is especially considering if you ever been around a logging truck a Hendrickson suspension or the like so we've just adapted that to a 3500 lound stub shaft here these are 5/8 plate this is all laser cut and these spindles which are all greaseable mind you these spindles are rated at 1100 lb the tires are rated 1,000 lb so we are giving this machine a 3,000 lb rating I don't recommend going higher than that but I know how you guys use your equipment you can see this is pretty self-explanatory we've got deflectors and then we also got chain keep Keepers on the side here now what will we use these for well these are designed to be able to create a cradle or or run a chain over the top of your log so if your log is butt heavy and you're grabbing it from the top of the tree and it naturally wants to lift the front of the log when you pick it with the winch well you can throw a chain over the front and you'll be able to carry a butt heavy log out you'll take obviously weight off the tow vehicle and you'll have to take that in consideration or we can cradle we can throw the chain underneath the log and just lift set the front of the log reset our tongs and lift the back l so now you're probably wondering what this contraption is well this is what we call our trolley this machine is designed to run many different features and functions you should be able to yard with it lightly you're going to also have the the feature of a standard log Arch where you're going to be able to cradle and carry your log out and you're going to be able to take and move Logs with unlimited length you'll be able to move pecker poles and tree length logs as long as they're not heavier than the machine can handle by using this Trolley system so what we got here is a pin it's got three positions a different height you can run it if you want to cradle your log from the front and hang from there but this operation is going to allow you to back over your log connect this hook to the choker on your log and as you pull forward this is going to run up stop at the back and then drag your log out from behind you it works really great on really long trees again pecker pulls you know light logs I've pulled a I've Dr around a 40ft log that was about oh 16 in at the butt 18 in it can do more uh that's just something I did with it you got to make sure your choker chain is tight enough and you don't have too much tag in to make sure that the log is high enough so when the machine articulates and the log comes out at a obtuse angle it's not interfering with your tire that is another feature of these really short tires people might ask well why four tires instead of just two well the walking beam suspension is a class two lever allows you to Traverse over obstacles much easier with a heavy load so as you can see for any of those that don't understand you'll see how the lifting mechanism works here as I pick up on this tire I will effectively only be lifting half of the weight of this unit cuz half will be on there the same goes for when this crawls over a stump or log see how easy that is this unit weighs just under 600 lb and I can easily lift that so now you can understand how little upward Force has to be applied to this tire to effectively lift this to allow the tire to Traverse over set obstacles so on some of our Prototype videos we had some people say oh great now you got four tires to get flats instead of two and blah blah blah it increases your chances of getting a flat in the forest well if you're going to go by that addage you might as well run a unicycle and get rid of your car that way you don't have more tires in the way any rate let's say for instance we get a flat tire here well how do we get out of the forest if it's truly going to run off the bead well we'll show you it's pretty simple go ahead and remove your cradle chain here and we can run it right around the axle we're going to say that the back tire is now flat this is just a demonstration you're going to take said chain and we're falling over well now your Tire's off the ground now you can run out on a single you're not going to run this off its bead you can do the same thing to both sides if you want to feed this trailer in over a log in a really hard spot to back into we'll repeat the same process over here all right so now both are off the ground mind you now we just changed the center of balance of this machine because we moved it forward from here to the center of this axle which takes incredible amount of weight off of the tongue so it becomes much lighter and easier to handle and wheel around all right so if you're not too good at backing up you can always do this trip on a stick while you're at it and you could position this over your log bring your machine in and connect okay let's come to the front here this is the really important part um put a lot of time effort and thought into how to make this work work to where is very strong and very safe for the end user so if you get an apparatus like this behind you I'm sure you know as well as I do you manage to flip this thing over well if this goes over and it's connected to the ball in your four-wheeler what do you think is going to happen you're going to roll and it's going to be bad so what did we do here we created a swiveling tongue this is greaseable here you go your grease zert this is a 1-in grade 8 shaft passes all the way through Doom tubing that's quarter wall thickness 3/8 here in the gusset plate you can see you have a handle and then obviously your power wire that is going to run your winch and it'll connect to back to your four-wheeler beautiful so that takes the safety factor and uh UPS it a lot you know in the initial phases and testing I was doing some really kind of radical and dumb stuff right well that's R&D driving as fast as I could and trying to flip my trailer I never was actually successful but it's possible and I know there's guys out there that will take bigger chances than me so this is for that oh factor and it should keep you out of Harm's Way we'll demonstrate that later I'll go ahead and throw this thing over on its side down in the pasture so this takes us to the next part this machine does not come with log Tong well we opted not to do that because everybody's needs for logging tongs and sizes are very very different so you might say well one size fits all but that's not been my experience so what I got here is I have a set of 25 in and 18in I find I use these more but when you need these you just got to have them as you can see here's your throat it'll handle up to almost a 31 in log we call it 30 because you're going to need a little wiggle room obviously you can also see here we have deflectors so when you're backing in and if your guide liming the log which is probably you didn't limit too well well you don't have a sharp a here that just slams into and stops you we figured that one out real fast first limb stub that I backed into and it stopped me dead in my tracks well we added those so as you can see we have almost triple the effective thickness of that 5/8 plate that 5/8 plate has zero deflection zero measured deflection when it's being operated so major Improvement 3/8 plate 3/8 tubing this is 3in pipe and then let's look up in here Tristan last but not least we have an anchoring point for a shackle here you can run a snatch block on here to take some load off of your winch if you need to all right you can see our wire passes through our upper tube comes out all the way to the front so it's direct shot no slices let's get this thing hooked up and uh we're going to go grab a lot so we're here on the trail for demonstration purposes it's kind of hard out in the brush it's hot as hell and we're getting covered in tick so we're going to be babies and do it right here and it'll be a lot easier to explain and show this is an old southern yellow pine log uh it was cut about a year and a half ago so it has lost the moisture content but it's still very heavy I can assure you we've been using this through the R&D process this is one of our sacrifice our dirty logs we drug this thing and beat it and everything everything else so really yeah all right so we're about 22 in by 24 it's a really balanced log uh we use this so we wouldn't be cherry-picking during the design of something that was extremely front heavy giving us a skewed idea of actually how this would work so we wanted the log to be balanced so we couldn't say oh yeah we can carry 24t logs because the butt was this big and the top was that big right all right here we got a 7t choker slip hook and a needle now if you can't needle and feed under this and you're not going to be able to get it cuz you're on too perfectly flat of ground which I could right there and that works but if you can't we're going to show you how you would go ahead and feed that here for demonstration purposes I'm going to do a bad job of backing up as you can see it just slips [Music] over now don't let the trailer roll your leg over because it will pull four-wheeler in the trailer back as you can see so stand outside of your [Music] tires it's like 94 to million per humidity we didn't come here to listen to any wi pull that I like to just drop that in there this creates a little bit of a pendulum effect now I'm going to try first time I'm just going to pull forward I'm going to see if it's going to run up and if it won't because we lose traction of the log skids then we go to plan B that works Dandy now I'm just going to take this pen drop it in the desired hole as you get more used to this machine you'll be able to eyeball it and know where when and how which one of those holes you're going to use so there we go all right now you can see the logs off the ground up front what is that 8 10 in it's going to come up higher and I'll show you why now we go ahead and set our tongs back okay so now we're scoped out you're going to see as we start winching up it's going to drive the log forward once again standing out of the way of your wheel so you don't get run over [Applause] all right so the other way we just go ahead and stretch out our tongs hook it on the trolley cure up Dro your [Music] pen so go ahead and lift this guy up stay very clear obviously you can see these tongs are just barely holding on so we don't want to be playing with that remember never put your fingers in a pinch point area so hang your trains from underneath comes down hard on it you won't get pin PR it down you got it all right Tristan my cameraman he's going to go ahead and hold this tape let's look at the length of this log and see what we got so what we had remember is 22x 24 on average both ends of this log so we're going to call it a 23 in diameter log by 16 to long let's go drive this thing around and take it over some stuff see what happens [Music] [Music] all right we're going to demonstrate crawling over obstacles so there's an old nasty St it's a pretty big one [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all right so I'm going to dump this thing over we're going to see how that swivel on the front works I don't give myself a hernia [Music] [Music] all right folks well we appreciate you sticking around if You' like any more information go ahead and reach out to us at ww w. tick Creek ranch.com or you can always get us at our email at tick Creek Ranch 417 gmail.com so that's it from us here at te Creek Ranch and we'll catch you on the next one [Music] [Music]",
