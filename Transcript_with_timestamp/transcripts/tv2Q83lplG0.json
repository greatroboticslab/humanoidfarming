  "text": "today i'm going to demonstrate a simple way to install backflow prevention between the faucet and a fertigation feeder the backflow preventer or tank valve is a critical piece of the irrigation system the backflow preventer is true to its name it prevents irrigation water from re-entering or back flowing into the water supply backflow sometimes called back siphoning occurs when there is a negative pressure or pressure loss on the supply side of the irrigation system without a functioning backflow prevention there is a risk of contaminating the water supply it is important to make sure that you install the backflow preventer in the correct direction when installing it make sure to look for the manufacturer's stamped directional arrow that is located on the side of the backflip event the backflow preventer can be installed using a glue fitting as shown or as a threaded fitting depending on the model that is used the arrow is the direction of water flowing through the pipe if the backflow preventer is installed backwards then it will stop the flow of water to your field we hope this video was very useful please check out our video series to learn all the steps in installing a simple irrigation system on a small phone thank you you",
