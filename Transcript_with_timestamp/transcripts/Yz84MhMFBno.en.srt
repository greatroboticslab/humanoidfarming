1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,080
growing your own vegetables

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,760
even in the most forgiving of climates

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,120
is a challenge that many of us are all

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,519
too familiar with

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,400
but for svalbard's residents polar sun

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,480
cycles that see

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,800
months of total darkness in winter and

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,520
midnight sun in summer make conventional

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,460
farming here

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,880
near impossible

11
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,080
[Music]

12
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,359
what's happening now we're all kind of

13
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,279
disconnected and that's what i've been

14
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,920
trying to do is reconnect everybody back

15
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,000
to

16
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,640
to where the food comes from because we

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,280
all take it for granted you know

18
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,280
good morning

19
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,520
have some greens for you

20
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:49,360
some radish for you

21
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,039
and some clover uh we started to

22
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,480
plant your other one so it's once it's

23
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,520
ready then we will start to follow that

24
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,280
but for now we have

25
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,640
this so this is amazing yeah and the

26
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,520
other ones are there i can take the

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,559
voice

28
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,719
thank you thank you long travel

29
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,879
distances for food or for waste disposal

30
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,799
of almost 1 000 kilometers between the

31
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,640
svarbar city of long yibian

32
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,240
and the norwegian mainland mean that

33
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,880
residents here are some of the world's

34
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,720
highest energy consumers

35
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,119
recognising a lack of available fresh

36
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,159
local food international chef turned

37
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,159
longy been local

38
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,960
benjamin vidmar saw an opportunity to

39
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,320
change the way that food was viewed

40
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,880
so we started this in 2016.

41
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,400
and we ordered it from alaska this dome

42
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,000
and then we put it back together

43
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,759
and we had to put a lot of concrete

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,640
around the perimeter so secure to

45
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,119
concrete

46
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,360
here we focus more to the leafy greens

47
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,360
herbs we do some micro greens

48
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,399
now we have some beets there there's

49
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,600
kale yep

50
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,280
radish daikon radish so yeah we've just

51
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,600
been growing

52
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,040
what we can grow and these kind of like

53
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,560
the cold weather so we don't have to

54
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,280
warm it too much we know we don't use

55
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,560
any

56
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,600
heat inside of here it's only from the

57
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,600
sun so it can get up to 30 degrees when

58
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,680
the sun is out and it can go down to 5

59
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,360
10 degrees when the sun's not out now

60
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,000
it's about 8 degrees in here

61
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,360
and and this dome is only used in the in

62
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,080
the summertime when yeah only when we

63
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,120
have light

64
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,840
so from end of may to about end of

65
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,680
september

66
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,520
we can grow out here and then the rest

67
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,160
of the time we grow indoors

68
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,640
fantastic and leafy greens you've found

69
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,040
to be

70
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,680
the most kind of i suppose for your

71
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,440
system

72
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,280
the most kind of economically viable to

73
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,959
keep this to keep this operation running

74
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,599
yeah well the thing is it would be so

75
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,920
nice to grow tomatoes and cucumbers and

76
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,879
potatoes but we wouldn't make much money

77
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,280
from that so

78
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,080
and all of this stuff comes by flight so

79
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,760
it's very expensive

80
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,000
to buy and it doesn't transport very

81
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,840
well so so that's why we've been kind of

82
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,879
focused on that yeah

83
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,640
sure using two main facilities

84
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,840
benjamin and his team are able to grow

85
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,440
in both the summer and darker winter

86
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,680
months by working around seasonality

87
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,440
benjamin uses both indoor and outdoor

88
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,319
facilities in order to maximize his

89
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,000
productivity

90
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,400
while minimizing any waste and energy

91
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
consumption

92
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,680
so i normally just go through and open

93
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,959
everything up

94
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:10,080
this is radish the daikon radish

95
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,920
this is also more radish

96
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,360
you managing all of these and the mirror

97
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,040
because yeah

98
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,879
he's uh he's the we're the main two

99
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,959
behind i just need to water these

100
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,440
but i we're the main ones behind it so

101
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,840
like i kind of take over the greens

102
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,959
and you know keep them growing and he

103
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,120
does the delivery

104
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,120
and he also takes care of the basil

105
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,200
and things like things like composting

106
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,640
you mentioned that you're using compost

107
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,200
from yours and other businesses

108
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,400
uh have you seen it kind of rise at all

109
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,879
in that since you've been

110
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,760
i actually don't want it to rise no

111
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,920
because we don't have the

112
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,000
space or the facilities to deal with it

113
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,720
so now we only compost

114
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,599
what we deliver yeah yeah sure so when

115
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,920
this goes out

116
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,040
we take it back but if you are upscaling

117
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,560
then we would take more

118
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,640
yeah for sure we would take more because

119
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,000
we would need to but for now it's very

120
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,000
small scale

121
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,519
but the thing is we make the possibility

122
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
for our guests to compost who else is

123
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,599
doing that

124
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,319
yeah everybody else throws it down the

125
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:09,599
drain or they throw it in a garbage so

126
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,599
so it's nobody else doing that

127
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,680
so tomorrow i will take this one maybe

128
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,120
this one this one and this one and i

129
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,320
will put under the light

130
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,079
and then it takes about another three

131
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,479
days and then we can deliver it okay

132
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,160
yeah

133
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,280
what does the light do for them uh it's

134
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,280
going to turn them green because now you

135
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,520
see they're a big yellow okay

136
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,280
longy bin's busy restaurant industry has

137
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,600
absolutely welcomed a new option in

138
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,520
ben's locally produced greens

139
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,680
high-end restaurants like funkenlodge

140
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,440
now use ben's home-grown ingredients to

141
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,040
give their dishes a unique

142
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:46,320
arctic edge my name is jelena

143
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:49,360
i'm working at the svalbard

144
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,680
funken lodge for six months now

145
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,400
oh it's what you get from the ships i

146
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,720
mean

147
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,040
this is amazing yeah especially i mean

148
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,720
we are almost at the north pole yeah

149
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:03,919
so this is exclusive i would say

150
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,160
for uh for svalbard and also it's

151
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,440
sustainable and it's really cool i mean

152
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,639
you don't even have this like in

153
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,160
gothenburg where i'm from

154
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,639
yeah i mean if you don't have fresh

155
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,919
things

156
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:18,240
you can never make good food

157
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,160
according to me tastes better yeah and

158
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,880
of course i mean we grow it

159
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,800
here so it's always fresh if we order

160
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,880
from the mainland and it goes by plane

161
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,280
it's also bad for the environment and

162
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,120
also it usually just dies

163
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,520
on the way here so it's just bad and we

164
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,880
need to throw it away anyways

165
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:39,919
so it would be best for everyone and for

166
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:43,360
svalbard's restaurant in general if we

167
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:46,000
could grow as much as possible here

168
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,720
so hopefully we'll get there so i mean

169
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,720
we're on a good way

170
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,039
outside of growing vegetables ben also

171
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,199
operates tours of the local area in his

172
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,039
custom-built restaurant on wheels

173
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,960
it gives guests a unique insight into

174
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,800
his operation as well as a chance to

175
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,600
experience local foods like arctic

176
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,630
reindeer

177
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,120
paired with his very own greens

178
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:07,280
[Music]

179
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,800
yeah so it's a restaurant bus and we

180
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,400
have uh we do tours

181
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,000
we do the arctic topper tour we do

182
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,479
northern lights tour so you sit in there

183
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
you can drink wine we serve some snacks

184
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,280
and then it's the kitchen is on the side

185
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
of it so the kitchen is like a food

186
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,759
truck

187
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,759
and then the bus is like the restaurant

188
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,440
and you serve your produce and stuff

189
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,800
yeah that's the plan now we want to make

190
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,800
like a

191
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,400
set up where we grow our food we serve

192
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,440
it with our tours and yeah i can show

193
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,440
you around if you want to have a quick

194
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,720
look

195
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,680
so once we get a piece of land we will

196
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,960
park the bus we will park the kitchen we

197
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,880
will move the dome

198
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,120
set it up there we're going to buy a new

199
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,919
greenhouse that's like a hybrid system

200
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,800
that

201
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,639
it's uh in the summer it we use it has

202
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,840
like a reflective flap so we open and we

203
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,280
can use the sunlight

204
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,039
and then in the winter we close it and

205
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,960
we use lights so i don't want to use

206
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,680
electricity all year i want it to be

207
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,120
smart

208
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,039
so when we have sun we're going to use

209
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,039
sun and when we don't have sun then we

210
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,960
will use electricity

211
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,720
although it has taken ben a considerable

212
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,240
amount of time and energy to gain

213
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,080
support for his project

214
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,000
local perceptions about growing are

215
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,120
slowly changing

216
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,319
so what do you think about you think

217
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,520
it's worth trying to grow vegetables

218
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,319
here versus shipping immune from the

219
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,440
mainland

220
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,120
yeah definitely it's a

221
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,479
step in the right direction to become

222
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,400
more sustainable

223
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:28,080
so it's cool a cool thought

224
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,080
i think people also worry about the

225
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,680
environmental footprint that we

226
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,240
make who are living here would be nice

227
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,520
to reduce that

228
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,280
since we've been doing this there's been

229
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,880
so many unintended consequences now

230
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,840
everybody's trying to grow food and

231
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,440
everybody's

232
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,639
inspired to do something different and

233
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,160
they're all growing based when they're

234
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,919
all sharing pictures of it and

235
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,919
the university of tromso people came

236
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,080
here and like they're like all

237
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,680
phds and professors and this and that

238
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,120
and they came here and they said wow

239
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,479
he can do this we can do so now they

240
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,360
want to set up some growing stuff in

241
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,199
trump so they're so they're going to

242
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,599
name it after me as well so

243
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,360
this little project is inspiring so many

244
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,479
other people making people think

245
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,479
you know that it's possible you know you

246
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,479
don't have to wait for

247
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,000
what are we waiting for that's the thing

248
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,759
what are we waiting for we need to we

249
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,440
need to do it now so

250
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:27,840
that's what we're doing we're working to

251
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:27,840
do it now

252
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,680
you
