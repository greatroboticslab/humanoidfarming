  "text": "hello friends welcome to our youtube-channel simpler IV sciences we are here with the mission to spread Agri Sciences in a simplified manner among farmers students and those personals who are interested in farming and we will begin our ride from the berries focusing on how agricultural cultivation practices changed so far in our country India with the hope that it will benefit you in many ways so let's start this video and watch it till the end to learn the impact of Agriculture and spread the knowledge as much as possible among us in the agricultural cultivation history traces back to Indus Valley Civilisation and it was also evidence to be found in some places of southern India cereals shrubs fibers were domesticated crop and dog goat shape when domesticated animals to begin with conventional point technique mostly used in farming for cultivation practices in Vedic literature attic Veda describing about plumbing following irrigation in the field for cultivation of fruits and vegetables are some proven facts in form of written records of agriculture in India evidence suggests that rice and cotton were cultivated since Indus Valley day it was also reported that some archaeologists believed that rice was cultivated as domesticated crop near the ganges river banks since 6th millennium before Christ and other crops such as barley oats wheat lentil chickpea pulses millets cotton and cocoa butter sheis fruits were also grown in different parts of India plying patterns were taken from the Bronze Age and this technique was involved being drawn by two oxen fastin to the wooden cross base attached to the plough to pull together traditional agricultural implements used mostly at the time made of bronze namely sickle 101 which are still used by many farmers now bamboo sieves Witter and X more than 2,000 years ago Indian farmers begin growing many spices and sugarcane crop and spreading of sugarcane cultivation took place when Macedonian soldiers carried Reed's or tall grasses which were honey bearing on their return journey and process to produce these sugar crystals were invented by the period 500 this now as clear as it is that agriculture is the backbone of our country's economy and depending on the three factors such as climate technological development and social culture practices cultivation methods also changed quite significantly now farming at present can be of subsistence and commercial depth under subsistence type shifting cultivation which is also known as slash-and-burn is still practiced by many farmers to grow cereals and other food crops it is a system which involves shifting from one plot to another by abandoning the former after exhausting it and let it revert its natural vegetation the purpose of such kind is to allow natural replenishment of soil fertility following natural processes now this farming practice is known with different names in various regions of the country and in other countries as well for example zooming in northeastern states deeper inside this grid district and under Magna cover Island they were in multiple dish odo in anther British and in other countries like Mexico and Central America it is known as milpa Roca in Brazil and another in Indonesia even today some primitive tools like how thou sticks community Labor's on wage basis are used in agricultural practices on small batch of plants although such farming is entirely dependent on monsoon season soil fertility and other environmental conditions that favor crop growth India has three cropping seasons namely the behave and Zayn and crops are sown accordingly in different time of the year now Rabi crops such as wheat barley chickpea peas mustard they are sown in winter from October to November and harvested in summer from March to eppley and they are predominant in Indian states like Punjab Haryana Himachal Pradesh with the Pradesh Jammu and Kashmir no.3 Condor on the other hand Karif crops like rice millet maize green drum like them and so on are sown with onset of monsoon and harvested in September to October they are predominantly cultivated in states like Odisha Rajasthan Andhra Pradesh Telangana Maharashtra Tamina with spangled and Kerala the third seasons a crops like cucumber watermelon musk melon pumpkin and bitter gourd are sown in between Ravi and curry during summer for instance in February to march or March to July now Indian villages witnessed tremendous transformation of Agriculture from self-sufficient production to commercial production with extensive services through commercial farming commercial output provided by agricultural practices involved mostly about raising crops in large scales or estates and shipping of the produce to other countries for monetization thinly populated states like Tamil Nadu Punjab Haryana Gujarat have adapted the commercial farming system for plantation already and main crops grown for the purpose are with maize cotton and sugar cane so commercial farming is of two types namely intensive commercial farming which requires large amounts of capital or labor with relatively smaller areas of land and another is a tensive commercial farming which requires investment of small amounts of capital and labor with relatively large areas of land farmers of India still have skeptical views when it comes to adapting new scientific technologies to grow their crop in present situation they have grown a mixed attitude towards farming technologies which is evidenced by growing of new plant varieties alongside 30 to 50 year old varieties adjacent to the field area while owning mobile phones to check regularly about crop prices but fail to pay attention to the necessary information about best methods to grow their crop for higher yield here we can possibly interpret the reluctance of adopting new technology pointing at first that less emphasis have been given to the communication of science to the farmers second deformed ways to promote the adoption of new technology another barrier is dead sometimes farmers interest does not meet i - i with scientists or technical person soil test results for which we see varied range of prices in case of macro and micro nutrients unfortunately in most parts of the country covering mostly the rural areas the poor still indicate that approximately 45% and 26% women and men respectively are illiterate and unaware of even the basic economics all the government took step to form fine policy tool in terms of incentives or subsidies to promote new agricultural technologies in India for example higher yield seed varieties advanced instruments and developed machineries irrespective of the attempt it is associated with pros and cons as companies draw some unnecessary additional features to the product for profit maximization here in view of this all effective and more simplified scientific communication to the farmers and tweaking policies at certain level good perhaps reflects some different picture on the overall obstacles the strategies however to increase the crop yield and spread of Agriculture education could boost of the economic growth of the country in an exponential manner the new strategies if adopted may change the scenario for example use of improved seed varieties stronghold on land ownership crop rotation irrigation methods such as drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation and appropriate use of farm machinery x' improve package and practices protective measures for pathogen and insect attacks to make farming profitable increase in minimum support prices may 8 to 9 to 5 percent cost Rotem now this perhaps will trigger the indian farmers to invest more in agriculture small holder farmers with their entrepreneurial strategies could be encouraged to invest in their farms and turn their image around for agricultural growth status of the country as they own more than 80 percent of the total farming land and 50% of livestock in India but due to low produce low productivity and market pricing status they do not receive what is expected and thus discouraging fact to invest in Fernie however a market with price transparency new land leasing laws and investments in life stocks could encourage the smallholder farmers to invest with enthusiasm so presently we see there is a wave of organic food consumption to build a better health thus sustainable farming movement can set the opportunity for a bright future of agricultural cultivation all the organic movement started long back in 1921 and the pioneering work promulgated by Albert Howard who is known as a father of organic farming and his wife Gabrielle Howard when in early 1900 scientists who are seeking for solution for the side effects of the toxic chemicals entering the food supply and certainly declining the overall natural soil fertility but current era people have already realized another aware about how consumption of junk foods causing greater ill effects on their health and thus causing lifestyle diseases especially who are residing in the urban cities general awareness from national and international exposure helping people to take steps avoid such lifestyle diseases by switching into organ in deaths so certified organic foods ensuring growth of organic market under the influence of scrutiny and regulations since past few years organic farming has witnessed a tremendous development almost in every crop type due to the general awareness of the end-users for healthy foods and also environmental safety it is reported according to w-h-o the organic food market is around 37 billion dollars at present already so it is to be believed that health-conscious end-users will promote the growth of organic agriculture sector in future India so here we hope that you have enjoyed this video and the informations as we had making it and if you did be sure to give it a thumbs up and subscribe to our channel if you found it helpful you can share it with your friends and family who are interested to learn about agriculture and find value in it too and please do leave a comment below we'd love to hear from you we are open for suggestions and share any topics you want us to cover we will see you with our next video thank",
