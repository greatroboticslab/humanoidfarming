1
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:28,160
we have our next

2
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:30,599
presenter WJ I'm sorry Justin

3
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,320
seon he is a

4
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:37,559
nutritionist beef nutrition extensionist

5
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,800
at mu and he's coming to you to talk

6
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:44,719
about gracing W use in beef production

7
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,719
systems please welcome

8
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,280
Justin move that out of the

9
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:59,199
way good

10
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,399
morning and and so the uh the title of

11
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,680
my talk is related to grazing wed use

12
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:05,280
and beef production systems and and the

13
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,200
primary reason that it is related to

14
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,799
beef is because that's what I do but it

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,960
certainly is applicable to multiple

16
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:16,040
species of livestock and and we'll talk

17
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:18,159
a bit about that uh as we go forward and

18
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,840
and so just I guess a kind of the way to

19
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,000
start is what is a grazing wedge and and

20
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,960
so the grazing wedge is a concept that

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,040
was uh kind of started in the grazing

22
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,560
dairies specifically in the in the

23
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,960
southwestern part of of Missouri where

24
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:35,520
we look at our forage inventory in a

25
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,680
visual system and and so the grazing

26
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,880
wedge kind of what I would say is simply

27
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,159
explained is that this is a visual

28
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:46,360
illustration of a collection of pastures

29
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:48,040
and so I I use this as an illustration

30
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,119
and and maybe it's not a great one

31
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,040
because you might be looking to say 58

32
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:55,079
pastures this is way more than I need to

33
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,759
to kind of think about but but just stay

34
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:59,520
with me and I'll show you some more uh

35
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,520
applied examples here in a minute but

36
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,840
function what the grazing wedge does is

37
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,240
we go out and we inventory our forage

38
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,640
with something as simple as a yard stick

39
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,879
or as complex as a sonar reader on the

40
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,160
front of a four-wheeler and and so from

41
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,319
a technology standpoint you can use a

42
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,480
yard stick or a grazing stick in this

43
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:20,560
case you can use a rising plate meter uh

44
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,160
either digital or manual or you can get

45
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,519
a sonar amounted uh deal for the front

46
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,560
of your um four-wheeler and and Dr Colin

47
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:30,519
Bach one of my colleagues is is actually

48
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,480
working on being able to take pictures

49
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:35,160
using Google Earth to take forage

50
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,640
inventory and and so the technology is

51
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,200
uh fairly diverse I guess is the way I

52
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:43,000
would say it but the grazing wedge gives

53
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,840
us a visual picture of our forage

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,640
inventory and and so it's it's kind of a

55
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:54,040
um u a stoplight system in that once our

56
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,680
our pasture in this case turns red we've

57
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,640
gotten to the point where that pasture

58
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,319
from a quality standpoint is too mature

59
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,720
and if we keep our pasture gure in the

60
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:06,080
green area then we have optimized forage

61
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,680
quality and then when we get it into the

62
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,159
yellow that is the point where we have

63
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,640
overgrazed it and that's based off of

64
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:18,000
measurements that we're taking as

65
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:19,840
infrequently as uh once a month ideally

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,519
what we would like to see is about every

67
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,200
10 to 14 days and so a bit of background

68
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:27,200
as it relates to this program is it it's

69
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,280
part of a sustainable agriculture

70
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,599
research and education grant research

71
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,519
and educ ation specifically and we have

72
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,159
producer Cooperators that collected a

73
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,840
lot of this data and we've we've

74
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:40,720
developed these producer groups that are

75
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,519
centered around these producers that use

76
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,799
their forage growth data as kind of

77
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:47,239
indicator values throughout the grazing

78
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,439
season I'll show you that in a minute

79
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:52,120
okay and so the the idea behind the the

80
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:54,480
grazing wedge is OB objective pasture

81
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,280
Management in that many people have

82
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,360
implemented rotational grazing systems

83
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,239
but many times we rotate through those

84
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,720
systems systems in a pattern that maybe

85
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:06,040
is convenient but not best from a forage

86
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,319
management standpoint do we always start

87
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,079
with south facing slopes in the early in

88
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,159
the season or do we start with the one

89
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:14,360
that's closest to the barn and so this

90
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:17,519
allows us to look at pasture from a

91
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,919
standpoint of growth and seasonal growth

92
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,840
and try to best utilize it we measure

93
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:25,080
and monitor that over the uh over the

94
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:27,360
the entire pure season but really what

95
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,160
we found through this work with the with

96
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,400
the producers is that first pass through

97
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,120
the past sets it for the rest of the

98
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:36,800
year if you do a good job of pasture

99
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,680
Management in May the rest of the year

100
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,320
is very easy or specifically late April

101
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,039
I should say but uh once once that

102
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,039
reproductive plant portion has been

103
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:49,080
taken off at the beginning the pasture

104
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:50,440
is kind of set for the rest of the year

105
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,360
and so if you want to think about that

106
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,280
from an applied standpoint what's the

107
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:58,120
best pasture that you'll see all year

108
00:04:54,280 --> 00:05:01,520
long it was largely cut as hay right

109
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:04,080
uniformly grazed in theory and and so

110
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,680
that regrowth we don't have any stems or

111
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,440
or reproductive tillers that we see

112
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,160
later on in the season so how do we set

113
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,919
up a management system that addresses

114
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,800
that goal at the end the other thing is

115
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:16,680
it helps us to address which forage

116
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,720
should we use next and and this I

117
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,759
apologize doesn't show up real well with

118
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,120
the amount of light but but one of the

119
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:25,720
things to think about is if you go

120
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,400
through and and graze a system and and

121
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,840
let's say you have an eight pasture

122
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:32,400
system right and and so you've set up

123
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,360
some sort of grazing system early in the

124
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,199
spring you'll go through and and graze a

125
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,720
pasture and and about miday it looks

126
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,800
really good right it looks really good

127
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,560
it's been nothing but regrowth and then

128
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,680
you have some pasture that looks similar

129
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:48,039
to this over here where you start to see

130
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,919
reproductive uh or seed heads start to

131
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:52,280
produce and and so you say well I need

132
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,720
to go graze this because I haven't been

133
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,240
there yet right that's that's the next

134
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,600
pasture to go to and I haven't been

135
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,520
there yet but in reality what I want we

136
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,720
used the grazing wedge just to challenge

137
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,840
producers to stay this is the part of

138
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,160
the farm that we should be making hay on

139
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,560
because it's already too mature for the

140
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,680
growing stock that we have in place and

141
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,560
this is ideal in terms of forage quality

142
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,280
and once forage goes bad or gets mature

143
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,160
goes to the red part on the grazing

144
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:23,000
wedge it's already

145
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,280
mature it'll take the cattle longer to

146
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,800
get through this more mature material

147
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,919
and in the end this stuff starts to get

148
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,479
overgrown and so from a management

149
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,120
standpoint that's part of the question

150
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:35,639
that we try to address with a grazing

151
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,280
wedge and so when we started this is uh

152
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:41,400
Denny and Mary Beth poges grazing wedge

153
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:43,680
that uh we started in 2010 and this was

154
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,880
uh the 23rd of May and this is kind of

155
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,599
the visual image that when you when you

156
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:51,120
take those forage quality measurement or

157
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:54,120
those forage inventory measurements you

158
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,080
get a visual display of your pasture and

159
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,520
so these are each of their pastures that

160
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,160
are labeled and and so what we see in a

161
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:03,879
lot of beef Enterprise systems is we we

162
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:07,199
start to push a lot of forage ahead into

163
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:09,360
the summer right and and so beef systems

164
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,520
are inherently more tolerant of poorer

165
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,160
quality forage the biggest question that

166
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,759
we get from beef producers is I need

167
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:18,039
more forage it's not forage quality that

168
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,879
we run out of I need more forage this

169
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:22,919
year probably more so than ever and so

170
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:26,120
the Dare or the grazing wedge was

171
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:28,919
actually started in the dairy system and

172
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:31,440
the dairy system they're highly aware of

173
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:33,039
forage quality and so one of the things

174
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,599
that we set out to do was just try to

175
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,479
see how this worked with a beef

176
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:39,759
production model and one of the first

177
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:42,280
things that we observed was that we see

178
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,319
a lot of our beef producers maintain a

179
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:48,800
lot more forage specifically at this

180
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:51,639
3500 lbs and of uh of growth more so

181
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,360
than our Dairy who much like it to be

182
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:56,800
under 3,000 lb more about

183
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,319
2750 and and so to think to put that in

184
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,639
a practical term you want forage in a

185
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:03,879
beef production system to be about this

186
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:05,759
the height of the eyeball on the cow

187
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:09,120
that's when her head's down right when

188
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:11,960
her head is down eyeball high is a good

189
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,560
forage availability and quality uh

190
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,440
guideline and if you can see her nose

191
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,120
when her head is down you're in this

192
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:21,560
yellow portion over here at overg grazed

193
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,680
okay uh good Lord put a grazing stick on

194
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,639
every cow between the eyeball in the

195
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,759
nose Jim garish is actually credited

196
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:30,199
with that concept but we're trying to

197
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,400
put that on a visual perspective

198
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:33,519
from a standpoint of how we can

199
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,399
inventory our pastures and so the

200
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,479
critical points in a grazing wedge this

201
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:40,680
is the the 4 Farms grazing wedge on in

202
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,440
the towards the end of June this year

203
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,720
and what we want to do from a fertilizer

204
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,640
and management standpoint is ideally we

205
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,959
have a pasture that's being staged right

206
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:52,839
along right when we get to the point

207
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:55,760
where our pastures are all flat we we

208
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:58,480
have a forid shortage coming and so this

209
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,959
visual illustration that we we send out

210
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,880
to these producers producers every two

211
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:04,720
weeks or the producers submit every two

212
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:07,680
weeks tells them that when they get to

213
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,399
pasture 5 on a 21-day rotation if it

214
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,519
falls below this line you need to start

215
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,720
thinking about some sort of forage

216
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:18,279
management system to meet the deficiency

217
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,079
right and so this year it was great to

218
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:22,040
kind of look at we started it wasn't

219
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:23,800
great I'm I'm not glad we had a drought

220
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,399
okay but it Illustrated the

221
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,560
appropriateness of this where we start

222
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,079
to

223
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:34,320
see we start to see these uh pasture

224
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:37,440
levels turning flat and we can start to

225
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:40,160
make management decisions before hey

226
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,839
prices get to $100 a ton and so it helps

227
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,640
us from an inventory management

228
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,920
standpoint and what we want to do is

229
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,640
maintain forage quality here and make

230
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,440
sure we don't overg graze it on the

231
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,760
other end and so that's what we call the

232
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,880
critical points as we think about

233
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,120
interpreting the grazing wedge here's

234
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,399
kind of how you can think about this is

235
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,160
that when it's underneath the line I'm

236
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,519
setting myself up for a forage

237
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,240
deficiency going forward right if I can

238
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:06,519
keep it above the line I've got enough

239
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:10,120
forage that it's right at the eyeball

240
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:11,880
high of the cow and this 1500 Line This

241
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,680
is like thinking about how many bales of

242
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:17,480
hay you have functionally in that I can

243
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:20,320
graze it down to 1500 lb of dry matter

244
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:22,800
and everything above it is forage on the

245
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,360
stump and so it allows us to start

246
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,200
calculating how much forage we have I

247
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,160
visited with our livestock specialist

248
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,399
this morning and this is something that

249
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:33,120
going to go out and do right now this is

250
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:34,760
the ideal time to go out and measure

251
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,839
your forage CU it's not going to grow

252
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,399
anymore the amount of forage that you

253
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:41,440
have right now is what you're going to

254
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,839
have available and so I can calculate

255
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,639
how many days of forage I have out there

256
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,399
and start to uh balance my

257
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:50,880
supplementation needs going forward

258
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,800
whether that's a supplement or hay

259
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,200
fundamental concept as it relates to the

260
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,040
grazing wedge is let's graze at to 1,400

261
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,920
lb of dry matter per acre on the first

262
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:04,560
pass okay and and so that is a very

263
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:07,200
tight system it it is extremely tight

264
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,639
from a from a 4 height standpoint but

265
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,279
that sets our pasture up just like

266
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:13,600
running a hay Bine across that field and

267
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:16,279
and the regrowth is going to be

268
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,720
vegetative for the rest of the summer

269
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:19,800
okay one of the things that we really

270
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:23,160
struggle with is we have non-uniform

271
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,560
grazing equals nonuniform regrowth and

272
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,959
you've observed this out in the past

273
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:31,279
years I I um I would assume is that

274
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:33,760
around manure piles or urine spots we

275
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:36,040
see this tall forage that those cattle

276
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,120
never come back to and it's not because

277
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:40,200
it's the manure pile per se but late in

278
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,880
the season this is mature and they've

279
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,079
got other vegetative forage to eat the

280
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,480
rest of the year and so we want those

281
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:49,800
cattle to be very aggressive the first

282
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:52,200
pass through when the forage is very

283
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,320
good and the manure piles are generally

284
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,720
fairly loose and then we set up the

285
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,600
season or set it up uh for the rest of

286
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,639
the season this is some of the forage

287
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,200
quality that we've observed in these

288
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,959
grazing wedge systems and so I I like to

289
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,720
show this line This is crude protein and

290
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:10,560
the crude protein requirement of the

291
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:13,000
beef cows right about here okay and so

292
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,639
in terms of protein content management

293
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,519
under this system provides more than

294
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,279
adequate protein to those cows but maybe

295
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,519
more importantly what we looked at is

296
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:24,839
what is the fiber content of that forage

297
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:26,160
and so from a from a productive

298
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:29,880
standpoint what I want you to think

299
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:33,839
about is a high bar on this chart is bad

300
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:37,519
okay a high bar is fiber and fiber is is

301
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:39,399
not highly digestible and a low bar here

302
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,880
is indigestibility

303
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:43,639
so the best way to illustrate this is

304
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,920
what we observed is something that we

305
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:47,880
we've uh told producers for a long time

306
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,120
is if you want to maximize the Harvest

307
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,680
of indigestible forage make your hay in

308
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:55,519
July and the forage samples that we took

309
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:57,560
under this system certify that is that

310
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,639
the forage is not as digestible in July

311
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:02,240
and August and we produce a high amount

312
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:05,399
of fiber so F

313
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,399
Focus excess forage harvest in April May

314
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:10,440
and June and because we've used the

315
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:12,560
grazing wedge we know what our forage

316
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:15,199
inventory is going forward as well as a

317
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,519
from a growth rate standpoint and and so

318
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:19,480
from a second pass forage standpoint we

319
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,399
think about how can we best utilize the

320
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,839
forage if I say I want you to graze it

321
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,399
to 3 in tall and you say that's pretty

322
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:28,959
poor quality forage for a lactating cow

323
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:30,959
and so what we want you to think about

324
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,600
is well is there some replacement heers

325
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,360
that could utilize that poor quality

326
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,800
forage is there some dry cows that could

327
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:39,560
utilize this poor quality forage to get

328
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,519
it down to that, 1400 lb of dry

329
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:44,399
matter and so I I like to show pictures

330
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:46,279
of these are the groups of cattle or

331
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,959
livestock that most people have standing

332
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:51,079
around we have some late gestation

333
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:53,519
cattle we have some early lactation

334
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:55,440
cattle we have some cattle that are

335
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,320
ready to be weaned and then we have a

336
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,079
group of growing cattle or replacement

337
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,120
heers and if you think about not a

338
00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:03,800
prioritization standpoint and that how

339
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,800
do we match our forage grazing wedge to

340
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,480
our cattle is that something that is

341
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:10,160
pregnant and getting ready to Cal or

342
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:12,320
lamb or kid whatever it is they have

343
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,079
first priority of forage they get the

344
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,399
first bite okay after that it's the

345
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:19,279
lactating animal because if she doesn't

346
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,959
have adequate condition at cing you'll

347
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,839
never add condition to her unless you

348
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:26,440
start carrying a feed bucket and so we

349
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:29,720
we educated our producers such that we

350
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:31,440
want these cows to get the green forest

351
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,279
and then if we have some red Forge that

352
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,199
we're not going to bail these are the

353
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,240
type of cattle that we want to use that

354
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:40,120
on because they have lower nutrient

355
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:43,199
requirements so as you prioritize

356
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:45,560
gestating cataler first early lactation

357
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,600
cater second and these two groups are

358
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:50,079
fairly flexible depending on your

359
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,880
production goals and and so that was

360
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:54,399
part of our educational component was

361
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:57,279
matching it to the uh Forge

362
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:59,199
Supply I like to show this in that if

363
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,800
you bush hog pastures during the month

364
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,759
of July that's not a product of the

365
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:07,079
month of July it's a product of forage

366
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:09,160
Management in April and May and that if

367
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:13,199
if you're if you're cleaning up pastures

368
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:14,519
in in uh May or in July sorry many times

369
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:17,519
what has happened is that pasture got

370
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:20,360
away from you in May and and if we can

371
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,959
graze it appropriately April and May

372
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,440
really focus our forage management

373
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:26,240
efforts using these tools it it

374
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,639
minimizes the amount of fuel and time

375
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,279
that we have to spend cleaning up uh

376
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:33,279
raising mistak so to speak the other

377
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:37,279
thing that this uh system allows us to

378
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:39,639
do and and I realize of one of the as a

379
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,920
producer no one likes keeping records

380
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:44,959
okay that's like the the number 20th

381
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:47,360
thing that people like to do and so by

382
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:50,000
entering these yield numbers you can

383
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,720
actually determine we actually determine

384
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,720
in the grazing wedge what the pasture

385
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,319
yielded in grazable forage we look at it

386
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:00,240
over time in terms of forage

387
00:15:57,319 --> 00:16:03,639
disappearance and so this is um Denny

388
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:07,959
Po's pasture 2012 they've harvested

389
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:10,440
anywhere from 2 to 3 tons per acre off

390
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:12,360
of those pastures and that's based off

391
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,920
of forage measurements that he's taken

392
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:18,040
throughout the season every 14 to 21

393
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:21,399
days and that allows us to see that 5B

394
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:24,600
and 4C are are maybe not as productive

395
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:27,000
as 10e and so if I have to prioritize my

396
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,199
fertilizer or I'm going to apply manure

397
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,240
or something along those lines

398
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:35,000
these are the two pastures that are

399
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:36,600
perhaps most in need or I know that

400
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
there's more water holding capacity

401
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,639
maybe in 10e maybe that's in the bottom

402
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,600
and so I'm going to put a higher level

403
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,920
of nitrogen there because I know I get a

404
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,920
response and so this allows us to look

405
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:50,079
at our pastures objectively and see

406
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,800
actually which pastures green up earlier

407
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:55,079
in the spring as well without keeping

408
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:57,519
records just as an inventory management

409
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:59,360
standpoint okay and uh this may be a

410
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,000
little small for those of VI in the back

411
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,640
but at the end of the year we also print

412
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,760
out a summary report and and so this is

413
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,799
he uh has started taking uh taken

414
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,480
measurements the 31st of March and took

415
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:13,959
them all the way up to the 20th of

416
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:16,480
October and this is 2012 and this is

417
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:18,199
estimated growth rate and so one of the

418
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,839
things I like to visit with producers

419
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:23,959
that we've shown from this data is we'll

420
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:26,919
grow three cows worth of feet a day the

421
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:29,559
end of April and early May on one acre

422
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:32,480
of ground and that the amount of feed

423
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:34,880
that comes out early April and or late

424
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,600
April and early may we can't stock for

425
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,520
that there's no way we can stock to

426
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,360
consume that amount of forage in a short

427
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,559
period of time and so what we look at as

428
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,559
we get down here into June and July

429
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:49,000
we're growing four pounds of feed per

430
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:51,559
acre per day okay and that's not a

431
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,720
surprise but normally we would see this

432
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:58,159
in the 25 to 30 lb range but this was

433
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:00,240
2012 and so it allows us to go back and

434
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:02,720
say what was our pre grazing and

435
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,799
postgrazing cover and and what hases

436
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,480
that done to the long-term growth rate

437
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:09,200
or or pasture

438
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:12,559
health and can we maintain an average

439
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,960
pasture cover around 2,300 lb and so

440
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:17,360
it's a it's a recordkeeping system that

441
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,760
is a product of an inventory management

442
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,400
if we take those measurements this is

443
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:25,440
all generated for you and you can look

444
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,360
at your grazing season at uh at the end

445
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,880
of the year and see what kind of growth

446
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,799
rates you you received on each of these

447
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,880
pastures and and the other thing that

448
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:37,039
kind of indicates is what we call the

449
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,960
key indicators and and this is where

450
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:41,039
each of these producers who are kind of

451
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,679
what I call our Sentinel producers

452
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,679
they're posted on the internet you can

453
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:47,280
look and I've shown the website several

454
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:49,440
times but you can see where they're at

455
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,080
relative to the state and what's going

456
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,679
on and so in this case we see that we've

457
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,840
got beef stalker cattle on the pasture

458
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:59,080
the forage growth rates about 12 pounds

459
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:01,440
an acre per day

460
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:05,559
and those stalker cattle are being fed 7

461
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:08,360
and 3/4 of a pound of uh of grain or a

462
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:10,000
pound of hay sorry and critical issues

463
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,600
they make notes and so you can kind of

464
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,440
see what's going on throughout the state

465
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,320
and this one's weed control is working

466
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:19,240
well one and A4 inches of rain yesterday

467
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,840
total rain since the end of April 1.75

468
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:24,120
in and so the producers are commenting

469
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,480
on what they're seeing locally and

470
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:29,280
allows us to kind of use those as a as a

471
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,679
as a guideline to what's going going out

472
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,960
going on out in the state and as you

473
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,400
find it if if you're interested in

474
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,880
joining these groups it allows people to

475
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,440
kind of say here's an indicator may not

476
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:44,280
be current for me but it allows me to

477
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:47,320
know what's going on relative to other

478
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:49,440
locations this is the the one uh example

479
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,880
that I think probably has the most value

480
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,320
that we learn through working with

481
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,159
producers is the fall inventory and that

482
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,600
there's nothing worse than realizing

483
00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:01,000
that you don't have enough hay about the

484
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,440
middle of February because there's not a

485
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,960
lot of hay being produced in the middle

486
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,600
of February and everybody else has

487
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,960
realized that same thing at about that

488
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,760
time and so from a cost standpoint as we

489
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,280
went through the financial analysis of

490
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:15,520
these operations is that how can I

491
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:18,280
predict the amount of grazing days that

492
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,440
I've got before I'm going to have to

493
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:23,400
feed hay and then how much of that hay

494
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:25,840
am I going to use kind of going forward

495
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:28,520
and and so this is just a label of a

496
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,280
bunch of pastures and this is the amount

497
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,960
of dry matter that's available on the

498
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:35,840
stump and and and so this is the amount

499
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,440
of forage this is the amount of acres in

500
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,480
each of those paddocks and then it

501
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,880
calculates tons of feed available in

502
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,559
each of those pastures and so you take

503
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,679
how many cows you've got and how many

504
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:48,440
tons of feed and then you can look at

505
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:51,240
your hay Supply and match our forage

506
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:53,280
availability with our intake hopefully

507
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:55,799
such that you get to the point where as

508
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,720
an inventory management tool inventory

509
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:59,440
is one of the biggest challenges we face

510
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,320
is that I don't want to spend more money

511
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,799
than I have to because it's tied up in

512
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:05,799
the hay right all year long until I need

513
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:08,360
it again but I certainly don't want to

514
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:10,880
have to pay two times for the hay

515
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:13,520
because I ran short at the worst

516
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,480
possible time of year and so we use this

517
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,679
fall inventory in that as as something I

518
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,120
would have you take home today is if

519
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:21,799
you're not interested in the grazing

520
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:24,440
wedge at all throughout the growing

521
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:26,760
season the fall inventory component is

522
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:29,559
as useful as anything to plan your

523
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:31,640
winter feed needs

524
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:33,480
and and so our feed and forage budgeting

525
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,640
is essentially our stocking rate which

526
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:38,240
is pounds of cattle times a percent body

527
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:40,039
weight intake and then the utilization

528
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,360
rate is what percentage your forage is

529
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:43,760
used and during the growing season we're

530
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:46,799
hoping that that's going to be somewhere

531
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:49,320
in the 50 to 70% range in the dormant

532
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:50,320
season it's a lot closer to 70% because

533
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,120
they're going to they're going to

534
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,039
utilize that we don't get a lot of

535
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:56,640
regrowth and then how long can I graze

536
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:59,760
you know if you if you think you've got

537
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,039
60 days of stockpile forage on hand that

538
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,559
tells you you know about when you're

539
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:05,880
going to start feeding hay and and it

540
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:08,080
just allows you to better manage your

541
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:11,360
inventory and if you know that you have

542
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,080
60 days of stockpiled forage and I've

543
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,760
shown you kind of what the quality

544
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:17,440
results are under that management system

545
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,679
we're encouraging producers to think

546
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:25,640
about that stockpile as a supplement as

547
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:28,039
opposed to a um total diet intake and

548
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:30,880
and so I explained that a bit in that

549
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:32,240
people don't like buying feed many times

550
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,919
but what we haven't thought about

551
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,799
stockpile is as supplemental feed I'm

552
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:39,960
going to put hay out but I'm going to

553
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:42,480
strip graze a certain amount of forage

554
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,360
so that that is the supplemental feed

555
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,720
and and I can strip graze that because

556
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,279
one of the first things that the

557
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:50,919
producers will tell me as it relates to

558
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:53,679
stockpiles like Justin if I had 70 more

559
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:55,880
acres to stockpile I'd have more cows

560
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,720
and that's a that's a valid statement

561
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,200
but what I encourage people to do from

562
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:02,520
an inventory standpoint is let's think

563
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,640
about stockpiling some forage or even

564
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,799
just using our fall growth most

565
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,600
effectively by saying you know what I'm

566
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:10,320
going to strip graze this off as a

567
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:13,080
supplement I'm going to give you three

568
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,600
days worth of supplemental grass and it

569
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:17,440
it supplements our poor quality forage

570
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,640
so the the biggest thing I wanted you to

571
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,960
take away with is the grazing wedge

572
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:24,279
gives you an opportunity to look at how

573
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:26,559
you manage your grats from an inventory

574
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:28,799
standpoint what we've kind of found

575
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:31,960
through our visiting with producers is

576
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:34,039
they do this for about two maybe 3 years

577
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,159
and after that they get a pretty visual

578
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:37,960
assessment of that system and they don't

579
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,720
go out and maybe measure as much as they

580
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,039
would normally but they'll go out and do

581
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,720
that one measurement in the fall and and

582
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:45,960
so it's kind of a growing process to

583
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:49,240
learn how the forage quality is best

584
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:53,679
managed relative to yield so with that

585
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:53,679
I'll uh take any questions yes

586
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:00,360
sir may sorry we have

587
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:11,600
to you talked about

588
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:14,760
um mowing the pasture in in May

589
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,120
um could you hold off till June and bail

590
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,760
it

591
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:21,400
up you where you say it gets away from

592
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,400
you could

593
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,480
you so so relative to forage management

594
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,760
one of the things that we we look for is

595
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,480
that we're all trying to capture as much

596
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:36,120
Sunshine as we can right our goal is to

597
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:38,080
capture Sunshine we have soil and we

598
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:40,279
have a photosynthetic leaf and how do we

599
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,360
capture sunshine and so one of the

600
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:44,360
challenges with letting that fore grow

601
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:46,840
and get further mature is it starts to

602
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,919
shade itself right and so if you think

603
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:51,480
about where does grass not grow well

604
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:53,520
under trees and so when it sends up a

605
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:56,200
reproductive tiller or seed head it

606
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,399
starts to shade the lower leaves and and

607
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,440
the Dairy Producers have have gone to

608
00:24:58,399 --> 00:25:01,960
that uh three leaf grazing system

609
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,840
there's only three live leaves on a

610
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,840
Fescue plant the fourth one starts to

611
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,559
die I will answer your question I'm just

612
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,520
going through some background okay and

613
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,960
and so one of the things we want to do

614
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:14,919
is the sooner we can stop reproductive

615
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,080
growth in that it shoots up one

616
00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:20,080
reproductive tiller okay one seed head

617
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,039
and once that's cut off everything else

618
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:25,720
is regrowth right and regrowth is our

619
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:29,200
quality and so we're very aggressive at

620
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:31,760
addressing that early on so that the

621
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,240
sooner that we Harvest it the sooner it

622
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,399
can start regrowing we have more

623
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:38,200
moisture and cooler temperatures if we

624
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:40,240
wait until June to go in and and take

625
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,240
that closer then what we have is we

626
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:45,480
don't have a lot of water available for

627
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:48,640
rapid recovery and it's hotter when you

628
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:50,480
mow pasture in the spring okay if you go

629
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,399
in and hay pasture in the spring early

630
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:55,120
in the spring like within 2 days it's

631
00:25:53,399 --> 00:25:57,120
it'll have a leaf out there like that

632
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,159
youve when you get it off there you see

633
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,559
that leaf that sticks out it's very

634
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:03,799
quick in terms of its regrowth what

635
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:08,559
we're trying to avoid is the shading as

636
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:08,559
much as anything and that as it gets go

637
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:14,440
ahead yeah

638
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:21,200
so baage is their best option or or

639
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,559
stock such that so one of the you know

640
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,720
there's a there are a number of people

641
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:26,480
that are what I call Hay haters right

642
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,840
they think hay is the bane of of a

643
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,600
pasture system and so one of the things

644
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:32,399
we think about is on a fall caving

645
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,840
system we keep those cavves around to

646
00:26:32,399 --> 00:26:37,720
help us manage that excess inventory of

647
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:40,320
forage and then we sell those calves in

648
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:42,480
June and and that relieves the amount of

649
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,760
stocking rate such that a cows can go

650
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:48,159
through the summer that's one option if

651
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:52,559
you can't make hay in May what i bage is

652
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,559
our best option and where we can make it

653
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:57,919
wet think they bags anym you got buy one

654
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:00,919
of bagging Mach yeah got to have a

655
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,919
wrapper

656
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:10,440
yeah no you can not you might try that

657
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,440
but it won't be very

658
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:18,200
successful well and and and so from

659
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:20,520
a yeah those are hard to try do that as

660
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:23,880
well but that's where you know maybe

661
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:25,720
it's even a custom deal or manage your

662
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,080
stocking rate stocking rate being the

663
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:31,559
big one in that how do I match the

664
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:33,840
forage that I have and most people you

665
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:36,120
know stocking rate is the number one

666
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:39,720
factor influencing the success of of a

667
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:44,120
pasture system is that do you stack for

668
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:47,440
2012 stack stock for 2012 or do you

669
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:49,440
stock for 2008 one of the wetest years

670
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,039
that we've had and and the question is

671
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,679
is it it depends and so how do I build

672
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:56,760
flexibility into that system and what we

673
00:27:54,679 --> 00:27:59,240
found is many producers don't know how

674
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:01,399
much forage they they can grow under a

675
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:04,159
management system this gives us the

676
00:28:01,399 --> 00:28:06,600
opportunity to look at that as a uh

677
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,519
forage growth rate and then we can start

678
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,760
to put an animal system on it that's

679
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:10,760
well
