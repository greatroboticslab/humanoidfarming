1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,959
what if one Zone on your sprinkler

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,460
system isn't coming on or isn't shutting

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:08,099
off but the rest of your system's

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,260
working okay could be your valve could

5
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:13,080
be your controller or it could be your

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,940
wiring how do you tell which today we're

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,580
going to help you troubleshoot your

8
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:20,160
malfunctioning Zone Dwayne Smith here

9
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,910
your irrigation product specialist let's

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,989
get to it

11
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,989
[Music]

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,199
in order to properly troubleshoot some

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,120
of the electrical components you will

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,579
either need a solenoid activator

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,860
chatterer or you could use a Multimeter

16
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,140
also called a volt meter for this video

17
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,960
we will be using the Pro 50 activator

18
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,579
chatter by Armada an activator is a

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,680
tester that's specifically designed for

20
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,899
irrigation and it makes this task much

21
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,399
simpler we have an almost identical

22
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,160
video to this one where we go through

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,899
the same process using a volt meter if

24
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,360
you don't have access to an activator

25
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,399
cheddar go and check out the other video

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,219
that uses the multimeter so let's start

27
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,559
troubleshooting problem one a zone won't

28
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:07,680
stop running even when the controller is

29
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,479
set to stop watering if the watering is

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,100
definitely off at the controller then

31
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,560
this kind of issue is something that

32
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,020
would probably not be caused by a faulty

33
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,000
controller it's nearly certain that's a

34
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,640
valve issue let's talk about what that

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,619
looks like if your Zone should not be on

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,659
but the sprinklers in that zone are on

37
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:26,220
or they're sort of on maybe they've got

38
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:28,200
water dribbling from the top of several

39
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,299
heads or if you few heads are popping up

40
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,820
and not just for a few minutes after the

41
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,380
Zone shuts off it's happening

42
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:37,079
continuously then the valve for that

43
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,820
zone is not closing all the way so in

44
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:42,180
that case you're going to have to find

45
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:44,340
and replace the bow problem two one zone

46
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,500
isn't coming on all the way that may

47
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,659
look like several heads not popping up

48
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,939
within the Zone perhaps none of them are

49
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,220
but there's water seeping from the top

50
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:56,159
of some of the heads then most likely

51
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:58,380
your valve isn't opening all the way if

52
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,659
that's the case you're going to need to

53
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,880
find and replace that valve although

54
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:05,340
another possibility is that you've got a

55
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,920
broken pipe you'll almost certainly have

56
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,840
a wet mushy spot in the yard and maybe

57
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,760
even a puddle you'll need to turn off

58
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,099
the water at the back flow or water

59
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,819
meter and then repair that brake problem

60
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:19,560
three one zone won't come on at all this

61
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:22,140
is the most difficult problem to

62
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,060
diagnose I have seen one case where the

63
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,400
customer's module was not properly

64
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,040
seated and there was an error code on

65
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,140
the control roller if you have a modular

66
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,500
controller make sure that the module is

67
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:36,360
inserted properly and locked into place

68
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:38,160
also make sure it's not a programming

69
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,900
error go through the program to

70
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,420
determine that the zone is scheduled to

71
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,459
run and for how long you can run a

72
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,920
manual cycle and Skip ahead to that zone

73
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:49,019
most controllers will have some sort of

74
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,700
indicator on the screen to show that The

75
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:52,800
Zone should be on

76
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,360
if the controller is showing that the

77
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,400
Zone should be running but the

78
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,980
sprinklers in that zone are not coming

79
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,800
on at all this could be a problem with

80
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:04,080
the controller itself the wiring between

81
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,300
the controller and the valve or the

82
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,220
solenoid on the valve we'll need to do

83
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,500
some electrical troubleshooting

84
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:13,560
let's talk briefly about what happens

85
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,900
when a controller activates a valve to

86
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,239
activate a Zone the controller sends 24

87
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,580
volts of electricity through a lead wire

88
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,739
to the solenoid on the valve the

89
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:25,680
solenoid is connected to both the lead

90
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:27,959
wire and to a common wire the common

91
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,659
wire is also connected to all the valves

92
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,700
in your system and heads back to the

93
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:35,040
controller that completes the circuit

94
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,900
when the solenoid is activated it opens

95
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,120
up the valve sending water to the

96
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,459
sprinklers so let's check to see if the

97
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,099
controller is working properly grab your

98
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:46,980
Pro 50 hit the power button you should

99
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:49,440
see this screen this is a 24 volt system

100
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:51,599
this is only going to work on a regular

101
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,819
controller not a battery operated one

102
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,819
I'm going to hit the arrow key to the

103
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:59,879
right to indicate 24 volts now I've got

104
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:03,120
this screen I'm testing for vac so I hit

105
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:05,760
the F3 key under vac I'm going to put

106
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,980
one clip on the common and one on the

107
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,980
Zone which I'm testing start a manual

108
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:14,459
cycle for that zone you're testing

109
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:17,040
and I should see around 24 volts in this

110
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:19,079
case it's a little over It's Not Unusual

111
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,720
there will be some voltage loss in the

112
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,820
wiring depending on how long your wiring

113
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,040
is to the valve and the gauge of the

114
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:28,380
wire so a little extra juice here at the

115
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,780
terminals not a bad thing at all this

116
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,940
terminal is definitely working if the

117
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:35,040
terminal is not working that means your

118
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:37,020
controller is malfunctioning or if you

119
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,240
have a modular controller it could just

120
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:41,280
be that the module is bad you could try

121
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,440
replacing that module if you have

122
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,060
another terminal that's not being used

123
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,680
you could switch the wire from the

124
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,680
non-working Zone to the available

125
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:52,680
terminal and reprogram the controller to

126
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,840
run that zone instead even if you can

127
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,220
make that work you will still probably

128
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,900
have to replace the controller

129
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,940
eventually because it's on its way out

130
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:02,520
but this will buy you some time maybe

131
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:04,620
even a few seasons if you don't have

132
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,440
another terminal available and assuming

133
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,120
it's not a module issue you're going to

134
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,580
need a new controller it's a great time

135
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,380
to upgrade if you've got a base model

136
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,540
you might want to check out a smart

137
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,919
controller that can change its

138
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,020
programming based on local weather

139
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:21,300
stations and you can program it with

140
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:24,539
your smartphone so check out the choices

141
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:27,300
on sprinklerwarehouse.com assuming that

142
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:29,280
your terminal is working perfectly your

143
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,860
problem is either the solenoid on your

144
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,020
valve or the wiring to test the wiring

145
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:36,180
and the solenoid wheel will be testing

146
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:39,060
resistance push the arrow key on the Pro

147
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:41,400
50 until you get to this screen press

148
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,620
the F2 key underneath the omega symbol

149
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,479
leave the clips on the terminals the

150
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:48,300
readings will jump around a little bit

151
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:51,060
and then settle I've got 42 ohms that's

152
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:53,820
good a 24 volt system like this is going

153
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:56,100
to be between 20 and 60 ohms if you've

154
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:58,080
got a battery operated system that

155
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,440
you're testing that would mean that the

156
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,300
solenoid on your valve is DC latching

157
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:05,580
you'll see around 5 to 10 ohms

158
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,740
resistance ratings for the valve you

159
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:10,080
have are available on the manufacturer's

160
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:12,360
website if the screen is showing this

161
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,060
three line lines you've got a break in

162
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,280
the wiring or a bad solenoid if you've

163
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:20,699
got a short in the system you'll see

164
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:23,039
something like this less than 5 ohms it

165
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:25,020
may even read zero ohms it means that

166
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,600
you've got wires touching somewhere that

167
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:30,060
shouldn't be touching so let's assume

168
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,699
that you've got a bad report here the

169
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:34,620
Pro 50 has indicated either a break in a

170
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:36,120
circuit or a short then we'll need to

171
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:38,400
move out to the valve to continue

172
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,500
troubleshooting out here at the valve

173
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,120
disconnect the wires from the solenoid

174
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,740
from the wiring coming from the

175
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,900
controller we're going to test the

176
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:48,479
solenoid a few different ways you don't

177
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:51,240
need to do all of this just pick one

178
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,520
the most direct way is to turn on the

179
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:56,000
solenoid put the clips on the solenoid

180
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,000
wires

181
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,520
press F3 for 24 volt system and F1 if

182
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:05,580
you've got a battery operated system

183
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,440
with DC latching solenoids from this

184
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:09,840
screen press F1

185
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,460
The Zone should come on let it run for

186
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,340
just a few seconds

187
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:15,900
and F3 to turn it off one note here if

188
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:18,180
you have a master valve on your system

189
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:20,099
the water is not going to come on unless

190
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,319
the controller is currently running the

191
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:23,880
Zone you're testing the master valve

192
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,220
proceeds all the valves in your system

193
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,620
and nothing can run without it on it

194
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:31,020
another option is to chatter the

195
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:33,599
solenoid now you don't want to chatter

196
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:36,120
the solenoid with the water on the water

197
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:38,400
to your system should be turned off at

198
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,039
the backflow or at the water main if

199
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,680
you're chattering press the F2 button to

200
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:46,520
chatter it sounds like this

201
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,520
foreign

202
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,560
and yet another test you can do would be

203
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,539
to test the resistance just like we did

204
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,360
at the controller I'm going to press the

205
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:06,419
right arrow button and then press f2

206
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:09,000
underneath the omega symbol because this

207
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:12,840
is a 24 vac system I'm looking for

208
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,780
something between 20 and 60 ohms 43 ohms

209
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:19,020
that's good less than 5 ohms or if you

210
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:21,180
get like the three lines like this then

211
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:23,460
the solenoid is Bad If This Were DC

212
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:25,560
latching solenoid 5 to 10 ohms would

213
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:27,539
indicate a good solenoid so if you've

214
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,180
got a bad solenoid you need to replace

215
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:32,580
either the solenoid or the entire valve

216
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:34,500
usually the price difference between a

217
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,479
replacement solenoid and the entire

218
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:39,000
valve is usually just a couple of bucks

219
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,279
I would go ahead and buy a new valve if

220
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,620
I were you if you're just replacing the

221
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:46,260
solenoid you'll need to find out the

222
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:48,420
correct one for your model of valve the

223
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,399
valve solenoids are not generic there's

224
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:52,800
a specific one you need if you're

225
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,480
replacing the entire valve any valve

226
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,779
that's the same type and size will do

227
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,899
now when I say type I mean inline

228
00:08:56,779 --> 00:09:03,120
anti-siphon angle this is an inline one

229
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:05,220
and it's a one inch valve so you can

230
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,140
replace it with any one inch valve

231
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,899
that's in line you don't have to match

232
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:12,839
modeler brand any brand works with any

233
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:15,060
controller Etc you do need to buy a DC

234
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:17,279
latching solenoid version if your system

235
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:19,320
is battery powered system and finally

236
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,320
Let's test the wiring connect the clips

237
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,480
to the wires coming from the controller

238
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,720
start the Zone you're testing

239
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,100
set your Pro 50 to test for vac like we

240
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:33,240
did earlier

241
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:35,100
and we're looking for around 24 vac once

242
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,380
again if you get three lines you've got

243
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,899
broken wiring if you get something

244
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:41,100
really low it could be a short check

245
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:43,200
your Connections in the valve box

246
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,480
hopefully that's the problem try making

247
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,640
fresh connections and always use

248
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,680
waterproof wire connectors if that

249
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,200
doesn't fix it you may need to run new

250
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,240
wire which is a real pain if you happen

251
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,279
to have multi-strand wire coming into

252
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,920
the valve and one of the strands in the

253
00:09:56,279 --> 00:10:00,480
multi-strand is not being used and

254
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,220
congratulations you've just hit the

255
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,860
jackpot somebody's already run your new

256
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:07,740
wire for you just swap to an unused wire

257
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:10,800
and swap the wire back at the controller

258
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:13,260
if there is another valve nearby an

259
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,839
option is to use a doubler the doubler

260
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:18,000
operates two valves using only one lead

261
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,680
wire that could potentially save you a

262
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,440
lot of work and headaches so check out

263
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,540
that option hope this helps questions
