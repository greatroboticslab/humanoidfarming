  "text": "I started my journey actually at South Dakota State University and ended up getting a degree in botany because I like to study of plants then I spent about 20 years with the USDA and most of it was ARS and doing research I was the technician under the research around the Cheyenne I was born in Brookings South Dakota and so we focused on no-till mainly diverse rotations and how they impact crops and then that transitioned into a lot of cover crop research well ahead of the popularity I think we're seeing with cover crops especially in South Dakota the agronomist for Olsen custom farms now I'm based out of Hendricks Minnesota but we've have farms in in South Dakota as well before I got to the farm they had acquired a small seed business and so they started raising some certified oats and spring wheat with me joining the farm we had other crops like sunflowers and then of course corn soybeans a little bit of alfalfa hay and then they have forages that are devoted to the to the feedlot operation and so one of the the first opportunities that I've seen joining Olson custom farms was to stretch our rotation out to take that power diversity and make it work for us because it's free it just involves more management but that's what I'm that the farm for is to help with that management and execute those cropping plans so now we're trying to move from not just corn soybeans but rather a corn soybean small grain a cereal crop right now that's old spring wheat or winter rye so now we've got this diverse set of situation where the corn sees a different previous crop but also a different moisture balance in the soil the community that we set up for it in the soil with the cover crops I look for many benefits to come out of it it's a little too early to tell but since I come from research and I've seen it be successful I'm pretty confident that we can be successful and like any management we have to take an account the cost of our cover crop seed and what it cost the seed but I'm looking at it that will offset those expenses with reductions in applied in organic fertilizer that's my goal for the farm is to bring our level of applied in organic fertilizer reduce it by forty to fifty percent that would be a good goal it's an ambitious goal but I think it's very attainable [Music]",
