00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:34,820
[Music]

3
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:45,490
so

4
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:45,490
[Music]

5
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,400
okay

6
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:14,799
today we'll start with a new topic

7
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,799
the topic on strength irrigation system

8
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,280
and

9
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,200
during the discussion when we had

10
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,320
discussed the various methods of

11
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,200
irrigation

12
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,200
we had discussed in brief

13
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,920
what do we mean by what we understand by

14
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,640
the

15
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,240
sprinkle irrigation system

16
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,720
but we have not

17
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,079
gone beyond that we had not looked into

18
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,680
one of the various

19
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:42,320
types of sprinkler irrigation systems

20
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,240
today we'll start first with

21
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,079
what are the various

22
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,880
types of sprinkler irrigation system

23
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,680
which are there are many many different

24
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,880
uh

25
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,880
modes of

26
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,640
sprinkler irrigation

27
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,759
method which is being

28
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,520
used

29
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,880
all over the world but there are some

30
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,280
some

31
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:08,439
method which have become more popular so

32
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,439
we'll try to look at those methods first

33
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,120
what are the various types of

34
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,599
sprinkler systems

35
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,680
out of the

36
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,360
various types existing

37
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,160
which are

38
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,160
very common

39
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,680
there are some systems conventional

40
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,160
systems which are

41
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,160
moved with

42
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,080
the manual labor

43
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,319
let me first

44
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,720
put all those which we are going to have

45
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,720
a look at

46
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,720
hand move solid set

47
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,840
side roll

48
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,840
then

49
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,280
center pivot

50
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,159
then you have

51
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,920
that gun

52
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,720
these variations

53
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,680
they have come about

54
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,680
with respect to the

55
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,200
requirements in terms of in some cases

56
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,879
with respect to the requirements of

57
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,400
labor

58
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,879
in some cases you will find that the

59
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,879
labor requirement is very low

60
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,120
so let's have a look at

61
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,120
these

62
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,360
different

63
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,080
types

64
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,080
one by one

65
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,760
the hand move

66
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,799
is the one which we had

67
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,799
discussed during last

68
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,880
the period when we were discussing the

69
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,799
various methods of irrigation where we

70
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,280
had said that

71
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:21,280
there is a

72
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,160
i mean line

73
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,280
and that

74
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,759
my line will have

75
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,759
different

76
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,520
literals

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,520
if we say that this is the main line

78
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,160
now

79
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,160
these littles

80
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,880
are moved

81
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,040
from one position on the lateral to

82
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,520
another position

83
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,639
using the manual labor

84
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,639
you might

85
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,639
again

86
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,479
the

87
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,479
this hand move system you can also

88
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,360
call this as

89
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,360
a portable

90
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,759
portable system

91
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,639
the level of portability

92
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,080
again can vary

93
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,000
in some cases

94
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,880
it can be

95
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,880
it can be completely portable

96
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,120
in terms of you might be

97
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,280
replacing the main line also

98
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,080
and moving it from one plate and one

99
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:37,039
place to another the next place

100
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:41,360
but that normally happens when you have

101
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,360
availability of water along a channel

102
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,199
whereas in some other cases it might be

103
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:49,360
called semi semi portable

104
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,759
right now what we are referring to is a

105
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,600
semi portable system where you are only

106
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,680
removing the laterals

107
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,520
the main line remains fixed

108
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,360
you might move the laterals from one

109
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,319
position to another position

110
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,919
so that the level of portability

111
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,400
can be

112
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,440
varying from situation to situation

113
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,479
there is no

114
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,120
such

115
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,240
rule the extent of portability

116
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,960
can vary

117
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:18,520
so the other the other extreme can be

118
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,520
the solid set

119
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,319
and this in the case of the solid set

120
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,680
system we might be keeping everything

121
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,560
fixed

122
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,560
the laterals as well as the main lines

123
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,800
they might be remaining fixed

124
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,800
if not

125
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,000
permanently at least for the

126
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,000
duration of the crop

127
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,960
so if you keep the

128
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,960
the little

129
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,160
uh fixed

130
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,800
for the duration of the crop

131
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,680
which in in turn what it will mean it

132
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,199
will mean that you will have to have

133
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,960
those number of lectures which you are

134
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,440
going to use

135
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,680
in any position

136
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,599
so the number of literals requirement

137
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,199
will be very high

138
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,840
in that situation where you are not

139
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,039
willing to remove the

140
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,120
laters you might not be running all the

141
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,520
literals at the same time

142
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,360
you might be running only

143
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,080
one segment

144
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,840
at a time because these things are again

145
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,039
will come to those

146
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,880
details when we'll discuss

147
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,880
that how many liters you can run at a

148
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,479
particular time because all these things

149
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,319
are dependent on

150
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:42,840
what is the source of water supply

151
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:46,240
was the quantity of water which is

152
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:48,160
available and the relevant pressure

153
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,879
so in other words

154
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,879
what is the pump which you are using

155
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,960
on the side of the pump

156
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,840
and that will decide how much how many

157
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,560
liters can be

158
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,720
used in one set or atom at a particular

159
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,000
time

160
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,800
that in turn also is dependent on

161
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,120
what is the pressure requirement in each

162
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,879
each later

163
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,440
because that is what is going to decide

164
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,039
the distribution pattern of the

165
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,319
directed area

166
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:23,120
or that sprinkler head

167
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:26,360
so in the case of solid set system

168
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,360
you will

169
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,919
keep the literals permanently fixed

170
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,399
if your labor is very expensive you

171
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,880
might decide to do that but that will be

172
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,000
at the cost of more investment in terms

173
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,640
of having

174
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,640
more number of lectures

175
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,919
then the

176
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,839
the side drawn system

177
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,480
in the case of side growth system

178
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,279
this is

179
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,360
to avoid

180
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:06,240
the use of labor

181
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:09,440
if the labor is very expensive

182
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,800
you might want to have a trade-off

183
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,519
between

184
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,200
the situation that in one case in one

185
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,240
extreme you have the solid charge system

186
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,160
where you need number of liters

187
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,040
which have to be bought and fixed

188
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,200
permanently in position or at least for

189
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,720
the the time for the duration of the

190
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,680
crop

191
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,680
the other extreme is that every time you

192
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,080
remove the electrode from

193
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,200
its position on the main line

194
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,080
and then

195
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,200
move the little to the the next position

196
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,440
after

197
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,120
physically dismantling it

198
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,920
which requires

199
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,800
a very regular labor

200
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:52,720
so to avoid that avoid that situation

201
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:55,040
and still reduce the number of liters

202
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,279
a system was

203
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,800
a wall where you can have a little

204
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,680
mounted on

205
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,120
some aluminium wheels

206
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,079
and that you can

207
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,640
roll for example you might be having

208
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,640
a little

209
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,920
might have this little and this little

210
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,000
is mounted on

211
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,000
[Applause]

212
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,440
some

213
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,440
reasons

214
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,360
so

215
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,480
through this

216
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,680
mounting

217
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,680
now you can roll the whole thing

218
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,399
and

219
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,079
this itself is a literal that means

220
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,920
there might be

221
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,240
there will be a

222
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,839
nozzle a sprinkler nozzle

223
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,959
mounted on this

224
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,440
now you might

225
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,720
feel that in in some cases if the

226
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,279
sprinkler

227
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,600
is the nozzle is mounted on this

228
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,920
since the whole thing is rolling

229
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:14,160
it might change the direction of the

230
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:16,240
sprinkler head so to avoid that

231
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,800
there was a

232
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,399
there's a mechanism by which you can

233
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,880
avoid that

234
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:26,000
by having a

235
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:28,880
some mechanism by which you have

236
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,760
a counterweight

237
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,680
which is put so that to keep the

238
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,959
sprinkler head always

239
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,560
and there's that there's a weight which

240
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:39,200
is put

241
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,959
which is uh quite heavy so

242
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,120
because of that weight the position of

243
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,240
the leaf the the sprinkler head will

244
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,399
always be

245
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,399
in the same position in which you want

246
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,959
it that means the inner position the

247
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,040
vertical position so those things are

248
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:56,959
taken care of

249
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:59,200
by having a specialized

250
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:02,000
those sprinkler heads

251
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,079
which can be mounted on these neutrals

252
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,079
but the advantage of this is that once

253
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,480
you have

254
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:12,160
done the irrigation or once you have

255
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:14,880
applied the water by keeping this in one

256
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:18,160
position you can roll it to the next and

257
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,600
that rolling also can be done

258
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,720
to a

259
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,760
motor

260
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,680
it can be some equipment which can

261
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,720
have some driving force

262
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,480
so that

263
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,720
driving can also be

264
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,760
the equipment can also be

265
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,880
having

266
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:37,440
that mechanism which can give you the

267
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,680
driving force also

268
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,959
or you can you can move it manually it

269
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,480
depends on what is the size of the whole

270
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,720
the whole

271
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,720
set

272
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,639
that is what we

273
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,880
call the side roll system

274
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,360
which is

275
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,120
quite uh

276
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,320
reasonably useful

277
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,320
in some situations but

278
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,839
is used only in those situations where

279
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,279
you cannot afford to

280
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,600
employ the labor

281
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,360
whereas in our country our conditions in

282
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,160
our country the labor is not that big a

283
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,560
problem so you might not need such a

284
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,560
system

285
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,000
then the central pivot

286
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,040
center pivot system is another system

287
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:38,560
which requires very

288
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:41,279
less amount of labor

289
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:44,160
first of all what the system

290
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:47,880
was the philosophy of this system

291
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,880
and this particular system

292
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:58,000
the source of water is

293
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,000
at a central point

294
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,320
and then

295
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,560
from this source

296
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,320
you are having a pivot arm

297
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,600
one pivot arm

298
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,079
which is

299
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,079
quite a

300
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,440
long arm

301
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,880
on which you mount the later

302
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,399
so this pivot can be

303
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,279
i can show you

304
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,279
a figure of

305
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:32,160
what this pivot

306
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,160
arm can be

307
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:43,880
is this clear this figure

308
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,880
now this is the pivot term

309
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:50,000
this pivot arm is having at

310
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,440
different

311
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
locations

312
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:57,279
these sprinkler nozzles are

313
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,040
attached at different locations

314
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,600
all along the pivotal

315
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,240
and this pivot arm if you can notice

316
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,800
here this is mounted on

317
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,120
these wheels

318
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:12,120
so the whole arm can move in one

319
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,120
direction

320
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,199
it can move

321
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:20,079
about this pivot point which is the

322
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:22,560
central point which is the source

323
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:26,279
this can move in the

324
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,279
in the circular direction

325
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,839
that means if you look at the total

326
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,199
and this since is mounted on

327
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:43,040
a different job

328
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,600
the mountings are

329
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,600
available

330
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,440
and this

331
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:55,480
there's a mounted all along on these

332
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,480
tripods

333
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,519
which are

334
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,720
in turn which are mounted on the

335
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,519
wheels

336
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,519
you can give it a

337
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,160
rotation

338
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:12,399
that means overall

339
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,480
as this moves in this direction

340
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,000
as this moves in this direction

341
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,360
each individual

342
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,360
you will be having

343
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,680
at each location

344
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,320
uh the location of this

345
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:27,360
sprinkler head either it can be up here

346
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,120
or it can be down there that varies

347
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,160
so in either case

348
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,199
as you have seen in the figure you have

349
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,320
these

350
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:39,279
sprinkler heads somewhere mounted here

351
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,279
at these locations

352
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:45,199
in either direction

353
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,839
so when you are operating these

354
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,839
each one is

355
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,560
is wetting area

356
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:55,600
which has its own

357
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,600
area of influence

358
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,120
so at a at a particular time you are

359
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,199
wetting up

360
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,199
a strip

361
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:09,120
and

362
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:10,319
as it moves in this circular direction

363
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,600
at each

364
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,439
individual

365
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,760
time you will find that

366
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,199
ultimately you are wetting

367
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,720
a circular

368
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,000
area

369
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,400
which

370
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,839
which is being wetted by the single

371
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,679
neutral

372
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,079
now this pivot

373
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,200
is it can be very

374
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,400
depends

375
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,720
how big

376
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,480
the pipe you are you have installed

377
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,760
or the pressures under which is

378
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:42,000
operating but is a real big area

379
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,000
the extent can be in hundreds of meters

380
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,400
so ultimately

381
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,600
you will find that you have

382
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,840
through a

383
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,360
central pivot system

384
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,120
the source was

385
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,280
at the central point

386
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,320
this source can either be in the form of

387
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,799
a valve

388
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:02,320
or it can be in the form of a buried

389
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:04,320
main line which has been tapped here

390
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:08,559
and you will be you will be getting an

391
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:11,039
area covered which is a circular area

392
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:13,840
the disadvantage of this

393
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:15,520
central pivot system

394
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,760
that you are

395
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,480
you are wasting lot of area which is the

396
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,480
cognition

397
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,520
if i

398
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,559
if i have

399
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,919
cover this area with the central pivot

400
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,120
system which is the extent of the

401
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,600
pivot

402
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,880
so ultimately i have covered this area

403
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,200
and normally

404
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:44,240
whenever you go in for the

405
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,919
the agricultural operations

406
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,000
you won't have the circular radius

407
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,080
covered this is a very big area so it

408
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,039
will be covering many many fields all

409
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,559
along

410
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,880
but still it'll be much more

411
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,559
advantageous if you can

412
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,880
if you can have some

413
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,080
way of covering these corner portions

414
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,880
which

415
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:06,400
are not being covered in this

416
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:10,400
in this system so you are wasting

417
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:12,080
this area is not getting any water

418
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,000
to avoid this

419
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:17,760
problem

420
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,760
the centripetal pivot system

421
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,320
the movement of the central pivot system

422
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,679
is varied

423
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:29,039
and is called

424
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,039
a linear move system

425
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:41,440
with the same as central pivot

426
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,440
but instead of

427
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,760
getting rotated

428
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:51,120
you are you are moving this pivot

429
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:53,919
along some channel or some supply source

430
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,840
which is a linear supply source

431
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,480
only then it can

432
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:01,200
it can be taken care of so and under

433
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,840
those conditions where you can have a

434
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,880
linear movement of this

435
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,280
pivot

436
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,720
you can avoid

437
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,840
getting this

438
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,840
these corner areas

439
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:20,880
solved you can you can you can you can

440
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:23,679
solve these areas you can avoid

441
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,640
the situation where where you are having

442
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,840
these

443
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:31,520
corner areas are not served

444
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:33,520
by the application of irrigation water

445
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,600
so that is what is

446
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,720
is only the operation

447
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,159
of the

448
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,600
pivot system

449
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,200
or of the

450
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,080
similar

451
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,000
pivot which can be moved in a linear

452
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,559
manner and you can you can take care of

453
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,600
rectangular areas which are more useful

454
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,880
than

455
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,880
the circular areas

456
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,640
then the

457
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,640
big gun

458
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,159
now this system

459
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,840
is having a philosophy that

460
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:14,559
you are having

461
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,320
a big nozzle

462
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:18,720
which is operating under much higher

463
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,360
pressures

464
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,000
so what you are doing is that instead of

465
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,480
using many number of

466
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,080
sprinkler heads you are using a sink

467
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,360
single nozzle

468
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,600
which is

469
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,480
having a very distance

470
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,200
very very large distance coverage

471
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,159
and

472
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,679
through the use of that single nozzle

473
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,600
you are

474
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,200
irrigating the areas

475
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,240
the only disadvantage is that the

476
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,760
pressures which are required they are

477
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,200
very very

478
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,520
high pressures

479
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,880
and the distribution is also not

480
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,200
very uniform

481
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,720
in the case of big gun system but in

482
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,799
some situations

483
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,200
the big gun system

484
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:03,360
can be useful where you're not very much

485
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,400
bothered about the uniformity

486
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,760
the type of crops are not very sensitive

487
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,799
crops

488
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,960
and

489
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:13,840
you have the prevailing pressures which

490
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,840
are required

491
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,600
now having discussed

492
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,360
the

493
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,039
different types of

494
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,280
irrigation systems

495
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:26,559
under the sprinkler irrigation system

496
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:29,039
which are available

497
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,720
we will go on to the other

498
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,919
related aspects of

499
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,080
the system

500
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,600
but most of the times

501
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,520
we will be discussing the the

502
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,640
conventional sprinkler irrigation

503
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,120
systems

504
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,400
where we have

505
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,679
a main line

506
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,679
and the laterals either

507
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:52,480
flexible or

508
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,480
the

509
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,840
the neutrals which are having

510
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,640
portability all the other fixed neutrals

511
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,200
that

512
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,480
that is only the method of

513
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,919
application

514
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,760
basically it doesn't make any difference

515
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,440
as far as the design is concerned in the

516
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,600
case of design

517
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,960
you have to decide on

518
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,080
what are the pressures what are the

519
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,919
sizes

520
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,720
what are the spacings those things will

521
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,000
come

522
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,200
but we are not going to cover the

523
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,440
designs of

524
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,559
big gun or

525
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,200
of

526
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:27,600
the central pivot systems

527
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,600
they are

528
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,080
beyond the scope of our coverage here we

529
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,240
are just

530
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,720
in many cases the designs are not much

531
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,120
different or similar because

532
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,240
the the basis behind those designs is

533
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,360
the same

534
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,840
it's not

535
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,679
very much different only thing is that

536
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,799
you will have to take in

537
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:51,600
into consideration their overlaps

538
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,880
how those overlaps have to be considered

539
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,400
what will be the

540
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,559
difference in the overlap when you have

541
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,679
a pivot system or when you have a linear

542
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:01,960
system

543
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,960
or the conventional system

544
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,880
so let's go on to the

545
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,880
system components

546
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,480
what are the basic system components

547
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,039
which

548
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,039
have to be

549
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,360
to be taken care of

550
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,799
the first thing is that in all these

551
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,480
systems

552
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,840
this is true for

553
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,919
all the system which we have just

554
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,640
mentioned

555
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,640
that you need

556
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,360
pressurized

557
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,679
water source

558
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:57,279
that is a must

559
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,799
the extent of this pressures

560
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:02,240
might be different

561
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:04,400
from one system to another system

562
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,559
this for example

563
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,320
the the system which we have just

564
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,240
mentioned

565
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,720
for example in the case of

566
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,720
big gun

567
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,840
the prevailing pressures

568
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,320
might vary between

569
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,080
830

570
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,320
kilopascal

571
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:29,320
to

572
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:29,320
1035 kilopascal

573
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,480
and

574
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,159
the impact sprinklers

575
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,760
now these impact sprinklers

576
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,320
are the the conventional systems where

577
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,159
we have

578
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,000
the sprinkler heads

579
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,000
mounted on the

580
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,919
the

581
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,640
littles and the littles are getting

582
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:13,200
watched from the

583
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,200
main line

584
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:18,400
and those

585
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,400
systems the pressures

586
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,360
will vary between

587
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,440
these limits

588
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,520
and the

589
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,520
pivot systems

590
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:41,360
are the system which

591
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,360
comparatively lower pressures

592
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:54,080
so these are the pressure ranges

593
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,919
now you can see here that the pressure

594
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,080
requirement of the big gun is almost

595
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,880
four times

596
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:03,520
that of the impact sprinkler

597
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,200
which is conventionally used for

598
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,840
the

599
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,840
the

600
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,039
areas which are

601
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,039
the reasonably

602
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,880
the reasonable areas which you normally

603
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,640
handle

604
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,399
whereas in the case of pivot system the

605
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,240
areas which you handle

606
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:27,120
they're very large areas and that is

607
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,200
possible only in the case of

608
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,960
cooperative farming or

609
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,720
where you have

610
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:37,600
very big farms which are under the same

611
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,760
uh farmers or under

612
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,520
you might have a cooperative so only in

613
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,360
those situations you will find that the

614
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,679
pivot systems are of

615
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,720
much use and you have

616
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,320
for

617
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,279
many many hectares you have the same

618
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,840
crop

619
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:53,440
but as in our conventional systems

620
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,919
as we know that

621
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,120
in most of our

622
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,440
projects

623
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,520
the availability of the crops is very

624
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,279
high you might have

625
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,399
very small size

626
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,799
fields

627
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:08,640
which are having the same crop and for

628
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,600
each individual field you will have to

629
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,200
have

630
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:15,679
the spectral system if you are using one

631
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,600
and the impact impact sprinklers will be

632
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:20,399
the one which will be quite useful in

633
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,399
other situations

634
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:33,520
and besides the pressurized water source

635
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:39,440
you will

636
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,440
need a mini line

637
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,320
a main line is

638
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,399
mill line is the connection between

639
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,399
the

640
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,799
the pressurized source of

641
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:59,799
water

642
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,240
and

643
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,399
the point of

644
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,600
delivery

645
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,600
this main line might not be required for

646
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,799
some systems

647
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,399
for example when we have discussed the

648
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,640
the

649
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:32,880
pivot system in that case the main line

650
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,360
is not required directly you are

651
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,559
having the connection between the source

652
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,120
and

653
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:39,120
the later

654
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,640
the main line is not

655
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,360
available in those systems but in most

656
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,799
of the systems

657
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,799
you will find that the main line is

658
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,919
a very important component of the system

659
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,399
then besides the main line

660
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,399
you have

661
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,520
electric line

662
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,200
the lecture line is the line which

663
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,919
comes after

664
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,520
comes off

665
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,520
of the

666
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,559
the main line

667
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:43,080
and it delivers the water too

668
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,120
to the individual sprinkler

669
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,240
taking a conventional

670
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:20,240
system

671
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,240
let's say that this is the source

672
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,039
this is the main line

673
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,919
out of the main line

674
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,000
you

675
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,960
will draw the

676
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:46,919
the little from the main line

677
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,919
so this is the later

678
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,600
and on the later

679
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,919
these are the positions of

680
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,919
the sprinkler heads

681
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,880
so these are the

682
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:13,320
sprinkler nozzles

683
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:36,080
then the other system components

684
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:38,640
which are related

685
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,640
are that

686
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,159
you would like to know

687
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,760
what is the lateral spacing

688
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,279
and at what spacing you have to provide

689
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,880
these

690
00:32:55,279 --> 00:33:00,000
sprinkle nozzles

691
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,000
on a particular lecture

692
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,720
now if we

693
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,320
call this as sl

694
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,320
and

695
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,399
what is the spacing between

696
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:28,159
the two lateral positions

697
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,519
on the middle line

698
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:33,039
so this is

699
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,039
known as main line spacing

700
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:41,519
and

701
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:44,519
normally designated by

702
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,519
sm

703
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:01,760
then besides this

704
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:04,799
we'll also be interested in

705
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:08,960
what is the vector diameter

706
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:08,960
so if you look at the

707
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:18,240
the area of influence of

708
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,240
this individual

709
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:24,399
sprinkler nozzle

710
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,399
and this is

711
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,599
this is the wetted area

712
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:47,520
individual spray pattern

713
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:49,520
and this area this nozzle

714
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,800
is the paper spray pattern of this

715
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,240
nozzle

716
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,960
that is

717
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,879
designated

718
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,359
by a parameter

719
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:59,359
which is

720
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,480
known as wetted diameter

721
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,839
and designated by dw

722
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:28,079
these are the main

723
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:30,000
quantities or some of the main

724
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:31,440
items which will be referring to quite

725
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,359
often

726
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,520
these are

727
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:35,520
the

728
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,040
the design parameters you can see

729
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,400
which will be very important

730
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:45,119
from

731
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:47,440
the consideration of our the

732
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:50,800
objectives of the design

733
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:52,079
and is very essential to

734
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,359
to know these

735
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,280
parameters

736
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:58,280
what these parameters

737
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,280
mean

738
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:08,839
so let us now

739
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,839
look at what are our design objectives

740
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:26,800
by now we know that

741
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:29,440
the generic design objectives

742
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,760
which we have which are true for all the

743
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,359
irrigation methods irrespective of which

744
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,119
method you use

745
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,960
and these the design objectives are that

746
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,320
we have to take care of the water

747
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,520
requirements

748
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:43,280
we have to avoid the

749
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,280
losses

750
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,800
so as to keep those losses as the

751
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,640
minimum ones

752
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,119
they are the same

753
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,720
they are not going to vary much from one

754
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:57,040
method to another method

755
00:36:52,720 --> 00:37:00,079
but let's have a relook into those

756
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,079
design objectives

757
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,400
the

758
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,320
the required depth of

759
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,839
application

760
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:23,440
this required depth of application has

761
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,240
to be satisfied

762
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:29,359
as a prime design objective because you

763
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,480
want the crop to

764
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:32,800
grow well

765
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,200
without

766
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,839
without

767
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,040
stresses which it cannot

768
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:41,440
sustain

769
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:44,160
those stresses we have to avoid that

770
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:46,720
those stresses should be

771
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,960
allowed to develop in the crop so for

772
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:52,640
that purpose we have to ensure that the

773
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:54,240
required depth of application has to be

774
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,280
provided to the

775
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,680
soil

776
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,359
at the time whenever it is needed

777
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,800
and this we

778
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:02,400
know that this required depth of

779
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,839
application

780
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,839
is dependent on many factors

781
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,440
is dependent on

782
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:13,760
the

783
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,760
peak

784
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,440
period evapotranspiration rate

785
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:27,440
which is a function of the climate so

786
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,960
you have to it will be a function of

787
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,560
what is the peak

788
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:34,079
you have a transportation date during

789
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:35,440
that period which is under concentration

790
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:38,160
and that will decide what is the

791
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:40,560
required depth of application

792
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:44,680
will also be dependent on

793
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,680
what is the water holding capacity

794
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,280
of the soil

795
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,160
the

796
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:03,040
roots on depth

797
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:06,160
as the these two put together

798
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:08,480
the extent of the soil profile which is

799
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:10,240
providing moisture to the crop

800
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,240
and the water holding capacity these two

801
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:15,680
put together will decide what is the

802
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:17,839
available washer

803
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:20,640
and

804
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:20,640
the management

805
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,280
allowed

806
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,280
depletion

807
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:28,480
these are the major factors which will

808
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,160
decide

809
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,480
because

810
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,839
when at what exact time you want to

811
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,079
irrigate

812
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:36,079
that

813
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:42,079
there is some level of flexibility in

814
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:44,880
that and that is a function of

815
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:46,160
decision made either by the farmer or

816
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,760
the management

817
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,960
so that is what we

818
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,640
have discussed earlier that the

819
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,160
management allowed depletion of

820
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,400
the deficit

821
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:58,160
can also influence

822
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:01,200
how much is the requirement

823
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,200
at that particular time

824
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,400
then the other design objective is

825
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:11,839
which is

826
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,839
true for this particular case

827
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:16,720
and the previous

828
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:19,599
methods which we have considered so far

829
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:21,119
this objective was not the one which is

830
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:22,880
which we are going to discuss right now

831
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:26,240
this is a very

832
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:28,800
particular objective which is only

833
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,839
true for the case of sprint irrigation

834
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,520
system

835
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:34,160
and that is that the

836
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,160
integrate

837
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:40,880
the integrate of soil

838
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,480
should not exceed

839
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,720
so as to avoid

840
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,760
and in and off

841
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:10,160
from the irrigation regit field so in

842
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:13,359
this particular method we don't allow

843
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:15,119
any enough to generate

844
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:18,319
which means we will have to

845
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:21,520
control the irrigation application

846
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:23,119
to the extent that the

847
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,839
there shouldn't be any

848
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:27,839
surface runoff

849
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:29,599
which which might crop up

850
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:31,599
which means that you'll have to you'll

851
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:33,200
have to take into consideration

852
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:34,560
what are the variations and they

853
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,240
integrate

854
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,760
because integrate is something which is

855
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,280
dependent on the soil moisture

856
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,240
conditions

857
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,960
is not

858
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:45,040
fixed it varies with respect to the soil

859
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:47,680
object moisture condition

860
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:49,359
so when we are designing the

861
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:51,440
the sprinkler irrigation

862
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:52,720
will have to consider what is the

863
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,480
prevailing

864
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,240
intake rate of the soil

865
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,040
under those conditions

866
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,760
and

867
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:02,319
control the irrigation application in

868
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:05,119
such a manner that you don't get any

869
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:05,119
surface runoff

870
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:16,760
then we also want

871
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,760
the uniformity of

872
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,440
application

873
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:33,280
so which is a

874
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:35,760
objective which is common objective

875
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:39,280
that was the objective earlier also

876
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:40,880
and this uniformity of application

877
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:44,680
will result in

878
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,680
reduction in the leak population

879
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:56,960
so if your depoculation losses are large

880
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:58,720
the uniformity will be

881
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,480
the uniformity of

882
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,720
application will be

883
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,720
low

884
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,920
we have to design the system in such a

885
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,920
manner

886
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:13,760
the uniformity of application can

887
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:15,839
be as much as possible under the

888
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,839
prevailing

889
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:19,359
conditions

890
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:22,800
now

891
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:22,800
the uniformity of application

892
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,319
at this stage we can just

893
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:30,720
at least

894
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,720
mention

895
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:36,960
that in in the case of sprinkler

896
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:39,359
irrigation system

897
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:41,920
you are getting a depth of application

898
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:44,400
by the overlap of

899
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,400
different

900
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:48,319
different

901
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:55,359
application patterns

902
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:58,480
which are for individual sprinkler heads

903
00:43:55,359 --> 00:44:01,359
so there will be some level of

904
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:03,440
inaccuracies involved

905
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:05,359
or some level of

906
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,440
non-uniformities which will be involved

907
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:08,720
because of these overlaps

908
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,400
and that will be

909
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,480
dependent on many other factors for

910
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,800
example the wind conditions

911
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,319
which is going to be a major factor

912
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,160
in deciding

913
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:20,640
how well you can

914
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:23,920
have the overlap

915
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:25,119
how effective overlap can be

916
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,240
obtained

917
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:28,720
under those

918
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:30,319
prevailing wind conditions

919
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,599
will be a function of the level of wind

920
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:32,960
conditions

921
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:35,119
if the wind conditions are very

922
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:37,920
excessive the wind speeds are very

923
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:40,560
excessive you might find that the

924
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:43,839
overlaps

925
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,839
might be very difficult to

926
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,079
obtain

927
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:50,480
the uniformity throughout the area we'll

928
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:51,520
discuss those things in detail i thought

929
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,079
i'll just

930
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:56,640
mention make a mention at this stage

931
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:57,680
that this is one of the the condition

932
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,720
which will

933
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,760
decide

934
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,280
how much

935
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,280
will be the uniformity which can be

936
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,280
achieved

937
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:12,480
in this system another design objective

938
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:14,319
which is

939
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,400
very often

940
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:18,480
can be a deciding factor

941
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:20,319
is the trade-off between

942
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,200
the

943
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:24,400
achieving the physical

944
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,640
conditions

945
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,520
the physical requirements of the crop

946
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,839
and

947
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,839
in achieving those requirements how much

948
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:32,640
you have to

949
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:34,480
incur

950
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:36,319
how much expensive

951
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,839
the system can be or how much expense

952
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:38,720
you have to incur

953
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:39,680
so

954
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:42,880
the

955
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:44,160
economy of the overall

956
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,920
system

957
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:48,160
is going to be a very major factor in

958
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,160
this

959
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,359
tradeoff between

960
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,839
physical

961
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:01,839
plus

962
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:06,560
biological requirements

963
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:12,000
and

964
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:15,000
on the other hand

965
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
the

966
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,520
economic cause

967
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,160
of

968
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:32,640
equipment plus labor

969
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:34,640
these two

970
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:36,880
factors are going to be the deciding

971
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:39,599
ones

972
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:41,839
in some cases if you change the design

973
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:43,760
you might

974
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:45,520
that your initial cost

975
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,240
goes up very much

976
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:50,240
you might have to invest a lot of money

977
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,680
in providing all those

978
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:54,240
equipment

979
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:56,400
example if you go in for the

980
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,760
permanent set system

981
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,520
is going to be the

982
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,960
fixed system

983
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,480
you will require

984
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,000
a lot of pipes

985
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,200
which will which will add to your

986
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,839
initial

987
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,839
investment

988
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:12,400
whereas if you go in for a flexible

989
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:14,800
system your label costs

990
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:17,200
will be quite excessive

991
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,240
similarly the costs like maintenance

992
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,680
cause

993
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:23,040
the recurring cost

994
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:23,040
all those things you'll have to see

995
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,839
and compare them

996
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:29,599
under different options

997
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:30,559
but at the same time you'll also have to

998
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:31,920
look at

999
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:34,079
how well you are

1000
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,079
by choosing a particular system how well

1001
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:38,880
you are in a position to cater to the

1002
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:41,200
requirements which is the basic need of

1003
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,000
the education system

1004
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,079
so

1005
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,920
this trade-off is a very important

1006
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:48,400
aspect and

1007
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:51,040
as a very subjective thing

1008
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,480
this trade-off will vary from place to

1009
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,240
place

1010
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:56,240
and those conditions are in those

1011
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,440
countries where the equipment is very

1012
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,359
expensive

1013
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:01,520
people might go in for

1014
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:04,319
the labor is cheap you might choose a

1015
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:06,880
different option than in those places

1016
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:09,440
where is the other way around

1017
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:12,480
so uh is this totally

1018
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:13,839
is a very subjective

1019
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,440
objective

1020
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:18,079
the design objective

1021
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:20,240
and vary from place to place is very

1022
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:21,760
essential to understand that but it can

1023
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:24,800
be a deciding factor

1024
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,800
in many situations

1025
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,520
then

1026
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:34,359
let's go on to the

1027
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:34,359
some other aspects which are uh

1028
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:39,599
which we must understand before we go on

1029
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,599
to the next

1030
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,640
level of

1031
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,559
looking into the designs of these

1032
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:47,559
systems as the uniformity of

1033
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:47,559
applications

1034
00:48:54,720 --> 00:49:00,400
we just mentioned

1035
00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:03,119
in our objectives that we need to

1036
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:05,200
get uniformity of application

1037
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:06,880
that uniformity of application is

1038
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,920
dependent on

1039
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,240
two

1040
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:12,720
basic factors

1041
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,720
one is the

1042
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:20,400
the pressure

1043
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:20,400
the prevailing pressure

1044
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,599
and the others

1045
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:26,920
the

1046
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:26,920
wind conditions

1047
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:57,559
how the pressure influences the

1048
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:57,559
uniformity of application

1049
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:03,440
let's take

1050
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:03,440
three different cases

1051
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,880
when we operate the sprinkler

1052
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:11,040
nozzle

1053
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:13,839
under three different

1054
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,839
pressures

1055
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,200
and this is my

1056
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,000
location of the

1057
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:27,000
sprinkler nozzle

1058
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:40,079
let's say that this is the

1059
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:41,760
distance this is the zero level

1060
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:44,480
10 20

1061
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,480
30 meters

1062
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:55,400
so this is the central point where the

1063
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:55,400
the sprinkler is fixed

1064
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:58,880
now if the pressure is

1065
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:07,280
too low

1066
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:09,440
we won't get the order of magnitude we

1067
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:12,240
are just saying relatively

1068
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:14,400
because that will be the the

1069
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:16,319
this variation

1070
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,920
of the distribution of water

1071
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:20,319
will vary with respect to the size of

1072
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,599
the nozzle and the pressure

1073
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:23,839
so we are just

1074
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:25,520
trying to look at how

1075
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:27,839
relatively

1076
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:29,839
the special distribution will change the

1077
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:32,880
pressure variation will change the

1078
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:32,880
distribution fraction

1079
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:39,280
when the pressure is low

1080
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:41,920
you might find that

1081
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:44,319
you might get a

1082
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:48,200
distribution

1083
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:48,200
of water which is

1084
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,079
something of this

1085
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:03,280
this nature

1086
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:05,359
because in this case what is happening

1087
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:08,559
is that

1088
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:08,559
since the pressure is low

1089
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:14,079
when the

1090
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:15,359
the jet comes out of the

1091
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:17,599
nozzle

1092
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:19,359
is not broken up

1093
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:22,000
into smaller particles

1094
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:24,640
is not fully broken up is not broken up

1095
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:27,119
to the extent that it can

1096
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:28,240
get distributed over this area of

1097
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:31,040
influence

1098
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:32,880
in a uniform manner

1099
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:34,880
it might be

1100
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:37,839
having some still some streams which are

1101
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:39,599
going as a stream of water there is some

1102
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:43,680
breakage of jet

1103
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:44,880
but not is only partial breakage

1104
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:47,280
so if that

1105
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:50,160
happens you will find that

1106
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:51,839
this type of variation will be absorbed

1107
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:54,000
on the other hand

1108
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:57,240
if the pressure is

1109
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,240
too high

1110
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:05,440
you might get a variation which is

1111
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,440
something of

1112
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,720
this nature

1113
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,680
and

1114
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:30,319
the pressure the

1115
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:30,319
variation of

1116
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,920
the distribution

1117
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:41,000
might be something like

1118
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:41,000
a triangular variation

1119
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,599
if the

1120
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:48,319
pressure is satisfactory

1121
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:51,040
now why we are saying that this is

1122
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:52,480
this variation this distribution is more

1123
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:54,400
acceptable

1124
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:57,839
because ultimately

1125
00:53:54,400 --> 00:54:00,800
we have to get the

1126
00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:02,800
overall distribution

1127
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:05,359
by overlapping these

1128
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,359
individual

1129
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:09,160
distribution patterns

1130
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:14,400
and is very difficult to

1131
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:16,480
get a uniform distribution the overall

1132
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,880
uniform distribution by

1133
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:20,880
having either of these two distribution

1134
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,400
patterns

1135
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,400
that's the reason otherwise there's no

1136
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:26,319
other reason this is the only reason

1137
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:29,760
that why we want

1138
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:31,280
a distribution pattern of this type

1139
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:33,200
why we are calling this pressure to be

1140
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:35,040
satisfactory because

1141
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:37,040
by having this type of precedent

1142
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:39,440
distribution is much easier

1143
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:41,440
to have a better

1144
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:43,520
uniformity

1145
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:44,559
of application

1146
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:47,200
okay

1147
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:47,200
