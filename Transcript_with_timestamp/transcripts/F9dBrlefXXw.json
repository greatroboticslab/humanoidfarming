  "text": "hello my dear students and welcome to this week overview during this week we are going to be talking about the soil degradation and conservation so we are going to be stared talking about the erosion the process by which material such as top soil is moved from one place to another caused by natural processes and human activities often occurs faster than soil is formed depleting fertile top soil crops trees and other plants communities protect soil from erosion so in conclusion erosion is the movement of stuff like dirt from one spot to another it happens because of natural and things people do sometimes it's quicker than soil can be made which is not good because it takes away the good Rich dirt from the top plants like crops and trees help keep the soil safe from erosion they act like a shield making sure the dirt stays where it should be this way the soil stays healthy and can keep supporting plants life then moving to Farmer practices that reduce erosion so farmers use various techniques to loosen erosion on their fields one method is intercropping where different crops are grown together another approach is crop rotation where different crops are planted in alternating Seasons shelter bels involve planting tall plants to block strong winds reducing soil movement conservation is a practice that minimize the amount of soil turn over during planting to racing transforms steep slopes into steps to slow down water flow and prevent soil wash out Contour farming is a method where crops are planted perpendicular to the slope of Health helping to trap water and prevent erosion these farming practices help protect the soil ensuring its long-term fertility and sustainability so in summary we have the intercropping which different crops mixed together we have crop rotation which crops are alternate we have shelter belts that tow plants block wind we have conservation that soil turnover is reduced we have ter racing which steep slopes turned into steps and then we have Contour forming which planting perpendicular to Hill slope then we have ranching practices so we have ranching is the raising and grazing of livestock overg grazing causes and worsen many soil problems range managers encourage grazing limits and enforce them on publicly owned land so we have here overg grazing so compact soil and damage structure we have removes native grass and expose bare top soil then moving here we have that it allows invasive species to outcompete Native species because of alternate environment then we have decreases pores of air and decreases pores for water so all of that will cause to decreases in Grass growth and survival and leads to wind and water erosion we are going to talk about this in detail as we are going to be creating posters research problems and connect that to real life situations",
