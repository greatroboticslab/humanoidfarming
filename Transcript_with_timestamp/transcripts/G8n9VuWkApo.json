  "text": "[Music] [Music] hello again and welcome back to horse life directly from the horse headquarters in germany visits nov for those of you who haven't joined us earlier today i'm johannes and i will i will be your host for the english language sessions today well a quick reminder on what is horse life obviously we would have loved to have you here in person but because of covet 19 this apparently isn't possible unfortunately so we thought about a creative solution to interact with you anyways and this is harsh life fortunately this new format actually gives us a chance to present you an even larger and more international seminar than ever before so a special welcome to the international audience and thank you very much for joining we hope you enjoy enjoy the next session before introducing our next topic and our next guest a quick uh remem remembering very quickly on what this is about this is horse life and so we hope not only you will hear from us but that we will hear from you as well so please ask all your questions via the chat function of your channels and we'll try to answer as many of them either after the sessions from the presenter or via the chat function directly to our next speaker actually the two upcoming presentations will cover a topic that horse has been dealing intensively with for about two years now and that's called biocontrol or biological plant protection what is it about is actually the biological control of pests and diseases through the targeted application of an active biological agent something that here in the eu is somehow still a niche sector but in other parts of the world like brazil this is already widely accepted and commonly used our next two guests will share insights on this innovative and interesting technology with us from two different perspectives the user's perspective as well as the producers gregory sanders will make a start and talk to us about the practical use of biological agents in large-scale farming operations gregory is director of operations of grupo progreso a family structured group of agricultural companies that will harvest close to 100 000 hectares in two harvests in 2021 their operation is focused on the production of soy corn and cotton gregory will talk to us about using biological control as an element of their integrated plant production protection system and will share information about related opportunities challenges cost effects and benefits to biological management as well as intended future steps welcome gregory sanders i'm an agronomist and operation director of progreso group progreso group is a group of companies familiar companies and individual growers that are established since 2001 in the state of minas gerais in the southeast region of brazil and also in poe the northeast region of brazil we grow cotton corn and soybean and we have also a business of soybean seeds and i would like to thank you a lot harsh to give me this opportunity to participate to this life inviting me and my company to talk about what we are doing in this presentation that we are bored biologic control in our company here in the poe some of the main characteristics of progreso group is we are pioneer in cotton planning with high technology in poe state we started planting cotton here in the year 2003 we built our own gene on the year 2006 and since that we become a reference in cotton here in the region of cerrado's in pov state we are one of the reference in quality of soybean seeds in brazil this we get recently we've invest a lot in our unit here mainly in poe and use of new technologies to make possible to produce soya bean seeds here in poe in a place there is a very hot and offer a big challenge to get a good quality in soybean seeds we are known by being innovative in our production process we always to be pioneered in the region we are operating we have some discovery about ourselves the way adjusting our process by our own to make possible to to explore the crops we are in this region we have a characteristic of share a lot of their knowledge we we learn everything we learn here in the region we used to share with other growers and we for us is a way to to make this these mistakes we we made another people want to do this and we can at the same time when we share learn a lot things that we it would cost a lot in our mistakes so this is a characters we have is to share everything that we learned along all over the years operating here in the region and we are avid to new technologies i must say we are the second harsh customer here in brazil and we are very proud of this talking about our farms we have a aurobranco farm located in paracatu miniaturized state is the only farm we have in the miniaturized state is the first one the group established in the year to 1997 before becoming really a group these farms nowadays two thousand and six two thousand six hundred hectares normally we have all the area planted with soybean in the first harvest and almost 70 percent of the area planted with corn in the second harvest we have another farm the peninsula is the little one we have located in guadalupe poe with 682 hectares irrigated area is very strategic for us to soybean multiply and give a speed in new varieties of soybean that is is being developed we have an imperial farm located in sebastian leo the area tutor is 10 780 hectares planted area normally this farm we make one harvest and they are the the the second harvest only crops to cover the soil and make uh straw in the area we have a hyena de seja a farm located in euro suite yoe with a 14 thousand and 300 hectares planted area normally this area we can plant total air in the first harvest with soybean and something like 10 and 20 percent of this area along the years we can cover if a second harvest of corn and the rest of the area the same of imperial covering with uh crop to make straw that is very very important in our region we have the youngest one a tropical farm located at bacia grande dohibero nowadays 17 400 hectares planted area we can make our something like 15 percent of second harvest with corn and this area is is to be consolidated uh this next season it will reach the mark of 20 21 four hundred hectares and we have the progreso farm that first farm here in poe state the most important area the biggest planted area we have in one farm and it's 36 000 hectares is where we concentrate our industrial uh structures we have a cotton gin we have the our unit of seeds located in poe installed in this farm main activities of the group as i said soybean corn cotton grow and soybeans the the last season 2020 2001 the current season we will have in our farms in poe and minas gerais state a total of 68 300 hectares soybean thousand of corn first harvest and three thousand nine hundred of cotton and as a second harvest we will have sixteen thousand four hundred hectares of corn a thousand and one hundred hectares of serbian and this soybean irrigated eighty hundred and fifty hectares will be at peninsula in the central pivots to multiply new varieties that are in the pipeline to be registered and for the next harvest the soybean seed business we have a unit in orobrenko farm with a structure to 120 000 sacks of 2 100 200 and 200 000 seeds like one sec like this normally for you to have an idea you can plant one hectare of soybean with this number of seeds in one sac so this structure can cover 120 000 hectares of soybean uh all with all this capacity in in a structure and where we can keep all the seed storage in a cold chamber and our main unit is located at progreso farm and a structure to 1.2 million sacks of seeds really impressive we have concept this structure since 2004 and nowadays we are unpleating this structure building a new big chamber cold chamber to store ready seeds to to go to the our customers i would like to talk about a little bit about the history of biologic control in big crops in brazil in the years 80 we had introduction of use of baccalaureates to control soybean caterpillar the anti-carcinogen metals and that time the growers used to pick up the the anti-carcinogen metals that seems to be affected by baccolo virus and freeze all these caterpillars and then in a certain moment put all in a mixer and then put this solution of of caterpillar mix it in a big mixer inside a plane or a terrain spray or a plane and spray all this solution in the in the soybean crop and this time it used to have a very it was very heavy the work to pick up this and to make all this process and we have suffered a lot with the effects of whether the the response of this kind of treatment by using baccalaureates should be very preventive not so you couldn't use this as in the point where the caterpillars was giving you uh damage to your to your soybean where you would lose money it takes a long time to control the the caterpillar so this failed along the years and the growers stopped using this kind of technology then in the years 19 for big crops we know it's a very popular and deep basilis du regensis and a commercial solution ready for use but it was efficient not so much if compared with the chemical control but it was a way to reduce the impact to the interesting bugs present in the crop but the cost of using the pill was so close to the the chemical control that doesn't make sense at that moment if you compare the efficiency and you compare the q the cost it represented that time and it didn't didn't work the there was no not so many growers using this technology at that time then you in the year to the years 2000 the beans soy beans and cotton growers in some regions some more cold weather regions where we have a high altitudes when you have a temperature below 15 degrees at night this this main tree crops start suffering a lot of if sclerotine escalo chiaro this disease caused by this fungus had a have a very difficult and very expensive cause to control by managing fungicides and that's that was an opportunity for the biologic control with by using trichoderma asean to get succeed and since that year that year until now we have a lot of growers in these main tree crops using constantly year by year this kind of fungus or making buying this from companies specialized companies to produce or some producing these by their own in their own farms and we had a a big change in the biologic control in brazil by the year 2012 when we had the introduction of elite corvair parmigia in brazil at that time nobody was ready to deal with this new [Music] caterpillar very resident for the normal insecticides we were being using and to control this this new caterpillar we should use some insecticides that was very expensive at that time and the helicopter after its introduction in brazil live as a legacy many growers after that started using biological control as a way to control the caterpillars and even other uses other purpose and this created a constant demand for all the biological and this environment this new environment created after this event was a perfect for established companies that work at this segment of of business and even for new startups to have an opportunity to grow and the recent most recent uh changing in this segment of business was some companies developed some solutions for the growers to produce their bio control agents inside the farm on farm in the year 2019 progress made a contract with agrobiological companies situated at lemmy some polystate southeast region of brazil that is specialized in producing solutions for production of biological control in on farm this contract we made an agreement to buy only their kit they have a feed kit for bacteria multiplication called multibacter and they've accommodated us 20 bioreactors capable of 2 000 liters each so we have a capacity to produce at the same time 40 000 liters of bio agents at same time and this contract this agreement leave us free to buy any source of any bacteria to any other company to be multiplied inside the b reactors that are accommodated with them the year 2019 we use by using an existing building we installed the 20b reactors of 2000 liters at fazenda progreso centred between other tree farms to produce and deliver all the bio agents to other farms and then november 2019 we started up this structure very simple use by mixing the multibacker kit and the desired bacteria you need we could produce at each reactor 2000 liters of the desired bioagent after producing we put all the this solution in of each bioreactor into ibc's of 1000 liters and after that analyze storage in a cold chamber or direct use by spraying with our planes the main use of each produce are for caterpillar controls nematodes and live disease and we've felt a lot the effects of reducing the impact so this structure is very simple and we are using this spraying that our planes as the same as other chemical insect size and fungicides to control the main bugs and diseases we we have in the our crops with less impact environment we are controlling now white flies the complex of caterpillars stink bugs spider mites and diseases by using these biological products at the same way of chemical we use to do before the multibacter technology create a very simple table for any agent you want to multiply in the columns you have all the agent a commercial prude product that you you can buy to use as a source of of this bacteria the time of multiplication the amount of commercial product to per each 2000 liters of the desired product you you may multiply and also you have the shelf life of the product at the ambient temperature the shelf life extended that's more or less 50 percent when cap when you storage this this product at 12 degrees celsius and you have the target for each agent you have a target a specific target on the crops and also the dosage of each each product to to control the target for instance this table help you to plan everything you need to produce how long will it take and how long will it be have available for you to use like the first column basilist origins uh variety as a why the commercial centauri it takes 48 hours to to be ready the most you will use is 4 kilograms of commercial product to produce 2 000 liters of the the product and if you keep this at ambient temperature eight days duration if you put in the cold chamber 12 days of duration and the purpose of this product is for spodoptera species and pseudo pluses pieces and you take between three or four liters per hectare spraying to control these caterpillars in any crop it could be soybean beans cotton and here we have the nine main agents we work with in the last season 2019 2020 with any purpose you have here in in this table to have an idea what we did last season 2019 2020 here you are some volume of each agent we multiply it the total amount of bu agent we produce it on our b reactors was a total of one million two hundred and ten thousand liters of bu agents most of them with a purpose to control the caterpillars talking about advantages so many you can save interests bug that help you in the pests control and biological you feel this a lot we can feel the the increase of spiders in the in our crops even then so i've been even in cotton by using this kind of products and reducing the chemical control and talking about money saving with i find a very simple way to compare what what's being saved in about in terms of money not to mention and other advantages and other benefits of the use of the biological control that are difficult to measure we didn't measure that but talking about money like soya bean last year we sprayed a biological it was an average in soybeans of 2.5 springs only using the biological control with with no chemical there so 2.5 sprains are i changed the chemical by biological with the same result of the chemical but with economy of 4.1 dollar per hectare if you multiply by 2.5 and the area a total economy of 488 thousand dollars almost 489 thousand dollars in soybean only considering the caterpillar control with biological in cotton we had a little bit more sprayers we used the four sprays removing the chemical control only biological control so the the chemicals in this kind of of purples are a little bit more expensive so the reduction was eight five point eighty five dollars per spray multiplying that by four sprays and the area four thousand five hundred hectares we have an economy of 105 000 so the total considering just this crop these two crops and this control of caterpillars we have something like 594 thousand dollars the pandemic of coronavirus uh we suffer with that because we couldn't get any more sources to multiply we had the multibacter kit but we didn't we couldn't buy the source of bacteria mainly the bacillus turijins and saccharopolis prospinosa for use in the coverage crops that we plant in the areas that we don't make this second harvest we plant millet we plant bracciaria and we we could have a higher economy a higher saving of money if we could use that that point that we main we intend to use in this next harvest so we are in the rain season 2020 2021 as we are about in the middle of this rain season so we are estimating um economy much higher than the last year so in soybean this year we have a little we felt a little a little lower pressure of caterpillars in soybean and also cotton i don't know but i i estimate to be the same so talking about soybean we believe we will use 1.5 spraying in the total area removing the chemical control and using the biological control so the economy of a little bit higher this year because the dollar is increased its value against the real and the cost of all the biological was in real so this year the economy is a little bit higher than last year in terms of prices of product so multiplying 5.0 to 1.1 1.5 spraying to in the total area of 49 and 900 hectares of soybean treated with biological we will have a economy of uh 375 000 this year we remove it the first chemical fungicide spraying we changed this by using the bacillus soup chilis so we removed one chemical spraying in the first in the vegetative phase of the soybean and introduced only the basil subtil so considerable reduction of costs 6.4 44 will reduce the cost in this spraying one one spray in total area we have a savings of 321 000 about cotton this year the area is 3900 hectares four springs because uh the difference of course become higher 7.04 dollars per per sprain by changing chemical to biological so if you multiply these four by four and by the area we had 109 000 of economy in this year different uh to the year 2019 and 2020 we have we will do the the control of caterpillars in other crops like sorghum millet and brachiari the total will be 50 400 hectares we estimate at least two sprains for economy because the products the chemical inset size we use in this in these situations are a little bit cheaper than the other than the cotton and the soybean will be a reduction of cost of 2.06 dollars per sprain multiply it by two and multiply it by the area will will expect uh 207 000 dollars of economy so estimating all the all the use only based on what i changed by chemical to the biological this year we expect saving 1 million 14 000 dollars of savings by change the chemical to biological with with no with no uh loss of of performance we had some chance comparing the season 2019 to 2020 to the season 2200 2020 in 2021 that is in course we removed the chrome bacterium subsur guy to our from our program because the efficiency of this kind of agent you should at least spray this weekly and this is this impacting in our operation mainly in the planes areas to be sprayed is very very high and doesn't make sense to us to continuous with this agent that requests so many so many sprains because normally the use of biologicals goes with other products goes with fertilizer and there is no significant change in our in our process of of production the first as i said the first chemical fungicide sprayed in soybean which was changed by chemical to the biological in most of the varieties of soybean so this gave us a significant reduction of costs but we didn't see any change in the performance of the control of the fungus disease leave diseases in soybean and we are concluding our microbiology laboratory to have a sample of of each production bioreactor and analyze this sample to ensure we are having a good quality product to be sprayed in the hour in our areas we plan some chains for the next season 2021 2022 agro-biological company that we make that agreement we have a contract is developing a feeding kit to produce fungi agents in the same bu reactor at the same system we are multiplying the bacterias so by these we will have some new agents that are very important in our production like we will be able with this work we will be able to produce balvari basiana to control whitefly on soybean and cotton we will be able to produce izaria from formosa rosia to control daobulus mites that's a very important bug nowadays in the corn that request a lot of sprains to control this pest and you have to take too much care of the corn you have to protect against this bug because is it transmits some virus that can make a disaster in your corn so we expect a very significant reduce of course in the control of this main main two pests the whitefly and bulus might said corn though blues minds that corn and white fly and soybean and cotton and uh we plan to start producing trichoderma arzianum and the purpose of this is to use in the full in the planning forum during soybean planning operation to reduce the nematodes to reduce the soil disease that attack the roofs of all the crops here in our explored crops so this uh these changes for the next season will increase a lot this money savings we are expecting a lot of money savings by this main two new agents these fungi new agents that we will be able to introduce in our control system and that's it well i would like to thank you all for the attention i hope you enjoyed my presentation and this can contribute to your business and i can you can contact me via email that i show in the beginning of presentation gregory at fazendaprogresso.com.bro even accessing our social media live with us from brazil gregory welcome and thank you very much for this very insightful and interesting presentation and that you shared with us um how's it going in brazil we are starting to harvest very good that sounds good so already good luck for that gregory thanks for being available for answering some questions and the first question isn't directly related to the topic you were talking about it's rather with regard to the opportunity to do two harvests in one rain season one of our viewers noticed that in the first half for the first harvest you plant around 81 000 hectares while for the second harvest it's only and that's still an impressive number but roughly 20 000 hectares so what's going on with the rest with the rest of the 60 000 hectares what what's being done with them at the time of the second harvest we used to plant some crops to cover the soil we need a lot of straw to to protect from losing the moisture here in brazil is very important to to keep this and we don't have a window a correct window to produce corn for in the whole area that was the best the best world for us and we use in other crops that request a little bit less water to to produce a a month a considerable amount of uh straw okay that's very important for us okay well thanks on that coming uh to your presentation and to questions on that so you made it certainly clear that you're using an integrated system for plant protection so you're not replacing 100 of chemicals with biological control so question on that is what's the ratio of biological control and chemical control and what efficiency level do you see on biological control compared to chemical control okay the the situations we remove it uh as i was talking about in my presentation for caterpillars in soybean we removed all the chemical control but you have a stink bugs white fly and other kind of pests you can't control that efficiently in the system we have by using biological but caterpillars that is the the we what the tasks we most spend money in the control the biological biological substitute changed every chemical to biological okay and that other pests we continue to use the chemical but the fungicides control we remove it we change it 25 between 25 and 30 in 30 percent by using substituting the bio the chemical to biological so specific targets talking about pests we are we changed it 25 percent and the of course to biological and the fungicides control 25 to 30 percent do you do you see an increase in that possibly in the future or um will that stay at the same level for the time being so we force these specific targets like stink bugs and white flies we have we expect a better control if you by using fungus where the bacterias that the main bacteria that we are producing on farm are not efficiency in the system we have but with fungus that we expect the next season be producing on farm we expect to control these other uh these other bugs by by using this this new kind of engine agents um on one of your last slides you uh mentioned that one of the agents you used in the first season in 2019 2020 you removed that um can you tell us a little bit more about the reasons for removing that what was um what what made you take that decision was it efficiency that made you decide to switch over again to chemical that specific agent chromobacterium sugar was being used to control the stink bugs and white fly but to be efficient we should spray at least weekly so at each seven days we would have to spray again the chrome bacteria subsur guy to have efficient control and our operational capacity of spraying with planes and other sprayers we we are not uh we don't have this capacity to do weekly spraying all over our areas so there that doesn't make sense to continue with that agent that's why we stop it using and um so do i understand right that there is an effect on workload for biological control of biological agents so that you in general would say there is a higher workload when applying biological agents because you need to spray more possibly as well as more often in this case as i said before i remove it because it it would increase the number of spraying but the system we are now the changes we made from the last season to this actual season we are not spraying more we substitute the chemical by biological in the same spray okay and the the main the main point is when you use a chemical you have a need to spray you go to your storage you got a product and you spray and with bio-biological produced on farm is very different you have to to see the need you have to produce the biological agent you need and you have to spray that and you have a very lower shelf life of each product you produce if compared with to chemical so everything must be very synchronized to be successful in this kind of control did you change anything within your farm system to be able to do so to anticipate when a biological agent is needed did you i don't know hire weather specialists or run your own weather forecast system or things like that to to be able to to adopt to that yes we have to like to like how do we say in portuguese to have all the area in your hands to see to know everything is happening to control in this in the right point you can't lose the control you have to get the control in your hands of the whole area that's the main difference and you have to synchronize how long you take to produce the product and you have the capacity of planes and so everything must be you have to to be at least two steps ahead if compared to other system by using only chemicals a question in this context is do you spray the whole farm at once or do you check within the fields which area has caterpillars and really needs to be sprayed yes that's real what we do we we spray when needed normally when needed the first the first spray between the first 40 days of this mainly soy bean you as on demand but we have to enter spraying for the fungicides mainly to protect from ferrous in asia i don't know how to say that in english it's a very important disease we have in soybean and yeah do you they have so i've been roast like let's say like that i don't know in the in the united states they they don't have this we have uh this roast and we have to protect from that and at least 14 days each 14 days you are spraying and if you need to put something to control caterpillars you put if not you don't do it okay that's that's the main point as needed okay all right thank you for that um coming back to your integrated system since when exactly so you you mentioned in your presentation that you started to produce your own biological agents um in 2019 for the first time um and was 2019 actually also the first time that you actually used biological agents or did you start the usage already before some agents we were using before basil study genesis we use it a long time ago some some situations but it was our our only usage so we buy like a d-pal i mentioned that my presentation i for a long time used the d-pal but the cost of the pail and the efficiency if compared to the the other doesn't make sense at that time and then we we were present to agro-biologica the company that gave us all the support to to produce on farm and we start from zero producing to using a whole area at the same year so we start because the cost allows us to do this okay um coming back just quickly once again to the um question of of the actual application um um one of the audience asks how many liters of water per hectare do you spray with the three to four liters of bacteria so in in your in your table that you showed in your presentation there was i think like you need three to four liters of product with how many liters of water would that be sprayed per hectare normally we we well yeah oh here you are again well we lost you for a second but you're back again thinking perfect okay normally each agent between three or four liters per hectare like if i you will use three agents normally between nine and twelve liters but they spray now we we can hear you we can hear you uh gregory you can continue talking we hear you so yeah by by the biological we use only by planes depending on the the amount of chemical and biological we are going to spray normally it goes from nine to fif to 18 liters of total of total uh total leaders per hectare total amounts yeah okay great so i think it's time for um one last question um that would be regarding um the economic effects so thank you very much first of all for sharing this profound insights on numbers with us and with the audience i mean when one looks at those savings that you mentioned one has to ask oneself why is not everybody doing it this way because the savings that you that you mentioned that you show are so obvious that that normally everybody would have to do it immediately the same way um so the question is is there any any negative effect that that comes along without saving so do you have a less turnover less revenue that you have to compare those savings with um or is it actually the true savings and and and it's it's just a positive effect very generally yes that is the only the savings i can measure by changing the chemical by changing the chemical by biological and the cost of this change because the rest is the equal and the efficiency we are having in the in the products we kept use are the same we are not there are a lot of effects of not don't when you use this you don't kill benefit uh benefit bugs you have in the crop and there are a lot of things i i the nematodes control that we are we are not mentioning this and so the difficult to to is not really the efficiency the efficiency when you have a synchronized production system are the same of chemical by with a lot of savings of money but the difficulties people to manage to have the the the control to produce the the agents on farm to build this so it's a it's it increase you uh the difficult to to to deal with the problems you have to and another another another thing that is a manufacturer to do the biological products on farm it's an another activity another activity you have to to keep in your farm gregory thank you very much um i think that was very very impressive to learn and get these insights from you um for me personally i learned that that that i think there's not that much um against um integrating biological control in your system and i think it's definitely worth looking closer to it here in the european union as well looks very promising to me what you've already discovered in brazil so yeah once again thank you very much for joining us for giving us these insights and all the best for your harvest and hopefully talk to you soon thank you very much johannes thank you so dear viewers um that was gregory sanders from brazil with uh yeah very impressive insights on biological control from the user's perspective horse life will continue in about well already ten minutes at six o'clock central european time with our next guest on the same topic but from a different perspective so i hope you will join us again soon and see you in a bit",
