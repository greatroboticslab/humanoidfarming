  "text": "easy to grow a Wonder in the kitchen tender fruits are nearly round mildly sweet flavor creamy texture plump and variably ribbed there's a nice poetry to Seed Catalog descriptions but there's also a lot of technical terms in there so we're going to talk about the meaning of some of those words and how they relate to your garden there's a few different types of seeds that you'll see advertised organic is one so organic seeds have been grown in organic conditions on a farm so that means no chemical fertilizers pesticides or herbicides as well as a whole host of other variables this one's listed as USDA organic certified whereas this one just says organic lettuce seed another thing you'll see is non-GMO project you are not going to accidentally buy any genetically modified or GMO seeds those are highly regulated they're very expensive and they're for agricultural producers if you find something that doesn't say non-GMO project certified doesn't mean it's GMO it's not something that you have to worry about hairloom seeds is another thing you see listed hairloom generally refers to plants different types of cultivars that have been grown for a long time some people say before the 1950s some people say 50 years I'm not sure that there's an actual rule but often they have a historical or cultural significance to an area which is why they still are grown you'll see some seeds listed as treated seeds I actually have some here that I ordered by accident you can see these PE seeds are pink so these are treated with a fungicide this will just keep them from rotting when they go in the ground pelleted seeds are not the same as treated seeds for smaller seeds like lettuce seeds what they are is they're actually a small clay coating that turns it into a seed that is about the size of a radish seeds so you end up with something that's easier to handle that's easier to plant out it's not necessary if you're not planting out a whole ton of plants but if you're planning to save seeds from your garden it's important to know if the plant is open-pollinated or if it's a hybrid so open-pollinated plants you could save the seeds from and then they will produce the same seeds the next year they pollinate naturally in whatever mechanism the plant uses it's different for all different types if it's a hybrid plant it's been more specifically crossbreed by agronomists who have picked out certain traits from A couple of different cultivars and put them together that plant will not produce seed that will produce a new plant the seeds may be sterile or they may just produce something totally different than the plant that you started with so you don't want to save seeds from hybrids hybrids are also often more expensive because of the technology that goes into them and you want to just make sure you notice how many seeds you're getting in the past I've ordered pepper seeds that were hybrids and then realized I only got 10 seeds in my envelope another word that's related to that is parthenocarpic or self fertile you're going to see that listed in association with growing in green houses if you're growing cucumbers or tomato in a greenhouse there may not be as many pollinating insects around and so something that's parthenocarpic is self fertile they'll often grow without seeds and they don't need to be fertilized by another plant in order to produce fruit seed cataloges will give you a lot of information about timing as well DTM days to maturity how many days it will take between when the plant is either directly seated in the ground or a transplant is put in the ground so I use them as a comparison point just to understand if I'm looking for something that's fast or something that's slow otherwise I'm not going to really take that information and assume that it's going to be true in my garden any perennial plants that you're ordering will also say Hardy till Zone 2 to 4 or Hardy to zone six it'll list them in there note that the USDA zones are different than the Canadian zones so check which zone you're in and then check which country your catalog comes from so that's how cold the plant can get over the winter so you'll also see a lot of growth habits listed on here so these are different ways that the plant grows and it's good to match these to the conditions that you want in your garden you'll see different things like spicy Bush basil is does well in containers as well as the garden the plants are small and Dome shaped so they're small dwarf semi- dwarf climbing those are words that will be used another big distinction here is between determinant and indeterminant those terms are usually used when talking about tomatoes Det perent means that the plant will grow to a certain size and it will produce fruit and seeds but then when it's produced enough seeds that it's sort of finished its life cycle and thinks that it's passed that on it will stop and it will die indeterminate they will continue to grow fruit and they will continue to produce seeds until the weather conditions change around them it gets too cold they dry out then they will die the days get too short something like that word you'll see a lot is resistance so there's a few different types of resistance you'll see these parlees say that it has intermediate resistance to dowy mildew resistance to uh diseases is very common you'll see that a lot in tomatoes sometimes it will say something specific like resistant to Tomato tobacco mosaic virus sometimes it will be General it will say good resistance package that's bolt resistance is another one that you see often something that can grow as the weather gets warm without going to seed if you've ever grown cilantro I find is an especially common one it'll grow really well in the cooler weather but as soon as you get a hot spell it'll just send up a giant amount of flowers and the leaves are not as good to eat also crack resistant Tomatoes uh will often crack especially if they get too much water if it's a wet year at a certain point in time when the fruit are forming the skin will actually crack so crack resistance just means that it's less likely to happen um they've been bred to have a thicker skin and more of an ability to to take on that excess water field holding how long something can sit in the field without needing to be picked maybe that's important if you want to grow you know a whole bunch of head lettuces and sort of leave them and pick them one at a time growth rate is often said Slow versus Fast growth rate intermediate growth rate grows well early grows well late likes heat likes cold you'll see all of these descriptive terms uniformity I often see so that's good if you're doing some preserving projects where you want beets that are all the same size or if you're selling them in a market and you want them to be a similar size and shape and then there's all the other words perfectly compliments strong handles holds color unique coloration weight speed and crunch these are the fun ones and then you've got all kinds of words that have to do with the flavors rich flavor tarte flavor sweet flavor maybe a little bit arbitrary but also pretty exciting to think about have a good time reading catalogs and hopefully this will help you understand what they're talking about I'm just going to go back to the Poetry now attractive dark green Savoy leaves on tall upright heads good sweet flavor",
