00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,759
To many, sugarcane might just look like

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,519
a tall grassy plant growing in the

3
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:12,400
fields. But for much of the world, it's

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,160
so much more. It's brown gold, the

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,039
lifeblood of a multi-billion dollar

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,199
industry that fuels global economies,

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,039
supports millions of farmers, and

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,400
produces everything from sweet treats to

9
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:26,400
bofuels. But have you ever wondered how

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,160
this humble stock transforms into the

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,039
pure white crystals sitting in your

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,039
kitchen?

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,920
The journey begins in endless fields

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,239
where sugarcane stretches toward the

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,000
blazing sun. Thanks to cuttingedge

17
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,879
harvesting machines built specifically

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,200
for this crop, thick, juicy stalks are

19
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,719
cut close to the ground, cleaned, and

20
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,550
loaded for the next stage of their

21
00:00:52,719 --> 00:01:03,520
transformation.

[Music]

23
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,920
From the field, the cane is transported

24
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,240
to high-tech factories where not a

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,560
single part goes to waste. Under the

26
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,360
watchful eyes of skilled engineers and

27
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:19,280
guided by precision automation, the cane

28
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:22,000
is crushed, filtered, boiled, and spun

29
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,240
until it becomes sparkling white sugar.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,640
But the story doesn't end there. The

31
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,799
byproducts like fibrous bags are turned

32
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,360
into green energy in sustainable

33
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,920
building materials while nutrient-rich

34
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,040
molasses is repurposed into animal feed

35
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,200
or fermented into alcohol. Today on

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,759
the full story behind this incredibly

40
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,320
versatile crop. From the harvest to the

41
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,920
final grain, you'll discover how modern

42
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,759
agricultural machines are

43
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,360
revolutionizing every step of the

44
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:59,119
sugarcane industry, maximizing

45
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,560
efficiency, minimizing waste, and

46
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,320
pushing toward a more sustainable

47
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,159
future. So, sit back, relax, and get

48
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,770
ready to dive into the sweet and

49
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:26,000
mechanical journey. Let's get started.

[Music]

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,879
Before we can harvest those tall, juicy

52
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,360
stalks of sugar cane, everything starts

53
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:35,200
with planting. And these days, it's no

54
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,080
longer backbreaking labor with rusty

55
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,040
tools. In today's techdriven fields,

56
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,680
powerful machines take over. Precise,

57
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,319
efficient, and immune to the heat.

58
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,080
Welcome to mechanized sugarce planting.

59
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,720
Instead of chopping and planting by

60
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,519
hand, farmers now load seed canes into a

61
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,440
hopper, and the machine does the rest.

62
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,239
Cutting stalks to choice, placing them

63
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,040
into furrows, covering with soil, and

64
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:04,080
adding fertilizer, all in one seamless

65
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,800
pass. Like a Swiss watch on wheels,

66
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,360
modern planters ensure every segment is

67
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,720
perfectly spaced and placed for optimal

68
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,120
growth. The result, bigger yields, less

69
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,360
labor, and no more scorching days in the

70
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,840
sun. And don't think these machines are

71
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,720
clunky beasts. They're built to handle

72
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,599
all kinds of terrain, from flat lands to

73
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,000
hilly fields, with some even using GPS

74
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:31,040
and soil sensors to adjust planting

75
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,440
depth in real time. It's smart farming

76
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,599
straight out of a sci-fi film. With

77
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,080
speeds of tens of thousands of stalks

78
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,159
per hour, these machines are reshaping

79
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,159
the sugar industry from the ground up.

80
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,560
And as advanced as they are, the mission

81
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:47,680
remains simple. Help each cutting grow

82
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,680
into a strong, healthy cane. Stick with

83
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:54,360
modern agri machines and we'll show you

the gentle prelude to the symphony

88
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,600
called sweetness, then harvesting is the

89
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,440
dynamic climax where the mechanical

90
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,080

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,759
harvesting process with Modern

96
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,000
Machinery, where the entire field shakes

97
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,560
to the rhythm of steel, oil, and

98
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,120
high-tech innovation. In the past,

99
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,800
sugarcane harvesting was a laborious,

100
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,360
time-consuming task that required

101
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,520
immense effort. Dozens of workers had to

102
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,160
wade through sugarcane fields, chopping

103
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,080
down each stock with knives, bundling

104
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,400
them together, and dragging them to

105
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,720
bullet carts under the blazing sun and

106
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,980
sometimes swarmed by mosquitoes. But

107
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,190
those days are long gone.

Now, with just a single sugarcane

112
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,840
harvester, you can do the work of an

113
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:34,800
entire army. Faster, cleaner, and with

114
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,919
incredible precision. Modern sugarcane

115
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,080
harvesters look like extraterrestrial

116
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:42,880
robots. Tall, versatile, and always

117
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,800
hungry for sugarcane. When operating,

118
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,360
the machine glides smoothly between the

119
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,360
sugarcane rows. Its spinning blades

120
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,919
quickly cutting the stalks near the base

121
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,800
without damaging the roots, allowing the

122
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:56,800
plant to regenerate for the next season.

123
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,720
Above, an automatic conveyor system

124
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,120
pulls the sugar cane into the machine's

125
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,400
body like it's swallowing spaghetti,

126
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,680
then neatly cuts it into standardized

127
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:08,720
sections, perfect for trucks and

128
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,960
pressing machines. The leaves and tops,

129
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,720
parts that aren't rich in sugar, are

130
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,880
immediately separated and returned to

131
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,160
the field as a natural cover, keeping

132
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,199
the soil moist and replenishing

133
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:22,160
nutrients. Fast, neat, clean, and

134
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:24,560
eco-friendly. This is sugarcane

135
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,479
harvesting in the new generation.

136
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,039
Moreover, advanced machines are equipped

137
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:31,120
with GPS, moisture sensors, yield

138
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,280
analysis computers, and even

139
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,360
surveillance cameras. This helps

140
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,919
operators know exactly where they are in

141
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,360
the field, which area has mature sugar

142
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,960
cane, and where to adjust cutting

143
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,120
speeds. It's like controlling a mobile

144
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,360
command center, not just a simple

145
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,000
machine. In countries like Brazil,

146
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,919
Thailand, or India, these harvesters are

147
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,080
specially designed to suit the terrain

148
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,560
of each region. There are four-wheel

149
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,560
machines for large planes, compact

150
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,039
machines for navigating between small

151
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,680
field borders, and even ones that can

152
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,599
climb hills. Because with sugar cane,

153
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,360
wherever there's sun and soil, it's a

154
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:11,599
place to harvest. And did you know an

155
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,400
average harvester can process more than

156
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:17,120
100 tons of sugar cane per day, the

157
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,520
equivalent of dozens of manual laborers?

158
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,000
Not only does this save costs, but it

159
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,479
also reduces the pressure on farmers,

160
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,039
increases regional productivity, and

161
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,960
most importantly ensures the freshness

162
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,280
of the sugar cane is preserved until

163
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,280
it's sent to the factory. Sugar cane

164
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,919
harvesting videos are always the most

165
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,759
popular on the PJ Modern Agri machines

166
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,960
channel because they're not just

167
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,720
visually stunning, but also inspiring.

168
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,680
There's something special about watching

169
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,160
the entire field of sugarcane move. Each

170
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,479
row falls steadily. The stalks fly into

171
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,199
the containers while the leaves gently

172
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,520
fall to the ground like summer snow. The

173
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,680
entire process showcases not only the

174
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,000
power of machinery, but also the

175
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,000
advancement of modern agriculture where

176
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,280
humans and machines work together

177
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,520
creating a closed loop system,

178
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:09,440
efficient, clean, and extremely smart.

179
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,080
And if you're wondering what happens to

180
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,319
the sugar cane after it's cut, then get

181
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,560
ready for the next stage in the journey.

182
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,280
Transporting it to the factory,

183
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,520
extracting the juice, boiling the sugar,

184
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,280
and refining it into sparkling sugar

185
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,720
crystals. But that's a story for another

186
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,960
episode. For now, just admire that

187
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,759
machine gliding through the fields like

188
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,800
a steel dragon, taking down each sugar

189
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,760
cane clump in perfect mechanical rhythm.

190
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,279
This is the beauty of technology in

191
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,880
agriculture where every drop of sweat

192
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,519
from the farmer is supported by

193
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,080
machinery to make it sweeter, more

194
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,190
precise, and more deserving than ever

195
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:57,279
before.

After leaving the field in the arms of

199
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:24,160
modern harvesters, sugar cane stalks

200
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,959
begin a new journey from plant to white

201
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,720
gold. Loaded onto specialized trucks,

202
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,750
they race along village roads towards

203
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:46,350
sugar refineries.

[Music]

205
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,200
Time is sugar. Freshly cut cane must be

206
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,839
processed quickly to preserve its

207
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,560
sweetness. At the factory, stalks roll

208
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:59,200
onto massive conveyor belts leading into

209
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,600
powerful steel rollers that crush them

210
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,080
and extract the juice. The sound of

211
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,440
metal and liquid fills the air, a

212
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:20,340
mechanical symphony of sweetness.

[Applause]

216
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,440
But this raw juice isn't ready yet. It

217
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,519
must pass through filters and settling

218
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,399
tanks to remove mud, fibers, and

219
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:41,120
impurities. Next comes the most magical

220
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:43,120
stage, boiling. Inside giant vats, the

221
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,399
juice is heated until it thickens into

222
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:49,040
syrup, then crystallizes into sugar.

223
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,120
Every step, temperature, timing,

224
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,440
stirring is tightly controlled by

225
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,000
automated systems while engineers

226
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,720
monitor from control rooms. Once

227
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,399
crystallized, the mix enters a

228
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:03,120
centrifuge, spinning rapidly to separate

229
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,680
molasses from sugar. The molasses goes

230
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,800
on to make rum or feed while the sugar

231
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,720
is dried and cooled into snowy white

232
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:13,200
crystals, ready for the world. But

233
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,800
nothing is wasted. The gas becomes

234
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,800
biomass fuel, paper, even furniture.

235
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,200
Steam and waste water are treated and

236
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:24,040
reused, creating a clean, circular

237
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,160
system. A modern model of zerowaste

238
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:28,000
agriculture. So next time you see a

239
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,640
spoonful of sugar, remember the

240
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,680
incredible journey behind it. From sunny

241
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:36,800
fields to roaring machines, from boiling

242
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,399
vats to sparkling crystals. And here at

243
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,600
Modern Aggra Machines, we bring you

244
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:58,720
every sweet moment.

246
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,480
think sugarce bag gas is just lifeless

247
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,800
waste after juicing? Not at all. In

248
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,760
modern agriculture, beasi is a green

249
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:12,959
treasure. A raw material reborn into

250
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:15,200
countless useful forms. One major use,

251
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,360
organic fertilizer. When dried and

252
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,720
fermented with probiotics or organic

253
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:23,360
waste, bagas becomes nutrient-rich humus

254
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,920
packed with potassium, fiber, and

255
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:29,360
beneficial microbes. It nurtures healthy

256
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,760
crops, improves soil, retains moisture,

257
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,839
and prevents erosion, continuing the

258
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,920
sugar cane's life cycle right back into

259
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,320
the field. But its journey doesn't end

260
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:41,000
there. Be gas is also turned into

261
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,519
biodegradable paper, plates, and food

262
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,800
containers. That sturdy box holding your

263
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:49,040
sticky rice, likely compressed bags.

264
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,839
It's a smart, eco-friendly alternative

265
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,279
to plastic. Now exported globally by

266
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,959
countries like India, Brazil, and

267
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:59,600
Vietnam. Even more of the gas is used to

268
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:02,639
make biochar, a special charcoal that

269
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,440
enriches soil, locks away carbon, and

270
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,839
supports sustainable farming. Clearly,

271
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,639
nothing from sugarcane is wasted. From

272
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:13,360
sweet juice to smart reuse, this plant

273
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,680
helps build a cleaner, greener future.

274
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,000
And all of this, you're discovering it

275
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,800
with us right here at Modern Agri

276
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,520

277
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:37,069

280
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:44,000
sugarcane in the field to the pristine

281
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,000
white sugar crystals has come to an end.

282
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,240
It is a long journey but one filled with

283
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,800
wonder where each step in the production

284
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,120
chain is elevated by modern technology

285
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,760
from the powerful harvesters to the

286
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,000
sophisticated production lines. Looking

287
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,160
back we can appreciate the intricacy of

288
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,720
every process from preserving the

289
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,560
freshness of the sugarcane to maximizing

290
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,560
the use of byproducts and even

291
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,360
protecting the environment through air

292
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:11,279
and wastewater treatment systems. It's

293
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,920
not just about creating an everyday

294
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,920
product we're familiar with. Sugar is a

295
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,680
vibrant testament to the collaboration

296
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:21,279
between the power of nature and human

297
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:23,160
ingenuity. Modern technologies not only

298
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,079
reduce labor, but also increase

299
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:28,959
productivity, protect resources, and

300
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:31,199
deliver sustainable economic value. Each

301
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:33,120
sugar crystal, though small, represents

302
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:36,160
the tireless labor and brilliance of

303
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,079
scientific innovations. In it, we see

304
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,639
not only material value, but also a

305
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:43,279
story of transformation, a reminder that

306
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,760
humans never cease to innovate. improve

307
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,760
and enhance the quality of life. If you

308
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,079
are someone who appreciates creativity

309
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,560
in agriculture, this journey is an

310
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:54,959
endless source of inspiration, a

311
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,680
reminder of the power of technology and

312
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,959
the skill in mastering natural

313
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:01,410
resources. Thank you for joining us on
