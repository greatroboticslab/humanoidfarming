00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
hey guys it's Anne if you are new here

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,140
and you are looking for an active

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,720
homeworm farming Community you are in

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:12,599
the right place today my goal is to show

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:15,000
and explain my highest producing worm

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:18,180
bin and there's just the two things that

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,859
you need to know in order to have a very

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,320
productive bin

9
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:24,119
I call this the wedge system it's a

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,740
little bit modified but we'll go through

11
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:27,480
that in a little bit and if you're not

12
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,939
new here you're going to see

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,679
that blue has an empty spot

14
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:33,780
which means that I've been doing a

15
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:37,140
massive amount of harvesting this is

16
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,480
about 10 to 15 gallons of worm castings

17
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,700
that I've harvested in the last

18
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,399
three weeks or four weeks since the last

19
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:47,040
time you've seen the spin you don't need

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,440
a five foot long Barrel in order to have

21
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:52,800
this kind of productivity you just need

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,300
a couple of good tips in order for you

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,699
to be successful

24
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:00,000
so what you're seeing right here is the

25
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:02,039
overs from when I do my sifting

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,960
so these are the ones that are not

27
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,840
exactly

28
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,939
you know finished so one of the things

29
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,080
that I have started doing that is a

30
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:12,659
little bit different than what I've done

31
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,360
in the past is I have been taking these

32
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,860
overs that are you know hard bits of

33
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,560
stuff that the worms haven't finished

34
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,659
and very likely some warm cocoons that

35
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,000
have gone dormant and I've been putting

36
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:26,840
these in with my prepared bedding

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,360
instead of using the finished castings

38
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,220
and one of the things that finished

39
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,200
castings have that these don't have are

40
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,020
usually some warm cocoons

41
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,479
so my prepared bedding usually ages from

42
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:42,240
three two to three weeks before I start

43
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:44,220
using it and that is one of your first

44
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,079
things that you need to realize is that

45
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,600
you need to be prepared

46
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,060
when you are doing your worm bin so

47
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,880
thinking about the end in mind and

48
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,520
basically getting ready

49
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,520
to be successful and harvest as much as

50
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,860
you can in the least amount of time with

51
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,880
your worm bins so what you're seeing

52
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:08,940
here are seeds and little bits of shells

53
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:11,099
Etc and bedding that has not fully

54
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,020
composted now what I'm going to do is

55
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:16,260
I'm going to take some of these overs

56
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,879
and I'm going to put those in my bin

57
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,260
with my prepared bedding and I will link

58
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:22,319
my recipe

59
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:24,300
uh the video for my recipe up above here

60
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,300
so what we're going to do is we're just

61
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:30,480
going to take a couple handfuls of this

62
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:34,379
in a 45 gallon tote with my shredded

63
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:37,760
paper and coconut coir and this

64
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:40,680
all of the you know nutrients all of the

65
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,019
bacteria and fungi that live within the

66
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,319
castings as well as the little worm

67
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:47,940
cocoons in here these are going to

68
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:50,640
explode into growth once they get into

69
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:52,739
high moisture and they are going to

70
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,319
start turning that bedding

71
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:58,019
into castings

72
00:02:55,319 --> 00:03:00,180
before I even use it in my worm bin so

73
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:02,760
I'm going to grab this and throw it over

74
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,580
a couple handfuls

75
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:09,560
the exact amount is not

76
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,560
you know 100 percent necessary

77
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,220
scale it to whatever size bin you're

78
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:16,440
using to make your bedding if you indeed

79
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,879
choose to make your bedding ahead of

80
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,099
schedule

81
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:22,620
for me that makes a layer about this

82
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:25,860
deep all the way across the bottom

83
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:28,560
and so now that we've got our handful of

84
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:31,620
these overs let's start moving the wedge

85
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:35,459
down getting prepared

86
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:39,060
to be successful is my first tip so in

87
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:41,340
the case of this bed this bin I'm doing

88
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,220
a wedge system which means that all of

89
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,239
the finished stuff is down at this end

90
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:48,120
it's drier

91
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:51,060
it has very little food left in it

92
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,640
and the worms actually move out on their

93
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,200
own so as I move this over you can tell

94
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,360
this does have a decent amount of

95
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,440
moisture and it also has some worms in

96
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,739
it

97
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:03,420
but this is the oldest edge of the bin

98
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:05,940
so we're going to go through this and

99
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:08,099
move everything down

100
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,439
so that's what I mean by starting off

101
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:13,200
with the end in mind my goal here is to

102
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:16,260
get finished castings now these castings

103
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,940
are probably about five months old maybe

104
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:20,160
a little bit older

105
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:21,120
and my goal here is to move them down

106
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,160
here

107
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,440
where I'm not going to mess with them I

108
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,060
might put some air in them by you know

109
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,800
fluffing them up every once in a while

110
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,120
but I'm not going to feed this end and

111
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,460
I'm not going to purposefully give it

112
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,100
any moisture

113
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:38,639
and in so doing I am going to set this

114
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:41,100
bin up for success for a fast Harvest so

115
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,780
what I'm doing here is fluffing this up

116
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,360
moving it over

117
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:48,600
the fluffing part gets all of the air in

118
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,400
there so that it can start drying

119
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,440
so little by little

120
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,960
we're making sure to kind of go in order

121
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,820
so first in first out

122
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,320
anybody who's in manufacturing will know

123
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,960
that as fifo

124
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:04,199
probably also in retail so first in

125
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,280
first out these are the oldest of the

126
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:07,680
castings

127
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,500
and I'm very slowly moving them over in

128
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,780
the order in which they had been started

129
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:15,600
now these castings will start to dry

130
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:18,120
over the next month or so

131
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,300
the worms are going to start moving down

132
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,580
to the feeding end of the bin

133
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:27,660
leaving us with castings that we can

134
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:30,060
Harvest again in another month or so

135
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,520
so what we're doing we're still we're

136
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,740
moving we're getting into like the next

137
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,780
area here this part's probably three

138
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,759
months old

139
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:42,240
picking out any of the big pieces here

140
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:44,340
making my life easier when I go to sift

141
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,180
so we'll still just keep moving things

142
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,979
over

143
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,080
I've had a lot of questions about the

144
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:51,660
wedge lately and one of the things is

145
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,880
that with the wedge and the little inset

146
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,880
diagrams that I put I often put the 45

147
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:59,940
degree Mark for the wedge

148
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,440
and I don't always or let's just be fair

149
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,900
never

150
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,120
um go in the 45 degree angle

151
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:08,699
I just shove everything over

152
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,139
the wedge method was originally made for

153
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:13,440
Barnes

154
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:15,479
to process like horse manure or cow

155
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,280
manure and when they were doing that

156
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:19,800
they're not doing it in a nice five foot

157
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,780
Barrel here what they were doing is

158
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,639
they're shoving it off to one far wall

159
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:27,419
in the barn

160
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:29,759
and that way every time they clean out a

161
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:32,280
stall they add something

162
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,020
and possibly at the far end of the wall

163
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,060
they could take something out

164
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:40,139
what they were trying to do by doing the

165
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:44,520
45 degree angle was to create air

166
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:46,020
but in here we have me as the person or

167
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,419
method for

168
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:50,520
adding air to the system so I don't

169
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:54,500
really need to do that 45 degree angle

170
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,500
because we're not in a barn

171
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:01,319
so I am just continuing to scoop here

172
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,539
moving everything over and as I go

173
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:04,979
around you can see I have a lot more

174
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:06,960
worms here

175
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:09,479
but that won't be true for long because

176
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,360
we are going to get to the food end of

177
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:16,030
the bin and they are going to want to

178
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:19,280
move into that nice new food

179
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:22,620
[Music]

180
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,500
okay and I am trying to figure you know

181
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:28,940
fill this up pretty high because as it

182
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,940
dries it's going to compress

183
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:35,160
so this bin gets completely fluffed

184
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:36,960
probably once a month every other month

185
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:40,280
Maybe

186
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,280
so we're going to

187
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:46,919
completely move it I haven't done a

188
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:50,160
harvest this big in a very long time

189
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:51,419
but needed a lot of castings for my beds

190
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,919
because I've started some new raised

191
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:56,220
beds recently

192
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:58,319
and I needed the worm castings

193
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:00,240
to get the biology going in a brand new

194
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,699
bed and that's the best thing about worm

195
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,000
castings it's not the NPK

196
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:08,520
it is the biology in here that helps

197
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,979
release all of the nutrients that's

198
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,960
already in your soil I mean the soil

199
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:14,819
already has

200
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,220
a lot of nutrients in it for the most

201
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:19,020
part at least mine does here in the

202
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,840
Midwest it has a lot of nutrients but

203
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,680
they're locked up and the biology in the

204
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,740
soil

205
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,900
isn't always sufficient enough

206
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:30,599
in order to release

207
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:33,479
all of those nutrients so what I'm doing

208
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:35,640
is I am supercharging my own soil

209
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:38,339
so that it can release the nutrients

210
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:41,339
that I already have

211
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:43,640
in my soil here getting the sticker out

212
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:43,640
of here

213
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,580
all right let's move the camera down and

214
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,800
then we will get closer to the area

215
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,839
that's already been fed but we're still

216
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:54,480
doing the same thing we're moving

217
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,120
everything over so this can dry so it

218
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:00,180
can cure and so the worms can move

219
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,700
all right hang on let's move over okay

220
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:05,700
here we are down at the business end and

221
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,920
uh last time I fed an enormous amount of

222
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:10,880
rhubarb plants because I was tired of my

223
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:14,279
rhubarb plants not producing

224
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,800
basically I would get some some leaves

225
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:18,060
and then it would immediately flower I

226
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,640
don't know what its problem was but

227
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:23,459
quite honestly I don't eat that much in

228
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,800
the way of rhubarb I did offer the

229
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:27,839
plants out to many people that I know

230
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,339
and everybody already had their own

231
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,160
rhubarb plant

232
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:35,040
so I did try to give it a new home but

233
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,899
that was not in the cards

234
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,060
so the rhubarb

235
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:41,640
is going to feed the worms

236
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:43,740
and as you can see here I have a rhubarb

237
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,060
plant that is still growing

238
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,580
I don't know if we're gonna play

239
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:49,980
Survival of the Fittest and let this go

240
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:52,920
you can tell the worms are definitely

241
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:56,120
working on that root

242
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,120
it's getting all mushy

243
00:09:56,459 --> 00:10:03,000
but we'll move that down hitchhiker

244
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,920
move that down with the rest of the food

245
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,519
but you can tell they're already working

246
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,720
on these big huge rhubarb stems let's

247
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:12,779
split this open and see if we have

248
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:15,480
anybody inside and there you go

249
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:16,800
they love crawling in little nooks and

250
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,380
crannies

251
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,640
for whatever reason you can tell they've

252
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:23,180
actually got their little castings in

253
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,180
there with them

254
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,420
hey

255
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:30,480
so still moving

256
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:33,600
still pulling out the stuff

257
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,360
you can tell oh

258
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,760
much much wetter

259
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,980
much much more worms

260
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:43,740
oh

261
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:46,640
looks like they made short work of that

262
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,640
mango seed

263
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:54,680
take out my label here I had some

264
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,680
radishes

265
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,760
there we go

266
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:06,120
and this is not super dry

267
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:08,940
there's like a seasonal problem with the

268
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:11,160
worm bins I go through a couple Seasons

269
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,779
where it gets too wet when it gets humid

270
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,279
here and then it gets too dry when the

271
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:16,200
heat goes on

272
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:18,120
but right now seems to be my sweet spot

273
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,579
it's June

274
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,920
it's 80 degrees in the basement with

275
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:26,160
about 60 humidity

276
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:28,620
so everything's pretty stable

277
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,640
okay so let's see what we've got in the

278
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,640
way of finished food

279
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,200
just gonna kind of pick through here and

280
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:38,220
see what I have and put that off to one

281
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,839
Edge

282
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,880
so like I said

283
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,560
um first things first

284
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,360
you know what is your goal are you

285
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,640
trying to get a whole bunch of castings

286
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,980
well if that is your goal

287
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,240
you need to think about how quickly can

288
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,100
you harvest

289
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,899
and if you set up the worms to get out

290
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:57,959
of your way because that is very time

291
00:11:54,899 --> 00:12:01,079
consuming waiting for worms to make up

292
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:03,000
their mind to migrate

293
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:05,579
so one of the ways that I can make

294
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,579
things go faster is kind of make the

295
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:11,640
area a little inhospitable

296
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:15,440
so these worms are going to oh

297
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,440
worm ball in the avocado

298
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,720
I really I wish I knew it was what it

299
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:24,660
was about the avocado shells that they

300
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:27,959
just absolutely love all right we will

301
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:29,220
put the party in the avocado

302
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:32,820
back

303
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:36,920
not to you know upset the little Fellers

304
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,920
okay so we're still moving out the

305
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:42,000
see if we get another worm ball down

306
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,339
here

307
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,720
we have an absolutely massive feeding

308
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:48,180
for them today

309
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,279
and we are also going to

310
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:53,399
give an enormous amount of bedding

311
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:55,380
because I did take out

312
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:57,600
um three five gallon buckets of castings

313
00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:01,200
out of here so

314
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,040
blue is getting a little skinny

315
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,380
for anybody who's watching that's the uh

316
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,260
[Music]

317
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:09,420
uh chicken bones

318
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:11,459
from a project last summer or last

319
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:13,680
winter

320
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:15,360
okay

321
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,540
but somebody was asking in one of the

322
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:21,000
Facebook forums do do worms eat

323
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:22,500
uh different things and one of the

324
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,639
things that they were asking about

325
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:29,820
specifically was rhubarb and I told them

326
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,980
uh you know don't tell but

327
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:34,380
they most certainly do and if you go

328
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:35,880
back and look at the last video

329
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:39,300
you will see

330
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:42,019
how much insane amount of rhubarb that I

331
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,019
put in this bin

332
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:47,100
okay so we are getting all the way to

333
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,720
the end now this bin does slope a little

334
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,360
bit this way

335
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,579
so you the moisture also kind of

336
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,220
gravitates to that way

337
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:58,260
there are no drainage holes in here I

338
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:01,019
manage moisture by

339
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:04,320
you know adding wet or dry bedding or

340
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:06,360
wet or dry food in order to mitigate any

341
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,639
sort of problems that I'm having at any

342
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,060
particular time with changing in

343
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,060
moisture

344
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:23,459
so there we go that is a big old

345
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:26,519
route that they are getting into

346
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:28,260
these were completely viable Roots less

347
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:30,660
than a month ago

348
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:32,880
and the worms have and they're friends

349
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:36,120
you've got the little isopods in here

350
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:38,040
and mites I don't see any spring Tails

351
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,779
springing around but I'm willing to bet

352
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:42,959
they're there

353
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:45,180
I usually do have a very good crop of

354
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,040
isopods in here

355
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:49,139
there's about

356
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,540
15 to 20 pounds

357
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:54,779
of worms in here so

358
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:57,839
I get to feed a lot of food so if you're

359
00:14:54,779 --> 00:15:01,079
if your bin is much much smaller of

360
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:03,600
course you need to get a get an idea of

361
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:06,360
how much food you should feed in order

362
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:09,959
to be successful

363
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:13,399
oops and they have taken apart

364
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:13,399
that avocado pit

365
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,720
looks like I had another worm ball that

366
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,480
I upended

367
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,980
this one was actually in the avocado pit

368
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,980
all right guys well we'll put you back

369
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:29,519
the goal is to keep moving the more

370
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,959
finished stuff to this end and the less

371
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,360
finished stuff

372
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:36,899
to the leading end so that I focus all

373
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:39,959
of my worms and worm friends

374
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:42,720
on the food that needs taken care of

375
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:46,100
I don't like to to leave the food in

376
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:48,899
multiple different places just because

377
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:50,639
I want the worms to have one location to

378
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:55,160
go to so that they get out of my

379
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,160
castings and I can Harvest them ASAP

380
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,060
foreign

381
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:09,060
and then here is the last

382
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:11,459
hopefully a little

383
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,720
mostly finished part of the casting so

384
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:14,820
this is a

385
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,459
a pineapple I don't even know how old

386
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,899
that is I'll have to put that in above

387
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:21,680
I'll have to go back and look and see

388
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:21,680
when we fed that

389
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:27,060
so everything smells great not having

390
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:31,260
any weird smells but they have totally

391
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:32,160
annihilated all of that rhubarb that

392
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:35,160
um

393
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:39,139
I fed the last time so that's

394
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,139
that's really good good job worms

395
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:43,079
okay so you can see how

396
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:45,240
now

397
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:47,220
all of these worms are here

398
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,339
and when they finally get finished with

399
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:52,019
all of whatever nuggets of

400
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:55,880
deliciousnesses in this part here

401
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:55,880
they are going to move this way

402
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:04,439
I think that's a potato a little tiny

403
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:06,660
potato I did Harvest potatoes recently

404
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:08,939
planted some super early in a grow bag

405
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:10,919
in the basement and then put it outside

406
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:13,500
really gave me a jump I was able to

407
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:17,660
harvest some potatoes

408
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,660
in June so that was that was nice

409
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,260
okay

410
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:25,319
now the second thing that you need to be

411
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:28,020
successful is the hardest with worm

412
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:30,059
farming and that is

413
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:32,840
figuring out the moisture for the bin

414
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:35,340
what is too wet what is not wet enough

415
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:37,260
and honestly

416
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:39,720
that is something that you have to

417
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:42,660
basically watch what your bins do in

418
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:45,059
your own environment and then

419
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:48,960
write it down in my case I make videos

420
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:50,880
but basically whatever Cycles you're

421
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,280
seeing within your worm bins and in your

422
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,039
environment you know keep a note of that

423
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:58,200
so that you can be prepared for it the

424
00:17:56,039 --> 00:18:00,480
next time

425
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:03,000
so like in the case of right now this is

426
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,400
The Sweet Spot I don't have to attempt

427
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,380
to make it wetter or drier it is

428
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:10,200
completely managed all on its own but

429
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:12,360
when we're in the middle of winter

430
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:15,240
um or in the early spring when it's

431
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:17,039
super wet then I do have to manage

432
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:20,460
first things first

433
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:24,179
I'm going to put a 10 gallon

434
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:26,400
been of prepared bedding this is pretty

435
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:28,740
dry and I want to put that on the bottom

436
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,760
so that the food that I'm going to put

437
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:33,000
on

438
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:35,940
basically will absorb into this and make

439
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,700
it all nice and tasty so they eat

440
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:41,640
this has been in the prepared bedding

441
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:43,500
bin for about a month this part was the

442
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,380
top that dried out in the basement a

443
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:48,059
little bit and then this part here was

444
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:51,360
on the bottom and you can tell how well

445
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:53,100
processed that is now that is because if

446
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,440
you were able to look close enough you

447
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:57,480
would see that there are springtails in

448
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,039
there and I think I even saw a couple

449
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,840
worms in there

450
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,539
and they get started working on that

451
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:06,240
bedding so that I get castings faster so

452
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:08,160
if you keep the moisture correct in the

453
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,760
bin where I keep all of the

454
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:15,559
the bedding then we go faster and that's

455
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,559
the goal more castings faster

456
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:25,440
fast uh call on forbidden food okay we

457
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,179
have an onion here

458
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,820
and everything I'm putting in this bin

459
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:31,919
works perfectly fine bananas nobody's

460
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:33,900
worried about those bread

461
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,240
you can tell that I soaked all of this

462
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:39,240
bread in water first

463
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,940
so that it would you know be kind of

464
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,500
like paste if you put it in dry there's

465
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:45,299
a chance that it will suck the moisture

466
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:48,299
out of your castings and out of your bin

467
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:49,559
and it'll kind of turn into a brick

468
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:52,020
here's something that I haven't done

469
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:54,840
before so this is kimchi

470
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:57,480
I uh accidentally left it on the counter

471
00:19:54,840 --> 00:20:00,600
and it molded so unfortunately that

472
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,520
kimchi over there is going to the worms

473
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,320
but I have given things that are

474
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:06,840
similarly pickled I've put pickles in

475
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,700
the bin before so I'm reasonably sure

476
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:10,500
that kimchi will be okay just like

477
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,900
pickles were okay

478
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:15,419
so we've got onions and then we're gonna

479
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:17,940
give some more pineapple here

480
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:20,780
lots of bananas here

481
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:25,260
is a rotten potato that has been frozen

482
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:28,260
and also thawed mostly

483
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:31,679
so if there's any questions about this

484
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:33,840
is zucchini and carrots and here's a tea

485
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,360
bag

486
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,760
um all of these things will be attacked

487
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,799
and will be eaten appropriately here's

488
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:45,419
an avocado that didn't make it

489
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:49,320
and they will all just be exactly fine

490
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:52,679
okay so in order to make sure that this

491
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:55,919
stays nice and bug free I'm going to get

492
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:58,679
them some more bedding wait but first

493
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:01,860
let's add some grit and I'm adding this

494
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:05,340
generous amount of grit for two reasons

495
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:07,380
one I have a lot of it it is crushed

496
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:10,200
eggshell I have somebody in my household

497
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:13,260
that eats about a dozen a day

498
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,580
so that means a lot of eggshells so even

499
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:17,160
though the worms don't need this much

500
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:19,799
grit the garden will use it later so

501
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:21,240
it's going to be fine so in goes the

502
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:22,980
next

503
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:26,280
10 gallon

504
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:28,740
bin of bedding and again you can wait

505
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:31,320
wait oh there's a worm okay so for me

506
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:34,500
putting the overs from my screen into

507
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:36,659
the bin with the prepared bedding

508
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:40,080
I'm actually making kind of a miniature

509
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:42,299
worm bin sort of and uh

510
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,460
so this bedding it's also got some

511
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:47,039
leaves in it it's got some coconut coir

512
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:48,240
in it and all of that will make it nice

513
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,820
and fluffy

514
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:54,179
it'll help make the moisture even

515
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:56,460
and also this will help keep any flies

516
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:59,000
or anything away from the spin bucket

517
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,000
number three

518
00:21:59,059 --> 00:22:04,039
foreign

519
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,039
is a little bit drier

520
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,700
but this is going to help so the

521
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,740
moisture will stay down low

522
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:13,500
and then the dryer part will stay on top

523
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:17,460
which will keep all of the the bugs from

524
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:20,760
doing things so I pretty much filled

525
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:22,080
half of the bin all at once with food

526
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,000
and paper

527
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:27,120
all of the worms are down here for the

528
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,640
most part and now that this part over

529
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,860
here has food they're going to finish up

530
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,840
over here because this is nice and wet

531
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:35,760
here they're not going to want to leave

532
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,440
this they're going to stay in here for

533
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,020
another month or two

534
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,000
but down there

535
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:44,159
at the far end is going to become dry

536
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,720
and they're going to move over here and

537
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,980
then when this starts to dry they'll

538
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,720
move down here

539
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:51,780
and that way

540
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,980
everything is very simple for me as far

541
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,120
as moisture

542
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,380
dryer

543
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,460
medium

544
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:58,620
wet

545
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:00,659
and that is exactly what you need in

546
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:02,880
order to cycle castings as fast as

547
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:04,320
possible if you like the video go ahead

548
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,120
and give it a muddy thumbs up if you're

549
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,559
