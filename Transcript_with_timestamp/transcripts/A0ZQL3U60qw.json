  "text": "bluetongue virus is transmitted to its ruminant host almost entirely by biting midges which we call curly coils so this means it's a non contagious disease so if you have an infected sheep which shows clinical signs of blue tongue the sheep next to it will not be infected by the virus directly by passing on from one sheep to the other the virus can only transmit if the biological vector Coleco despite images is around so the virus and replicates in the insect and eventually after a certain time period it will reach the saliva gland and once it has reached the saliva gland the next time this now infected meat feeds on an uninfected suitable mammalian host so in the case of gluten again romulans sheep cattle it can then transmit the virus during that blood meal back into the mammalian host and then the virus starts its replication cycle in this host again and this is a really intriguing relationship because it doesn't function as a mere needle transmission at all there's more and more research for examples that the saliva has a very active role potentially in pathogen transmission because these insects have to salivate to stop blood correlation and immune responses because if so therefore live is come up surgical active it could contains anticoagulants because if they otherwise would try to feed the blood would immediately clot and then you can't take it up but by having these bioactive molecules in their saliva they can prevent this blood clotting and they are able to take up a blood meal because there it is a non contagious transmission classical methods we use like preventing contact restricting animal movement although they are still necessary they have a far less in act on a vector borne disease animal movements are important to not dislocate the virus throughout an entire country so of course if you move the animal from southern England to northern England you could almost create a second outbreak however on a local scale once the local insect population is infected they will say they will not stop you can restrict herbs you can say excuse me you are now on little interest rate so even if you don't if you do have enemy movement controls the moment that virus is in the local insect population you have lost it because it will still be able to be transmitted those insects will still fly and infect neighboring farms so this is one of the challenges of dealing with a vector borne transmitted pathogen and this is why if your free country and your fearing the incursion of a vector borne disease it is so important to catch it early because what you're trying to do is find it and remove those animals or or at least get them out of being exposed to so many biting insects before the local insect population is completely infected the program Institute has an insect er II where we breed several insect species so mosquitoes and some biting sized Moxa's cats it runs and also Coulee coitus biting images in our blue tongue research which is mainly gluten pathogenesis research or transmission research or immune response and vaccine research we do the vast majority of our work with those mammalian hosts which are really in which I in nature infected and affected by this virus so we use sheep goat and cattle because if you carry out research in something as complex as pathogenesis so where is this virus going and how is it causing disease or something like the immune response which is very species specific we fear that it is an incredibly advantage to actually be able to use the host which is affected by this disease we would obtain our study animals like sheep or goats or cattle from a commercial farm these are normal and farm animals and at the moment they come into our isolation units they are incredibly monitored so depending on which type of study we do we would treat them we would give them painkillers the one questions which is often raised when we talk about our work and describe our work is could we do our research without using animals so we do a lot of work with primary cell cultures where we just get blood or samples from animals which which are put down any way to establish primary cells to establish organ cultures and we carry out infection studies of these cells we even we have a project where we also assess the response of these cells to insect saliva to already get an idea what is going on what kind of cytokines are being made how do they respond is different when the virus is only says with and without meat saliva so we have developed a method to collect Mitch saliva or making them making them spit into a fill time we can wash off the saliva so we have a really active project to get our research to a level as high as we can by not using animals but there's only so fast we can go when it comes to big questions like transmission when it comes to big question like is this vaccine safe is this vaccine efficient how does the enemy respond upon challenge we cannot carry out this work without the use of life and animals the vertebrate immune system is way too complex that we could ever hope to replicate that fully in their modern systems there's always going to be a step where we need the animal research because I just if you just think of how for example an insect borne virus is transmitted with insect blood feeding in the skin the skin is one of our is the biggest organ we have and is one of the complicated the most complicated organ we have and then you have blood vessels bringing all these cells and responding and then it gets distributed to the entire body this level of complexity would almost be impossible to create in an artificial situation and of all you can take it so far and reduce the numbers which is the alternative goal there will always be questions where we need the whole organism so currently the work we do on gluten virus we use about twenty to thirty animals a year occasionally when there is an outbreak of bruton virus for example in in a country where this has never been or there is a strain which is emerging which we don't know then there is the potential to do like an emergency study to be able to characterize the pathogenesis of this virus and to foster vaccine development for this particular strength there are several vaccines against bluetongue virus and to understand why we are still concerned about developing other vaccines for gluten virus we need to look a bit at this virus so the virus has 27 serotypes so far we have discovered at the moment but they keep finding more and the problem we have is it the protection or the immune response upon either infection or vaccination is serotype specific so what that means is if you wax in it against the pt8 you're cheap and your cow is only protected against bt8 it is still susceptible to 26 other gluten strengths so the vaccines which are available are in Northern Europe inactivated vaccines that is they're safe and they are efficient and they have been used successfully to for example eradicate bluetongue virus 8 from the UK a few years ago but they are only there monotypic so they will only protect against the stream hence they are fine in a situation where you combat a single stream incursion it gets more problematic when you're in a country which has said those dreams of bluetongue virus circling one big area for the research is to try to find out how can we get across ferrotype protective vaccine because in countries like India where bluetongue virus still has a big impact on subsistence farmers especially in the south they have 10 15 20 strains of operatin virus circling so a lot of endemic countries use and modified lights attenuated vaccines so they have several strains of life virus however it has been shown that they can reach levels which makes them transmissible so midges can actually pick up the vaccine strain and then testing some of them in British breeds they also induce clinical signs so while some indigenous breeds have clearly avoid stress disease and do not get sick to these vaccines anymore we did not use them in northern Europe because we could show that to certain preparations they would still induce clinical disease in in the country so then when we test for antibodies we don't know does this animal have antibodies because it got vaccinated or does this animal have antibodies because it was infected at one point during their life so that makes control very difficult and then another area with inactivated vaccines is although if they are applied well in time their protect against the challenge of the virus the immune response is relatively slow so an animal is protected or she probably after 3-4 weeks castle at the moment need to dosages so that would mean probably six weeks until they are protected so if you think of an emergency vaccination where the virus is already active you could find yourself in a situation where that induction of immune response isn't quick enough developing better vaccine which might be quicker might again shorten that risk if you need to use a vaccine preparation as an emergency response so these are all drivers for improving the vaccine although in a in a one strain outbreak situation and applied well before the virus really gets going the current inactivated vaccine available for gluten will protect your enemies and and is a good is a good way of protecting your enemies another very important component of this virus which is crucial to understand is that it is segmented so its genome is arranged in segments and what that means is if two strains of bluetongue infect oneself they can swap things a bit like influenza okay so we create this virus not only creates variation by mutation it creates variation by changing genome segments which we call reassortant the immune response to this virus is monotypic so it is specifically to the zero type other characteristics however our strain specific so we can have a mild or moderate or virulent strain of for example bt v1 so when we have a new outbreak we buy serotypes have no clue what this strain is going to do just because it's a Vth strain does not mean it will be a very long string we have to monitor we have to see and sometimes we even have to do an element experiment to understand which what kind of strain are we dealing with is this a virulent strain it is a male stream how quickly do we need to get a vaccine out or if this is a mud stream can we let this go and this can obviously change very very quickly with reassortant so you could have a mild beat anyone strain circling and a virulent Vth strange circling and then they infect the same enemy and suddenly they swap this genome segment which is responsible for the serotypes let's say BT one but then the virulence is on other segments and suddenly you have a new btv one because your BT v8 strain has now got that segment from BT one but it has remained all the virulence of the other segments which inside really maked BT v8 but on the outside it has now become meet anyone however it still does mutate and it does mutate in this segment this segment tool which encodes for the outer coat protein which defines the zero type and this is why we have 27 zero times but the strain landscape is far more complex because it can chop and change all the other segments and therefore render a vaccination campaign useless within the exchange of one genomes you",
