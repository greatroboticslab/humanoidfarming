7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:25,680
provide crucial incomes to over 70% of

8

rural households in India which amounts

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,359
to about 30 million

Foundation has developed a Dr integrated

climate adaptive solution for tropical

wet and dry climates this solution was

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,160
implemented with farmers in Karnataka

India

21
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,560
is very important to note that the

22
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,840
domestication of poultry is due to major

23
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,560
factors of the environment climate

24
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,080
because they are homeotherms they adjust

25
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,680
their body temperature to the

26
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,960
environmental

27
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,680
temperatures since they are homeotherms

28
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,159
their body temperature is 105° uh

29
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:30,600
Fahrenheit and they are comfortable when

30
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:32,680
the temperature around 75° fit after the

over higher temperature causes stress

33
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:40,680
lower temperature also causes stress we

34
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:43,799
have to provide good sheds with cross

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,960
ventilation safety from the cats dogs

36
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:49,960
reptiles and also the cross ventilation

37
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:53,320
is very important because the birds have
