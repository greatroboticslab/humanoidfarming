1
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,520
uh

2
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:23,439
food safety council or conference

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:26,400
education china in july of 2014

4
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,320
and the reason they held it is between

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,119
2012 and 2014

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,160
they saw a 59 percent increase in cancer

7
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:36,399
rates

8
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,399
and whenever grain comes in from

9
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,840
argentina

10
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,239
now they've got 1.4 billion people and

11
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,160
if they have a lot of sick people

12
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,879
or autistic children which is growing

13
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,119
erratically they just cannot afford it

14
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,320
bob can i ask you to stand over here

15
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,400
should i

16
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,400
we'll get a better song of the life

17
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,759
right here would be perfect right there

18
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,520
you may have to move if i'm going to

19
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,240
stand here and so

20
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,600
as long as you can see it i'm good so

21
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,720
they know if they can't

22
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,759
have that continued increase

23
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:31,439
they can't afford it as we can here

24
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:34,000
now will it make a difference china is a

25
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,759
different country i got home and my wife

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,200
asked are you ready to go back

27
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,600
i thought a little bit and i said no i

28
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,520
don't think so why

29
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,439
i'm not that big on eating cooked

30
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,799
cabbage the beds were as hard as the

31
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,720
floor here

32
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,560
everything was foreign if you ate food

33
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,920
and it was a chicken dish they cut up

34
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,439
the chicken and they leave the

35
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,479
bone fragments in the food so

36
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,640
and pollution was terrible but the top

37
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,040
seven generals in the chinese army were

38
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:07,119
in the front row of the audience

39
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:10,479
and that's the biggest market for

40
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:13,440
our soybeans in the world they

41
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,599
basically import 67 percent of the

42
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,040
exported soybeans in the world

43
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,959
and roughly 50 to 55 percent of the u.s

44
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,560
soybeans end up in china feeding people

45
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:26,160
there

46
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,160
and there will be some major changes in

47
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,640
their consumption and soybean supply

48
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,480
anyhow we think the message about

49
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,040
healthy food is getting home

50
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,239
the successful farming magazine is

51
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,640
published by meredith

52
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,840
publishing in des moines iowa and they

53
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,120
ran a mid-february

54
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,400
issue 2016. it was entitled farmers meet

55
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,879
your new boss

56
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,000
and it was a 12 star nine segment 12

57
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:54,560
page story i can send copies to people

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,200
but in there they said the millennial

59
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,400
shopper

60
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,440
that's 30 to 35 years old or maybe 30

61
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,519
to 40 they want

62
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,959
healthy food they want happy families

63
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,560
they want good nutrition

64
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:10,080
in their food and they said

65
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,480
farmers even if you don't like the

66
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,720
message recognize that these shoppers

67
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,159
will make up

68
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,200
say 70 of the shopping public in about

69
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,599
10 years

70
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,959
so you better adapt and we went and

71
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,360
talked to the head editor

72
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,360
dave kearns a few days after they showed

73
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,120
up and we thanked him for writing it

74
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,879
and we asked are you expecting any

75
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,239
negative feedback he said yes we're

76
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,200
going to the big uh

77
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,200
actual here uh commodity classic and

78
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,280
we're expecting people to come up and my

79
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,920
we've already prepared our answer and

80
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,760
that is we publish 34 magazines in

81
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,159
different languages

82
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,440
and we also publish like ladies home

83
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,120
journal and

84
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,159
quite a few women's magazines and they

85
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,799
knew that uh roughly 100 million

86
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,760
women a month read their magazine and

87
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,200
they said we like

88
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,439
producing the best producing circulating

89
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,040
in different countries the best farm

90
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,560
magazine possible

91
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,720
we also do the same for women's

92
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,760
magazines we did our survey we know what

93
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,799
the

94
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,280
five top hot hot buttons are for women

95
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,640
and it's healthy food happy families

96
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,519
good nutrition

97
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,199
so if any of the egg producers or any

98
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,799
people disagree with us we'll let them

99
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,799
argue with a hundred million mad women

100
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,400
so uh i like uh part of what i'm here

101
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,720
for is to share this

102
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,759
news and then also interact with people

103
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,440
and hopefully

104
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,759
learn about some markets where we can

105
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,880
connect some midwest producers

106
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,960
to maybe consumers out here i'm involved

107
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,080
in a big food project that we may move

108
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,639
on to different countries

109
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,160
but 30 miles north of me in central iowa

110
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,520
will be the biggest fish farm

111
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,600
in the nation by this fall and within

112
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,000
five years after five planned expansions

113
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,400
it will

114
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,600
be the biggest in the world they're

115
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,160
raising barramundi

116
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,759
which are australian sea bass so they

117
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,520
went after the higher dollar eight

118
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,919
dollar pound fish markets to the two

119
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,000
dollar

120
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,240
pound tilapia market which is a bottom

121
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,199
feeding fish

122
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,639
anyhow uh nutrient uptake by 200 bushel

123
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,360
corn which is kind of the standard

124
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,199
servings is listed here and basically

125
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,039
the number one used herbicide which is

126
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,080
from company in saint louis

127
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,039
uh chelates all of these they're all

128
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,880
listed here

129
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,479
uh richard olrey is speaking quite a bit

130
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,600
today he's a good friend

131
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:30,320
and he likes to work with pubmed

132
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,320
and he looked at those minerals and he

133
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,759
figured out what percent

134
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,320
of the genes that are in the human

135
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:39,600
construct involved those minerals

136
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,280
he said roughly 59 of them and that's

137
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,520
why we're seeing a lot of the diseases

138
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,919
in there and i'll get heavier into that

139
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,680
uh bob i need you to stay in between

140
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,800
those two lines or else you're not on

141
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,479
screen for the life

142
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,420
people are actually following this life

143
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:55,529
okay right there it's fine

144
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,529
[Music]

145
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,000
now people are asking is that the

146
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,440
education the herbicide or

147
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,120
is it the insertion of the gene that's

148
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,080
causing the problem

149
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,680
and uh basically at universities uh no

150
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,680
one gets a grant to do this

151
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,440
work or these studies unless they have

152
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,199
permission from the seed companies

153
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,800
they're not going to do that the two

154
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,479
people that have done it is ishmael

155
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,759
catmac at purdue

156
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:21,360
and then luis zobioli out of mourinho

157
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,199
brazil when he was studying with bob

158
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,600
kramer at university of missouri

159
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,199
but they looked just at the insertion of

160
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,759
the trait and they found

161
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,479
pretty significant decrease in those

162
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,960
minerals

163
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,000
in the plant and the thing is most of

164
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,759
those minerals are those

165
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,440
uh manganese boron copper and zinc

166
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,080
if the plants are missing them they're

167
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,280
going to be very prone to disease attack

168
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,120
and dying from

169
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,600
uh fungal disease probably a root

170
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,080
disease if humans are deficient in those

171
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,680
minerals

172
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,280
they're also going to get sick and very

173
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,280
likely end up with alzheimer's

174
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,120
okay there's rich's slide

175
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,599
there is a chart that shows a

176
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,400
correlation or the chelation quotient

177
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,680
between

178
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,599
the glyphosate product and the different

179
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,319
minerals

180
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,280
and quite a few of them chart is

181
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,440
available

182
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,720
what we urge farmers to do now though is

183
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,680
take a closer look

184
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,680
at their fertility programs number one

185
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,120
when they pull soil tests we urge them

186
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,479
that if they haven't been looking at

187
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,599
those micronutrients

188
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:28,639
pay attention to it part of the problem

189
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:31,759
and lack of decent nutrition

190
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:34,160
to the plants and to the people is that

191
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,680
most of these tasks will detect if the

192
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,440
mineral is there

193
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,680
but it won't detect if it's plant

194
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,960
available or if it's being calated by a

195
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,440
stronger compound

196
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,080
which is the case okay here's the work

197
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,919
uh

198
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,520
you know i got that in there twice yeah

199
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,919
what we're seeing in probably 90

200
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,680
of the fields right now is a general uh

201
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,000
instead of a dark green color we got

202
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,360
light green dark green streaking

203
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,080
and there were a lot of publications

204
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,759
20 years ago where they diagnosed it and

205
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,800
there was a chart called be your own

206
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,639
corn doctor

207
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,319
if you're showing this discoloration

208
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,560
it's shortage of

209
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,639
sulfur or nitrogen if you're showing

210
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,879
this zinc or another mineral

211
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,000
we don't see that as much anymore and

212
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,919
most farmers

213
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,759
look at it and their agronomists don't

214
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,800
know about it universities aren't

215
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:25,599
telling them what to look for so

216
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,240
the teachers aren't trained but if we

217
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,080
see that

218
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,240
the plant is going to be much more

219
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,599
drought prone stress grown

220
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,599
subject to disease attack and also

221
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,279
diseases more likely to show up which

222
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,680
was the case

223
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,760
now in north central iowa i like flying

224
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,839
a friend of mine builds his own

225
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,320
airplanes and he wins the

226
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,839
top prize for homebuilt and oshkosh

227
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,760
wisconsin

228
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,200
so he's safe to fly with but we're going

229
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,120
over fields

230
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,000
southwest of fort dodge iowa north

231
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,760
central early august of 2010

232
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,680
and all the corn underneath it should be

233
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,480
dark green it's not

234
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,560
it's brown it's dead from a new disease

235
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,480
brought on by lack of nutrition

236
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,800
and bacteria that moved into the corn

237
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,800
crop and that happened to be the same

238
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,839
bacteria collaborator

239
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,959
that was used as the promoter when they

240
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,360
did the first bt

241
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,360
project

242
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,959
anyhow these are soybean fields they

243
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:27,120
should all be dark green

244
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:30,240
instead they were attacked by a fusarium

245
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,720
fungus which is a root rot again

246
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,480
caused due to lack of nutrition

247
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,560
everything should be dark green

248
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,760
why these are significant is guess where

249
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,720
the food supply is coming from

250
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,920
oftentimes

251
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,480
from these disease fields

252
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,000
uh two great uh kind of case studies

253
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,880
that were done

254
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,720
by lay people are written up in books

255
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,000
one is called animal farm

256
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:57,279
and that's p-h-a-r-m written by mark

257
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,279
purdy who is an organic british dairy

258
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,120
farmer that did not believe the official

259
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,040
explanation of what was called mad cow

260
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,000
disease or bse

261
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,240
which is caused by a biomatrix that we

262
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,079
commonly call a prion

263
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:14,959
the other one is when you chelate

264
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,079
cobalt with a herbicide it's not

265
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,920
available

266
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,519
you will demyelinate your nerve sheath

267
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,160
and you'll end up like a famous baseball

268
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,279
player called lou gehrig

269
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,959
and uh if you happen to go to a dentist

270
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,399
and he's talking about giving nitrous

271
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,880
oxide

272
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,320
you may tell the dentist i want to beat

273
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,240
our cobalt test

274
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,480
first because if you're exposed to

275
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,880
nitrous oxide it converts the

276
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,640
valency of the cobalt from plus one to

277
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,560
the plus two or plus three

278
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,800
valency and it will not be body

279
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,440
available and as i mentioned to a few

280
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,480
people

281
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,240
i played softball in iowa falls

282
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,920
in our good second baseman ended up

283
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,959
being a superintendent in school after

284
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,040
he got his doctorate

285
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,640
and he went in for a small dental

286
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,160
procedure and he never woke up from the

287
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,200
anesthetic

288
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,399
and it may have been this as the root

289
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,160
cause so

290
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,680
if people are around different uh

291
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,800
products that chelate it there are

292
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,399
things you can do

293
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,240
in this case we tell people if they're

294
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,760
using liberty herbicide

295
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,560
to uh take b12 supplements or get some

296
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,440
losses

297
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,240
or actually get a b12 shot core atom and

298
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,760
b vitamins

299
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,320
is cobalt uh going a little bit further

300
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,360
into that

301
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,120
uh investigation as far as why the

302
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,560
eighty percent of the u.s corn crop was

303
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,120
dying early

304
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,760
we ended up getting referred to dr chris

305
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,800
johnson

306
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:37,040
who was a head researcher

307
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,560
specializing in prions at the national

308
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,480
fish and wildlife research group in

309
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,880
madison wisconsin

310
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,640
and i dropped some samples off with him

311
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,560
and they tested it and they got a coke's

312
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,279
postulate which is where you

313
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,000
take a disease plant isolate the

314
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,600
organism

315
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,839
and test or treat another new plant

316
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,360
healthy plant with it and it comes down

317
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,200
to the same disease

318
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,880
then that's called fulfilling colt's

319
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,480
postulate

320
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:07,360
but he wrote a a good article on it but

321
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,040
he was censored and never got published

322
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,480
so what we've been working on in the

323
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,399
full investigation has been

324
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,480
we've been working on since 2009 when

325
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,240
the disease first showed up

326
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,079
and the full investigation has been

327
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,279
going on since 1999

328
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,360
it still hasn't come to a full

329
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:24,000
conclusion but

330
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,680
there's a few good books to read one

331
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,639
actually started out with kurt vonnegut

332
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,560
jr

333
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,399
because he helped solve the riddle as

334
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:34,000
far as something that is not

335
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:37,680
living can replicate and as his brother

336
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
as it turned out he would discuss

337
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,600
crystal work with his brother who

338
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,880
happened to be a crystal researcher at

339
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,200
mit

340
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,040
and they would talk about this at

341
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,839
thanksgiving dinner and such

342
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:53,040
and he took the talk about crystals

343
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:56,000
replicating and put it in his book

344
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:58,959
called cat's cradle

345
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,480
but another good book deadly feast by i

346
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,600
think richard rhodes

347
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:06,639
and it was a story about

348
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:09,200
a epidemiologist medical doctor that was

349
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,639
working with cannibals in new guinea

350
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,880
and at the start of the story they

351
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,279
describe a feast where granny is both

352
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,120
the guest of honor the main course

353
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,680
but they had a strange neurological

354
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:23,200
disease show up called kuru

355
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:27,200
so a fellow by the name of uh

356
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,200
well then following that was uh

357
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,240
mark purdy who was an organic british

358
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,680
dairy farmer that didn't believe the

359
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,720
official explanation

360
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,639
and he found out that the mad cow was

361
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,440
showing up when they had a deficiency in

362
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,160
copper

363
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,880
an excess of manganese and exposure to

364
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,360
high levels

365
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,639
of em emission that was sent off a

366
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,240
cascade

367
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:52,000
but the prions that were in their brain

368
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,160
that are used to store long-term

369
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,720
memories in normal humans

370
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,000
or in the prc form but when they're

371
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,920
exposed to the high levels

372
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,639
of em emission and the other factors

373
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,320
they convert

374
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,920
to the infected prpcs form

375
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,680
and the person that did the best work

376
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,760
was probably a fellow named stanley

377
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,399
prusner who was a neurologist at

378
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,720
university of california san francisco

379
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,199
he worked on it 20 to 25 years

380
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,000
it was his passion everyone says the

381
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,000
dead end

382
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,360
he ended up winning the nobel prize in

383
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,800
medicine

384
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,600
in 1997. now if these are in the food

385
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,360
supply

386
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,959
if they're in the body the way to get

387
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:35,600
them out is by

388
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:35,600
taking a mineral called clinoptillolite

389
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:42,560
c-l-i-n-o-p-t-i-l-o-l-i-t-e

390
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,399
and it is ground zeolite which is used

391
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,959
in an aquarium to take the nitrogen out

392
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,399
of the water it's a volcanic mineral

393
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,120
if they grind it at one to three

394
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:53,760
nanometers in size at 105 degree angle

395
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,959
and it's considered clean up to light

396
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,600
but uh

397
00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:00,000
is probably the number one cause for low

398
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,880
birth rates in the us because the freon

399
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,639
considers the fetus as nutritional rival

400
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,399
and how we found it is in a high

401
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,399
percentage of young animals

402
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,320
who are being miscarried during the mid

403
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,920
stages of pregnancy

404
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,240
the aborted placental tissue ended up

405
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,880
being

406
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,560
full filled with these little crystals

407
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,600
and

408
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:24,000
diagnostic our vet pathologists that did

409
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,399
the staining in the autoclaving

410
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,240
uh ended up finding it in the feed

411
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,040
source which was a soybean meal at that

412
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,040
time

413
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,160
but harvard medical is researching these

414
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,880
as far as how

415
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:37,040
they're connected to arteriosclerosis

416
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:41,839
parting of the arteries

417
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,839
arthritis cataracts and alzheimer's

418
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,600
anyhow uh i happen to go with don huber

419
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,079
the top ag

420
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,240
scientist in the world on a seven-day

421
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,639
road trip we took pictures in an

422
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,240
industrial scanning electron microscope

423
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,759
i got these pictures here at anywhere

424
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,000
from fourteen thousand to a hundred

425
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,440
eighty thousand times magnification

426
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,839
and these are coming from corn and

427
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,600
soybean tissue from the midwest

428
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,800
chinese found them right away in

429
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,560
soybeans imported from the us

430
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,399
they just screw the plants up from the

431
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,759
seed split the leaves open

432
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:15,279
in the scope or slide

433
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,320
to catch the juice that flowed out of

434
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:21,279
the leaves and they found that

435
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,399
i mentioned uh as far as verification of

436
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,040
this uh

437
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,720
dr claudio soto at the university of

438
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,639
texas health services wrote a big

439
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,639
article probably the best one on it

440
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,160
and there's stanley cruz nerf's work

441
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:35,519
he's still alive

442
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,600
uh harvard our washu in st

443
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,600
louis has a true lab they do the work

444
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,360
there also and there's a lot of faculty

445
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,680
go between washu

446
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,800
and harvard and i've talked to a few of

447
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,279
the people

448
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,440
and they're correlating it with 24 other

449
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:52,320
human diseases

450
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,880
and if you don't have the 45 years

451
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,040
experience as a vet pathologist

452
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,920
know how to stain it and do the

453
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,519
autoclave work

454
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:05,839
you're never going to find these you're

455
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:05,839
never going to see these

456
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,039
they made a few bad assumptions and that

457
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,400
is the they said

458
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,079
they were reductionists they said the

459
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,000
presence of one gene controlled the

460
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:30,799
expression one type

461
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,799
and what they know now is genetic system

462
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,559
press our one trait typically is

463
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,600
controlled by the electromagnetic

464
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:42,480
interaction between bullseye

465
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,080
so it's a lot more complicated than that

466
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,720
and also what they didn't know

467
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,919
is that every human has two to five

468
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,679
pounds of bacteria

469
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:56,320
in their gut and those bacteria

470
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:59,520
are responsible for extracting nutrients

471
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,039
controlling human health and also make

472
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,720
up roughly

473
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:07,840
uh seventy percent of the immune system

474
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,520
in people okay we

475
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,679
basically all pesticides that they have

476
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,160
in fact most herbicides might keep

477
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,320
work by chelating minerals but the

478
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:20,320
history of pesticides basically starts

479
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:23,840
in europe

480
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,640
pre-world war one and the big company is

481
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,080
called ig

482
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,840
farming and farben is a german word for

483
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,000
colors and they were making industrial

484
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,000
dies out of coal tar

485
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,240
now when after world war ii they had the

486
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,919
nuremberg trials and basically ig farben

487
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,200
was split up into three

488
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:45,039
companies basf bayer and uh

489
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,720
hurst works so and then in this country

490
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:49,520
we had uh

491
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,520
pyrethroids were developed by the

492
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:55,360
british

493
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:57,200
from chrysanthemum flowers

494
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,400
and then we in this country we had

495
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,880
efforts at

496
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,160
fort detrick and that's basically where

497
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,360
we worked

498
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:08,840
to counter the activity of the russians

499
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:11,840
that was detailed in a book called

500
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,840
biohazard

501
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,960
adhd is a major problem right now what's

502
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,880
the cause of it

503
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:23,120
and what they know is basically insects

504
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,799
nervous system is very similar to that

505
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,320
of humans

506
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,200
so if you work with colonist race

507
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,039
inhibitors

508
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:35,840
or nerves in insects

509
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,799
and people are exposed to that either as

510
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,840
direct

511
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:42,160
say drift or exposure

512
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,600
through the food or air they're very

513
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,520
unlikely to have some of the same

514
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,760
problems and if you talk to any teachers

515
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,840
at work with grade school kids

516
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,160
discipline is oftentimes our number one

517
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,240
problem

518
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,760
as far as leaky gut and all of that i

519
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,120
was involved in this project

520
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,880
i still have a 30 year old t-shirt

521
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,120
hanging

522
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,240
one time should she throw it away i said

523
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:09,600
no it's a gold mine but what it was

524
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,480
trying to uh create insect resistant

525
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,559
corn

526
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,080
and they did it by taking a genetic

527
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,080
sequence from

528
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,559
uh soil dwelling bacteria called

529
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,720
bacillus thuragensis or bt

530
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:23,200
and they were using clavibacter bacteria

531
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,360
to put it into corn

532
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,360
and anyhow it was great because number

533
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,679
one problem grazing corn in the western

534
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,880
corn belt is european corn bark

535
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,799
that came from europe

536
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,159
and supposedly up the economy during

537
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,960
world war one

538
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,880
but if that's happened uh they theorized

539
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,840
that it was only be effective against

540
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,080
insects that have

541
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,360
an alkaline gut not something with an

542
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,200
acidic gut

543
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,400
but it looks like there are some of

544
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,960
their assumptions were wrong

545
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,159
because if kids are having a problem

546
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,880
with leaky gut

547
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,320
it's major problem behavior problems and

548
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,520
then oftentimes

549
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:02,000
it breaks the blood-brain barrier

550
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,360
so they have done a lot of microtoming

551
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,559
of different

552
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,799
gut cells they know that

553
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,880
one type of food causes basically a

554
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:14,559
breakdown of the gut lining

555
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:17,120
loss of integrity loss of attackness

556
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:19,039
with and without and they have got the

557
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,600
medical proof that there is an actual

558
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,799
problem

559
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,880
it's not mental uh we really needed

560
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,799
uh to explain this whole thing and to

561
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,039
work with us over in china

562
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,240
present good evidence we needed the help

563
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:33,039
of two good

564
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,360
human biochemists we end up getting help

565
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,840
from a guy named anthony sam south who i

566
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,880
believe

567
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:42,000
is up in new hampshire

568
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:44,720
not a raspy old guy but very intelligent

569
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,880
he started doing the work after he would

570
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,600
he's got some greenhouses that he works

571
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,600
in at his house

572
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,039
and he would just be into a bucket

573
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,320
instead of going outside in the cold

574
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,720
winter he noticed

575
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,080
uh when he's poured the bucket onto

576
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,600
plants that would kill them so he

577
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,200
thought maybe i've got something in me i

578
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,320
should check out so

579
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,480
he ended up forcing all of monsignors

580
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,440
getting and acquiring all of monsanto's

581
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,320
secret

582
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,159
research results through the freedom of

583
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,159
information act

584
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,400
anyhow he partnered up with steph center

585
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,200
who's a head biochemist at mit they've

586
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,039
written six

587
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,679
major review papers about 30 to 40 pages

588
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:25,280
in length

589
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:28,240
very heavy reading but if you read are

590
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:30,960
going to be pretty much kind of

591
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:34,480
impartial expert on it

592
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,480
we're also seeing a lot of uh

593
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,760
different parts of the country where the

594
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,880
price of combines has gotten quite

595
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,480
expensive

596
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:45,520
the if they have to hire in

597
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,760
uh combines to harvest their crop

598
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,799
they want to stay on schedule and they

599
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,000
will spray their

600
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:54,400
crop to

601
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,039
desiccate it so was all right say next

602
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:00,960
tuesday when the cutting crew gets here

603
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:03,280
and uh the systemic herbicide

604
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,280
that late in the season will be sprayed

605
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,080
on the leaves and it will be transported

606
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,640
directly

607
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,240
to the growing point which at that point

608
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,760
is the brain

609
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,679
so a lot of the people that think that

610
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,480
gluten intolerance actually might be

611
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,559
very allergic about creating symptoms

612
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,520
due to the glyphosate that is contained

613
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,640
in there

614
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:27,679
so we really need a replacement for it

615
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:31,120
and there's good progress coming on that

616
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:33,760
but read these papers it's

617
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,240
samsel incentive number one two three

618
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,559
four

619
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,600
five and six and they're already working

620
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:41,919
on seven eight

621
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:45,120
at night again nancy swanson

622
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:49,760
basically showed the correlation

623
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:52,159
between uh bt corn acres

624
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,480
and colitis and crohn's crohn's is a

625
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:58,159
nasty disease that

626
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,159
if you haven't his lifetime

627
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,080
affliction i lost a sister to it

628
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,840
there are alternatives out there there's

629
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,279
a fellow named bob quinn

630
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:11,640
uh farms up montana he run grows the

631
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:15,840
ancient wheats that were selected for

632
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:17,919
digestibility and flavor rather than

633
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,960
being able to be processed quite easily

634
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,080
so he raises

635
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:24,000
grains like commute and spelt grinds

636
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,080
them and sells under the label

637
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,720
bob's red mill and those are

638
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,720
alternatives

639
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,200
sanaf did work on it as have other

640
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,679
people

641
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,919
and there's a strong correlation between

642
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:40,080
gut microbes and obesity

643
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,840
if you throw off the gut population and

644
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,559
you move away from having

645
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,640
lactobacillus enterococcus and biofidium

646
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:49,279
as your major three bacteria

647
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:52,799
and move towards salmonella e coli and

648
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:55,279
clostridium you'll have major problems

649
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:57,039
a lady by the name of dergena stanley

650
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,720
teaches at queensland university in

651
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,720
australia and she has found out that if

652
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,760
they do fecal transplants

653
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:07,039
and include specific bacteria

654
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:10,559
in the transplant you can actually cure

655
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:12,080
autism and diabetes she's done the work

656
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:14,960
but when she writes

657
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,159
she always writes like she's doing it on

658
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:20,159
poultry

659
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,159
and that way she disguises her results

660
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,880
but uh there is an obesity switch and it

661
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:27,120
looks like that's being affected

662
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,000
uh you go to other parts of the world

663
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,440
and the number of people

664
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,640
grossly overweight is down quite a bit

665
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,919
i guess i've been impressed with the

666
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,039
shape of the people here it looks like

667
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:40,080
there's a lot of marathoners and such

668
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,480
but you go to different parts of the

669
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,640
world

670
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,960
germany argentina you can tell they're

671
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:48,080
starting to drink a lot of

672
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:50,080
pop and consuming

673
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,600
high fructose corn syrup which hopkins

674
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,799
found out doesn't

675
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:57,679
get digested for usage it gets towards

676
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:59,600
fat right away

677
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,600
anyhow brings up the question is roundup

678
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,240
in our food and if you're eating a

679
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,600
modern

680
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,480
uh drive-through diet or a fast food

681
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,159
diet

682
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:12,720
hamburger cheeseburger with french fries

683
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,720
during pop there's quite a few different

684
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,919
ways where the glyphosate can get into

685
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,720
your system

686
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:21,200
and it looks like it's involved in a

687
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:24,559
high percentage of major diseases

688
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,960
they actually tested honey zen honeycut

689
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:29,039
with mothers across america did one

690
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,520
study a friend of mine did another one

691
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:33,279
they looked at honey from northwest iowa

692
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:37,039
again

693
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:40,320
honey is made from nectar and pollen

694
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:42,400
from flowers and if you got

695
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,320
pesticide drip landing on those flowers

696
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,360
it's picked up in the honey

697
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,799
so more places than you think

698
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,559
there's quite a bit of talk yesterday at

699
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:52,559
the pre-meeting about instruments that

700
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:55,279
could be used to detect it

701
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,480
this device is what's called an x-ray

702
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:58,640
diffraction

703
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,559
instrument from broker which is a

704
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,279
massachusetts country

705
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,760
it's it looks like a giant squirt gun

706
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:08,000
and

707
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:10,240
uh it does cost on it there's two

708
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,799
tools that come with it together it's

709
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:15,279
about 63 thousand dollars

710
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:18,159
and it was repurposed our broker

711
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:20,559
requested that dr jill clapperton

712
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,279
who's the number one or two number uh

713
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,600
best

714
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:26,159
soil microbiologists in the world

715
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,000
repurpose it so she is using it

716
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,360
and she is putting food products in the

717
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,440
tray be it

718
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:36,559
uh a fruit a vegetable processed grain

719
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:39,120
and egg or peel off an orange it will

720
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:42,080
analyze for all 94 minerals in about

721
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,559
75 to 80 seconds and it'll give you a

722
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,520
total

723
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,720
rundown on it and part of the goal is to

724
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,799
have these out there

725
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,840
it also picks up small molecules which

726
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:52,880
would include

727
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:55,440
pesticides and pharmaceuticals

728
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,080
and i work quite a bit with jill and i

729
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,440
ask

730
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:02,640
that the number three library be built

731
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,799
for mycotoxins because more and more

732
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:08,080
people are being exposed to

733
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:09,360
bacteria or fungal mold or is coming

734
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,559
through the grain

735
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:15,760
we're seeing a major problem with if our

736
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:18,799
farmers have grain that basically

737
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:20,240
rots and they can't feed it to their

738
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,360
livestock they will take it to an

739
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,240
ethanol plant

740
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:26,559
and the ethanol plant will basically

741
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,760
concentrate the mycotoxins

742
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:30,000
3x and then they try to sell it as ddgs

743
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,159
to

744
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,760
other livestock feeders if they don't

745
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:37,200
accept it they try to get rid of it

746
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:40,240
in animal food pet food

747
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,520
and also human food and we've got places

748
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:45,120
where the dogs

749
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:48,240
will not bread anymore

750
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:51,679
in iowa and major problem

751
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,679
in humans uh

752
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,880
exposure to some of them the symptoms

753
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:58,240
will range from

754
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:01,279
uh refusal to feed or to

755
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,559
esophageal cancer so major problems also

756
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:05,919
adhd

757
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:08,159
uh what the 65 000

758
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,279
instrument will replace is probably one

759
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:12,640
that runs

760
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:13,200
350 to 500 thousand dollars the state of

761
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,960
the art

762
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:19,279
is uh the so-called lc tandem ms

763
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,520
we're working on a scanner that we hoped

764
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:23,760
would be out two years ago in june

765
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:26,559
um designed and built by the jet

766
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,000
propulsion lab engineers price point was

767
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,320
going to be 250

768
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,240
and a housewife could take it in scan

769
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:35,360
all of her food before she bought it

770
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:37,600
for mineral content and pesticides

771
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,679
but uh things kind of fell apart on that

772
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,000
dan was involved and dan has visited

773
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:44,240
with

774
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,000
the engineers on it very smart people

775
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,080
it's not completely dead i found out

776
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
this summer

777
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,760
one thing if you've got relatives in

778
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
florida let them know that they probably

779
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:57,600
need to do something with their water

780
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,799
this is a slide of data taken by

781
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:02,720
a well water survey taken by the u.s

782
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,880
geological survey

783
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,919
group which is in the department of

784
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,520
interior

785
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:12,240
but is well water in central florida and

786
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:14,000
everything in the pink area uh is

787
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,039
contaminated with the number one

788
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,399
used herbicide partly because the citrus

789
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:22,640
growers have been using

790
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:26,559
20 gallons of roundup per acre

791
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,559
on some of their ground for 20 years now

792
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,159
they excuse me 20 pounds they're putting

793
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:35,039
on four gallons

794
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,840
five times a year four quarts five times

795
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:38,880
a year yeah

796
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:41,440
okay now i i'd gas with that figure

797
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,919
this shows that if you're irrigating

798
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,159
corn

799
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:46,000
with 28 inches of water which typical in

800
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:49,440
their sandy soil

801
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:52,640
they calculated how much glyphosate

802
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,600
would be pumped per acre or per square

803
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,080
mile

804
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,799
and they've got some places 35 million

805
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,840
pounds

806
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:02,000
coming up just a huge number and i've

807
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,480
got a friend that has the only organic

808
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,399
citrus grove in florida they're

809
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,720
very proud of it they sell it as uncle

810
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,720
max

811
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,080
he was caught in a conundrum and his

812
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:19,440
news

813
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,480
name are they found glyphosate in orange

814
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,120
juice in florida

815
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,640
which is not surprising at all he tried

816
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,799
to get a

817
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,320
permit to dig an irrigation well and

818
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:30,080
they would not give him one

819
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,399
they said if you want water for your

820
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,880
trees will give you the waste water from

821
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,880
orlando

822
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:39,519
and i've got a friend that is an oxford

823
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,440
trained forensic medical pathologist he

824
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:44,840
did analysis on the water

825
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:47,679
and it was 24 20 to 40 part per million

826
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:50,720
glyphosate and it also contained a lot

827
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:50,720
of pharmaceuticals

828
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:56,399
and that is why these trees are dying

829
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,000
because roundup works

830
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:00,320
not like inhibiting the shikomite

831
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,840
pathway but it works by tying up the

832
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,919
minerals needed to

833
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,720
have an immune system and fight off the

834
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,720
root pathogens

835
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,120
so we've got food sources this is what

836
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,840
is allowed by epa

837
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,159
and these levels and standards are not

838
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,120
set

839
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:19,519
by science they're based on requests by

840
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,279
the herbicide companies

841
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:23,440
and they go in every so often they raise

842
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:26,320
them because they want to be

843
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,640
within the standards that are allowed

844
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,760
now

845
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,880
if you have the uh bessie the cow you

846
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,760
can have 400

847
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:35,440
part per million glyphosate in the hay

848
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:38,640
that you're eating

849
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:40,080
number one problem in cattle sometimes

850
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,279
in this country

851
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,080
and in europe germany especially is

852
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:47,279
botulism

853
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:49,120
chronic botulism because

854
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:50,799
uh you kill off the three beneficial

855
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:53,440
ones which i mentioned earlier

856
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:55,440
ones that thrive are e coli salmonella

857
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,600
and clostridium

858
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,640
there's effects out there beverage

859
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,600
sources

860
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:03,919
they tested german beer i think they

861
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,919
were all

862
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,799
contaminated and men had a much higher

863
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,279
glyphosate level

864
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:13,360
as tested by urine analysis because

865
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:15,600
germans drink more beer

866
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,600
and my favorite one or steiner wheat is

867
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,039
on there so i don't drink much anymore

868
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,360
at all

869
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,880
so if you're a highbrow californian

870
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,360
might say i don't drink beer i drink

871
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,720
wine

872
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:29,600
they tested in st louis 14 different

873
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:32,640
brands some organic wines and

874
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:35,760
90 of them were contaminated because

875
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,679
usda rules allows organic crops to be

876
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:40,880
fertilized with

877
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:44,720
manures from cattle and been fed

878
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:48,799
gmo brain anyhow

879
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:51,279
this was a german study they did

880
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:52,240
basically city dwellers that do not

881
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,600
spray

882
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,600
and it was coming through the food or

883
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,519
the drink

884
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,440
uh fungicides they're used more and more

885
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:01,200
to fight these diseases

886
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:04,240
a good friend of mine is a top plant

887
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,080
pathologist with the argentinian usda

888
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,639
and he works with a group called jerkus

889
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,159
was is a japanese usda

890
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,159
and just to prove there were no

891
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,919
fungicide residues in the grain they

892
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,839
finally tested some for the first time

893
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:17,280
guess what they found

894
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:19,839
and they've got a real bad sleeping

895
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,720
disease in northern argentina and all of

896
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:23,760
brazil called

897
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,320
asian rust it's a worst disease plant

898
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,280
disease

899
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:30,159
people i've ever seen if you see the

900
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:32,639
plants beginning to turn yellow

901
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:35,119
there's no way to say them it will die

902
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,679
and we saw it one year wiped about about

903
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,960
15

904
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,839
million acres of soybeans so it places

905
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:44,720
the

906
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:47,119
chinese food supply in jeopardy anyhow

907
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,079
north carolina medical school did a

908
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:51,280
study

909
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:54,960
doesn't all show up on this uh slide

910
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:57,839
but anyhow they the second most common

911
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:01,440
fungicides used are the strabil urines

912
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:03,839
they came out of basf as a

913
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,200
stabilized synthetic version of a

914
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:07,839
strobiliaris

915
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,920
product that prevented other fungi from

916
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:11,040
utilizing pine cones in the forest as a

917
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,599
food source

918
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,800
but he treated human nerve cells he had

919
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,280
a petri dish

920
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,880
with these fungicides he found severe

921
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,760
neurological damage

922
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:25,040
to the nerve cells so he's theorizing

923
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,040
that these are tied into

924
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:31,839
huntington's disease als ms

925
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,000
what have you so they need more studies

926
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:34,000
yet

927
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,880
lauren pang is the health official

928
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:41,440
former whole official

929
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,320
on the island of hawaii know him quite

930
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,599
well

931
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:48,800
in where they've got some severe

932
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:52,560
problems with pesticide exposure say on

933
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:55,520
kauai near a town called waimea

934
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:57,119
the companies have to show a list of

935
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,960
what they were all spraying

936
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,240
and the reason that became a big problem

937
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,480
is there were

938
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,240
times they were spraying uh op

939
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,960
insecticide a neurological

940
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:08,320
affecting herbicide uh insecticide right

941
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,000
next to the schools

942
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,160
and the winds will change from being 20

943
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,599
miles from the north one minute

944
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,520
five minutes later the 20 minutes from

945
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,560
the south and there were

946
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:20,240
adults that would have to go to school

947
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,320
take their kids right to the hospital to

948
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,320
have them treated for

949
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,240
an insecticide that companies would not

950
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,839
reveal they had been sprayed

951
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,160
and at night they'd go home and they'd

952
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:31,440
take their parents to kidney dialysis

953
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:34,560
because all the dust

954
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:36,000
that blew into their houses and

955
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,640
they weren't able to get anything done

956
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:42,160
but what lauren did is when they

957
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:44,720
say epa test one herbicide they only did

958
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:46,400
run one task that's all that's required

959
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,560
when you test two products you have to

960
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,119
test product a and product b

961
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,400
and a times b when you've got three you

962
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:55,839
do a

963
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:59,200
b c a times b b

964
00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:00,320
times c plus a times c so it was at five

965
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,480
or seven

966
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,599
or if you're exposed to 87 different

967
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,400
things

968
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:08,720
probably simultaneously that's one times

969
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:11,599
10 to the 23rd different

970
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,240
cases or combinations you need to test

971
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,920
and they've

972
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:18,400
only got the money to do five

973
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,839
i mentioned chronic botulism become a

974
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,359
deadly disease

975
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:25,359
for cattle if you ever hear about 200

976
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:26,720
cattle all of a sudden being found dead

977
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:30,079
on a farm

978
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:32,880
and it's not lightning it's not ufo

979
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:33,680
damage it's probably chronic botulism

980
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,520
because

981
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,359
what it will do the cattle will get

982
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:40,960
gaunt

983
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:42,720
skeletal the mouth will get paralyzed

984
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,640
and they'll just drop over dead in the

985
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,359
stanton because the neurological

986
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,560
toxin will get our botulism toxin gets

987
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:50,960
so high

988
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,640
now when ladies get a botox injection

989
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,240
that's the same toxin

990
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,760
what the german scientists medical

991
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,800
people have discovered

992
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:01,359
is most sid's death crib death are due

993
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,119
to exposure to botulism

994
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:05,680
and a friend of mine was filling in for

995
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:08,400
don huber when don

996
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,960
was hit in the hospital and he happened

997
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,240
to be out

998
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:15,119
in maine and was

999
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:17,119
giving donald's lecture and donna uh

1000
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:18,160
dairy farmer invited him out to come see

1001
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:21,040
his cattle

1002
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,720
200 or 150 dairy cows that the farmer is

1003
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,640
very proud of

1004
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,800
and bill day's farmers that have all

1005
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,560
their cow's name that was herds of 20 or

1006
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:32,400
so

1007
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:33,760
and anyhow michael watched them walked

1008
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,119
past and

1009
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,040
the farmer asked what do you think of my

1010
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:39,119
cattle he said you got a really nice

1011
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,960
herd you should be really proud

1012
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:42,480
but you've got three or four that have a

1013
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,000
problem

1014
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,000
guy asked what do you mean he said i

1015
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,240
noticed four are walking

1016
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,160
stiffly like their joints are hurting

1017
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,440
them and i watched them drink water by

1018
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,079
the fountain and they're lapping the

1019
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:58,320
water up instead of drinking it

1020
00:38:54,079 --> 00:39:00,079
and he said what might happen you come

1021
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,920
in the next two or three days they'll be

1022
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:04,079
dead in the stance

1023
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,760
and the farmer asks how do you know this

1024
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,079
and mike says well i kind of worked on

1025
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,520
that

1026
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:11,440
my previous life which is where that i

1027
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:14,960
talked about that

1028
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:17,599
grinder and and then the

1029
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,480
farmer started crying great big 200

1030
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,440
pound guy

1031
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,640
six foot three and usually farmers don't

1032
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,960
start crying like that

1033
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,400
mike asked what's the problem he says my

1034
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,760
grandson's in the hospital they don't

1035
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,400
know what's wrong with them

1036
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:34,000
i mean you're going downhill and mike

1037
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:36,960
says call them up and request a botulism

1038
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,160
test right away and they did it was

1039
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,160
positive and they saved the kid

1040
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:46,240
anyhow are we seeing it in iowa yeah

1041
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:48,480
major problem in dairy herds california

1042
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:50,000
i've seen it three times in iowa and

1043
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,760
it's where they're consuming uh

1044
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,520
lights of glyphosate which is screwing

1045
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,960
up the the gut

1046
00:39:53,520 --> 00:40:00,160
population chronic fatigue

1047
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,160
also connected with it

1048
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:07,040
in germany they counter it by taking a

1049
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:08,400
humate product called activa men or

1050
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:11,040
active almond

1051
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,240
in this country there are different uh

1052
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,319
humate sources

1053
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:16,800
uh one that is commercialized and well

1054
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:20,240
researched is a product called restore

1055
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:23,599
which is developed by a triple

1056
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:24,079
certified medical doctor zach bush it is

1057
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,880
sold

1058
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:28,720
in gnc i believe and also walmart for

1059
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,760
about 63 dollars

1060
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:34,800
for a bottle that lasts about 96 days

1061
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:37,040
i take it i think everybody should

1062
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,160
and i'm working with a another humane

1063
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,960
guy out in

1064
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,480
idaho and it'll be a powdered pill

1065
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,400
rather than a liquid

1066
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,760
but what it does it ties up the active

1067
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,599
ingredient

1068
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:51,280
in cattle they can also take sauerkraut

1069
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:53,520
juice because sauerkraut

1070
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,680
is fermented with the lactobacillus

1071
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:58,319
bacteria

1072
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,720
i'm sorry so what does that do exactly

1073
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:01,760
it

1074
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:03,599
uh the lac

1075
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,760
if you're trying to get the gut healthy

1076
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:09,280
again the number one thing is to

1077
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,480
get rid of the herbicide that diet that

1078
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,560
is dirty

1079
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,760
and then try to re-establish the gut

1080
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,560
population

1081
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,560
the number one bacteria beneficial and

1082
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,880
being lactobacillus

1083
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,240
and solid kraut juice or sauerkraut in

1084
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,480
general

1085
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:26,160
contains is fermented using active

1086
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,640
bacillus bacteria

1087
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:31,119
that floats into this sauerkraut from

1088
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,119
the air

1089
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,839
so some

1090
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,960
it sold over the counter in germany

1091
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:47,599
a friend of mine that lives along the

1092
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,760
mississippi river his level was 13 part

1093
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:53,680
per billion in his urine

1094
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:55,920
and anyhow he is german he went over

1095
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:58,400
there brought the product back it's a

1096
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,440
humane pill he made is basically the

1097
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,000
shaving

1098
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:04,319
off the top of a coal bed which is made

1099
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,319
of old plant parts high in carbon

1100
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:08,000
but you've got a lot of binding sites in

1101
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:08,960
it under a microscope that looks like a

1102
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,680
honeycomb

1103
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:14,480
and it ties up the the toxin and then

1104
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,480
you crap it out

1105
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:18,960
you said the product was your store

1106
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:22,319
restore it's a liquid product

1107
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:25,599
and uh well researched

1108
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:30,319
by the nih medical community

1109
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:33,280
and if you look up uh do a youtube

1110
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:36,240
either jeffrey smith or dr mercola

1111
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:38,640
interviewing zach bush

1112
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,599
zach bush i've got to admit he was on

1113
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:43,680
the patrick

1114
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:46,160
temple's gmo revealed

1115
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:48,480
series and they describe him as probably

1116
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:50,000
the best educated best well-spoken young

1117
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,520
physician they've run across and i would

1118
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,680
tend to concur

1119
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:59,760
except he gets about three things wrong

1120
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:02,880
but well worth watching

1121
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,480
and what he's done uh is he made the

1122
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,440
excellent connection between healthy

1123
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:10,640
soil healthy people

1124
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:14,240
uh this was stephanie and anthony's

1125
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:15,520
first talk uh that

1126
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,520
when we're in china one of the

1127
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,440
presenters was a lady by the name of

1128
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,800
rowena or makova

1129
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,640
and we had heard about a study where

1130
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,480
they fed gm food to

1131
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,480
lab animals by the end of the second or

1132
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,760
third generation they're all sterile

1133
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,680
we heard it was done in russian we

1134
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,920
thought well probably done in a bathtub

1135
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,280
our old car radiator

1136
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,040
well she happens to be head of the

1137
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,520
neural uh human behavior

1138
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,960
and neural bioscience institute very

1139
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,720
good scientist is kind of a good

1140
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,560
scientist in russia

1141
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:44,000
and she did not believe the results when

1142
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,760
she did it

1143
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
and usually you don't look at rats and

1144
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:50,720
think those poor little rats

1145
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,640
but she didn't believe the results so he

1146
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:55,920
had the study repeated nine times the

1147
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:59,599
results were the same every single time

1148
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:01,839
and i don't know vladimir putin in

1149
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:05,119
person a friend of mine has met with him

1150
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:06,960
several times but

1151
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:09,200
fed said no more gm food in their

1152
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:14,079
country they view

1153
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:14,079
modified food as a germ warfare weapon

1154
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:20,800
as do the chinese wasn't that

1155
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:23,200
study also found that the rats were

1156
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,200
growing

1157
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:31,200
but yeah the loss of fecundity was

1158
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:34,800
showing up and repeated nine times and

1159
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:36,160
uh one medical conference i was at was

1160
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:39,680
called the environmental health

1161
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:42,960
medical conference they're having one

1162
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:45,680
in i think scottsdale arizona in april

1163
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,040
and anyhow it's the doctors that you go

1164
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:49,839
to when the mayo clinic

1165
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:52,079
says i've got nothing i can do for you i

1166
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:55,119
just go home and prepare to die

1167
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:56,880
and what these doctors do uh every

1168
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:58,560
community i think should have a doctor

1169
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:02,839
trained in this because

1170
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:04,560
without it i'll tell about top 16 out

1171
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:07,520
later

1172
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:08,960
but the learning objective is uh what

1173
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,960
they are teaching

1174
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,640
people that are just getting introduced

1175
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,720
to environmental medicine

1176
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:16,839
if if you have a patient come out do

1177
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:19,440
about a five step

1178
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:21,920
survey

1179
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,920
and say

1180
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,160
five step survey first of all look and

1181
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,280
see what heavy metals they've been

1182
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:33,280
exposed to in

1183
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:35,520
any previous work or hobby

1184
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:38,480
heavy metals what have you number two

1185
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,480
look and see what

1186
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:47,839
maybe bacterial fungal mycotoxins they

1187
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:47,839
may have been exposed to number three

1188
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,280
look and see what industrial compounds

1189
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:54,480
such as in

1190
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:56,160
paint in wallboard in carpet they've

1191
00:45:54,480 --> 00:46:00,960
been exposed to

1192
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:02,160
then look and see what pesticides may be

1193
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:05,040
coming through the food

1194
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,520
or the water and then lastly look at

1195
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:08,960
maybe

1196
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:10,720
em emission height levels the electrical

1197
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,480
circuitry or gauss's coming from

1198
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:14,560
electronic equipment

1199
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,920
a lot of work on cell phones has in

1200
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:18,319
wi-fi has been done

1201
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:20,319
in the netherlands and israel they do

1202
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:21,520
not have been worldwide conferences on

1203
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:23,839
that topic

1204
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,800
a friend of mines whose wife was on six

1205
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:27,200
star

1206
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:29,920
sunday morning cbs a few years ago when

1207
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:31,839
they were researching it

1208
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,440
caught the start of it before running

1209
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:36,000
out doing some work and i said

1210
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,720
that's what bert's wife has and she is a

1211
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,520
processing

1212
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:41,040
engineer that taught at a university but

1213
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:43,920
she could no longer tolerate

1214
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:45,920
cell phone power signals and she can't

1215
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:49,119
take the signal from

1216
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:52,240
u.s cellular her sister cannot tolerate

1217
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:54,160
signals from verizon and anyhow they had

1218
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:56,480
her living in a metal travel trailer

1219
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:58,160
inside a machine shed and that still

1220
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,960
wasn't enough so she'd get physically

1221
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,560
out

1222
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,400
they finally sold some ground and they

1223
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:05,440
bought a house in west virginia

1224
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:09,040
where they got a big radio uh telescope

1225
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:11,359
to listen for signals from outer space

1226
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:14,079
and uh that whole valley that people can

1227
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:17,200
have cell phones they can't have wi-fi

1228
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:19,040
and the whole valley which is big in

1229
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,400
west virginia is being populated by

1230
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,000
people from

1231
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,599
around the world that are sensitive to

1232
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,520
em signals

1233
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:28,000
uh anyhow the major conference was

1234
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:30,480
chaired by a senator from iowa and joel

1235
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,480
lieberman

1236
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:36,839
and they ruled this research is real

1237
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:38,720
people are affected by having health

1238
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:41,440
consequences but

1239
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:43,200
basically major companies utilities and

1240
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:45,280
cell phone companies

1241
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:47,200
were probably at fault partly the

1242
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,800
utilities because they take the easy way

1243
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:52,000
to ground their equipment

1244
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:54,240
out now in human medicine it's not

1245
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,599
a topic in dairy cattle that are very

1246
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:58,559
sensitive

1247
00:47:55,599 --> 00:48:00,640
i've got a couple friends that uh go out

1248
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:03,440
and they diagnose three voltage

1249
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:05,119
and they're very very sometimes are

1250
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,640
actually natural because you sit on a

1251
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:10,720
tetronic plate

1252
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:15,680
but they actually clear up the problem

1253
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:15,680
but there is the agenda

1254
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:21,119
there's a list that's kind of what i was

1255
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:23,760
looking for

1256
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:25,440
uh basically look at fam family history

1257
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,119
have you a history of disease

1258
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:29,760
why this is important is the number one

1259
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:33,599
detox system in the body

1260
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:36,240
for chemicals and in the plants

1261
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:38,079
herbicides is what's called the p450

1262
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:40,319
cytochrome system

1263
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:42,160
and it allows the body to detox it by

1264
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:45,119
breaking it down

1265
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:46,400
if you've got poor mineralization in

1266
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:48,559
your history

1267
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,760
or you've got a lower genetic tolerance

1268
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:52,400
to it

1269
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,040
uh you may not be able to detoxify

1270
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,359
something

1271
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:57,040
that you're one of your siblings or one

1272
00:48:55,359 --> 00:49:00,319
of your cousin can't

1273
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:02,800
that's very important now uh

1274
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:04,160
dow chemical has a dark history and what

1275
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,079
it boiled down to

1276
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:08,400
is they were using an organophosphate

1277
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:10,240
insecticide as a termiticide

1278
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:11,520
so people would come and have their

1279
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:14,880
house treated for

1280
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:17,520
termites the vapor would move and if the

1281
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:20,800
kids slept in a downstairs basement

1282
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:23,119
uh the day after it was treated some

1283
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:25,040
of those kids went into a coma that they

1284
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:27,599
were still in 30 years later

1285
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:29,920
and dow was paying for their care and

1286
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:31,680
that was never revealed but a

1287
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:33,440
happy head of a group and the head of

1288
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:35,200
research for that company was

1289
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,280
a good was a friend of mine and great

1290
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:39,520
guy to work with and that's why they

1291
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:42,240
moved to using fipronil instead of

1292
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:44,240
the organophosphate much safer and it

1293
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:46,000
lasts longer

1294
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:47,680
so what we talk about what contributes

1295
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,280
to total body burden

1296
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:51,520
and basically anytime you're exposed to

1297
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:53,839
something that challenges your

1298
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:58,640
immune function and detox system it's

1299
00:49:53,839 --> 00:50:02,400
all cumulative

1300
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:04,720
uh the best uh medical health doctor

1301
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,520
in the country that i've run across is

1302
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:09,359
uh

1303
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:11,680
jill carnahan she's an illinois farm gal

1304
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:12,640
and she is a survivor of cancer in

1305
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:15,200
crohn's

1306
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:16,960
and also mold exposure when her boulder

1307
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:20,160
colorado office

1308
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:22,480
was flooded anyhow the way she

1309
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:23,280
related is suppose you've all got your

1310
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:26,720
personal

1311
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:29,119
detox bucket it's a five gallon bucket

1312
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:30,800
and some people's buckets are hinged at

1313
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:32,880
two inches above the ground

1314
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,400
others are right at the top and every

1315
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,760
time you're exposed to something that

1316
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:38,880
bucket gets filled

1317
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:42,480
forward and fuller when that bucket tips

1318
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:45,280
that's when you get sick so if you can

1319
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,920
decontaminate your body or clean out

1320
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,599
your liver

1321
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:55,119
the main filtration system in the body

1322
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:58,319
then you're going to stay healthy

1323
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:59,200
and uh you've got different spectrums of

1324
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:01,520
viability

1325
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:03,119
depending on the mineral levels and then

1326
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:09,839
also

1327
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:09,839
your diet and your genetics

1328
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:14,800
the number two system is methylation

1329
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:19,359
there's four of these four minor ones

1330
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:23,040
one major one different symptomology

1331
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:26,400
all the time rashes

1332
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:30,319
sleepiness irritability canker sores

1333
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:33,599
look through there quite a list

1334
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:36,720
i think i only listed half of them here

1335
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:41,599
more red flags allergies

1336
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:45,040
infertility brain fog

1337
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:46,640
the young fellow i've got with me is a

1338
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:48,160
grandson of a good friend of mine that

1339
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:51,280
does a lot of ag writing

1340
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:54,079
very good investigator and anyhow

1341
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,760
this kid and his father had severe

1342
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:58,400
problem with brain fog

1343
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:59,760
they started taking the restore which

1344
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,559
with the minerals in it

1345
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:05,040
repaired the direct circuitry from the

1346
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:08,000
gut into the brain and brain fog cleared

1347
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,000
up within 20 minutes

1348
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:12,000
i started taking one of their products

1349
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:15,359
it was called

1350
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,280
h2 and i'm usually usually get six hours

1351
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:18,000
of sleep and i'm wired and going yet at

1352
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,160
three

1353
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,920
but i was taking that i was going 23

1354
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,359
hours a day and i wasn't getting tired

1355
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,800
that kind of scared me

1356
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:26,720
because i know you can't do that too

1357
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:29,760
long

1358
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:33,680
but it's an h2 product

1359
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:35,119
so good slide and this i think came from

1360
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:40,480
uh it originally had

1361
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:40,480
sweet crawford in there who was from

1362
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:45,200
dekalb illinois but it said if a woman

1363
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:47,280
is getting out

1364
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:49,839
to get dressed up and go out she's

1365
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:52,960
exposing herself to 187

1366
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:52,960
potential toxins

1367
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:59,839
and this is why i was down in

1368
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:02,800
ecuador working on some rose farms and

1369
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:04,720
long-term potential is to get them

1370
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,520
extracting essential oils for the

1371
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:09,200
organic

1372
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:13,119
cosmetic industry in europe

1373
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:14,559
that's where the bumps are anyhow

1374
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:16,160
a lot of things you're probably sitting

1375
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:16,720
there thinking holy crap i use them all

1376
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:19,760
the time

1377
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:22,960
so like running into potential problems

1378
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:24,240
as far as glyphosate exposure anthony

1379
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,800
samsel did the study

1380
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:28,160
and the gel caps that most medicines

1381
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:31,359
come in

1382
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:34,319
are made from collagen which comes from

1383
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:35,920
cattle tendons and such they boil them

1384
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:37,760
and they don't give any regards if

1385
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:39,680
there's any glyphosate

1386
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:42,319
eaten by those cattle that is in the gel

1387
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:44,400
caps and also when they make medicines

1388
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:47,920
they use that fermentation

1389
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:50,160
and the media typically will continue

1390
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:51,359
so my wife's name is carol she was

1391
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:54,400
feeling uh

1392
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:57,440
doll and she's she's a live wire she's a

1393
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:59,040
retirement age and she worked 42 years

1394
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:02,559
in a medical lab

1395
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:04,720
and anyhow rachel

1396
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:05,920
did a over the phone exposure because

1397
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:08,960
that's richard's gift

1398
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:10,079
go listen to him and he listened and she

1399
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,319
was full of fluoride

1400
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:15,359
4x normal levels with the hair analysis

1401
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:16,640
showed where did she get it from

1402
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:20,319
at the time we thought it was from

1403
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:24,400
bottled water and from

1404
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:27,680
taking cholesterol drugs statins

1405
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:30,720
because they're fluoride based anyhow uh

1406
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:34,640
she went to arden anderson who's a

1407
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:38,319
head's our think tank group and he's a

1408
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:40,960
md ph.d masters in public health

1409
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:42,640
agronomist air force flight surgeon so

1410
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:44,880
he's pretty good

1411
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:45,760
and went to his uh got an adt a

1412
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,720
chelation

1413
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:49,520
from him in his office west of kansas

1414
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:52,559
city

1415
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:54,400
and it came back and her body ate high

1416
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:55,200
cholesterol and also stopped like on

1417
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,599
fire

1418
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:59,760
so they did the et chelation 24-hour

1419
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:03,359
urine catch they sent it to the lab

1420
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:06,559
came back and she was full of lead

1421
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:09,839
gallatin galidenium thorium

1422
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:11,520
caesium and they said where

1423
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:13,119
might these have come from what was your

1424
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:15,760
job well

1425
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:16,559
iowa state university in the doe lab is

1426
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,960
their

1427
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:20,640
center for rare earth research and

1428
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:23,119
they're refining them

1429
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,680
in the floor right above her my first

1430
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:26,079
question

1431
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:28,160
is did they have a separate ventilation

1432
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:30,079
system the answer was no

1433
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:32,720
so she was full of these and why she had

1434
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:35,359
the high level of cholesterol

1435
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:35,760
is if this was causing inflammation and

1436
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:38,880
the

1437
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:39,760
body knows that it's the liver to go

1438
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,880
into high gear

1439
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:44,400
reduce as much as you can to protect the

1440
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:46,319
brain

1441
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,520
so she went down had a full body

1442
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:49,280
chelation by the top

1443
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:51,440
doctor in the country who's also in the

1444
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:54,880
think tank down in beaumont

1445
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:56,720
down in kirbyville texas and after nine

1446
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:59,280
sessions they dropped her

1447
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:00,079
cholesterol level by over 100 points got

1448
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,520
rid of the ache

1449
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:04,319
and the pains and she's ready to go for

1450
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,319
another 20 years

1451
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:08,960
so anyhow most people don't know about

1452
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:10,880
that they sit there

1453
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:13,440
she went to the doctor and the doctor

1454
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:15,680
said she couldn't sleep either

1455
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:18,400
and her solution all the problem is take

1456
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:18,400
a sleeping pill

1457
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:22,960
so that's why i think more people need

1458
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:25,040
to be aware of this and be aware that

1459
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,319
turn of the century most hospitals had a

1460
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:29,520
chelation office

1461
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:30,559
but what they do this guy besides being

1462
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:32,799
a medical doctor

1463
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:33,680
it was a physicist he built his own

1464
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:36,079
equipment

1465
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:37,680
but they take the blood out they run it

1466
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:41,920
through a uv

1467
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:43,200
light they subject it to ozone to get

1468
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:45,440
more oxygen in there

1469
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,880
and they inject the edt8 which is a

1470
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:49,040
universal solvent

1471
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:50,880
but she got rid of the plaque of her

1472
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:54,160
blood vessels

1473
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:55,280
83 year old friend of mine he gets a

1474
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:58,240
chelation

1475
00:56:55,280 --> 00:57:00,400
about twice a year he's got zero plaque

1476
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:01,839
in his blood vessels

1477
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:04,000
the only thing he's got wrong with his

1478
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:05,680
health he's got angina because he

1479
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,480
put his cell phone in his shirt pocket

1480
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,480
for too many years

1481
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:17,119
so i'm going down there i

1482
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,760
great health but i know i like steak i

1483
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:20,960
like

1484
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:23,520
french fries sometimes i fry hash browns

1485
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:26,799
i'm going down there just because i know

1486
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:30,000
the years i've got some plaque probably

1487
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:32,160
so it's there as far as mold what do we

1488
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,160
do

1489
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:35,680
we're down in ecuador and along the

1490
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:38,640
coast everyone's got

1491
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:39,119
mold problems if you're in hawaii major

1492
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:42,559
problem

1493
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:43,920
even in fancy houses they pulled the

1494
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:45,760
they didn't know where the mold was they

1495
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:47,040
took the wallpaper down guess where it

1496
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:50,160
was

1497
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:51,040
it was growing on the glue which is

1498
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:53,760
scottish based

1499
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:55,359
in the house in a nice house you think

1500
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:58,400
there's no mold

1501
00:57:55,359 --> 00:58:02,319
except and that one place is on the sofa

1502
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:05,599
cushions so uh continuous problem

1503
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:07,280
serious problem again symptoms

1504
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:09,040
associated with it

1505
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:10,319
many there's 14 different ones i think

1506
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:13,839
there's two pages

1507
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:15,440
28 major mycotoxins ingrained

1508
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:17,520
the thing is if they're coming at you

1509
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:20,079
you don't know they're there

1510
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:21,280
because they're tough to detect and also

1511
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:24,960
say one major one

1512
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:27,559
of the t2 toxins there's 400 of them

1513
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:30,160
only one has been researched the other

1514
00:58:27,559 --> 00:58:32,480
399 have been researched but the

1515
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:36,799
data is still classified top secret by

1516
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:39,680
the us military

1517
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:40,240
and what we're seeing now with more root

1518
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,240
rots

1519
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:44,559
because glyphosate kills off the

1520
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:48,000
beneficial bacteria in the soil

1521
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:50,799
the fusarium and aspergillus

1522
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,240
molds are increasing and showing up in

1523
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:56,079
the diet

1524
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:59,200
this oxford trained medical pathologist

1525
00:58:56,079 --> 00:59:01,119
went into a local grocery store and he's

1526
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:03,680
got the old rebel type but he

1527
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:05,200
went and grabbed samples from 20 boxes

1528
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:07,040
of kids cereal

1529
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:10,240
none of them tested under the allowable

1530
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:10,240
level for mycotoxins

1531
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:16,839
again health effects of fungi breathe in

1532
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:22,079
there

1533
00:59:16,839 --> 00:59:24,799
numerous common symptoms

1534
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:27,760
ones that most people have at some time

1535
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:27,760
maybe all the times

1536
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:36,960
again symptoms metallic taste

1537
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:39,520
quite common sometimes uh

1538
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:40,160
supposed not supposed to reveal this yet

1539
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:43,520
but uh

1540
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:44,160
will anyhow we had the bird flu come

1541
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:46,960
through iowa

1542
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:48,880
supposedly a viral disease things were

1543
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:51,599
extremely fishy with it

1544
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:52,319
different producers were told anybody in

1545
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:55,440
my group

1546
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:58,160
do not allow feed samples to be taken

1547
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:59,760
anyhow it ended up in 46 million

1548
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,799
chickens and turkeys ended up being

1549
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:02,799
destroyed

1550
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:04,480
sometimes multi-million dollar losses

1551
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:06,160
and then a major problem with disposing

1552
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:08,559
of the carcasses

1553
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:10,400
anyway i was sitting there mentioning to

1554
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:12,319
a water research friend of mine

1555
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:14,000
i made the comment wouldn't it be nice

1556
01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:14,720
if someone had a machine you could sit

1557
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,599
down

1558
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:19,200
and using either electronic waves or

1559
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:21,200
some sort of smell wipe out all the

1560
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,240
bacteria and fungi that are causing the

1561
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,079
problem

1562
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:25,520
well one of these has been developed it

1563
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:26,720
was tested by the world health

1564
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:28,880
organization

1565
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:30,880
and he was called to testify in front of

1566
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:33,520
the whole over in italy

1567
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:35,119
three weeks ago and this device we hope

1568
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:37,680
to get on the market

1569
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:37,680
looks good

1570
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:42,000
we've got a health and wellness page we

1571
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,520
uh put a website together with the help

1572
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,559
of the guy that did the website for

1573
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:47,119
steppenwolf

1574
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:48,960
and a grateful dead and we put a lot of

1575
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:51,040
our own content in there

1576
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:52,240
and we have a health solution store up

1577
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:54,400
there for people trying to get the

1578
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:57,040
information

1579
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:59,359
and uh a good example if you're a

1580
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:01,839
teacher or have kids

1581
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:02,400
there was a school in wisconsin up at

1582
01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:05,520
appleton

1583
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:09,280
and it was a school for behavior or

1584
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:11,119
disordered kids and uh

1585
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:12,960
delinquents kids that didn't go to

1586
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:13,520
school getting bad grades didn't want to

1587
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:16,079
study

1588
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:18,160
true what have you and an outside

1589
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:19,680
consultant came in that had a good idea

1590
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:21,119
on diet and he looked at the doctor he

1591
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:22,799
said everything junk

1592
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:25,440
let's get rid of the pop let's get rid

1593
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:27,920
of the high fructose corn syrup

1594
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:29,760
let's uh put better food in there which

1595
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:33,599
ended up being cheaper

1596
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:35,680
and after three months

1597
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:36,880
all the kids were perfect no behavior

1598
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:38,880
problems that was

1599
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:41,119
one of the better performing high

1600
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:44,240
schools in the state of wisconsin

1601
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:45,920
and nationally and anyhow the officials

1602
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:49,440
were told whatever you do don't

1603
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:51,200
tell anyone else about this thing

1604
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:52,720
but a daughter a friend of ours happen

1605
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:54,480
to know about this

1606
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:55,760
but it's called you can google it

1607
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:59,920
miracle in wisconsin

1608
01:01:55,760 --> 01:02:01,760
some neat stories but it was proof that

1609
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:03,599
all these toxins that are in the grain

1610
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:06,559
mycotoxins poor diet

1611
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:08,000
does have consequences shows up in the

1612
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:08,799
kids because they're younger they don't

1613
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,079
have the big

1614
01:02:08,799 --> 01:02:13,599
fully functioning immune system so

1615
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:15,200
recommendations then for all these

1616
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:17,440
problems we tell people clean up the

1617
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:20,079
food supply

1618
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:21,280
use restore or this hopefully to get on

1619
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:24,319
the market

1620
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:27,520
called the molecule to repair the gut

1621
01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:30,559
tract tissue and then to get rid of any

1622
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:33,200
prions which were not in the food supply

1623
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:35,280
and maybe are linked to alzheimer's

1624
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:37,359
because it's a plaque disease

1625
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:39,280
uh anthony samsel has done a lot of work

1626
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:42,240
on it he concurs with that

1627
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:44,559
but there is clean optilite available i

1628
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:45,440
get mine from a micro minerals company

1629
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:47,280
out of

1630
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:50,240
the netherlands i have don bring it back

1631
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:53,359
when he comes to europe

1632
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:56,559
nine grams per day there is a small

1633
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:59,839
religious community in illinois and

1634
01:02:56,559 --> 01:03:02,000
one of the leaders of the church was in

1635
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:03,200
our group and owns a seed company

1636
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,440
and we're down there putting on a

1637
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:06,400
meeting and all of a sudden being as an

1638
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:08,240
elder in the church

1639
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:09,839
he got word that this lady in his

1640
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:11,920
community had miscarried for the third

1641
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:13,520
or fourth time in a row

1642
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:16,799
and they had not had a live birth in

1643
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:20,000
their community for a year

1644
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:22,240
and we sent

1645
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,000
some placental tissue down to the vet

1646
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,880
pathologist that had done the work on

1647
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,200
the

1648
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:29,359
large animals and the placental tissue

1649
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:31,200
was full of these crystals

1650
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:33,839
and the next question is what do we do

1651
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:35,599
about it and some amish guy came up with

1652
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:36,079
a solution before we could figure it out

1653
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:37,680
but

1654
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:39,680
they started taking the clinton out till

1655
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:40,799
the light and within nine months they're

1656
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:42,559
going to have a light burst in the

1657
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:44,559
community again

1658
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:46,240
we've seen the same thing in animals

1659
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:49,119
point nine grams per day

1660
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:50,240
in with the juice the same thing if

1661
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:53,039
you're

1662
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:53,839
tr ha if somebody your family is being

1663
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:58,240
treated for

1664
01:03:53,839 --> 01:03:59,920
a cancerous tumor the best way to shrink

1665
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:00,720
the size of the tube and maybe make it

1666
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:03,520
disappear

1667
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:04,480
is take this because it chelates out the

1668
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:06,799
iron

1669
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:08,079
and energy is delivered to the tumor by

1670
01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:10,240
a charged iron

1671
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:11,680
so if you take it they say take mineral

1672
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:15,839
supplements at the same time

1673
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:15,839
so where is this available in the u.s

1674
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:20,480
different health food stores sell it

1675
01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:23,760
they jack the price up quite a bit

1676
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:27,839
i get mine for maybe 10 a pound

1677
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:27,839
out of micro minerals in the netherlands

1678
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,960
if you anyone in your family has

1679
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:35,200
aquariums

1680
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:36,960
and you can go to the aquarium store and

1681
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:38,400
get a filter that pulls the ammonia out

1682
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:40,319
of the water

1683
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:42,000
that's called zeolite it's volcanic

1684
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:46,000
mineral when they grind it

1685
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:48,400
smaller then it comes to an optilite

1686
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,000
i'll last the fertility organic growers

1687
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:54,400
will use a product called

1688
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:54,400
azolite hazelnite is also

1689
01:04:54,880 --> 01:05:02,880
zeolite uh we work with a couple

1690
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:04,559
uh our medical doctors environmental

1691
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:05,839
health medical people

1692
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:07,760
taught one's from illinois there's a

1693
01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:10,319
real good one from out in

1694
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:12,480
mount shasta california they work with

1695
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:12,480
us

1696
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:18,079
as far as the effect of all of these

1697
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:21,440
exposures we don't quite know

1698
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:22,960
michael k skinner was a good

1699
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:24,880
researcher at washington state

1700
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:28,240
university and in his

1701
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:29,220
uh multi-year study he exposed lab

1702
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:30,640
animals to

1703
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:32,880
[Music]

1704
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:35,680
five different toxins at levels one one

1705
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:37,920
hundredth of what was considered harmful

1706
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:39,520
and the genetic damage was done and the

1707
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,319
damage did not show up until the third

1708
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:44,480
generation

1709
01:05:40,319 --> 01:05:47,440
later again they censored him on that

1710
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:48,559
i showed the restored product very

1711
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:50,480
usable

1712
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:53,839
my friend that developed the other

1713
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:56,400
machine has his phd in biophysics from

1714
01:05:53,839 --> 01:05:59,680
oxford and tokyo he developed an under

1715
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:02,240
the counterfeit system for about 1500

1716
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:03,280
that will pull the roundup out of

1717
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:05,680
drinking water

1718
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:08,240
so if you've got a water supply that is

1719
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:10,079
coming stream fed

1720
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:11,440
you always want to look upstream and ask

1721
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:14,160
what crops are being grown

1722
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:16,400
and what pesticides are they're using if

1723
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:19,920
it's a pesticide with a

1724
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:22,400
long residual life then you should have

1725
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:24,880
your urine tested

1726
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:26,559
which can be done by john fagan at his

1727
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:28,160
lab in fairfield iowa it's called

1728
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:30,480
research health lab

1729
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:32,640
and he's got the equipment to test for

1730
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:33,440
glyphosate and its primary metabolite

1731
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:36,480
which is called

1732
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:38,480
ampa amino methylphosphonic acid

1733
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:40,000
but you should have that done i've had

1734
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:41,920
it done but that was when they're using

1735
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,920
immunoassay which was not

1736
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:45,680
as accurate as what the germans could do

1737
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:47,680
so i need to get that done i've got a

1738
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:50,000
kit paid for just haven't done it

1739
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:53,280
there's the under the counter

1740
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,799
works very well does he talk to don

1741
01:06:53,280 --> 01:07:01,839
huber he found out the

1742
01:06:54,799 --> 01:07:01,839
chelation quotient

1743
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:04,240
you
