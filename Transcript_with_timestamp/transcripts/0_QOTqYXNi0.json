  "text": "[Music] [Music] a gross weight and welcome everyone to a great backyard garden with me Michel junus waist thank you for those of you who have congratulated me on becoming the chairman of the collar village council thank you very very much if you watch in Perm to choose the video you would have seen that I uploaded a video where someone sent me a video to react to and I reacted to where someone actually wear nifty odd does I believe they took bottles and they cut off the top of the bottle so what they did they took bottles I cut off the top of one bottle they drilled a hole in the cover of another and let's imagine that is not here and they put it in this like that we for Fred or string or rope come out from this bottle of water going up to this model to be plants this was a self watering technique and I thought it was very very innovative and I thought to myself perhaps I can do this but in a different way let me just tell you why this happens or why this can work whether you use the water the rope up or down the things that once there's a way for water to travel or to go through it will pass when you have the soil on top it will dry out eventually I plan to take up the moisture or Sun or point is it a gel on top and there's water below and there's a medium a way for the waters to work now water will move from an area of high concentration to low concentration as long as there's a way for it to go through so even if we population this technique kurosu without the work evaporation will happen and water will go up rise even if the water do not rise because of the whoop do because this is filled water and the top will be drying out constantly because the plants be taken in moisture now water will move from the high concentration up the rope to the low concentration and this is how to work and simply happening with this technique so I'm just gonna show you exactly what I did I'll show you the result because it did work and I will tell you more about it let's go ahead I fill this up of water and then I use a cotton cloth or batsto wheel drive a lot of cotton I think this is mini cotton I roll it up and then I put piece another soil here and then this part here now what happened is because what I'll move from an area of high concentration to low concentration as I told you meaning there is extremely wet moist and that was dry so the water came up dry cloth when done the dry cloth and will work faster because of gravity and went in here now as you can see this part is dry and this part is wet so this goes to show that the water is moving constantly from an area of high concentration down the cloth which is like a medium this is what it used to go down or what I was doing I had a stick on the hill hold on because what happened is a limb just see if I can find a way right I had to use this stick to keep the cloth off of the peel because similar to domina the water was going on on sub-wavelength is going in the instead right so this is an idea I can walk off pretty well I'm quite sure just by watching that you might because for me to be in the Old Market Garden I let me just show you already a tomato here right here started to sprout so as you can see this dry let's your idea is now if you notice the top is dry but the bottom is wet what has happen is that the water is slowly moving from an area of higher concentration which is here to lower concentration obviously to start from the bottom and adventure the top will become the top here which is dry will eventually look like this here which is moist but this idea can work pretty well as I told you I saw this on even to Tuesday when I reacted to the video and I thought to myself I can try this or know what I'm going to do I'm going to try it out in my plan to stand right here I'm gonna try it out right here so I'm gonna try to find a way to put in a pail of water here I'm on the next end over there and then have a cloth right here lying down or maybe I might put it from here to here so that the water and coming from the peel up here come down on here and I have another peels over here so this area because the moist and obviously like I will put the cloth to pass between hand here so no matter what moisture mantle good I could to the plant but because they'll be moist the water be passing so this is an idea I think that can pretty well and it's very comical because you can feel a continent water and you don't need to come and watch it every two days or three days if you have enough if you have a big enough peel either to only this lasted about what three to four days and it's extremely hot in the green ah so I think we should also take into consideration that evaporation been happening but it's not as constant of course because we can see that it worked if that was dry then we can say okay the water here disappeared from evaporation in the atmosphere but here is extremely moist its moist it's more sense working so I wanna encourage you of course obviously there isn't too long and I'm talking too much but please be encouraged that you should try out this idea find a way with your bucket garden to try this idea and being innovative be very creative in using out this idea because of course guys I hope that you enjoy this video feature thank you very much for requesting that I reacted to the video that I didn't choose the easier the video that you want me to react to don't forget you could leave a comment below on any other videos of adversity bucket garden or could send me a message by whatsapp number one seven six seven six one seven zero two two four don't forget to check out my other youtube channel which is called genus with just a comment tree I will post a link middle of course guys thank you for subscribing to our YouTube channel and don't forget when you press subscribe there's a bear next to will subscribe click on it so that you'll be notified when I put a new video and I wish it back in Canon thank you for liking our Facebook page thank you follow us on Twitter and on Instagram and to encourage you to remember a backyard garden in some way so definitely keep the doctors away and address ways out",
