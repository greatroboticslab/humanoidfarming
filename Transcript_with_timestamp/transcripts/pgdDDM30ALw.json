  "text": "I want to thank everybody we just hit 17,000 subscribers the other day thanks modern standards good morning modern standards we've got probably at least inches of snow yesterday and last night it's crazy it's cold out this morning they're calling for today and tomorrow to be negative 40 with the windchill it's gonna be cold let's make sure all the animals have extra hay well we were getting a lot of questions about how does our outdoor green house hold up with all the snow and what do you need to do this morning before I clean up the winter chicken coop I thought I'd show you how I do it what works well for us [Applause] [Applause] they love the fresh hay this time of the year especially go Peck through and eat all the grain to help encourage that we don't like to have electricity out running to our coops so what we really like using on these rubber water buckets mat troughs whatever you want to call them and they get frozen flip them over step on them well nice and clean the snow on the greenhouse it's pretty dark in here too what I use to clean off the greenhouse whatever I have in my hand you have a push from that works good you have your feed bucket that works good easy peasy just like that it lets so much more light in but keep the snow off of it and we don't have to worry about the greenhouse collapsing off and the chickens really like the extra light one of the other really good benefits about doing this is and piles up the snow along the side of the winter chicken coop slash greenhouse and it helps keep out the drafts it seals it up believe it or not snow is a very good insulator believe for every inch of snow you get one hour value so that's pretty good so the heat can go up the top which is fine but if we can keep a lot of the drafts out on the sides for the animals it's great you don't want it airtight because your animals need fresh air circulating you couldn't have your animals in a barn a heated barn that's not good for them you want to have them out of the elements the biggest things you want keep my little wind and they want to have a place room to go and get in from the wind in the walk rain or water but the elements the cold is still good for them you just want to have an a draft free area it's kind of weird like we want to go inside in a warm house I'm sure the animals would love to do it but it's not healthy for them so we got to remember that we're not animals don't react to this weather the same way we do the more they're out in it the better it is formed especially the more natural it is like our pigs are getting a huge winter coat on them so that's keeping them warm yesterday when I was out feeding them in the afternoon it was snow no good but all the snow was melted off them they will wet sweating and then they can go inside there too hey going there they can dry off they can get warm they can go back in and out this weather doesn't bother them they're getting acclimated to it they do it really good speaking of that let's go check on the pigs and see how they like and all the snow [Applause] guess we gotta pack our trail down if it ever warmed up we can do some snowshoeing it's gonna be way too cold this weekend to get under this tree keeps getting narrower and narrower we gotta keep ducking I think it's between the snow buildup and the tree get him weighted down from all the snow they've been out and about good morning what are you girls thinking of snow oh you know what that means huh I don't know if that noise will ever get old they definitely are eating a lot more which is a good thing I want to see him eating that means they're staying warm if we need to go through an extra couple of bags of feed to keep them warm it's worth it later on today I'll bring them out a fresh bill of hay went to the feed store the other day and I picked up a few extra be able to hay because I knew it was gonna be cold out this coming week and weekend it's banked up nice all around the sides of the greenhouse what do you think of all this snow okay the day off yesterday in a two-hour delay today and this is just the week back from winter break you get a whole nother break I was hoping today to start building our large soil block maker that our medium-sized soil blocks will fit into but with all this cold coming and snow we got we're gonna switch gears we have some Quonset tents or tent sheds we got to clean those off otherwise they're gonna collapse and we need to get more firewood in the house tomorrow today it's supposed to start supposed to be like 40 below zero with the windchill we're gonna be going through some firewood so we've already gone through quite a bit this week has been so darn cold that pile is brought up to the window we had another one in front of it clean this up and get some more wooden ah [Music] the aprons dry in nicely my went a little overboard I want to have like an heirloom quality apron that I know will handle my abuse that I can do anything with it and I have to worry about it and it just gets better and better with aids like it gets more patina to it no last that's what I like to do stuff that's kind of my thought pattern now if we built the house the use of all wood wood floor wood walls with squid siding metal roof like something's gonna happen to it if we have used it or it gets beaten up a little bit I want to look nicer with age the outdoor kitchen all rough sawn lumber it's just the older it gets the more character it's gonna get the more age is gonna have now with our new day modern plastic world the older it gets the crafty or it gets it throw it away and get some new stuff what are they saying vinyls final it's not wood is final just don't paint it oil your oil stuff it last like the outside of our house we've oiled the siding and if we have to redo it we don't have to scrape it and paint it we can power wash it let it dry and reel it easy-peasy and they'll just keep adding to the richness and the beauty over time and that's what I'm hoping for with the leather apron it's probably half of it's probably completely dry so I'm excited I can't wait to start using it I'll be using it in the intensive three-day pasture to plate class we're going to be putting on here in April with the pigs on us it's gonna be exciting all right enough staying warm by the fire we got to get outside and get some stuff done judo doesn't look like she wants to come out but I bet as soon as we get ready to go out we asked should we write out the door with us jumping around no come back in July by the wood stove and melt the snow off of her you ready to go out [Music] let's grab snow shovels hay for the animals snow broom this thing works amazing for cleaning off your cars we're not using it for that right now right Pluto yes first of all I'm gonna get in the hair [Music] all right that one's taken care of do you covet Quan this way [Music] [Applause] we're going to the tent Pluto you got it whoo snow is neat as snow is knee-deep over here Oh even deeper this quantit tent was over that way quite a bit the tractor was parked in it we had a microburst that came through last spring took the tent off threw it up in the trees for the month later laying it back down over here we haven't used this with the boaters said well we got to make sure we keep it cleaned off otherwise it's got a cave-in and it'll be jump [Music] well a snow hasn't been plowed it's knee-deep right now it's just beginning of January we're gonna get a lot of snow this year I think Monday and Tuesday they call for more snow glad I got that roof beam off I would've caved in with the next storm I betcha [Music] lower down one floor down let's go hey slow down [Music] [Music] [Music] you want to go and defrost you nice and warm Figaro [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you're gonna have to finish up plowing inside the cameras not liking the wind chill out there this morning we've already had a few camera errors time ago get firewood hi at least now tomorrow when it blowing 40 below zero all day long will be warm [Applause] [Music] be happy too let's keep us warm for a few days I hope there now I know I can sleep good at night I'll have a nice warm house we lose power we don't have to worry about electricity heating our house it's 40 below outside we got plenty of wood in the house we don't get to go outside and get it I'm ready to stay inside this weekend thanks for liking commenting and subscribing we'll see you right back here tomorrow at lawmakers a guide to modern home setting self-sufficiency and freedom bye [Music]",
