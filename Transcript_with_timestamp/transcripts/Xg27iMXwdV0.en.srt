1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,319
in the next 35 years we'll have to

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,399
produce more food than all of the

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:09,559
world's production combined over the

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:12,240
last 2,000 so what will the Farms of the

5
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:14,920
future look like well they're unlikely

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,880
to look like this just yet but many of

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,800
the Sci-Fi looking elements are already

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,400
on the way take automation these concept

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,439
robots are being designed to

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,920
autonomously scout sense and treat

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,800
invasive Pest and pathogens with micro

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,559
amounts of herbicide or pesticide vastly

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,200
reducing the cost and environmental

14
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,800
impacts associated with these chemicals

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,399
this is known as Precision farming and

16
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,640
see here how the lasers on this tractor

17
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,280
can detect the presence of weed to only

18
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,600
treat affected

19
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,879
areas and this is the ladybird Rover a

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,039
working solar powered prototype that

21
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:53,879
conducts autonomous Farm surveillance

22
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:56,600
mapping and weed

23
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:58,879
detection drones are also tipped to play

24
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,800
a big role in The Farms of the future

25
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,960
like this octop at rothamstead research

26
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,880
this bbsrc funded demonstrator

27
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,200
technology could help the farmers of the

28
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,439
future measure growth and biomass and

29
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,320
detect stresses to crops from pathogens

30
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:15,360
or lacks of nutrients or water other

31
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,880
researchers are already using them for

32
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,799
surveillance sewing seeds and even to

33
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,680
find or her farm animals as you can see

34
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:26,000
here vehicles like these utilize the

35
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,759
latest Advanced sensors and the Farms of

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,600
the future will be packed with them

37
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,560
multi and hyperspectral cameras for

38
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,600
example Le can see problems that the

39
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,040
human ey just can't and want 24 hours a

40
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:40,560
day feeding data back to Shared cloud

41
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:43,320
services for analysis and action and it

42
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,119
doesn't have to cost a fortune even now

43
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,159
a lot of this data can be gathered

44
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,600
calculated or uploaded by smartphone

45
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,719
upgrades and apps meaning the benefits

46
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,759
can be cost effective and realized

47
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:56,439
quickly in developing countries too

48
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:59,079
tomorrow's Global Farms will therefore

49
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:00,960
be key users of The Internet of Things

50
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:03,439
whereby vehicles and Equipment can use

51
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,880
GPS and Wi-Fi to talk to each other

52
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,119
connect with weather and pest forecasts

53
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,360
as for the Farms themselves the future

54
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:12,760
Farms might not all be on the ground but

55
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,959
under it instead or integrated with

56
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,840
factories businesses and harnessing

57
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,879
local energies and

58
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,879
opportunities the Farms of the future

59
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,480
will also make use of data from large

60
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:26,280
scale experiments such as the bbsrc

61
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:28,920
funded Northwick Farm platform and the

62
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:32,360
scanalyzer then there is the national

63
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,640
plant fomic Center also funded by

64
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,080
bbsrc to feed the planet in an

65
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,480
increasingly globalized food system and

66
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,640
in the face of climate change and

67
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,120
extreme weather we'll need elements of

68
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,400
all this amazing technology and more

69
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,280
bbsrc funded researchers are working

70
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,800
with partners and collaborators across

71
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,800
the world to realize this

72
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
vision
