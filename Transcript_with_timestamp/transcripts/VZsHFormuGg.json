  "text": "we have over 2,000 pigs 2,000 pigs why did you leave UK to come to Nigeria why must I sett in abroad the Zeal the passion in me as an entrepreneur I believe in settling in Nigeria work with Nigerians achieve whatever I want to achieve all my life I've never had a time that I say I have like one week holiday I see myself working every day every day that I see myself Idol I know the is not feeling fine we breed pigs and also run production of livestock feed and I'm happy that today here has produced a lot of farmers and people have heard about us for nuke and cranny of the state and neighboring states this is the biggest pig farm in plateu [Music] state what's up guys it's Simon AR again and welcome back to the channel today we are bringing you a wonderful video and we are here at po gas pig farms and we are here with the CEO engineer UD yeah thank you it's nice to meet you sir me too pleasure is mine my name is OB now I'm the MD AUST Farm science Industries limited basically we breed pigs and uh also run production of feed livestock feed these are what we do here we're trying to see how we can you know bring things together that we can offer what government are not doing what we heard about them doing before but they don't do it again in form of employment in form of startup of business form of a forum where people can come and see how they can start up their own businesses and I'm happy that today here has produced a lot of farmers in this place and people have heard about us for nuk and cranny of the state and neighboring states as a matter of fact and to the glory of God I think this is the biggest pig farm in plateu state wow God is helping us we are striving and going higher and higher our vision is that one day our farm will be one of the best farms in terms of scope in terms of best practices in West Africa uh we are competing want to compete with Global Services best services so that we can offer the best to our customers and end users and also bringing other potential Farmers on board the young guys instead of waiting for white jobs we ask you there are some things we can do on our own that can provide employment that can may make weth by what we do so this is the place this is the arena so uh where where are we now okay this is one of the pens this is one of the pens this penc okay we have a this is C in penc we have piglets this is where we doile our figlets figlets yeah so let's go and see it so we have to sanitize yes you have to sanitize so these are our piglets when our our piglet at a certain age um basically 4 weeks we tend to win them wow I like how organized everything is yes yes like I told you that this is the work we do you can see how clean the environment is so um how many pigs do you have in total well we have over 2,000 pigs 2,000 pigs 2,000 pigs yes you have different breed so they are all the same breeds no no we have different breeds we have breeds like d Rock we have hsh we have land race we have large whes we have curo we have uh cross durok we have Danish protest we have u a lot of them in total like how many bre we have like over 10 breeds 10 breeds that's a lot yeah yes so um how did all of this start how did you start all of this well this place started um well far back 2020 2020 the co year year so that every all of us were locked inside the house yeah so we are deeply into construction industry so at that time government and other uh other uh business agencies shut down their shops that's true because of the because of the co so with found ourselves in the house and lock ourselves up but before then don't forget we have workers employees under us so every month employees will put a phone across and say a what about our salary we have not SE so as a man don't work as a man we must pay because if you don't pay they will come and look for you at home and um based that we have worked we have a Cod relationship at work we cannot deny them so I have to think Which Way Forward we think outside the box and say there's need for us to start something so that we not notice that what we do is what we should tell oursel the bitter truth that we don't have any permanent work we only had a temporary work because a contract work is a temporary work so we start yeah 2020 start building during the coid we will come here we put blocks we started from the other side we put blocks just one block two blocks three blocks at the end of the day we have about over 10 p p f p f what do you have in p f here we have Growers growers okay when you say grows what do you mean by Growers Growers are those that have matured from piglet sh okay so they have grown they have win to attend a a mature State stage so that in this area this place you now see the PE tend to add rat yes exibit some maturity stage in their body in their body begin to see them own okay so they are now becoming independent from their mother they tend to become mother or father what's the average a pig can give there to like average numbers okay a pig can average of 10 10 okay does it depend on the breed or all of them mostly large white and L Rich okay we have witnessed 19 19 wow yeah this place we W 22 22 yeah uh but averaging 10 10 so they can give birth to8 6 12 14 5 it depends on nature we have also witnessed P giving birth to one one is Justin the is my name I am the O the owners representative I act the capacity of the MD in case if it's not available so where are we in the mail meil yeah that's what you call it warehouse warehouse what do you do in the warehouse this is where we compound our feed okay your feed so you make your feed your yes we make our Fe ourselves okay for example this what we have here is the we offer we offer yes so these are feed yeah these are feed okay this rice brand okay over here we have the the S beans the S beans okay so there are a lot of additives that are involved that I may not mention during our formulation so that's is what we do here to making sure that we have a quality feet that we give to our P to making sure the way you have seen them eyes they quite healthy yes quite he that's what we do here yes this are machine for mixing and this here A machine for grinding okay grinding grind the M ground is those are the two major thing that this machine does but there is the mixer where all the additives I put them together and I mix them with B them okay so if we start to customer custom okay you sell this to to customer how much does the bag of this cost H I may not give per head because we'll buy in tons in tons okay are the major challenges you faced in Pure Gas like I said the challenges we face is economy our economy is harsh in Nigeria as a whole you buy something today tomorrow you will not get it and the people your customers would not tell you how much you buy raw materials all they are concentrated is this is the price you have placed this if you are saying you are selling a kg of pork 1,5 it should be 1,5 irrespective of other adops in raw materials for example we have raw material we use like Maze and other grains a bag of maze is goes for 60,000 per bag back of 100 kg so by the time you compound and other element other raw materials that those the one we imported by the time you compound them together and see how much a kg of feet goes you will not able to sell a pork the cost price that is I'm talking of the the the the production cost will not be less than 2,000 naira per kg and if you sell it you will not see people that will patronize you so we are struggling to to come out considering our production cost we are struggling to pay our overheads our bills because the cost of production is high so it's a huge challenge if our economy will be fair will be better that things are easily accessible easily bought then other people can even come on board so that is the major challenge we face like I told you recently that we are blessed with customers from across the neighboring states like kaduna Abuja uh nasarawa Benway anambra and other states is because we we don't look at that cost I was telling you we are looking at how can we bring more people on board because I believe the greater we are into this business the better for us we subsidize our rates we bring it down and allow other people so long you have that passion to be in business we don't look at the monetary aspect of it we look at how we can help you to start up your business so because if we want to look at how much we spend to raise a pig a piglet we may not sell so we look at what is possible how if we have brick even on the cost of breeding a big to certain level we're good to go so like piglet we have the one we can sell as low at 25,000 30,000 depending on the breed we have also a breed of 60,000 we have breed of 40,000 what's the highest amount of P I'm the one I'm telling you 140,000 piglets for piglets okay so it depends on the uh on the brid yes okay so what of bigger pigs how how do you sell them okay I'm talking of Life yes we sell 1,000 we sell 800 depending what you are buying now we sell one two depending the the the the quantity you are buying if you buying in L scale large scale we s we reduce money uh if you are just buying few uh it depends but ranging from 800 to 1,200 what's your advice to um someone wanting to venture into pig farm or any business at all in Nigeria uh I say that young particularly the younger ones we shouldn't because our government have disappointed us we shouldn't be lamenting in our government as a result of bad leadership you understand we should we should roll our sleeves and come on board look for something you can do it might not be Pig faring it might be crop farming it might be another venture you want to do don't give up roll your sleeve come out and see what we can do and I'm also extending this venture to other enterpreneurs let us see how we can touch lives let us see how we can touch lives by bringing people around us anybody that shows passion in this business we encourage them by helping them to start up that business and there a couple of them have been sending messages and prayers that is enough for me as far as I'm concerned they pray for me every day by day God bless you God bless you God bless you you are the reason why this business is still functioning today and we are good I know tomorrow God or someone God has put in a position will remember us yes that's my belief so I call on you I call on other people friends let them come on board let them come patronize the P AUST come and be partner with P guys we offer Training Services here we are Consultants here too uh even other people who have farms and they're having issues we have uh professionals you know medical professionals around us who can offer a better advice and revive their Farms we don't want to see any farm that winding down or close down or not functioning all Farms should be alive so that we can synergize together so guys if you enjoy this video to like share subscribe and do all to patronize Mr HUD of biogas so I'll drop the details below the video so that you can see and reach out to him I'll see you in the next video",
