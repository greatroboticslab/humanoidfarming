a hat fan either and here's John Thomas who's constant\nattention to growing and processing seed corn is your crop insurance for next\nyear the result of this partnership is an institution dedicated to the\nproduction of superior seed corn the largest and most modern plant in\nexistence more than a hundred thousand bushels of pioneer hybrid seed were\ndried sorted graded and bagged here this year\nthe warehouse 300 feet long and with the capacity of more than 40,000 bushels was\nrecently built to accommodate the increasing volume and how and why it's\nuseful put more money in your pocket but before we see what has been done with\nhybrid corn let's take a look at a field of open pollinated corn I think you'll\nrecognize maybe we can refresh your memory about the faults and the flaws of\nopen pollinated pause anywhere in the Corn Belt fields of open\npollinated corn greets the eye this one isn't a bad feel in fact it's pretty\ngood but it won't bear close inspection garstin Thomas have thousands of\nvisitors every fall to insist upon seeing the difference between open\npollinated corns and pioneer hi-bred corn\nnor worse than the average field yet there's a decided lack of stiffness here\nwhich is notably present in the hybrid fields your to visit later you will\nobserve a general lack of stiffness and style looks like the cows had been in\nthe corn there's an appearance of sagginess due\nmostly to fall in stocks stocks that break before the ears mature caused\nchampion dropping ears not sound corn and not conducive to large yields the stocks upon which these ears were\nproduced went down early with resultant rottenness of the ear limber stocks are\neasily blown down that are difficult to pick either by hand or by machine when\nthe wind is accompanied by rain the Fallen stock attempts to come up again\nand in so doing forms a gooseneck another reason for stocks falling is a\npoor weak root system a typical fault of open-pollinated corn later you will\ncontrast this root with the heavy pioneer hi-bred root the lack of\nuniformity in pint of ears of open pollinated corn slows down picking\nmaterially for this reason corn picking contests are practically always held in\nhigh bred fields where the contestants show to the greatest advantage the\nuneven position of ears seen here does not permit rapid or efficient husky\nanother fault of open pollinated corn is the fact that the ears themselves drop\noff so easily on windy days a mechanical corn picker can't pick up these ears a\nhuman corn picker doesn't like to after the corn picker has been through\nthe open pollinated field the job of picking up fallen ears yet remains this\nextra task is wholly unnecessary in the pioneer hi-bred fields which you'll soon\nsee 10% of the corn was left on the ground too much to leave but a lot of\nwork to get and here's what you finally do get on uniform size shape and quality\nfor the lack of uniformity and bigger in the field that we've just looked at is\nthat you don't know which pollen grain pollinated each separate pound in other\nwords you don't know who the daddy was no one would be so foolish as to try to\nimprove livestock without selecting the finest sire the reason you get a\nprize-winning bull or a good boar is because some breeder has selected his\ngrandparents with the greatest of care now let's take a look at a field of\npioneer hybrid corn where we do know the father from the grandfather in fact we\nknow all of the ancestry for ten generations back the cloud gets larger\nyou know what they say about building a better mousetrap this is daily routine\nduring harvest time at the Garston Thomas plant in Coon Rapids where\nvisitors are welcome seeing is believing here's an example of what pioneer hybrid\nseed corn will do for you there's an ear on every stock the ears\nare at a uniform height and the stops are standing up stiff straight and\nstrong and the ears will bear plenty of inspection to again the uniformity of\nheight is extremely noticeable product of two adjacent hills three emphasizes\nthe uniformity of the ears for size type and quality they're a noonday meal for\nany horse pioneer produces corn of real quality it's good feed and it markets at\ntop prices what all of you who've marveled at hundred bushels per acre\nyields you're now seeing one hundred and ten bushels to the acre what do you\nthink of this neighborhood of healthy ears called the Gold Coast by one\nvisitor 110 bushels to the acre means eighty eight hundred pounds of ear corn\nit takes sturdy stops to hold up this kind of a crop how beautifully they\nstand we can even see angle risers crosswise through the corn field\ntake a look down that aisle a pathway to prosperity and what's more the ears don't fall off\nwhen the wind blows remember how easily they fell in the other field smoke that\none in your pipe mister corne can't stand up without a root\nsystem either go ahead and pull it out it can be done but it takes plenty of\nhelp these roots go down where the plants will endorse your arm they oughta\nproduce corn they've had plenty of opportunity to\nabsorb a lot of nourishment from the soil and they did produce a lot of corn\nroots tell a lot of the story of pioneer hi-bred corn which one of these two\nloops do you think has the best chance to get down where the moisture and plant\nfood are which one will hold the stock the straightest a pioneer hi-bred root\nis four times as large the mechanical Quantic are also gets a real chance to\ndo a good job in hybrid corn sooner or later all farmers will be using the corn\nthicker the heavy root system sturdy straight stops and strong shanks of\nPioneer hybrids are well adapted to mechanical foreign thinking\nthis is corn raising reduced to a science in a few minutes that wagon will\nbe back full of corn from four rows seventy rods long when picking coin by hand or\nmechanically how convenient it is to find the ear at\na uniform height on every stop there aren't two inches difference in the\nheight of ears just to show that these individual hills aren't unusual for this\npioneer field let's pick three consecutive hills how\nuniform they are in height how nicely they break out\nand what fun to pick these Golden Ears and man what up prophet three adjacent\nhills nine big fine quality ears harder to hold them to husk over here the corn\npickers already made one round seventy rods long and here's the tape hold on there old boy over then we can't\nblame you at that they'd never believe you back home if you didn't have some\ncorn to back it up and over in the corner of the field the loaded wagons\nare dumped the coin elevated onto waiting trucks and headed for the\nprocessing plant in one day three men with a corn picker have picked 2,000\nbushels from 19 acres of land and loaded it onto the truck again we repeat corn\nraising reduced to a science and saw the town it goes and while we string along\nbehind let's glance at the field that was\npicked with the sturdy straight pollen rows left standing the corn from these\npollen rows is never used for seed but is later picked and fair back at the Platte our cargo potential\nseedcorn gets ready to face its Judgment Day\nit looks mighty fine out there in the fields and it would be excellent in any\ngrain market or feedlot but it must undergo many severe and exacting\nprocesses before it becomes pioneer hybrid seed corn the quality hybrid\ntruckload after truckload of carefully bred corn is hauled from farms of nine\ncounties in the vicinity of the garstin Thomas plant corn that has been brand\nand grown under vigilant supervision of pioneer experts the crowds of visitors\nare always interested in studying the many reasons for pioneer supremacist good substantial businessman beans all\ninterested in learning why pioneer can afford to extend its famous replanting\nagreement to all purchasers to find out why pioneer can back up performance with\nan agreement that makes this hybrid seed as good as a gilt-edged bomb ah Niagara of golden well pours over the\ntop and down the conveyor belt into the large bins beneath cream-of-the-crop\ndisscourn but still only embryo seed until it has been processed thoroughly\nto fulfill the rigid requirements pioneers are max only 60% of these tears\nare good enough to become pioneer hybrid seed pod\nthe rest will be fed on Bob Darcy and Charlie Thomas's farms in the sorting\nplant another chef leaves another comes on duty and the ear corn faces its first\nacid test three shifts a day 230 men to a ship just a cross-section of a large\nnumber of men whose skill and hard work makes possible a hybrid like pioneer\napproximately 8,000 bushels are handled in the sorting back each day only one\nvariety is inspected at one time to insure against any mistake in\nclassifying each ear is individually examined every damage channel is removed\nall off-site beers are discarded and only the choice corn is dropped in the\nBox foresee inferior or light ears are rejected no farmer ever started his own\nseed with greater care from the hundreds of skilled workmen\nfarm minded young men from Nebraska Missouri Iowa and Kansas emerged the\ncheckers those links hide inspectors who reexamine every ear and every kernel to\nmake sure there has been no oversight the words are famous and handy check and\ndouble-check this careful sorting and restarting is another reason why pioneer\ncorn grows uniformly and vigorously uniformity is elemental in quality\nhybrid corn it took many seasons of breeding to get ears like these they\nstill have a long hard path to go but so far they have proved beyond doubt to\nhave quality and breeding the choice corn that survives this series of\ninspections is conveyed directly from the sordid piles by way of a conveyor\nbelt system which transports it to the root of the large frying bins and fence\ninto the cribs below portable dryers along the side of the\ncribs force hot air through the corn six oil burning front Swift fans driven by\n60 horsepower motors maintain a constant temperature of 110 degrees just like a\nhot wind off the Kansas wheat fields the constant hot air pressure reduces the\nmoisture content to 12% and assures splendid germination later guarding the\nseed against possible danger from cold weather the corn now sorted checked and dried\nand already over some top hurdles proceeds on its way up the ladder of\nsuccess to the corn Shelley at full capacity these chalets can shell 1,000\nbushels an hour on the top floor of the grading plan the\nsorted dried and shelled corn starts its homestretch trip through the main plant\nthe postgraduate course and processing that adds finishing touches to a truly\ngreat scene for several sets of sodding drums separate the large kernels from\nthe small kernels and the pea we in fact circles are removed\nbreeders on the floor below divide the large round from the large flat and the\nsmall round from the small flat making for kernel sizes accurate grading\npermits accurate planting which means uniform stands this mercury treated superior seed corn\nhas finished the long race and is now worthy of the name pioneer finally\nreceiving the award of merit the familiar trademark of Pioneer hybrid\nseed corn every sack has been stamped to show the kernel size and variety the\nparticular variety being sac today happens to be another pioneer champion a\nbanner Trophy winner in the Iowa State yield tests a masterpiece in scientific\nseed selection sealed by sowing the bag contains genuine pioneer hybrid seed\ncorn the real McCoy a perfect seed that has successfully withstood the many\ntests and processes this seal is for the customer's protection when Pioneer corn\nis sealed in the bag your next year's banner crop is as good\nas in the bag - it's bred and selected to produce prize years seven different\nvarieties each adapted to a particular area each one students of varying\nclimatic conditions are stored in the three large Garston Thomas warehouses\nuntil delivery can there be any wonder with generations\nof breeding and the painstaking processing that each kernel of Pioneer\ncorn receives by the famous pioneer replanting agreement can be offered with\nthe purchase of each bushel of corn this replanting agreement ensures that if for\nany reason including worm damage and floods you have to replant pioneer\nhybrid corn the seed for replanting is free pioneer first oldest and largest\nproducer of commercial hybrids can give you this assurance only because it's\ntime-tested results every all the guesswork from corn growing when\nyou buy pioneer you'll get more for your money it costs a dollar an acre more to\nplant pioneer hybrid seed and normally it increases the yield around 14 bushels\nor seven dollars in other words it Nets you six dollars an acre more profits and\nnow I want to thank you for your interest many of you have seen our\nprocessing plant and visited our seed fields and can vouch for everything\nyou've seen here today and more - for the rest we've tried to bring them out\ninto mow hammer to show you how pioneer hybrid corn is produced and what it will\ndo for you next year we trust you to join those thousands who know that\npioneer the quality hybrid is the surest way to happy harvest",
