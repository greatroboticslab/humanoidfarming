00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,799
What's up YouTube and welcome back to

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,839
the channel. Today we have an issue with

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:11,040
the New Holland and the issue is water

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:13,759
in the hydraulic lines. So I'm going to

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,839
show you how to drain the reservoir and

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,720
to flush the lines without removing the

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,520
skid plate underneath and also show you

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,359
one of the main reasons for this

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,740
problem. So stay tuned and let's get it

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:34,930
started.

11
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:34,930
[Music]

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,760
So to confirm, we do have water in the

13
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:46,480
line. If you remove your

14
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:48,640
dipstick, you will notice that is white

15
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,640
and

16
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:58,280
milky. And you can see that it's

17
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:02,239
contaminated with water.

18
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,239
So, what we're going to do

19
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,760
is we're going to remove the dipstick

20
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,479
here and we're going to drain the tank

21
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,799
by siphoning out the oil from the tank.

22
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,040
So, first thing you want to do is get as

23
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,680
much of the contaminated oil out as

24
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,560
possible.

25
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,040
So, the first thing we're going to do is

26
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,040
remove the

27
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,880
dipstick and we're going to siphon

28
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,880
everything out through

29
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:46,400
here. Like I said, you can

30
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,400
see definitely

31
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,280
contaminated. So once you get your dipst

32
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,600
stick

33
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,640
removed, what you want to do is what I

34
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,960
use is a small

35
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:01,200
pump. Um you can get these sheet pretty

36
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,200
much anywhere and it hooks to your

37
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,200
battery.

38
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,360
connect

39
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:28,000
it. And we're going to put it into the

40
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:36,440
reservoir. And the other end we're going

41
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,440
to put into a bucket.

42
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:44,869
[Music]

43
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:59,280
[Applause]

44
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,400
Definitely. Go. We're going to pump this

45
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,400
out

46
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:38,959
until it stops. So, that'll be your

47
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,959
first step is to get everything pumped

48
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:51,799
out. So, one of the main reasons that

49
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:57,879
this particular brand gets water in the

50
00:03:51,799 --> 00:04:01,360
reservoir is on the cap. If you

51
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:02,439
notice that inside, you'll notice that

52
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,680
there's a

53
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:08,159
filter

54
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:11,360
which if it's not in the right place, it

55
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,319
will let water seep through these holes

56
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:18,320
and enter

57
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:21,280
in. And the other reason is around here,

58
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,080
if you notice how this is designed, as

59
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:27,440
water comes in or it rains, it should

60
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:30,720
run off to the side here. But over time,

61
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:33,840
there's a gasket under here. And if that

62
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,919
gasket goes out, water accumulates here,

63
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,280
and it just drains down into the tank.

64
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:41,600
So, normally I keep this covered up, but

65
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,320
unfortunately I didn't get it covered up

66
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,960
and we had a lot of rain, so I knew that

67
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,600
was the problem. So, going to take this

68
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,440
off and check the gasket also and

69
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,919
possibly make another gasket and put

70
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:58,639
silicone in here. So, those are your two

71
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:02,400
reasons. one, double check to make sure

72
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,600
you have the filter in here, which is

73
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,520
that

74
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,759
inside. And then the other reason, check

75
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,800
to see if your gasket is worn out around

76
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:15,919
here. If it has, then just take this off

77
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,759
and put in a new gasket or put silicone

78
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:22,120
around it. And I'm going to show you how

79
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,120
to prevent that in the future.

80
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:41,529
[Music]

81
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:59,639
So, as you You can see this gasket

82
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:03,680
is in pretty bad

83
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,680
shape. So that could be the

84
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,400
culprit. And

85
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:13,280
underneath, which is here, it should

86
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:16,800
actually be another gasket here that

87
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:22,240
seals around here. And don't know if

88
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:26,639
it's just missing or in bad shape, but

89
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,639
you can see definitely

90
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:34,880
water. So that's our main

91
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:37,280
culprit. So another thing you can do is

92
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,120
you can pick up a pump like this, which

93
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,880
is

94
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,720
inexpensive, and that'll help speed up

95
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:47,479
everything while you're pumping with the

96
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:51,600
electric motor. But so far the reservoir

97
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:55,880
holds six and a half gallons and so far

98
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:58,400
we've pumped out about three and a half.

99
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:01,199
So that's the first section. We're going

100
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:04,199
to go empty that and start back pumping

101
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,199
again.

102
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,639
Then once you get everything emptied

103
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,720
out, we're going to refill the

104
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:19,039
reservoir and go out and run it. And

105
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,720
then we're going to open up the cylinder

106
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:27,919
line to see if we're getting clean fluid

107
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,919
up front. So, let's get it filled

108
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,560
up. Heat. Heat.

109
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,160
Once you refill it, cuz you're going to

110
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,599
have to flush the lines, you're going to

111
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,520
see how much is in here. So, we're going

112
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:12,319
to

113
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:14,639
take this line with your boom in the up

114
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,400
position.

115
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,199
So, we're just trying to get as much as

116
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,680
out of the lines as possible before we

117
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:28,039
refill it

118
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:28,039
again or reflush it. So, you loosen this

119
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,360
Heat up

120
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,640
here.

121
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,600
Heat.

122
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,240
Heat. Heat up

123
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,200
here.

124
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:47,580
[Music]

125
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:59,959
Heat. Heat.

126
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:24,000
[Music]

127
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,760
So once it's running clear with this

128
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,320
hydraulic fluid. We're going to check

129
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,320
the other lines, operate the machine,

130
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,320
and then come back and relead the lines

131
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,320
again.

132
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,279
Add to flush your auxiliary lines, which

133
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,480
we're going to do last because I hadn't

134
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:06,720
used it. So, it should

135
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:08,880
be good fluid in here. In order to keep

136
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,920
from breaking those lines, you basically

137
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:14,480
just take your plug. You got a plug here

138
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:17,040
and take the plug there. And then we'll

139
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,800
let it bleed out from here. But this

140
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,120
should have these lines should have good

141
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:24,800
fluid through them since I hadn't

142
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:28,560
operated those. But we got those bled.

143
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:31,279
And now let's go operate the machine and

144
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,760
come back and refill the reservoir and

145
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,680
bleed it

146
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:37,680
again. All right,

147
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,680
puppy

148
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,560
slow. All right,

149
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,600
stop.

150
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,320
Here

151
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:33,210
Yeah. All right.

152
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:33,210
[Music]

153
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,079
So, we got the system bled out and all

154
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,480
the water out the line. We're going to

155
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:51,600
bleed it one more time and then we'll

156
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:55,839
come back and bleed with the auxiliary

157
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,839
lines. But what I did is for the purpose

158
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,839
of the video, I just showed you what

159
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:03,279
comes out of the line so that you can

160
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:07,519
see the milky um oil that comes out. But

161
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:10,880
what I did is actually took a line and

162
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,839
connected it to the plug and then just

163
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,839
ran the other

164
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:18,399
end of the line into a bucket and just

165
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,680
pumped it out that way. Um, like I said,

166
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,120
for the purpose of the video, just

167
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,079
wanted to show you what comes out of the

168
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,079
line as you ble each line and then just

169
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:28,720
connect the line to it and just continue

170
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:30,639
to bleed it until you empty your bucket

171
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,639
and then you get clear fluid running out

172
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,480
into the bucket. But like I said, we'll

173
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,000
bleed the system one more time and then

174
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,320
we'll come back and bleed the hydraulic

175
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,320
lines just to make sure everything is

176
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:44,240
good.

177
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,639
So, the process is to make sure you keep

178
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,320
enough

179
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:52,000
oil in the system so when you're

180
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,399
bleeding it, you don't affect your pump.

181
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,600
So, I have

182
00:15:53,399 --> 00:16:00,880
the fluid pumping into the system. And

183
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,580
once it reaches its proper level, we're

184
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:06,519
going to go ahead and start bleeding it.

185
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:09,320
[Music]

186
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:11,480
And so, like I said, I got the holes

187
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,839
running into a

188
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:16,399
bucket. And we'll go ahead and bleed

189
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,399
this front

190
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:32,880
[Music]

191
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:36,800
line. Here is the next setup. We're

192
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:39,759
going to bleed this side. And we got it

193
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:42,759
going into our bucket. Got the bucket

194
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,759
empty.

196
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,950
Now we're going to bleed this side.

197
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:32,089
So, we got our setup.

200
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,200
So, we're going to do the same thing to

201
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:22,440
drain all our delivery lines. And

202
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:27,400
basically you cut this over here and we

203
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:27,400
just do each one of them.

204
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,290

209

[Music]

211
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,559
This will be the third flush of the

212
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:39,360
auxiliary

213
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:43,120
line. No water in the line, but the

214
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:46,080
fluid was dark. So, going to drain them

215
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,799
until we can get clear fluid. So, let's

216
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:52,280
see if this one will do it. So, this is

217
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,280
the third flush.

220
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:15,760
up here.

222
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,600
Heat. Heat.

223
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:28,880
Once you got all your lines bled and

224
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:31,520
your hydraulic fluid filled back to the

225
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,520
right level, the next step is to come

226
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,440
around the

227
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:37,840
back and you're going to change your

228
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:41,799
hydraulic filter. So, we'll take that

229
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:44,960
out and change that filter. And then

230
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:48,840
next, you can see the gasket, which was

231
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:50,840
in pretty bad shape. But the gasket

232
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:53,159
goes beneath

233
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:56,840
here. And

234
00:21:53,159 --> 00:22:00,840
then another one is here, sandwiched

235
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:03,120
between the filler cap.

236
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:05,320
So, you're going to put your gaskets

237
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:08,720
there. And then make sure you put

238
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:11,679
silicone, add silicone or RTV silicone

239
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:14,880
to it. And then on both spots, sandwich

240
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:18,080
it in. Put your screws back in. And then

241
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,400
to prevent it from happening again,

242
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,679
we're going to go down here and make

243
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,840
sure you have a gasket here, but you

244
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:28,640
want to put silicone around that and

245
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:32,080
then seal this back in. That way water

246
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:34,799
doesn't get in. And then for the top to

247
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:38,960
prevent water, you're going to take just

248
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:41,159
a regular plastic um container, you're

249
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,000
going to cut the top off of

250
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:46,799
it

251
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,200
and place it over the top. And then as

252
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:51,200
your cap go

253
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:53,520
down, as your cover go down, it'll hold

254
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,960
it. So that way it won't pop off while

255
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:58,280
you're working or anything and you won't

256
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:03,400
forget to put it back on.

257
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:06,400
So, that's what we'll get taken care of

258
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:08,880
next. So, this is one way to flush your

259
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,880
entire hydraulic system and to remove

260
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:14,000
all the contaminated oil out of the

261
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,080
system. It took me about 20 gallons to

262
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,880
flush the entire system. And that's

263
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,880
including the hydraulic lines. If you're

264
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:24,000
just using this process to change your

265
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:26,080
oil, the whole system takes about 6 and

266
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,880
12 gallons. So, if you're just changing

267
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,000
your oil, you won't use as much. So,

268
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:35,520
once we got all the contaminated oil

269
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:38,559
out, next thing we did is you have a

270
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,320
filter that's in here and you have

271
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,880
gaskets that's around there. You want to

272
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,520
make sure both of those are good. In our

273
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,840
case, all the gaskets were bad. So,

274
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,000
those are special order gaskets. So, in

275
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,960
case in that case, you may want to order

276
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,080
those in advance. Um, so what I did is

277
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,960
just made two and put those around and

278
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:01,120
then put silicone there. Make sure your

279
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,520
fil breather filter is good because

280
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,520
you'll get water in from here and that's

281
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,640
where the cover comes in and just make

282
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:11,039
this out of a simple container and cover

283
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,039
it up and that eliminate water going

284
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:15,760
through the breather. And then you want

285
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:17,919
to put silicone around the base of your

286
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,559
dipstick and that way you won't get

287
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,559
water in there. And then finally, you

288
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:25,120
want to make sure you change the

289
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:27,360
hydraulic filter. And once you've done

290
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,600
that, that should take care of all your

291
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:32,080
problems for as water getting in through

292
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,080
your reservoir. So, hope this video
