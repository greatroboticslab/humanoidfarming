29
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,479
are here taking over the alligator farm

30
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,079
today i am standing in front of what is

31
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,399
going to be the job site for

32
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,840
the 8x11 pond with about a six seven

33
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,680
foot stream on it this is where the

34
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,479
ecosystem pond is going to be installed

35
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,560
this will be a

36
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,600
bird enclosure so we're gonna have

37
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,680
waterfalls back

38
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,960
up over there meandering little stream

39
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,560
maybe we'll include some driftwood

40
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,520
elements for them to perch up on

41
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,720
but just like shallow pools slow moving

42
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,560
water that kind of stuff and then the

43
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,000
pond will sit over in here skimmer over

44
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,280
on this side this is going to be a

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,760
training exercise

46
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,959
for a lot of newbies so what i love

47
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,640
about events like this

48
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,040
is yes we have the advanced build upon

49
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,760
which ed is leading oh look at my hair

50
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,440
the bonds but um what i love about this

51
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,879
is ed is of course leading the advanced

52
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,280
build but today we

53
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,440
are doing a just a standard 8 by 11

54
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,120
ecosystem pond and the simplicity of it

55
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,160
the 20 products in 20 steps and that's

56
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,920
what we're going to achieve

57
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,280
so the whole part of the point of this

58
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,200
yes is to build an

59
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,959
incredible beautiful enclosure bird

60
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,560
loving stream that's visually

61
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,040
amazing but the more important thing is

62
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,440
to educate our customers the contractors

63
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,400
and

64
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,400
some of the people that are actually

65
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,640
do-it-yourselfers on how to efficiently

66
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,160
put in a pond and do it profitably so we

67
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,599
want to teach them the right way so that

68
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,200
they can avoid all the pitfalls that we

69
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,760
learned over the years so the point of

70
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,920
this

71
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,480
space back here is to show them the

72
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,080
basic math or arithmetic or just a basic

73
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,800
level of water features so i've got some

74
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,560
incredible

75
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,920
cacs that are also going to be with me

76
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,680

a little behind but not because of

127
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,560
anything besides talking but

128
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,680

129
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,840

130
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,280

138
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,160

139
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,639

141
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,820

professor

224
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,080
fast forward about two weeks since we

225
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,760
kind of hard stop

226
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,839
out here right yep ed's wearing his

227
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,760
green shirt for the winter retreat which

228
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,519
signifies that we may have had a group

229
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,279
photo which usually

230
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,800
is the end of a project and we're also

231
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,640
standing in front of the gila monster

232
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,040
shed and there used to be 35 pounds of

233
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,880
stone

234
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,880
30 pounds of stone and it's been changed

235
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,480
over to brick because there's gonna be a

236
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,720
patio going in soon because

237
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,000
the pond is done the pond is done 100

238
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,200
done and it looks

239
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,360
awesome i can't wait i have

240
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,880
i have i've i've taken a little glimpse

241
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,760
of it but we're gonna show you so ed i'm

242
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,959
gonna follow you

243
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,560
let's go baby all right so ed

244
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,800
everything went smooth right everything

245
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,560
went great and that was because we spent

246
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,000
a lot of time in the beginning you and i

247
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,839
have been doing this a long time

248
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,240
we know the benchmarks we know where we

249
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,920
need to be so we made sure we had to get

250
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,560
all those different things completed

251
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,240
the big challenge we had if you remember

252
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,560
was putting in that under drain

253
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,880
all that groundwater coming in causing

254
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,120
problems edges collapsing down

255
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,160
we had to manipulate everything to make

256
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,160
it work and

257
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,600
it came together because once we got all

258
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,480
that infrastructure in place we were

259
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,120
able to focus

260
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,000
on the beauty and this is what we got oh

261
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,640
my god

262
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,760
are you kidding me fine i know right it

263
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,440
was awesome so

264
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,839
we killed it the team that we had out

265
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,839
here master cac certified aquascape

266
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,399
contractors coming in from around the

267
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,560
country

268
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,160
coming together working as a team which

269
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,079
is what i love because we were able to

270
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,240
split up into multiple groups

271
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,760
what we did i spent the time in the very

272
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,519
beginning laid everything out

273
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,360
gave them the background of what you and

274
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,680
i did here two weeks ago

275
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,519
showed them all of that stuff and then

276
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,360
we started tackling everything we hit

277
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,600
the intake bay we finished up that

278
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,760
beautiful little southwestern arroyo

279
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,920
which is going behind that that cypress

280
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,839
stump we put in those big logs

281
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,160
we got that wetland finish we did the

282
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,079
waterfalls we did all that detail work

283
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,399
the edging the plants the lights

284
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,480
and graded everything but it's still not

285
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,480
a 100 finish because there's a massive

286
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,800
structure going over the entire top of

287
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,640
this

288
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,640
and they are starting on monday so there

289
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,519

290
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,760

right so that was awesome to get kind of

302
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,240
the intro from ed if you remember when

303
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,519
we last left off

304
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,120
we had about 85 90 of this rocked

305
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,200
and we had a couple frame rocks in the

306
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,120
wetland dry fitted and installed

307
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,240
all we needed to do is beautify it over

308
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,639
here we've got the

309
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,000
intake bay area these are those external

310
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,240
pumps that we talked about so we've got

311
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,360
an 18 000 gallon per hour pump and a 12

312
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,079
000 gallon per hour pump

313
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,639
drawing in 30 000 gallons per hour

314
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,279
feeding

315
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,160
that amazing looking waterfalls and

316
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,160
wetland filter

317
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,680
as well as the circulation jets that are

318
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,040
along this back side and down at the

319
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,639
bottom that we talked about remember

320
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,079
those steps that we put in once that

321
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,839
water clears up you'll be able to see

322
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,600
but this goes down into here then there

323
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,360
then there then there making this very

324
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,480
very approachable and interactive

325
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,560
what i love and i mean love is the shape

326
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,360
of the pond i love these peninsulas

327
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,800
we managed to really capitalize on the

328
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,800
square footage that was in here

329
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,880
and we just took over and made an

330
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:54,320
incredible space for john and jen to

331
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,839
relax get in but also enjoy we've got

332
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,240

know and have not been able to do in the

343
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,680
past and what you guys have seen our

344
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,839
videos for this guy right here so

346
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,079
valuable member of earthworks and

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,040
thank you

you did a great job thank you sir you're

355
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,519
the man so anyways we've got the intake

356
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,519
bay

357
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,560
we've got this straight down section

358
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,000
that we talked about where we're gonna

359
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,760
bring the patio up out over

360
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,920
you can see all these big craggy rocks

361
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,800
these peninsulas the incredible shape of

362
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,959
this pond

363
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,399
really making it organic and interactive

364
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,240
now that you guys can see where water

365
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,000
level actually is in the pond you can

366
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,920
see that big cypress log

367
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,600
that dives down into the water the way

368
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,120
we intended it you've got that large

369
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,639
cavity where it's hollowed out great

370
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,160
place for carnivorous plants

371
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,079
but it just really changes the shape

372
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,440
we've got this aquatic planetary behind

373
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,839
it with this gravel beach

374
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,800
avalanche landslide but guys girls

375
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,040
everybody alike

376
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,240
look at these waterfalls now if you

377
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,959
remember it was just

378
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,440
that rock that rock that rock and that

379
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,600
rock

380
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,040
we only set this stuff and then we dug

381
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,480
out the wetland filter

382
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,079
filled it got all the gravel and

383
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,760
substrate in but we didn't do any of the

384
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:20,560
beautiful stuff on top and the guys did

385
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,560
a fantastic

386
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,360
the guys did a fantastic job of pulling

387
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,560
it off creating that vision i know when

388
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,240
we were out here the last time we had

389
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,399
talked about splitting the waterfalls

390
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,399
back behind this triangle rock getting a

391
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,279
little kicker over there big waterfalls

392
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,320
and then just a

393
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,199
like a nice raging ripple effect a lot

394
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,120
of white water

395
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,480
this looks incredible absolutely

396
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,360
incredible i love the change in

397
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,360
direction

398
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,800
it just turned out outstanding the edge

399
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,160
work is incredible

400
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:50,240
guys look at all that open water

401
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,680
if you remember the amount of energy and

402
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,720
effort it took to get down to that four

403
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,160
and a half foot depth

404
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,600
was a lot you can't even see the

405
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,279
architectural wall right now because the

406
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,279
water's a little murky and that's okay

407
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,040
that will all settle out but it turned

408
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,399
out beautiful that's the biological

409
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,480
filter right up in there

410
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,079
everybody so that's that wetland filter

411
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,320
so that upper pooling area with that

412
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,199
enormous log along the back edge there's

413
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,360
a log here

414
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,440
just the incorporation of these wood

415
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,240
elements is so crucial in helping make

416
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,399
this thing look

417
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,000
natural and organic and then of course

418
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,360
you've got the main waterfalls dumping

419
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,320
into that upper pool which is the

420
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,160
wetland filter

421
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,240
everything looks outstanding i can't

422
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,720
wait as ed said for that lanai to get

423
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,720
built

424
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,720
and really see this thing totally come

425
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,519
to fruition when the patio is in where

426
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,279
i'm standing

427
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,199
the walkway everything over there and

428
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,880
then the landscape i know john and jen

429
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,160
are going to take extremely good care of

430
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,440
this i know they have great vision

431
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,800
because we've seen what john

432
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,040
and jen have been able to do over at the

433
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,720
alligator farm so they definitely have

434
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,560
their work cut out for them but i know

435
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,399
they're up to the challenge guys this is

436
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,360
an incredible water feature it's been an

437
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,440
incredible journey

438
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,880
i was so proud happy to be a part of the

439
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,720
prep work i wish i could have been here

440
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,240
for this but on the same token i was

441
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,839
glad to be bringing some new people
