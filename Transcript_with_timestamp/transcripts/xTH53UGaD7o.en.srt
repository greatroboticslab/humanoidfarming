[Music]

4

because some I think this is common

5
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:27,000
Sunnah I've sewed about mother not soda

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,210
planted about a month ago it's taking a

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,530
bit of a hammering from am not hammering

8
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:37,040
a slight smattering of s not damage it

9
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:37,040
uses like spinach

10
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:22,530
now a couple more days I think of these

11
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:29,320
yeah he's a snappy Nairobi and sown in

12
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:35,710
region I gotta I harvested them a bit

13
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:38,070
glam squad from here and have some beans

14
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:38,070
of thing

15
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,329
that's an African blue basil

16
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:32,880
now some more think some flower shoots

17
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:36,330
of Chinese chives garlic chives very

18
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:48,930
quite tasty the best in a sandwich but

19
00:02:36,330 --> 00:03:01,410
I'm gonna do a stir-fry yeah we gonna do

20
00:02:48,930 --> 00:03:03,240
a quick stir-fry be that this is one

21
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:06,080
being I've got some let's see what we

22
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:12,540
got underneath are looking at beautiful

23
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:16,500
nobody can see the thousands of buggers

24
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:20,940
wearing they're screaming away so

25
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:22,500
finally cracked the farming worms now

26
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,660
I've got thousands of them which is a

27
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,220
good thing

28
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:28,730
all right I'll probably probably kiss

29
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,730
you might say

30
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:52,330
I'm often visiting Jacques herb farm in

31
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:54,930
Gloucestershire and she has opened a

32
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:59,590
sort of five or six times a time here

33
00:03:54,930 --> 00:04:01,680
quite a famous person I shall show you

34
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,680
around

35
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:21,470
try

36
00:05:22,840 --> 00:06:02,960
tipping up over one of my man hold I'm

37
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:06,010
used to I use electron ships and we're

38
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,010
used to come in

39
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:23,909
I might have overdone it with them

40
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:24,599
buying stuff from Jackie this cost me a

41
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:27,029
fortune

42
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:29,819
I'm gonna have to be reposting all of

43
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:33,569
this it's all them because I need them

44
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:38,509
it's going to need to survive the winter

45
00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:43,259
this is like a peppery leaf thing and

46
00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:46,919
nice I think it's a the herb of

47
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:50,749
some sort or garden as I what I really I

48
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:55,759
really went there to get this which is

49
00:06:50,749 --> 00:07:00,809
some for cliffs and firms or rocks alpha

50
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:04,550
and and instead I got that and if and

51
00:07:00,809 --> 00:07:07,849
all of this so I'm totally mad anyway

52
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:07,849
there you go

53
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:36,870
I'm putting up some some plants for

54
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:38,909
keeping overwintered endorsed with

55
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:41,570
central heating all the rest of it and

56
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:44,099
one of the biggest problems is root rot

57
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:46,769
so you gonna make yeah yeah your soil in

58
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:53,550
your pots really really um free draining

59
00:08:46,769 --> 00:08:56,519
so I've put half grit and a half equal

60
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:59,160
equal mass air not mass volume of grit

61
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:02,880
and compost

62
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:06,870
I'll put a little bit of organic

63
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:09,630
fertilizer in as well give us the

64
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:10,670
maximum chance of keeping keeping the

65
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:14,209
plants alive

66
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:14,209
remove the winter

67
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:37,399
[Music]

68
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:54,189
she's a pop round and brought together

69
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:57,869
now course what we gonna do my new

70
00:09:54,189 --> 00:09:57,869
people I think I'll use a bigger pot

71
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:10,350
it's a bit deeper loosen a few of the

72
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:40,279
this is the burn jelly plant bobbing

73
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:43,100
frutescens it's suppose we could for

74
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:45,279
burns and stuff it's not edible is to be

75
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:49,190
applied

76
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:52,130
you know externally well I don't take my

77
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:56,500
take your own medical advice but this is

78
00:10:52,130 --> 00:11:00,320
what I'm told it does so um so yeah the

79
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:02,959
is very very tender so it's an African

80
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,790
plant so it's going to be staying

81
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,790
indoors there's a very pretty flower

82
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:13,790
let's see if we can get a shot that when

83
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:15,230
I see ya there it's pretty in full

84
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:19,370
flower this is the last remaining a

85
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:20,480
couple of florets off it so then they in

86
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:23,660
full flower it's very pretty

87
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:40,190
we should see I won't even see that one

88
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:42,320
am it flowers next we're getting new

89
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:45,230
shoots coming out here so what I shall

90
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:48,100
do it's pretty cutting back there and

91
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:52,610
they we grow I'm being cruel to be kind

92
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:56,680
you're greater their plan then we put it

93
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:59,570
you turn the leaves are eaten and it's

94
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:04,010
yeah they're quite peppery it's related

95
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:05,839
to the Vietnamese coriander a plastic

96
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:09,170
area having a super scary as well have

97
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:13,520
different types of nuts pursue carrier

98
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:15,579
Hydra Piper Piper is pepper by rubriz is

99
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:19,010
the red version of the water pepper

100
00:12:15,579 --> 00:12:22,400
classic area water

101
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:22,400
let's get started

102
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:55,000
do not want to think

103
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,169
[Music]

104
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:47,900
so yeah nights are closing in okay I've

105
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:49,720
got used to having lots of fans time and

106
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:52,060
evenings to get things done but it's

107
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:57,530
times racing on again

108
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:59,600
yeah that's the much of the reasons why

109
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:06,320
we gotta get things ready for indoors

110
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:08,690
and winter the winter garden say so yeah

111
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:12,430
so I'll finish up now and then do more

112
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:16,880
tomorrow and but ya know I'm pleased and

113
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:22,850
they're quite warm ornamental Oregon and

114
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:25,010
on their regardin it's quite pretty I

115
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:30,320
think it's related to a course can mint

116
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:32,960
of course can course can regard oh we've

117
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,610
got a caper bush over there which I want

118
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:39,350
a great big that's that's why I said bit

119
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:43,820
bit of a bigger bomb yeah African jelly

120
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:45,760
burn jelly I'm really great for the

121
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:49,730
flowers let's face it

122
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:52,100
and this one's good this is a classic

123
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:55,790
area because the other person Kerry I've

124
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:57,740
got the the Vietnamese coriander is so

125
00:15:55,790 --> 00:16:02,540
good and I've tried a few leaves of this

126
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:04,310
I'm trying here but yes I hope for that

127
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:08,540
I tend to eat the Vietnamese coriander

128
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:10,310
you know two or three times a week so

129
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:13,700
hopefully it's a good addition it's a

130
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:17,150
perennial so I'm gonna try and keep it

131
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:22,240
alive and take cuttings that sort of

132
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:22,240
thing so should be good for you
