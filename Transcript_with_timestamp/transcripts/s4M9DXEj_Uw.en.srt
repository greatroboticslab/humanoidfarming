1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,870
so that brings us to Suzy Thompson she

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:10,530
is an associate professor and plant

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:13,139
breeder at NDSU she develops new potato

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:16,350
cultivars for growers the industry and

5
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:18,480
also consumers she grew up on a seed

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,970
farm here in the Red River Valley and

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,890
she loves anything out in the field and

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,600
according to Suzy the best part of her

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,689
job is working with potato growers

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,650
gardeners and students so with that

11
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:32,610
thanks for being with us today Suzy

12
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:34,920
Thank You Julie for that nice

13
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:37,040
introduction and happy first day of

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,379
spring to everyone I hope that everybody

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:44,090
is in the gardening mood since it's

16
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:46,829
finally bright sunny and fairly warm out

17
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:49,649
today I just came from the greenhouse

18
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:52,230
where I was crossing so I had my North

19
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:56,190
Dakota Caribbean escape for the day and

20
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:58,829
I can't help but be excited for the

21
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:01,050
upcoming planting season whether it's in

22
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:04,830
the field or out in our own yards or

23
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:06,510
even pots on our sidewalks I wanted to

24
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,390
remind everybody that you can type in

25
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:13,110
questions and then as Julie indicated

26
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:15,030
when I'm finished with my presentation

27
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:17,390
then I will go ahead and try to answer

28
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:22,130
those questions that you've submitted

29
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:24,930
the title of my presentation today is

30
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:27,180
one potato two potato three potato four

31
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,909
best management practices to produce

32
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:32,070
more and of course I was reminded or or

33
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:33,900
came up with this title because of an

34
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:37,229
old nursery rhyme that many of us

35
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,299
probably remember I can't the part I

36
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:42,210
can't remember is if we used to sing it

37
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:44,790
while we jump rope tour or or when it

38
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,649
was that we used it but but anyway

39
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:51,170
potatoes are near and dear to my heart

40
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:54,930
so I I chose that as a way to talk about

41
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:57,360
production and and how we might optimize

42
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:01,079
production in our gardens please advance

43
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,670
the slide so potato as a kind of a

44
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:05,090
background potato is a member of the

45
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:09,649
nightshade family or the Solanaceae in

46
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:13,080
that family are about 2,000 species only

47
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:13,830
160 of them are tuber bearing there are

48
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,750
20 called

49
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:19,320
the rated species that we would consider

50
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:23,100
to be potato or wild potato relatives

51
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:25,290
and of course the botanical name for the

52
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,700
common potato that we raise or what some

53
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:29,730
people might refer to as the white

54
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:34,560
potato or Irish potato is solanum

55
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:36,960
tuberosum please advance the slide and a

56
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,750
little bit more in relationship to the

57
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:42,540
botany but so being a member of the

58
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:47,070
Solanaceae potato is a relative of

59
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:49,740
tomato eggplant pepper tobacco petunias

60
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:52,980
and of course one of our favorite not

61
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:55,920
really favorite weeds the nightshades we

62
00:02:52,980 --> 00:03:00,240
grow potato tubers for their potatoes

63
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:02,750
for their underground tubers and kind of

64
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:06,560
to help put everybody into perspective

65
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:10,080
potato tubers are really modified stems

66
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,540
so things that can go on in potato

67
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,490
foliage can go on in potato tubers too

68
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,900
and I'll try to come back to this or I

69
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:18,720
definitely will come back to it when we

70
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,340
talk about potato storage but also when

71
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,410
we talk a little bit about some

72
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:25,080
physiological disorders that might

73
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:26,820
impact potato potato would be what we

74
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,640
would consider to be an herbaceous die

75
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:31,860
cut so dicot means that it would have

76
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,930
two cotyledons it's not a grass and

77
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:38,870
herbaceous of course means that it's

78
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:42,750
succulent and potatoes are annuals

79
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:45,750
potato has its origin in the south

80
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:48,360
american andean region and it stretches

81
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:51,120
all the way from that backbone of the

82
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,310
Andes all the way up through Central

83
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:58,500
America Mexico into the Four Corners

84
00:03:53,310 --> 00:04:01,440
region of the US so the people from the

85
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:04,320
gene Bank in Sturgeon Bay Wisconsin they

86
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:07,470
actually do collection expeditions in

87
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:10,980
the Four Corners region of Arizona

88
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:14,519
Colorado Utah and and look for some wild

89
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:16,680
species that are growing in the wild and

90
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:20,660
and important and native to that

91
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,660
particular particular region

92
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:26,950
in terms of production the potato

93
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:30,190
industry is more than a four billion

94
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:32,920
dollar industry North Dakota as you can

95
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:36,040
see on this table ranks third in terms

96
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:38,680
of the acreage harvested and but not

97
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:42,910
always in turn and usually in terms of

98
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:44,650
production sometimes we are eclipsed and

99
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:49,930
in this case you'll see that Wisconsin

100
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:51,760
in 2017 surpassed North Dakota in terms

101
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:55,180
of their total production as well as the

102
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:57,610
value then but we often times will

103
00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:01,240
flip-flop between our two states and

104
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:03,640
they have the potential for a higher

105
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,380
yield in Wisconsin they have a little

106
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:09,040
bit longer of a growing season and of

107
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:11,800
course in North Dakota our production is

108
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:14,230
based on both non irrigated as well as

109
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,150
irrigated production in terms of

110
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:18,340
certified seed potato production North

111
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:20,710
Dakota ranked second only after Idaho

112
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:22,600
and just for those of you that might be

113
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:25,780
curious where Minnesota would rank

114
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:30,040
Minnesota in terms of production usually

115
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:32,290
ranks about sixth there are many

116
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:34,840
cultivars more than 200 cultivars a

117
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:38,380
potato that are available to producers

118
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:40,750
in of the US or in North America these

119
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:44,110
are the on the list are the predominant

120
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:47,440
cultivars in order of their production

121
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:50,260
but many of these are not necessarily

122
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,480
the right choice for gardeners you will

123
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:54,850
recognize probably dark-red Norland and

124
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:57,640
also russet nor Koda of course Norland

125
00:05:54,850 --> 00:06:01,420
was released from NDSU in 1957 and

126
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:08,530
russet nor Koda in the early or excuse

127
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:11,070
me late 1980s and so those cultivars you

128
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:14,020
can oftentimes find at your local

129
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:15,490
gardening center or the grocery store

130
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:18,400
that might be carrying some seed

131
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:20,710
potatoes etc but these are the

132
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:25,090
predominant varieties in terms of

133
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:27,730
commercial production in the US for

134
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:29,740
market classes this might be a area

135
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:32,770
where some of you will have a keen

136
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:34,750
interest there are basically four

137
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:35,230
classes the first would be our round

138
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:38,290
white

139
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:40,840
and in our growing area the round whites

140
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:44,500
that we grow are high in dry matter

141
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:47,950
content so they kind of have a mealy dry

142
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:50,410
texture and of course they're used to

143
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:52,480
make potato chips out on the East Coast

144
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,340
though there is a market for round

145
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,960
whites that would have a lower dry

146
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:58,240
matter so they would use them more

147
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:01,480
similarly to how we use red potatoes

148
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:04,300
here the texture would be more creamy or

149
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:07,480
more waxy and so they would be using

150
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:09,640
those for boiling and then a home fries

151
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:13,000
or making potato salad or things like

152
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:14,560
that the important features for making

153
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,590
potato chips of course would be that

154
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,260
high dry matter content as when we are

155
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:25,180
doing the processing the water content

156
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:29,740
of the potato is replaced by oil in that

157
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:31,870
frying process and then the amount of

158
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:34,840
sugar in the tuber is usually less when

159
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:37,270
we have high dry matter potatoes in

160
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:41,710
favor of starch and that results in a

161
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:44,410
lighter chip or french fry color so the

162
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:47,740
those are some features that would be

163
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:50,130
important for for that market class ii

164
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:53,740
market class and hopefully everybody can

165
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:55,450
find the kind of brown color tubers and

166
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:58,480
on the left hand side of the photos

167
00:07:55,450 --> 00:08:00,430
there is the long russet and whites and

168
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:03,130
some of these are used for processing

169
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:06,580
and many of them are also used for table

170
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:09,700
stock or for fresh use so some important

171
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:11,140
characteristics for these are again if

172
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,700
they're going to be used for french fry

173
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,830
processing that they have that high

174
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:18,580
specific gravity or that high dry matter

175
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:21,160
so a potato variety like russet Burbank

176
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:25,750
is is number one for making french fries

177
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:29,520
all across the globe and and of course

178
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:32,020
they need that elongates shape with the

179
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,570
russets for the table stock industry

180
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:36,280
something like restin are kota these

181
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:38,080
will tend to have a lower specific

182
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:40,360
gravity so again that more waxy or

183
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:44,530
creamy texture they tend to be higher in

184
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:46,180
sugars and and and so they don't make

185
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:48,610
good french fries they would fry too

186
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:51,190
dark they would be caramel e and

187
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:53,890
um probably even smell a little bit

188
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:56,019
burnt when when we would cook them not

189
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:57,910
not necessarily right after you harvest

190
00:08:56,019 --> 00:09:00,010
them but certainly after you would store

191
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:03,190
them particularly at temperatures that

192
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:06,279
we store table stock potatoes at on the

193
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:09,120
bottom are some bread selections from a

194
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:11,709
field day that NDSU was a part of and

195
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,959
these are showing reds for the table

196
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:16,690
stock industry or or four fresh use and

197
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:19,630
these of course are very popular in our

198
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:22,470
area the Red River Valley is quite

199
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:25,540
famous for its red potato production

200
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:28,500
they tend to again have that creamy or

201
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:32,380
waxy texture they make excellent

202
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:34,420
additions the soup to do they make great

203
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:36,279
mashed potatoes and of course these are

204
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:38,860
really the potatoes that we're looking

205
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:42,070
for when we are going to be making the

206
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:46,600
traditional potato salad and then lastly

207
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:48,670
on the middle right is a picture of what

208
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,160
I would consider to be our heirlooms or

209
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:53,649
our specialties probably everyone is

210
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:57,120
pretty familiar with Yukon Gold and of

211
00:09:53,649 --> 00:10:00,520
course that has a soft yellow flesh

212
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,649
interior of the tuber and some people

213
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,660
also might maybe will have heard of a

214
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:06,850
variety called all blue it's an old

215
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:10,450
variety from Europe that came across

216
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:12,430
with our ancestors there's also all red

217
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:14,560
and now some of the breeding programs

218
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:18,970
around the US are starting to release

219
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:22,209
others some with additional cultivars

220
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:24,339
that have red blush or blue flesh I add

221
00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:28,360
around that blue for example comes out

222
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:30,670
of Cornell so the heirlooms and

223
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:33,520
specialties with the exception of Yukon

224
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:35,940
Gold are probably not found routinely in

225
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:38,920
most grocery stores at least in our area

226
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:40,959
however they tend to be more frequently

227
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:45,730
found at farmers markets during the

228
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:48,790
summer or during the fall for in terms

229
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:52,269
of utilization about 88% of the potato

230
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:55,959
production in the u.s. is used for human

231
00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:59,170
consumption about 61% is used for of

232
00:10:55,959 --> 00:11:00,690
that is used for processing and 26% of

233
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:02,730
that is used

234
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:06,269
the production is used for the fresh

235
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:09,660
market potatoes 7% of our production is

236
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:12,089
used for seed potatoes six percent would

237
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:14,699
be shrink or those losses that a potato

238
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:16,920
grower might suffer in storage and then

239
00:11:14,699 --> 00:11:19,949
less than 1% is now used for livestock

240
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:24,449
feed when we would go across the pond to

241
00:11:19,949 --> 00:11:27,899
Europe they feed a significantly higher

242
00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:32,879
portion of their livestock with potatoes

243
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:35,250
than we do here in the US in terms of

244
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:37,230
nutritional attributes I think that

245
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:39,839
potato oftentimes gets a bad rap in the

246
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:43,410
media but really potatoes should be

247
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:45,660
considered a little powerhouse our

248
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:49,399
average potato that we would be baking

249
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:53,779
or maybe we have multiple potatoes

250
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:57,060
little B sized tubers small ones

251
00:11:53,779 --> 00:12:00,360
totaling about five ounces it would

252
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:03,600
equal a serving and that single serving

253
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:06,000
only has 100 calories potatoes have no

254
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,630
fat they have no cholesterol and no

255
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:14,759
sodium however potatoes actually have

256
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:18,149
higher amounts of potassium than a

257
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:22,439
banana and of course in the media and

258
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:24,959
with some nutrition folks banana has

259
00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:28,410
kind of been the poster child for high

260
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:30,810
potassium foods potato does have high

261
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:32,759
total carbohydrates and sometimes in the

262
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:35,459
literature we hear that potato is bad

263
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:37,410
because it has a high glycemic index I

264
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:40,500
think that more and more research is

265
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:42,569
showing that it really depends upon what

266
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:45,180
foods you're consuming with the potatoes

267
00:12:42,569 --> 00:12:48,240
yes if you're just eating chip after

268
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:50,759
chip out of a bag that probably is going

269
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,649
to impact your blood sugar quite rapidly

270
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:58,350
but if you're having mashed potatoes

271
00:12:52,649 --> 00:13:02,430
with a bit of salmon or some other type

272
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:06,569
of lean meat elk or or beef that is

273
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:08,750
going to impact how quickly the

274
00:13:06,569 --> 00:13:11,420
carbohydrates are broken down and

275
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:14,520
shuttled into your bloodstream and

276
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:17,370
potato is high in dietary fiber it

277
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:20,640
provides about three grams and of course

278
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:22,140
obviously if we eat the potato skins or

279
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,480
include them if we're making mashed

280
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:28,800
potatoes or for eating our baked potato

281
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:32,040
that would help us a reach that that

282
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:34,050
fiber level and four potatoes are

283
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,120
actually pretty high in protein when

284
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:38,940
compared with other vegetables or fruits

285
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:41,640
and another area where potato really

286
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:44,640
shines even the white fleshed cultivars

287
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:48,990
but one serving of potato provides about

288
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:51,390
45 percent of the u.s. RDA for vitamin C

289
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:54,150
that's even higher than an orange or a

290
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:59,010
serving of oranges so I hope that

291
00:13:54,150 --> 00:14:01,320
everyone will reconsider the the

292
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:03,570
nutritional attributes that potato can

293
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:07,050
provide and how it can be a part of a

294
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:08,520
healthy lifestyle since we're talking

295
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:11,370
about potatoes I thought it would be a

296
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,690
good idea to maybe share just a little

297
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:15,450
bit of background about our potato

298
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:18,570
breeding program at NDSU it was begun in

299
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:21,450
1930 so we have more than a 85-year

300
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:23,220
history now during that time 26

301
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:25,260
cultivars have been released or

302
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:29,100
varieties I used the two terms

303
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:32,970
interchangeably but usually hear talk

304
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:34,800
about cultivars the major goal or

305
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:38,250
objective of our breeding program is to

306
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:40,200
release exceptional multi-purpose

307
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:42,720
cultivars that meet the needs of potato

308
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:45,420
producers and the industry in North

309
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:49,890
Dakota Minnesota the Northern Plains and

310
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:55,050
beyond and for some of you guys as I had

311
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:57,420
mentioned the Norland and russet nor

312
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:59,640
Kota but the picture I have there on the

313
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:03,540
bottom is of the famous potato breeder

314
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:06,240
dr. Bob Johansen and obviously nowadays

315
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:09,750
we grow red Norland and dark red Norland

316
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,950
but he released Norland in 1957 and to

317
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:13,020
think that we're still growing line

318
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:18,180
selections from that is is pretty

319
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:20,190
impressive and pretty exciting and this

320
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:23,340
is just a listing of the cultivar

321
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:25,140
releases coming from NDSU all the way

322
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:28,340
from Nordic nor Clayman Norland that

323
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:28,340
were released in

324
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:33,950
19:57 I don't know I have read norland

325
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:37,700
on that list but seem to have a spare

326
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:40,640
one there and and then all the way

327
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:43,760
through Dakota Ruby which was released

328
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:46,340
in 2014 we have a lot of different Minds

329
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:49,610
coming along in our pipeline here at

330
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:52,340
NDSU so I'm hoping that in the next few

331
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:55,910
months we'll be releasing a new chip

332
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:58,160
variety and/or a new very early russet

333
00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:02,840
variety that would be great for people's

334
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:06,620
gardens in a short growing season in

335
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:09,650
terms of climate and soil potato is a

336
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:12,020
cool season crop and the optimum

337
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:13,460
temperatures that potatoes like to

338
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:16,100
thrive under would be in that

339
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:16,880
temperature range of 55 to 70 degrees

340
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,780
Fahrenheit

341
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:23,420
even up to 75 potatoes do not really

342
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:25,790
like hot temperatures at all and at

343
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:28,700
temperatures above 87 to 90 degrees

344
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:32,860
Fahrenheit photosynthesis will decrease

345
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:35,150
or actually stop and of course that

346
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:38,570
photosynthetic production during the

347
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:41,510
daytime is turned into starches and

348
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:44,750
shuttle down and deposited it as the

349
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:47,150
intimate our tubers at night time during

350
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:49,940
the our summer months after we've had

351
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:53,000
tuber ization so production of the

352
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:55,790
photosynthate is very important potatoes

353
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,040
have a high water requirement and this

354
00:16:55,790 --> 00:17:01,190
is predominantly due to them having a

355
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:04,670
shallow root system so the roots of

356
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:08,120
potato are primarily in the 18 top 18

357
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:11,290
inches of our soil and this is a much

358
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:13,900
more shallow root system than our

359
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:19,570
agronomic crops like wheat or barley

360
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:23,209
alfalfa goes down about 6 feet deep is

361
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:24,860
more similar to many of our vegetable

362
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:27,140
crops and so most of us are familiar

363
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:30,700
that we need to be able to provide a

364
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:34,190
consistent and uniform irrigation or

365
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:36,890
have timely rainfall in order to get

366
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:40,720
adequate production potatoes prefer

367
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:43,030
well-drained and slightly acid soils

368
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,430
but they are really widely adapted and

369
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:49,420
potatoes will grow from sea level all

370
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:52,900
the way to high mountains they obviously

371
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:54,820
like the sandy or sandy loam type of

372
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:57,610
soils but they also do very well in

373
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:59,620
things like muck soils or in peat based

374
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:02,800
soils like we have near gone Vic or

375
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:07,090
clear broken Nam in Minnesota in terms

376
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:11,710
of pH they will grow on a wide variety

377
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:13,120
of PHS and out east there are soils that

378
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:15,730
they grow potatoes on that would have a

379
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:20,110
pH in that four point five to five range

380
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:22,360
and I have been working in breeding

381
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:24,160
programs and cultivar development

382
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:27,670
programs all around the Intermountain

383
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:30,370
West and many producers are growing

384
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:33,880
potatoes on soils where the pH is seven

385
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:38,710
point eight or eight the reason why we

386
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:42,670
talk about soil pH is that sometimes we

387
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:44,350
say or and and we see it there happens

388
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:46,330
to be more common scab and I'll show you

389
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:48,780
some pictures of what color a picture of

390
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:52,870
what common scab is on an upcoming slide

391
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:56,350
but I think that it really depends upon

392
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:58,870
what bio types of the streptomyces you

393
00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:01,540
might have in your soil and then what

394
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:03,070
beneficial flora and fauna you might

395
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:07,060
have in your soil that would help

396
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:10,870
protect the developing tubers and and

397
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:14,320
that pH isn't the the complete answer

398
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:16,990
shall we say my next bullet I have day

399
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:23,430
length written down and day length is

400
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:26,020
important because of the wild species

401
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:28,300
particularly many of our wild potato

402
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:30,250
species will not trooper eyes under long

403
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:33,100
day conditions but as all of you are

404
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:34,750
familiar with we have very long days

405
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:40,810
during our summer times here when we're

406
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:44,800
producing potatoes so our our potatoes

407
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:47,170
are usually setting tubers right around

408
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:50,380
that June 21 the longest day of the year

409
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:52,960
the first day of summer and and then

410
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:54,220
rapidly bulking after that but when I

411
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,289
try to use

412
00:19:54,220 --> 00:20:00,009
while potato species that came from

413
00:19:56,289 --> 00:20:03,460
places like Peru or Ecuador or or even

414
00:20:00,009 --> 00:20:06,399
Central America or Mexico a lot of them

415
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:08,289
will not start to rise until the day's

416
00:20:06,399 --> 00:20:11,350
get to be quite short like we have in

417
00:20:08,289 --> 00:20:13,929
September and so it's hard for me to

418
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:16,899
maybe maintain tubers of those those

419
00:20:13,929 --> 00:20:21,940
particular clones and I would be using

420
00:20:16,899 --> 00:20:23,830
those as a way to inter grass late

421
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:26,500
blight resistance for example or maybe

422
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:29,019
resistance to Colorado potato beetles or

423
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:30,820
things like that and and I'm doing my

424
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:33,700
crossing in the greenhouse but I like to

425
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:35,409
be able to to grow the potatoes out in

426
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,450
the field and so lots of times those

427
00:20:35,409 --> 00:20:39,299
will be just little itty-bitty tiny

428
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:42,580
things when we go to harvest them when

429
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:46,419
whereas our solanum tuberosum that had

430
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:52,389
its origins in the area of southern

431
00:20:46,419 --> 00:20:54,789
chile near of chile island they tuber

432
00:20:52,389 --> 00:20:56,710
eyes under long day conditions so not

433
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:58,330
something that's so important maybe for

434
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:02,169
you gardeners to think about but it is

435
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:05,500
important for for the potato industry to

436
00:21:02,169 --> 00:21:10,059
be aware of so let's talk a little bit

437
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:12,490
more about our prepping our potatoes for

438
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:15,070
production so we'll talk about

439
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:17,860
propagation there are two types of

440
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:20,110
propagation that we do or can use for

441
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:22,179
potato production the primary one of

442
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:24,279
course is asexual reproduction and

443
00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:26,980
that's where we use either a small whole

444
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:28,960
tuber or we use a piece of a tuber it's

445
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:33,940
also referred to as clonal propagation

446
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:37,149
and when we are doing a potato seed

447
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:40,539
certification we will utilize plantlets

448
00:21:37,149 --> 00:21:42,309
that we grow in test tubes that would be

449
00:21:40,539 --> 00:21:44,590
free from diseases this would be the

450
00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:46,870
start of the seed certification system

451
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:49,840
but each one of those plant lights or

452
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:55,330
each one of those pieces of potato would

453
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:58,570
be a clone of the the same variety and

454
00:21:55,330 --> 00:22:01,419
so it's also referred to as clonal

455
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:03,700
propagation in terms of our seed

456
00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:07,100
potatoes in Europe they tend to plant

457
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:10,400
the small potatoes haul in

458
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:12,679
u.s. we generally will our seed will be

459
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,750
bigger so we will be cutting it either

460
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:18,230
in half so that we wind up with two

461
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:22,039
pieces that are about two to three and a

462
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:24,590
half ounces or or we might be cutting 8

463
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:27,620
ounce tuber into 4 pieces that would

464
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:30,710
make that that optimum range of a two to

465
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:32,900
three and a half ounce seed piece the

466
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:35,120
important feature of course is that each

467
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:37,460
seed piece needs to have an eye because

468
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:44,090
that's where the new stem will develop

469
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:45,650
from and we breeders however and I have

470
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:49,159
a couple of pictures on the bottom of

471
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:52,070
this slide we create and use what is

472
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:54,200
called true potato seed and so if any of

473
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:56,059
you have seen what some people will call

474
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:59,000
those little Tomatoes on top of the

475
00:22:56,059 --> 00:23:02,240
potato plant those are our potato

476
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,510
berries or potato fruits they can

477
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:08,000
contain up to 250 individual seeds

478
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:10,640
because of the highly heterozygous

479
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,590
nature meaning we have a lot of genes

480
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,289
and there's a lot of diversity in those

481
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:18,500
genes each one of those brother and

482
00:23:15,289 --> 00:23:21,169
sister seeds in one of those fruits will

483
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:23,659
be genetically different from or can be

484
00:23:21,169 --> 00:23:25,640
genetically different from all of the

485
00:23:23,659 --> 00:23:29,390
other brothers and sisters so when I

486
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:31,549
make a cross and plant out the seed in

487
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:33,590
the greenhouse oh and then take the

488
00:23:31,549 --> 00:23:37,159
tubers that I grow in the greenhouse

489
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:38,720
from those the and plant them in the

490
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:40,940
field it will kind of look like a

491
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,250
patchwork quilt I can have different

492
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:45,830
flower colors it can have different

493
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:48,200
maturities we can have different skin

494
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:53,419
colors we can have different flesh

495
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:56,330
colors just a myriad of of traits it's

496
00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:59,179
really fun and and so if anyone's

497
00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:01,820
interested in you know either harvesting

498
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:04,370
the berries and extracting the seed or

499
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:07,070
doing a little crossing on your own I'm

500
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:08,840
cross pollinating then and growing them

501
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:11,720
out that can be a real fun project with

502
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:14,419
your kids or or just as an adult to see

503
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:16,790
the diversity that you can attain in the

504
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:20,600
wild the primary pollinator is the

505
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:22,730
bumblebee but that's not important for

506
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:25,580
potato production in the garden we're

507
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:28,550
using clonal propagation so we are

508
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:31,220
trying to produce all potatoes that look

509
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:37,040
alike and of you know probably one

510
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:39,410
variety I guess a couple of other points

511
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:42,830
that I should make in terms of prepping

512
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:44,720
for planting and propagating we can cut

513
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:46,700
our tubers it's a good idea to use a

514
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:50,870
sharp knife we don't want to use a

515
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:53,930
serrated knife the potato seed will heal

516
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:57,560
better if it's a nice clean cut or sharp

517
00:24:53,930 --> 00:25:00,950
cut we will need about 15 pounds of seed

518
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:02,210
potatoes to plant a 100 foot row and

519
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:08,120
we'll talk a little bit more about

520
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:10,550
spacing in a subsequent slide when we

521
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:13,640
are searching for seed potatoes

522
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:16,670
obviously garden catalogues are a

523
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:18,740
typical source or a lot of our local

524
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:21,880
grocery stores will carry seed potatoes

525
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:25,730
in their produce section you should not

526
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:28,670
choose the potatoes from their produce

527
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:30,530
display however because more than likely

528
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:32,240
those potatoes have been treated with a

529
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:35,000
sprout inhibitor to prevent them from

530
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,550
sprouting and because of that if you

531
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,970
tried to cut them and plant them in your

532
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:44,080
garden you might not get any any of the

533
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:48,890
eyes to to sprout and grow a new plant

534
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:53,360
so we recommend that you purchase your

535
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:56,630
seed potatoes either from a reputable

536
00:25:53,360 --> 00:26:00,230
seed grower or from a reputable garden

537
00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:03,020
catalog or or from one of your local

538
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:06,320
garden centers or or perhaps grocery

539
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:09,740
stores I'm gonna diverge from my slides

540
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:12,670
here just for one second so please you

541
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:15,530
can go ahead and leave it on this one I

542
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:19,010
didn't talk much about cultivars when I

543
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:22,040
showed the slide about what cultivars

544
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:25,610
were are being grown by the commercial

545
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:29,510
potato farmers but the typical cultivars

546
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:32,570
that you'd probably find in the in your

547
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:34,500
seed catalogs are some of the older

548
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:37,380
varieties you might find cannabis

549
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:40,760
her Irish cobbler obviously red Norland

550
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:43,919
red Pontiac sometimes red lesotho 's

551
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:45,539
many people like to grow a few russet so

552
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:48,090
I think a typical one that you would

553
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:50,400
find would be gold rush I do not

554
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:53,490
recommend trying to grow russet Burbank

555
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:56,070
in your gardens recipe Bank is quite

556
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:58,650
temperamental and it doesn't do

557
00:26:56,070 --> 00:27:00,990
particularly well in our heavy soils

558
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:06,630
like we have in the Fargo Moorhead area

559
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:08,490
and it also is very temperamental when

560
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:11,610
it comes to water it has to have their

561
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:14,309
uniform water in order to produce nice

562
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:17,100
smooth attractive looking tubers so I

563
00:27:14,309 --> 00:27:20,429
don't recommend that you purchase rest

564
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:22,530
the Burbank or or look for that in our

565
00:27:20,429 --> 00:27:26,190
area you might find some russet nor

566
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:29,400
quotas and some Vikings at your local

567
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:32,340
seed retailers and of course Yukon Gold

568
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:34,409
Yukon Gold is a great variety to grow in

569
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:36,210
your garden it's quite upright it

570
00:27:34,409 --> 00:27:38,610
doesn't produce a lot of tubers per

571
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:41,940
plant though so you may want to plant

572
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:46,309
them a little bit closer and plant a few

573
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:49,169
more heals the tubers when they get big

574
00:27:46,309 --> 00:27:51,630
for Yukon Gold oftentimes will have

575
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:53,669
hollow heart if the moisture hasn't been

576
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:59,220
quite uniform or if you let them get to

577
00:27:53,669 --> 00:28:01,559
be too large and but they are a good you

578
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:04,289
know quite early maturing potato and

579
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:07,169
they are really have so many uses

580
00:28:04,289 --> 00:28:11,580
they're kind of my go-to in terms of

581
00:28:07,169 --> 00:28:13,919
multi-use when I'm cooking here at NDSU

582
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:16,110
we've released some great varieties that

583
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:20,789
are probably a little bit harder to

584
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:23,220
track down but if you know a seed potato

585
00:28:20,789 --> 00:28:26,760
grower and you want to get something

586
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:30,360
into or talk to your local grocery store

587
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:32,880
produce manager or your garden center

588
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:35,250
manager and they can talk to the

589
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,260
certified seed potato growers but it

590
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:42,510
takes about three years to get geared up

591
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:44,669
to produce potato support a new market

592
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:46,679
so if somebody wanted to grow our

593
00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:48,790
beautiful to quote a ruby for example it

594
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:52,600
produces a high set of

595
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:57,370
beautiful bright red skin round like

596
00:28:52,600 --> 00:29:00,370
apples potatoes very high yielding but

597
00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:02,770
in order to you know you probably aren't

598
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:05,080
going to find it in the marketplace and

599
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:07,660
so you might have to ask and then it

600
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:10,660
might take them a year or two to be able

601
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:12,610
to get them in but I would like to hope

602
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:16,900
that some people would be adventurous

603
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:19,240
and and try to maybe explore some

604
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:22,150
different potato varieties than the old

605
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:25,360
standards okay we can advance to

606
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:27,010
planting so when we are going to be

607
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,530
planting in our gardens we're not going

608
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:32,230
to be using a fancy machine like we have

609
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:34,270
here for planting our research plots but

610
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:37,330
I thought that it was kind of a good

611
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:40,840
picture because it shows the hills that

612
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:43,240
oftentimes we will use and as gardeners

613
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:45,820
you might want to be forming as well and

614
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:48,310
you have the opportunity to form those

615
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:50,590
hills before you plant and then plant

616
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:54,550
into them or you can plant into flat

617
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:59,580
ground and then create a hill as part of

618
00:29:54,550 --> 00:30:02,680
your cultivation weed control whatever

619
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:04,570
you want to call it in the garden and

620
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:07,360
I'll talk more about healing I believe

621
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:09,220
in the next slide so for spacing in our

622
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,160
Gardens most of us will plant our

623
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:15,280
potatoes and rows that range from 30 to

624
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:21,010
36 inches wide or the distance from the

625
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:23,920
top of the hill or the the row from the

626
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:27,460
distance between the two rows would be

627
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:30,310
30 to 36 inches some potato growers will

628
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:33,480
also use 38 inch rows but it just

629
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:37,870
depends upon what equipment they own so

630
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:40,560
so you are welcome to do what you might

631
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:44,440
where what might work best for you

632
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:47,320
within the row most of us will plant 10

633
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:49,750
to 12 inches apart or you know somewhere

634
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:52,150
around the foot between plants are

635
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:55,360
between seed pieces if we want to

636
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:58,570
produce a high volume of very small

637
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:00,850
tubers then we might want to put our

638
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:02,770
seed pieces closer together within the

639
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:06,250
row so maybe

640
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:09,520
plant them at eight inches if that is

641
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:12,550
the desired supersize profile that we

642
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:15,970
would be after and then I have the word

643
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:19,420
beds on my little bullet points here

644
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:23,740
some people are starting to grow

645
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:28,800
potatoes in what would I would call a

646
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:30,990
raised bed it would be like a hill

647
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:33,850
except that it would be three feet wide

648
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:35,410
so you would you would build it up and

649
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:37,870
then it would be three feet wide and

650
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:40,900
some people will plant basically three

651
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:43,860
rows of potatoes but they will be offset

652
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:47,590
so they're more in a diamond shape and

653
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:52,300
um and again you can use whatever seed

654
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:54,130
or within row spacing that you want

655
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:57,520
depending upon what you're going to be

656
00:31:54,130 --> 00:32:00,280
doing with the potatoes or what size of

657
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:01,870
potatoes you want and when we plant we

658
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:04,330
usually plant our potatoes so that

659
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:06,790
they're about four inches deep so if

660
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:09,429
we've already ready formed our Hill then

661
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:12,970
we will poke them down to about four

662
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:16,030
inches below if we are going to plant

663
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:18,190
our potatoes and then form the hill we

664
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:21,550
might just want to poke them in a couple

665
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:24,400
of inches and then build up that hill as

666
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:31,179
I mentioned when we're doing our Reed

667
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:34,660
control in terms of fertilization most

668
00:32:31,179 --> 00:32:37,240
of us would base our fertility

669
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:39,250
management on a soil test and even we

670
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:41,590
gardeners should probably be testing our

671
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:44,350
soil every few years you know we're

672
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:48,880
rotating our different vegetable crops

673
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:50,980
around we are maybe adding some compost

674
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:56,110
that we're making in a barrel on our

675
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:58,900
patio sometimes there is you know

676
00:32:56,110 --> 00:33:02,100
backyard flooding so we are getting a

677
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:04,720
mixture of soil from new construction

678
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:08,410
you know in our neighborhood or or

679
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:10,450
varying things so doing a soil test is a

680
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:12,520
good idea and here at North Dakota State

681
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:14,380
University we do have a soil testing lab

682
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:18,040
and so you can

683
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:21,910
um get a little bag from them or or just

684
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:24,010
pull a few cores from your soil and put

685
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:26,680
them in a paper bag and Mail em and

686
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:29,530
bring them in and they can run a little

687
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:32,800
soil test report I would recommend going

688
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:35,080
down to 12 inches in your garden and

689
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:36,970
like I said do it every five years or

690
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:39,690
three to five years or three to eight

691
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:43,750
years just so they kind of have an idea

692
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:47,230
when it comes to actual fertilizers we

693
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:49,330
can use commercial fertilizers like we

694
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:51,940
would get at any of the big box stores

695
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:55,230
or at our gardening centers but we can

696
00:33:51,940 --> 00:34:00,280
also use manure or other types of

697
00:33:55,230 --> 00:34:01,990
organic sorts of fertilizers and and it

698
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:04,630
doesn't really matter what we are

699
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:06,940
shooting for is we want to supply our

700
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:09,490
potato plants with the proper amount of

701
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:13,780
fertilizer so that we can attain a high

702
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:16,870
yield with our commercial growers we

703
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:18,909
have a little chart and we say that you

704
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:21,790
know depending upon your soil test and

705
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:25,080
your yield goal this is what you should

706
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:28,690
be providing in terms of n P and K

707
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:31,060
nitrogen phosphorus and potassium for we

708
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:34,270
gardeners I guess I use more of a rule

709
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:38,530
of thumb that we need to apply about 1/3

710
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:43,000
of a pound of nitrogen for every 100

711
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:45,250
square feet of potato production we have

712
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,740
going on some of us might have those

713
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:51,040
beds or some of us might have rows and

714
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:53,530
so I'll let you kind of do your own math

715
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:57,160
but but that would be kind of a general

716
00:34:53,530 --> 00:35:01,690
rule of thumb for when we don't

717
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:04,300
necessarily have a recent soil test when

718
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:07,240
we are placing our fertilizer whether it

719
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:10,660
be commercial fertilizer or manure we

720
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:13,720
can work it into the soil pre plant or

721
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:15,850
if we want to we can when we're using

722
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:18,880
commercial fertilizers like granular

723
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:21,280
fertilizers we can place it two inches

724
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:23,410
to the side and two inches below our

725
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,630
seed piece the reason why we don't want

726
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:28,190
to put it right with our seed piece is

727
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:30,740
that we

728
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:33,200
can the the salts and commercial

729
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:35,690
fertilizers can cause burning to the

730
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:38,210
developing roots and Duvall developing

731
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:41,930
shoots so that's a reason why we might

732
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:44,619
avoid putting at least any type of

733
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:49,540
volume of the commercial fertilizer in

734
00:35:44,619 --> 00:35:52,609
close proximity to our seed pieces a

735
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:55,609
typical fertilizer that I recommend for

736
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:59,270
potato production we use it on the farm

737
00:35:55,609 --> 00:36:01,520
I use it in my research plots and it's a

738
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:03,680
good one that home gardeners can usually

739
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,990
access would be something like fifteen

740
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:08,990
thirty fifteen and just to refresh

741
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:13,970
everybody's memory that first 15 stands

742
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:17,119
for in the thirty stands for or I said

743
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:20,839
in and didn't say nitrogen the thirty

744
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:23,810
stands for P for phosphorous and the

745
00:36:20,839 --> 00:36:27,440
fifth the last fifteen stands for K for

746
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:29,390
potassium potatoes are a high user of

747
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:32,480
phosphorous and especially with some of

748
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:35,119
the pH is that our soil pH is that we

749
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:39,650
have in this area our phosphorous might

750
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:43,790
not be as readily available as some

751
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:47,470
areas where they have a lower pH of soil

752
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:50,500
so it's important that we select a a

753
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:53,170
fertilizer that has a high phosphorous

754
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:56,089
content or that we add supplemental

755
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:59,270
phosphorous because it's very important

756
00:36:56,089 --> 00:37:05,660
for tuber production and for high

757
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:10,130
quality tubers let me see then comment

758
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:13,880
about manure we should um use well aged

759
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:17,240
manure typically I would recommend that

760
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:20,260
you apply manure to your garden in the

761
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:22,310
fall before you're going to be planting

762
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:26,150
whatever vegetables but especially

763
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:30,140
potatoes and the part of the reason for

764
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:33,950
this is that if the manure is not you

765
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:36,140
know somewhat composted already it has

766
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:40,010
been implicated and causing common scab

767
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:41,730
on potatoes but it also is more likely

768
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:46,050
to be harboring things like

769
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:46,950
weed seeds or even some insect pests and

770
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:49,020
things like that

771
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:51,450
so we like to say to incorporate

772
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:54,090
well-aged manure and to do that in the

773
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:57,210
fall prior to our growing season now we

774
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:58,770
can advance asides to the culture okay

775
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:01,680
so I talked a little bit about healing

776
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:03,510
and hopefully this picture you can see

777
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,900
the hills and how the potatoes are

778
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:08,100
coming up in the middle of those hills

779
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:10,859
healing is important for potato

780
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:13,980
production for two reasons number one is

781
00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:16,380
it helps with water management so if we

782
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:18,990
get a heavy rain or if we're using an

783
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:21,150
overhead sprinkler in our garden the

784
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:24,480
water will stay in the fertile part

785
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:28,950
hopefully and our potato plants will not

786
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:31,290
have to wet the feet hopefully that's

787
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:32,940
one reason for the healing and of course

788
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:35,730
the other reason for the healing is to

789
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:38,760
help prevent greening of our developing

790
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:41,040
tubers even sometimes as we're

791
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:44,400
approaching fall and we maybe have had

792
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:47,970
some dry soils we maybe have a really

793
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:50,160
great potato crop coming up as our vines

794
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:53,490
start to senesce or our plants start to

795
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:55,890
die there might be some cracks in our

796
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:59,359
soil and sometimes we'll find that our

797
00:38:55,890 --> 00:39:02,790
tubers have little green lines or green

798
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:05,190
splotches on them because they have been

799
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:08,070
exposed to the light remember I said

800
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:10,140
that the tuber was a modified stem so

801
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:12,330
anything that happens to the foliage can

802
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:15,210
happen to the tubers and greening is one

803
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:20,600
of those things the tuber will develop

804
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:23,790
chlorophyll just like our stems so

805
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:26,010
irrigation a reminder the potato plant

806
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:29,430
is shallow rooted that are primarily in

807
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:32,400
the top 18 inches when we have water

808
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:36,540
stress we might see our potato plants

809
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:39,810
wilting we might see a Bluegreen gray

810
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:41,790
color to our foliage and when we go to

811
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:43,619
harvest our potatoes we might start to

812
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:45,510
see some misshapen tubers they might be

813
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:47,940
pointy on one end they might be shaped

814
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:49,890
like a dumbbell there might be some

815
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:52,530
external defects things like growth

816
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:54,240
cracks or what I call knobs that are

817
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:57,450
second growth

818
00:39:54,240 --> 00:40:00,090
when we go to cook them and cut into

819
00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:03,210
them we might see some internal problems

820
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:05,010
things I call a heart so potatoes don't

821
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:07,260
like water stress but they also don't

822
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:09,720
like being over watered and that's the

823
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:12,300
reason why I have our bullet late season

824
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:15,330
watering as we start to see our potato

825
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:18,660
plants start to senesce or die that

826
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:20,700
you'll see a yellow chlorosis and the

827
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:25,050
plants probably will have kind of

828
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:29,360
started to crouch down or lay down in

829
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:32,160
the rows they're not being hugely

830
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:34,110
photosynthetically active probably we

831
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:38,520
don't want to overwater at this point

832
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:42,060
because we can create problems where our

833
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:43,740
tubers are struggling to breathe you

834
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:45,510
might see some little white freckles on

835
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:49,020
the potatoes when you would dig them out

836
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:51,540
of wet soil those are the breathing

837
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:54,510
pores and when the potatoes are

838
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:57,630
struggling to breathe in the soil they

839
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:59,869
will the those breathing pores will kind

840
00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:02,790
of expand and they almost look fuzzy

841
00:40:59,869 --> 00:41:04,710
those white freckles but because those

842
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:08,609
breathing pores are wide open we can

843
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:10,859
have some pathogens enter and then this

844
00:41:08,609 --> 00:41:13,050
can limit the shelf life or the storage

845
00:41:10,859 --> 00:41:16,710
life of our potatoes in our root cellar

846
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:18,990
or in our potato storages so we need to

847
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:21,270
be cognizant of late season watering I

848
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:24,840
don't really have a bullet point in here

849
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:26,730
indicating how much a water we should be

850
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:30,060
using or how much irrigation we should

851
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:35,220
be doing but typically we want to keep

852
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:40,410
the top 12 inches of soil damp and we

853
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:43,050
would be thinking about supplying about

854
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:45,510
one inch of water per week a potato crop

855
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:48,180
will use between eighteen and thirty six

856
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:52,530
inches of water depending upon our soil

857
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:56,130
type for a whole growing season you know

858
00:41:52,530 --> 00:42:03,390
for a hundred to 120 day growing season

859
00:41:56,130 --> 00:42:06,180
so so I you know certain soils are going

860
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:08,100
to like hot dry sands are going to

861
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:10,020
require heavier watering

862
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:15,360
then if we're growing potatoes on our

863
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:16,950
loans or certainly on our clay soils

864
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:20,460
like we have here in the Red River

865
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:22,020
Valley now on the next couple of slides

866
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:24,000
we're going to talk about pest control

867
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:27,180
and we'll start out talking about weed

868
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:30,180
control first my first comment would be

869
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:33,360
if you want to change slides would be

870
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:35,840
that we do not use a herbicide in the

871
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:38,460
garden now for growing potatoes for

872
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:41,550
farmers market scenario you're probably

873
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:43,470
going to have larger areas but when

874
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:45,420
we're gardening we tend to have a lot of

875
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:47,730
different species and very close

876
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:51,960
proximity to one another so I don't

877
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:55,260
really recommend using herbicides in our

878
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:59,270
home gardens instead that should be what

879
00:42:55,260 --> 00:43:01,560
I tell my mom is it's therapy after work

880
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:04,530
you know at the end of the day it's a

881
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:06,300
nice fun way to go out and you know do a

882
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:08,880
little puttering around after supper

883
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:10,860
weeding and tending to your garden it's

884
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,440
a very peaceful enjoyable time of the

885
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:18,360
day to listen to the birds talk to your

886
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:22,200
backyard neighbors just you know just a

887
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:24,600
better way to handle weeds but there are

888
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:27,300
some weeds that particularly seem to be

889
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:29,100
problematic and potatoes some of them

890
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:31,320
like the nightshade like the picture

891
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:34,050
that I'm showing here they're related to

892
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:36,480
potatoes and so the two seem to come

893
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:40,290
hand in hand but we might see things

894
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:41,430
like foxtails or wild oats in our farm

895
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:43,380
fields a lot of times you'll see

896
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:45,540
volunteers cereal grains so we might

897
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:47,970
wind up with oats or wheat or barley

898
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:50,460
depending what the previous crop here

899
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:52,860
was oftentimes in our gardens we'll see

900
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:54,270
things like wild mustard I definitely

901
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:57,240
find a lot of pig weeds and lambs

902
00:43:54,270 --> 00:44:00,650
quarters in my garden buckwheat is

903
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:02,910
becoming a problem in some areas

904
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:06,380
certainly Canada thistle can be

905
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:10,080
problematic if we have it in our our

906
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:12,600
yards or in a row ditch that it can

907
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:15,540
easily move and the more tillage we do

908
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:18,270
the more calm canada thistle spreads and

909
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:19,550
then of course in my garden i oftentimes

910
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:21,950
will find kosher

911
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:24,200
and it depends on where you're growing

912
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:27,020
your gardens are where you might be

913
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:30,380
growing potatoes for the for a farmers

914
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:32,780
market or or a field but um the

915
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:36,800
complexion of weed species might change

916
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:40,210
depending where you are on the globe for

917
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:42,830
insect pests the major insect pest

918
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:45,170
potato is Colorado potato beetle and

919
00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:46,940
oddly I worked in Colorado for six years

920
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:51,580
in the San Luis Valley we didn't have

921
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:56,150
Colorado potato beetles but the original

922
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:59,390
naming of the beetles came because they

923
00:44:56,150 --> 00:45:01,190
identified these beetles that once they

924
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:03,740
started producing potatoes in Colorado

925
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:06,880
came off with a buffalo purr which again

926
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:10,700
is related related species to potato and

927
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:13,190
and so that was in the northeastern

928
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:16,310
corner kind of near that Greeley area so

929
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:17,570
so that's how Colorado potato beetle got

930
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:20,660
its name but it doesn't mean that

931
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:23,060
beetles grow everywhere in Colorado so

932
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:27,080
the top three photos that I have the top

933
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:29,900
photo shows you the the adult and they

934
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:32,300
do some defoliation the middle photo

935
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:34,970
shows you a potato plant that was the

936
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:37,600
foliated by beetles and then if you look

937
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:41,180
very very closely on that that very

938
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:43,340
bottom of the top three but actually

939
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:47,810
turns out to be the middle photo on the

940
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:51,190
slide you'll see some little larvae that

941
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:53,720
sort of look like fat little slugs and

942
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:55,940
some people refer to these as pigs

943
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:59,240
because they're kind of pink and they

944
00:45:55,940 --> 00:46:00,620
start out tiny in red the eggs would be

945
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:02,720
found on the undersides of the leaves

946
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:05,150
and they usually are a yellowy orange

947
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:07,580
color and then the closer they get to

948
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:09,410
hatching they they kind of start to

949
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:11,270
become this orange yellow or orange

950
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:13,760
--red color

951
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:18,410
but these little larvae then when they

952
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:21,650
hatch they start eating and so the the

953
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:24,350
size of these ones would have quite

954
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:27,140
ferocious appetites and they can consume

955
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:30,410
a lot of potato foliage in just a day or

956
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:32,349
two again in your garden I'm not sure if

957
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:36,640
you really need to be using an insect

958
00:46:32,349 --> 00:46:40,509
side for control a lot of people will

959
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:48,430
handpick them or you can shake them into

960
00:46:40,509 --> 00:46:51,609
a little coffee can of something like

961
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:55,059
turpentine or you can just collect them

962
00:46:51,609 --> 00:47:00,069
into a container and put them into your

963
00:46:55,059 --> 00:47:03,069
trash you know in if you are

964
00:47:00,069 --> 00:47:05,890
uncomfortable with killing them but we I

965
00:47:03,069 --> 00:47:08,499
think in our home gardens controlling

966
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:11,190
them is using insecticides is not as

967
00:47:08,499 --> 00:47:15,069
important as controlling them using

968
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:18,130
another method like hand picking the

969
00:47:15,069 --> 00:47:20,859
bottom right hand picture it is a

970
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:23,109
picture of green peach aphids and they

971
00:47:20,859 --> 00:47:26,079
are literally covering the potato Foley

972
00:47:23,109 --> 00:47:28,569
agent in that particular photo if it's

973
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:32,170
you'll sometimes find in your garden

974
00:47:28,569 --> 00:47:35,109
they vector viruses or they can transmit

975
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:37,930
potato viruses in your garden it's

976
00:47:35,109 --> 00:47:41,109
probably not a big deal but it's a huge

977
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:43,599
issue for our certified seed potato

978
00:47:41,109 --> 00:47:46,690
growers so they like to control aphids

979
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:49,509
many of them as a sustainable practice

980
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:54,249
will release ladybird beetles because

981
00:47:49,509 --> 00:47:56,829
they're a natural predator of aphids

982
00:47:54,249 --> 00:47:58,509
that's something that you can purchase I

983
00:47:56,829 --> 00:48:01,749
know in some of the garden catalogs you

984
00:47:58,509 --> 00:48:03,549
can purchase a little tub of of ladybird

985
00:48:01,749 --> 00:48:09,219
beetles and let them go free in your

986
00:48:03,549 --> 00:48:11,319
garden but for the most part growers

987
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:13,150
have commercial growers have a hard time

988
00:48:11,319 --> 00:48:18,359
using any kind of insecticide because

989
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:22,029
the aphids move and and they fly and so

990
00:48:18,359 --> 00:48:24,940
they struggle with that so they have to

991
00:48:22,029 --> 00:48:27,430
you know do other things which is number

992
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:31,150
one try not to have potatoes with

993
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:36,999
viruses in close proximity to your seed

994
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:39,339
fields if you do have a feds in your

995
00:48:36,999 --> 00:48:41,289
crop you might see some honeydew or you

996
00:48:39,339 --> 00:48:42,780
might see some crinkling of leaves like

997
00:48:41,289 --> 00:48:44,880
our end

998
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:48,600
kind of some rolling like we see in this

999
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:51,990
photo that could be a symptom of their

1000
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:55,860
their activity leafhoppers can be a

1001
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:59,490
problem in our area these little insects

1002
00:48:55,860 --> 00:49:02,390
are quite tiny they do hop they sort of

1003
00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:04,350
look like a teeny teeny teeny tiny

1004
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:08,430
grasshopper if you look at them closely

1005
00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:10,640
they have wings they blow up on the

1006
00:49:08,430 --> 00:49:13,980
winds from southern states and so

1007
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:16,380
sometimes if they've had a lot of them

1008
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:19,320
in southern states on other crops and

1009
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:22,680
they blow up will have few leaf hoppers

1010
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:24,180
around early in the summer generally not

1011
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:27,200
something that we need to control

1012
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:30,260
usually the predator insects get them

1013
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:33,120
flea beetles are another one that

1014
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:36,330
occasionally will see it we'll get that

1015
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:39,390
child holing effect I ate my go to plant

1016
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:42,000
if I am wondering if I have flea beetles

1017
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:44,400
I look at my radish plants because flea

1018
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:48,900
beetles seem to like radishes better

1019
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:52,620
than everything so that's the the story

1020
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:55,020
on insects the bottom picture is of wire

1021
00:49:52,620 --> 00:50:00,440
worms and particularly if we're taking

1022
00:49:55,020 --> 00:50:04,710
our or putting a garden in where we have

1023
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:07,110
just taken it out of sod or out of

1024
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:10,910
alfalfa we might see wire worms very

1025
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:13,950
rarely do we have grubs potato diseases

1026
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:16,530
in your garden hopefully you're not

1027
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:18,360
going to see too many the upper

1028
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:21,600
left-hand picture is a picture of common

1029
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:24,870
scab again it's caused by fungus in the

1030
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:27,450
soil called streptomyces you may or may

1031
00:50:24,870 --> 00:50:31,860
not have it it's a good reason to rotate

1032
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:34,020
spots in your garden and we can

1033
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:36,600
certainly peel it away it's not harmful

1034
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:38,730
it just doesn't look appetizing early

1035
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:41,670
blight is the picture in the middle and

1036
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:43,650
if you have a chance to come back and

1037
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:47,280
review this you'll see that those little

1038
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:49,230
lesions look like a bull's-eye the funny

1039
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,120
thing about early blight is early blight

1040
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:53,400
tends to come in late when our potatoes

1041
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:55,350
maybe have some kind of stress and late

1042
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,670
blight tends to come in earlier in the

1043
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:57,980
girl

1044
00:50:55,670 --> 00:51:03,200
season late blade is in the lower

1045
00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:05,260
left-hand bottom picture and if we tip

1046
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:08,299
those leaves over we might see some

1047
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:11,720
mycelial growth around that kind of

1048
00:51:08,299 --> 00:51:14,210
chlorotic yellow halo pink rot is the

1049
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:16,609
picture in the middle on the bottom and

1050
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:20,839
we would not notice this until we went

1051
00:51:16,609 --> 00:51:23,540
to cut open the potato and it is a

1052
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:26,630
problem because your soil was too wet

1053
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:29,089
and particularly as the plants were

1054
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:30,650
maturing and then sometimes we'll see

1055
00:51:29,089 --> 00:51:32,990
some skirts the bottom right hand

1056
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:35,420
picture is a picture of black skirt for

1057
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:38,510
Rhizoctonia some of us call it that it's

1058
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:40,160
the dirt that won't wash off and there's

1059
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:43,430
another one that kind of gives our

1060
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:47,240
tubers a bronzy sort of Sheen again

1061
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:50,480
neither of these are anything that you

1062
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:53,359
need to be scared of the the skirts we

1063
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:55,430
can just peel them away they just don't

1064
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:57,260
look pretty they're kind of cosmetic but

1065
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:59,809
the other one we call silver skirt

1066
00:51:57,260 --> 00:52:01,520
because of that kind of silvery bronzy

1067
00:51:59,809 --> 00:52:05,299
Sheen that we might see on some red

1068
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:08,210
potatoes for physiological disorders the

1069
00:52:05,299 --> 00:52:11,510
upper picture is a picture with many

1070
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:13,460
growth cracks the middle picture shows

1071
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:17,660
you secondary growth or what we call

1072
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:19,549
nobs both of these are caused by as well

1073
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:22,309
as hollow heart which is the bottom

1074
00:52:19,549 --> 00:52:25,190
left-hand photo all of these are caused

1075
00:52:22,309 --> 00:52:28,190
by our potatoes being under some kind of

1076
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:30,260
a stress usually heat stress and/or

1077
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:32,630
water stress then we have an alleviation

1078
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:35,420
of that stress by either cooling of

1079
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:38,750
temperature or by supplying some

1080
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:40,250
irrigation or or getting a rain and then

1081
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:42,410
our potatoes decide that they're gonna

1082
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:44,690
grow really really fast all of a sudden

1083
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:47,059
their fertilizer is available the

1084
00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:50,030
temperature is nice so they grow really

1085
00:52:47,059 --> 00:52:52,210
fast sometimes they manifest themselves

1086
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:55,160
in a crack on the outside of the potato

1087
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:57,260
sometimes it causes the dormancy

1088
00:52:55,160 --> 00:53:00,349
basically to have been broken in some of

1089
00:52:57,260 --> 00:53:02,540
those eyes so they form knobs or it

1090
00:53:00,349 --> 00:53:05,359
causes a physical tearing on the inside

1091
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:07,930
of the tuber when we have very rapid

1092
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:11,020
growth because the potato can't keep

1093
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:14,110
up and and so we get that hollow heart

1094
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:16,900
or Brown Center we also might see some

1095
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:18,820
different misshapen tubers you might get

1096
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:20,650
the baseball gloves or we might get

1097
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:22,540
these pointy tubers like we have in the

1098
00:53:20,650 --> 00:53:24,280
hollow heart picture and then the right

1099
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:26,230
hand picture is bruising this is a

1100
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:28,840
picture of black spot bruising and this

1101
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:31,810
is what happens when we maybe handle our

1102
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:34,600
potato is roughly we're picking them up

1103
00:53:31,810 --> 00:53:38,470
into plastic buckets and dumping them

1104
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:42,700
into something else or we are touching

1105
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:44,500
them hard with our potato taking fork so

1106
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:47,350
when we peel it we might see that black

1107
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:49,510
spot then for harvest were we're already

1108
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:51,400
thinking about harvest I have new

1109
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:55,030
potatoes here because a lot of us if we

1110
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:57,520
plant early in the season I know some

1111
00:53:55,030 --> 00:54:00,130
people like to plant on Good Friday we

1112
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:02,650
probably it well even if we plant in May

1113
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:05,610
we might have new potatoes for the

1114
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:07,660
fourth of July for example if we want to

1115
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:10,840
harvest a couple of plants

1116
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:13,390
I recommend only harvesting what you can

1117
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:16,180
eat for that meal because they are small

1118
00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:19,570
they have very thin skins they desiccate

1119
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:21,700
easily so I would just harvest a plant

1120
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:25,080
or two enough to get a pot of potatoes

1121
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:27,070
to have with peas and and call that good

1122
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:28,930
if we're going to be digging our

1123
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:31,690
potatoes to store then we want to have

1124
00:54:28,930 --> 00:54:33,430
more moist soil but not wet but moist

1125
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:35,620
because again that kind of provides a

1126
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:38,110
cushion and then we need to be cognizant

1127
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:40,690
of temperatures growers do not harvest

1128
00:54:38,110 --> 00:54:44,170
below soil temperatures of 45 degrees

1129
00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:46,690
Fahrenheit and they do not harvest when

1130
00:54:44,170 --> 00:54:48,640
the temperature is above 65 degrees

1131
00:54:46,690 --> 00:54:52,420
Fahrenheit we have a little bit more

1132
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:54,490
leeway in our home gardens but really

1133
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:57,910
ideally we'd stay in that 20 degree

1134
00:54:54,490 --> 00:55:01,030
range of 45 to 65 degrees and then

1135
00:54:57,910 --> 00:55:02,950
lastly in terms of storage if we have a

1136
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:05,110
root cellar or something we should be

1137
00:55:02,950 --> 00:55:07,390
starting our potatoes at 90 to 95

1138
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:09,760
percent relative humidity we don't want

1139
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:11,770
to have free moisture but we want to

1140
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:15,400
provide humidity because during the

1141
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:19,690
curing part that initial ten days to two

1142
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:22,000
weeks we are allowing our potatoes to

1143
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:24,970
heal up any wounds that they might have

1144
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:27,910
and also to allow for the skins to set

1145
00:55:24,970 --> 00:55:29,890
if need be we want to keep the initial

1146
00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:31,690
temperature in that 50 to 60 degree

1147
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:33,670
range if we're going to be storing our

1148
00:55:31,690 --> 00:55:36,250
potatoes over the winter then we

1149
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:39,790
gradually lower about one degree a day

1150
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:42,970
down to 38 to 40 degrees if we can and

1151
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:45,970
then I have light and light is really

1152
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:47,950
key again because if we forget to leave

1153
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:49,810
the light on in our root cellar or we

1154
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:52,150
have an open window in our basement and

1155
00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:53,560
our you know on the uncurtained window

1156
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:55,900
in our basement and that's where we're

1157
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:57,430
storing our potatoes they're going to be

1158
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:59,920
exposed to light and we're going to

1159
00:55:57,430 --> 00:56:02,260
develop some greening some people are

1160
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:04,890
actually allergic to that green area and

1161
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:07,540
we can peel it away but if we don't and

1162
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:10,840
someone eats that they can develop a

1163
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:14,860
tummy ache or develop some flu-like

1164
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:18,100
symptoms and this is due to natural

1165
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:20,140
insecticide called glyco alkaloids in

1166
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:22,330
the foliage and so that same thing

1167
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:25,840
happens in our tubers because our tubers

1168
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:27,430
are modified stems okay I think I've

1169
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:29,680
covered a lot of ground I didn't talk

1170
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:31,990
quite as fast maybe as I thought I was

1171
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:34,260
going to but I'm game to answer

1172
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:37,480
questions if people have them

1173
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:41,920
Susie there was one question so far from

1174
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:46,500
Dianne what can we do for scab okay well

1175
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:49,840
um scab is a soil borne fungus so it if

1176
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:52,390
people have it in their soil then if

1177
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:54,700
rotation is an option I would consider

1178
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:56,310
that you know to somewhere else in their

1179
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:58,960
garden maybe where they haven't grown

1180
00:56:56,310 --> 00:57:07,540
potatoes or other solanaceous crops

1181
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:11,680
recently there are very few fungicidal

1182
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:16,210
like seed piece or seed treatments or

1183
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:18,340
anything like that that we can use there

1184
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:20,920
are some varieties that are a little

1185
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:22,870
less susceptible than others but this

1186
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:25,420
might be a good instance where the they

1187
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:29,350
maybe want to get a soil test and see

1188
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:31,120
what their soil pH is maybe their this

1189
00:57:29,350 --> 00:57:32,620
would be an opportunity to do a little

1190
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:36,460
bit of soil amendment

1191
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:39,880
you know add lime if that if the pH is

1192
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:42,600
too high or add something else if they

1193
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:46,840
are growing potatoes on a more acidic

1194
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:50,710
soil because people also get common scab

1195
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:53,830
on acid acid soils it's called acid scab

1196
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:56,140
in those cases we have time for one more

1197
00:57:53,830 --> 00:57:58,630
question and we have one more here

1198
00:57:56,140 --> 00:58:04,510
what cultivar do you recommend for a

1199
00:57:58,630 --> 00:58:06,820
potato box for a potato box I guess I

1200
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:10,450
don't I'm I'm I'm not sure what they're

1201
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:12,280
referring to as a potato box maybe they

1202
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:15,460
can maybe I can answer the other

1203
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:18,340
question that popped up while they

1204
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:20,620
described what a potato box's sure can

1205
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:24,250
you use your store and potatoes for seed

1206
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:27,730
potatoes I do not recommend that people

1207
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:32,160
use their own potatoes as seed potatoes

1208
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:36,360
because you are not a seed grower and

1209
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:38,440
you know nobody's coming in and

1210
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:40,510
inspecting your crop during the growing

1211
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:42,730
season and inspecting it during the

1212
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:45,970
storage season like like real certified

1213
00:58:42,730 --> 00:58:48,130
seed potato growers do i I think that in

1214
00:58:45,970 --> 00:58:49,930
many cases your yields are going to

1215
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:52,770
decline you're gonna wind up with a lot

1216
00:58:49,930 --> 00:58:56,350
smaller of tubers and you're gonna have

1217
00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:59,560
unthrifty plants so here's a little more

1218
00:58:56,350 --> 00:59:01,900
on the potato box question she means

1219
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:04,390
growing potatoes in an elevated box

1220
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:07,570
where you add layers to the box as the

1221
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:10,330
potatoes grow okay this is a great

1222
00:59:07,570 --> 00:59:14,470
question I have not ever grown potatoes

1223
00:59:10,330 --> 00:59:18,640
in in such a growing system but because

1224
00:59:14,470 --> 00:59:20,260
they are growing in a box like that I'm

1225
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:21,900
guessing that you're looking for

1226
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:24,670
something that is going to be putting on

1227
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:27,580
additional stolons and growing more

1228
00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:30,100
tubers you probably would want to pick a

1229
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:33,580
variety that would be more of an

1230
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:35,920
indeterminant variety than something

1231
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:38,170
like red Norland is very determinate

1232
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:40,570
it's you know and also very early

1233
00:59:38,170 --> 00:59:44,210
maturing so so I would not pick

1234
00:59:40,570 --> 00:59:45,890
something like that out of our

1235
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:47,869
and I probably would not pick a Yukon

1236
00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:53,630
Gold either because they they're not

1237
00:59:47,869 --> 00:59:56,359
going to set more tubers this is a

1238
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:59,059
little perplexing a variety that might

1239
00:59:56,359 --> 01:00:02,180
work would be Red List soda if you could

1240
00:59:59,059 --> 01:00:08,210
find it I think that our Dakota Ruby

1241
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:11,780
could there are some European varieties

1242
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:16,339
that you might find around there's one

1243
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:20,109
called Molly it produces a lot of little

1244
01:00:16,339 --> 01:00:23,569
round tubers probably 20 per plant and

1245
01:00:20,109 --> 01:00:26,059
they would have yellow flesh but again

1246
01:00:23,569 --> 01:00:30,380
it's kind of going to depend what your

1247
01:00:26,059 --> 01:00:33,290
what's available at you know for your in

1248
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:39,260
terms of your source you were a garden

1249
01:00:33,290 --> 01:00:41,680
supply store or your grocery store or or

1250
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:44,300
maybe you have a favorite seed catalog

1251
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:46,069
so we have two more questions and then

1252
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:49,520
we're going to have to set it up for the

1253
01:00:46,069 --> 01:00:53,420
day from Linda can you use your stored

1254
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:56,270
potatoes for seed potatoes okay I answer

1255
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:58,640
that one previously and I indicated that

1256
01:00:56,270 --> 01:01:00,440
I prefer that you not I think that

1257
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:03,140
you're going to see a significant yield

1258
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:05,960
decline because if your potatoes have

1259
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:08,720
picked up viruses or other diseases they

1260
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:11,569
the tubers are not going to enlarge very

1261
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:14,690
much also your plants are not going to

1262
01:01:11,569 --> 01:01:18,140
look healthy and your your crop is only

1263
01:01:14,690 --> 01:01:21,079
as good as the quality of your seed okay

1264
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:23,150
and final question does the purple color

1265
01:01:21,079 --> 01:01:26,839
or whatever color disappear after

1266
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:29,150
boiling this is a great question the

1267
01:01:26,839 --> 01:01:31,040
purple if you're growing something yes

1268
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:32,690
growing something like all blue or or

1269
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:35,690
say you bought it at the farmers market

1270
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:37,940
or there are some purple ones that have

1271
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:40,970
recently come out of Colorado and I

1272
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:44,299
can't say the name of it but um if you

1273
01:01:40,970 --> 01:01:47,240
leave the skins on the purple color will

1274
01:01:44,299 --> 01:01:49,670
be retained in the flesh if you peel

1275
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:53,119
them and put them into your salted water

1276
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:56,690
or whatever then yes the potato or that

1277
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:58,819
that purple color is going to dissipate

1278
01:01:56,690 --> 01:02:03,859
and if you tried to mash them they would

1279
01:01:58,819 --> 01:02:06,380
be great if you want to retain them one

1280
01:02:03,859 --> 01:02:11,260
excellent preparation method is baking

1281
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:15,619
or microwaving and a lot of times in

1282
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:17,510
when I didn't grow the purple ones my

1283
01:02:15,619 --> 01:02:20,390
girls were little are one of our school

1284
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:23,420
colors was purple we would make purple

1285
01:02:20,390 --> 01:02:25,609
french fries and I actually would bake

1286
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:29,119
them on a baking stone effort after I

1287
01:02:25,609 --> 01:02:31,460
peeled them and then the purple color

1288
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:33,799
was retained and of course they got a

1289
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:34,910
little golden brown on the edges but but

1290
01:02:33,799 --> 01:02:37,250
you could still tell that they were

1291
01:02:34,910 --> 01:02:40,039
purple oh it sounds like fun

1292
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:42,020
well I think I'll wrap it up for the day

1293
01:02:40,039 --> 01:02:44,299

1294
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:46,369

01:02:44,299 --> 01:02:48,079
