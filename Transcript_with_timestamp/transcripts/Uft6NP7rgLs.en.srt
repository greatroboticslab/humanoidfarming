00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:06,560
hello everyone my name is brian parman

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,919
i'm the ndsu agricultural finance

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,519
specialist

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,480
uh working for the department of ag

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,880
business and applied economics and ndsu

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,039
extension and today's presentation i

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,520
want to talk a bit about backgrounding

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,240
profits and returns for fall of 2021

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,960
headed into uh 2022

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,960
and this year we're dealing with

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,679
some different circumstances than we

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,920
have in the past with respect to uh

13
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:35,600
livestock particularly cattle prices

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,120
live cattle and feeder calves as well as

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,800
feed costs

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,960
things like hay

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,120
dry distillers grains corn those kind of

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,559
things crop commodity prices a bit

19
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,640
higher this year

20
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,800
but but we've had some strong livestock

21
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,399
prices this fall and as we go through

22
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,559
this we're going to see how this is

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,879
going to work out for

24
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:59,039
feeders potentially across north dakota

25
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:02,239
and the surrounding states

26
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:05,199
so for the uh scenarios that i'm running

27
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:07,760
here and that we're kind of going by

28
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,840
um these are the price assumptions that

29
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,640
we are working from this year and this

30
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,040
is

31
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,360
quite a bit different than last year uh

32
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,560
corn for instance we're assuming about

33
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,680
575 a bushel corn silage at 55 dollars a

34
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,080
ton dry distillers grains well above 200

35
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,159
a ton at 220.

36
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,360
most of the things like limestone

37
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:32,799
limestone bag salt and premix i didn't

38
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,880
change too much but hay prices uh are

39
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,680
are quite a bit higher

40
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,560
approaching 200 a ton for alfalfa hay

41
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,320
and 125 for grass hay

42
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,560
and then the yardage fee

43
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,840
we settled in on about 40 cents a day

44
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,000
for yardage

45
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,479
part of that due to the higher energy

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,119
costs that folks are facing this year

47
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,200
with higher natural gas prices

48
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,280
fuel prices things like that as well as

49
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,719
potentially electricity costs and then

50
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,960
trucking

51
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,799
last year's assumption was about 75

52
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,960
cents per hundred weight

53
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,680
increased it quite a bit almost 66

54
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,479
percent to a dollar 25 per hundred

55
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,399
weight

56
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,120
on the other hand interest

57
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,800
slightly down to about five percent

58
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,040
assumption and then shrink and death

59
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,040
loss staying roughly about the same

60
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,200
so this is kind of the price assumptions

61
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,040
here obviously as i go through this you

62
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,440
can adjust those in your mind a little

63
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,640
bit uh if you need to

64
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,120
if you think some of those are a little

65
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,040
bit too high perhaps too low

66
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,800
that that's just sort of a good

67
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,680
benchmark that uh we feel like that

68
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,519
we're running from here and so if if you

69
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,080
think again that some of these are are

70
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,519
off uh feel free kind of to to maybe

71
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,160
make a mental note and adjust them

72
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,160
accordingly

73
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,840
so

74
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,720
this are these are the six different

75
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,160
scenarios that we are uh running through

76
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,120
and that i'll be going through during

77
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,360
this presentation and we have

78
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,680
basically three steer and three heifer

79
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,640
backgrounding scenarios

80
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,640
um

81
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,720
one of which is the uh uh one 1.8 to two

82
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,280
pounds uh average daily gain for for

83
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,080
steers uh and these these animals start

84
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,840
at 500 pounds and are sold at 800 pounds

85
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,000
and this is the feed cost under those

86
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,159
assumptions that uh i was running

87
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,200
through per day so feed costs per per

88
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,599
pound

89
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,720
then the 2.8 pound scenario slightly

90
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,400
heavier

91
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,280
purchased heavier and sold a little bit

92
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,519
heavier that's 2.8 pound average daily

93
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,720
gain that's going to be about 60 cents

94
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,120
per day

95
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,400
or 60 cents per pound under that ration

96
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,159
scenario then a much faster daily gain

97
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,159
at 3.6 pounds a day and these are

98
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,519
starting at

99
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:45,599
575 pounds all the way out to about

100
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,959
finished and that comes out at about 64

101
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,239
cents a day

102
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:52,959
heifers we start with a scenario of

103
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,920
lighter weight heifers 450 up to 750 at

104
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:59,200
72 cents a day

105
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,840
then we have a 550 weight up to 850

106
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,959
weighted across the 77 cents per day and

107
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:08,400
then a 2.8 pound average daily gain for

108
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:11,200
heifers from 525 weight to 805 pounds at

109
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,360
a feed cost of approximately 59 cents

110
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,360
per day

111
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,639
so again i'm gonna so to start with i'm

112
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,239
gonna go through the uh steer feeding

113
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,759
scenarios first

114
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:23,120
and uh

115
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,639
then i'll go through the three heifer

116
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,880
scenarios after that and then we'll

117
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:31,280
compare uh compare all six

118
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,479
so this is the prices that we uh that

119
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,400
i'm i'm using for this presentation here

120
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,240
and this came from the north dakota

121
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,560
weekly auction summary ending uh the

122
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,560
weekend november 13th which

123
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,080
this is this recording is being made on

124
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,240
the 15th so this was friday uh last week

125
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,520
um and showing the the steer prices for

126
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,240
the for the

127
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,080
various ranges of weight and then i put

128
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,400
a live steer price there assumption at

129
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,919
the bottom so for for fat cattle at

130
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,320
about 131 dollars and 40 cents at 1350

131
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:05,840
pounds was the last report i saw for

132
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:08,160
some of the uh the buyers down in in

133
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,880
dakota city kind of area so these are

134
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,880
the assumptions working from here

135
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,160
for as far as the value of the animal

136
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,560
coming into your back grounding

137
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,720
operation and then the value that you

138
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,400
would be selling at at whatever the

139
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,720
weight happens to be 750 850 pounds etc

140
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,160
and note i use the average price here i

141
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,240
don't use a high and a low i'm just

142
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,880
simply using the the average price

143
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,080
because again this is an estimation

144
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,400
uh for these scenarios

145
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,560
so this is our first scenario uh we're

146
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,960
running here and this is that 500 weight

147
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,919
to 800 weight

148
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,720
steer

149
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:47,280
at 1.8 pounds per day this is the ration

150
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,880
being fed and you'll note here on this

151
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,560
this right column where it says dollar

152
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,360
per head per day that's not dollars per

153
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,000
pound so you'll note that uh

154
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,240
it's a dollar 30 per day and we i gave

155
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,639
uh the previous chart that showed the

156
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,240
price per pound this is a

157
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,560
you know the dollar

158
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,360
cost per day versus dollars per pound

159
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,919
assuming that 1.8 pound per day

160
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,919
scenario

161
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,039
so we put it through our our

162
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,440
backgrounding budget

163
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,759
estimator and i use the north dakota

164
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,080
state university backgrounding budget

165
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,160
and make some modifications to it

166
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,960
for instance if you open up the budget

167
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,479
you see online down below the return to

168
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,720
labor and management risk you'll see all

169
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,479
these prices for feed stuffs

170
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,120
i simply didn't use that because i

171
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,240
already did the ration assumption up

172
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,000
there so

173
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,560
for the sake of this presentation i just

174
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,360
put it in as the cost and you'll see the

175
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,720
feed cost of a dollar 30 per day

176
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,720
rather than rather than going and

177
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,840
filling out each individual item within

178
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,280
the ration

179
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,520
since i already showed what the ration

180
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,400
was you can you can see that and what we

181
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,880
have here in this scenario to get to

182
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,080
approximately 800 pounds that animal is

183
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:03,520
going to be on feed for 167 days

184
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,039
and with the lot cost and the shrink and

185
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,319
the trucking

186
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,160
our uh

187
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,639
total return over labor and management

188
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,319
is about minus eight dollars

189
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,639
and the biggest reason that this one

190
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,960
actually takes a loss and and this is

191
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,680
kind of the scenario for all the steer

192
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,360
scenarios is that the the current market

193
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,520
price of

194
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,680
feeder calves steers particularly that

195
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,120
550 weight uh

196
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,520
area

197
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,520
though those animals are are bringing a

198
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,160
relatively strong price

199
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,039
so in order for someone to make any

200
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,160
money

201
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,840
on on steers that 500 550 weight they're

202
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,720
going to have to put on more

203
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,720
weight faster than than 1.8 pounds per

204
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,520
day is is just kind of what this is

205
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,840
telling you so they're on weight long

206
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,240
enough here and and it just takes too

207
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,919
long it's just too slow and so

208
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,759
essentially there just isn't a big

209
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,759
return if we're not putting on the

210
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:01,759
weight on our steers fast enough so at

211
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:03,599
1.8 pounds that that steer

212
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,160
it just isn't generating the returns at

213
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,360
167 days on feed but you'll see going

214
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,120
forward

215
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,440
this back uh backgrounding and putting

216
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,800
on the weight at least on steers and

217
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,160
heifers as well

218
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,479
is a is a profitable situation going

219
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,639
forward

220
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,919
so our next scenario

221
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,759
we're running

222
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:28,240
575 weight animals to 855 pound animals

223
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,639
and this is again is a a

224
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,200
higher rate of gain 2.8 pounds per day

225
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,680
instead of that 1.8 that i that i had in

226
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,240
the last scenario uh total feed cost per

227
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,159
day is a bit higher uh because of the

228
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,279
fact that that we're putting on more

229
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:46,399
weight um so it's a dollar 68 per head

230
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:49,920
per day on average to to get from 575

231
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:52,480
pounds to 855 pounds at 2.8 pounds per

232
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,040
day and you see here here's the ration

233
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,360
uh you know a lot of silage corn being

234
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,640
being in this ration as well as legume

235
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,920
hay and

236
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,920
some corn and ddgs

237
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:09,040
the budget here and the profitability on

238
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:12,240
a 855 waste deer or putting on 2.8

239
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,760
pounds from 575 to 855 is a fairly

240
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,000
strong

241
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:19,120
proposition we have decent decent

242
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,040
profitability numbers at 65 per head

243
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,839
and that's at that average daily gain of

244
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,399
2.8 pounds per day basically signifying

245
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,480
that being on feed less time

246
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,080
uh while still putting on the weight

247
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,720
actually pays

248
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:35,120
as far as steers go and even though the

249
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,200
feed cost is is significantly higher at

250
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,040
a dollar 68 per day because we're

251
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,560
putting on more weight they're only on

252
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,880
feed for 100 days instead of

253
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,279
approximately 167

254
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,480
and under that scenario we wind up with

255
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:51,680
a situation where we have uh

256
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,399
essentially a much stronger return and

257
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:57,279
65 dollars per head so

258
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:59,040
it just shows here that that

259
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,959
again as has been in previous

260
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,240
presentations or renditions of this that

261
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,240
i've done

262
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,480
in different scenarios and feed costs in

263
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,519
years past that it just shows that

264
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,240
putting on weight faster tends to be a

265
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,959
much more profitable proposition for uh

266
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,040
producers uh than than than leaving them

267
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,800
out there for a longer period of time as

268
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,079
yardage costs wind up

269
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,079
eating up a lot of the gains

270
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,920
so here's our final steer scenario and

271
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,120
this is basically taking them from a

272
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,399
calf at 575 pounds all the way out to

273
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,680
pretty much a fat

274
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,240
uh calf

275
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,480
and just about ready to do be

276
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:42,160
slaughtered and and this is a much

277
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:44,480
faster rate again at 3.6 pounds per day

278
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,240
and of course for that reason you're

279
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,560
looking at dollars and thirty two

280
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,560
dollars and thirty one cents per per uh

281
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,440
per head per day to to put on that kind

282
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,519
of weight

283
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:57,200
with a much of the ration coming from

284
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:59,680
silage corn and uh corn uh grain as well

285
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,839
as some ddgs and grass hay

286
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,480
but this is the the ration for for this

287
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,480
scenario

288
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,200
now

289
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,880
this is the the spreadsheet that comes

290
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,640
out there and you'll note

291
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,519
that despite the

292
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,320
higher

293
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,600
cost per day and the longer time on feed

294
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,519
because this animal is going to be on

295
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,959
feed for 95 days longer than the

296
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,360
previous example

297
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,880
uh even though we're putting on more uh

298
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,880
more weight per day we're just flat out

299
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,360
putting on more weight so it's going to

300
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,240
stay in the yard a lot longer and this

301
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,480
this

302
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,600
basically pays out to 85 and 43 cents uh

303
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,640
per head

304
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,800
so

305
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:42,640
again a decent amount of profit to be

306
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:44,640
made backgrounding this steer to to

307
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,519
basically all the way to finish

308
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,600
you'd be looking at making 85.43 ahead

309
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,079
approximately but it's also worth

310
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,519
mentioning the longer they're on feed

311
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,360
even though we're putting on the weight

312
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,639
then you run the risk of things like

313
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,320
feed costs changing or livestock markets

314
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:03,120
changing because under these scenarios

315
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,959
remember i'm assuming a fixed

316
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,839
fat cattle price

317
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,079
and

318
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,680
200 days from now fat cattle prices

319
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,200
could change they could be better or

320
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,600
they obviously could be worse so

321
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:17,120
somebody may be looking at this as a as

322
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:19,040
a possibility might want to go ahead and

323
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,800
use some of the the revenue protection

324
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,399
products buy a futures contract or

325
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,560
something like that

326
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,639
in order to uh

327
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,320
take advantage of the prices as they are

328
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,120
and ensure that there aren't going to be

329
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,120
any losses

330
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,200
so our next set of scenarios the three

331
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,360
that we're going to talk about here are

332
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,040
heifer feeding scenarios

333
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,040
and

334
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,880
these follow along similar lines to the

335
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,440
three steer scenarios we had with some

336
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,120
slight modifications

337
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,639
so here are the prices that are used for

338
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,880
the heifer feeding scenarios and they're

339
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,279
pulled from the same auction report

340
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,440
looking at uh feeder heifers

341
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:58,160
all the way from you know 300 pounds up

342
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,040
to a thousand pounds i don't have a

343
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:04,560
a fat heifer price on here because i do

344
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:06,639
not do a a finishing heifer uh scenario

345
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,680
uh in in any of the three that that

346
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,680
you'll see going forward

347
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,200
so the first scenario being done is 450

348
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:18,079
pounds so lightweight heifers up to 750

349
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,079
pounds at a relatively low average daily

350
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,720
gain you know the lower end of the

351
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,959
steers at that 1.8 pounds per day

352
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,680
and a good share of this ration coming

353
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:29,760
from silage and and a good share coming

354
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,320
from grass hay and that comes out to a

355
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,639
dollar 29.30 per day

356
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:39,480
to put on this 1.8 pounds on our heifers

357
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,480
from 450 pounds to 756.

358
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:45,440
so to achieve

359
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:47,360
uh or arrive from 450 to 756 pounds at

360
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,079
1.8 pound per day that animal is going

361
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,560
to have to be on feed for about 170 days

362
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:54,959
so quite a long time on feed for these

363
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,639
these heifers here almost as long as

364
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,519
finishing out a steer

365
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,839
all the way from 550 to to 1270

366
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,480
something pounds

367
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:08,000
uh at 3.6 pounds but you'll notice down

368
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,839
here a positive return of 36.18

369
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,199
despite the fact that they're in the lot

370
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:15,120
for quite a while at 170 days and this

371
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:17,040
feed cost and of course yardage fees

372
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,920
wind up adding up day after day after

373
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,920
day

374
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:24,800
but what we're seeing is that as far as

375
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,800
heifers go even in the in the least

376
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,600
or the slowest rate of gain scenario

377
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,480
that that's being done from the lighter

378
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,480
weight lightest weight up to 750 pounds

379
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,399
still a profitable endeavor and when

380
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,360
we're covering all of our costs here and

381
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:42,000
and and netting 36 dollars per head so

382
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,639
that's a that's a pretty strong return

383
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,800
out the gate and i've done this uh

384
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,040
presentation or similar for for the last

385
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,279
several years and typically this

386
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,519
this particular scenario is not really a

387
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,680
money maker per se or it hasn't been in

388
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,839
the past but it is this year and one of

389
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,760
the big reasons is that price gap

390
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,639
between steers and heifers when you go

391
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,240
from

392
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:07,279
550 weight up to 700 or 800 pounds is it

393
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,680
almost goes away i mean 800 850 weight

394
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:12,639
750 weight heifers are selling for

395
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,880
almost as much in a lot of cases as the

396
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,639
similar weighted steers so that price

397
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,959
gap closing

398
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,519
significantly you're winding up making

399
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:23,120
making up a lot of ground financially by

400
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,639
by putting that weight on so not only

401
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,720
are you making money putting on some of

402
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,880
the weight the cattle buyers are looking

403
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,959
for right now but you're also making

404
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:34,160
money by closing that price gap between

405
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:36,320
steers and heifers so even even the

406
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,320
this scenario here which which typically

407
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,040
i've done in the past has not yielded a

408
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:43,040
positive return it is this year at 36

409
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,440
dollars and 18 cents per per head on

410
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,440
average

411
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,480
so our next scenario it's the similar

412
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,399
it's the same daily rate of gain at 1.8

413
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,800
pounds per day but we're starting with

414
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:57,600
550 weight heifers up to 850 weight

415
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:00,160
instead of 450 to 750 like the last

416
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,320
scenario again though using

417
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,160
relying heavily on silage for our feed

418
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,800
and grass hay as well with a little bit

419
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,880
of

420
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,839
ddgs in this case

421
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,519
for a daily cost of a dollar 39 let's

422
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,320
call it a dollar 40

423
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:17,279
per day to put on that kind of weight

424
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,279
under this scenario

425
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,720
so

426
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,880
basically we are

427
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,000
putting on the same amount of weight 300

428
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,079
pounds

429
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,680
at the same average daily gain so that

430
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,199
these animals are going to be on feed

431
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,000
pretty much the same amount of time as

432
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,440
the previous scenario 170 days

433
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,160
but you'll notice

434
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,800
that the the feed cost does change but

435
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:42,560
look at our uh return to labor and

436
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:45,279
management going from uh what it was

437
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:47,759
36 37 maybe up to 40 dollars per head

438
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,920
all the way up to nearly 100 per head

439
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,079
and the reason why is the amount that's

440
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:55,040
being paid by cattle buyers for these

441
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:57,839
850 weight animals that price is really

442
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,680
strong on heifers 850 weight heifers

443
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:03,040
where the price gap between heifers and

444
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:06,160
steers is pretty much gone entirely and

445
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:08,640
so with strong prices for 850 weight

446
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,799
calves uh it's really it's really

447
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,880
reflected here in this return of a

448
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,480
hundred dollars per head so we are

449
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,520
making some money

450
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:20,480
on on on putting on on the feed on the

451
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,160
the feed end of things but really a lot

452
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,799
of this money a lot of these returns are

453
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:28,160
coming from that price uh that strong

454
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:29,919
price for 800 850 weight heifers

455
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,440
as well as steers for that matter but

456
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,000
that's that's really where the strength

457
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,400
in this is coming from and showing that

458
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,720
uh this year uh

459
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,640
compared to all others is an outstanding

460
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,799
year really to be backgrounding your

461
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,640
heifers uh and taking advantage of what

462
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,280
the market is telling you and what the

463
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,360
market is saying is that uh feedlots

464
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,919
finishers uh they're really wanting

465
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,000
these 800 850 weight caps that's that's

466
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,840
what they're they're all looking for and

467
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,799
uh they're willing to pay for it and it

468
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,799
just shows right here

469
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,240
so the final scenario uh doing with uh

470
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,480
half dealing with heifers and the final

471
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:10,000
scenario of the of the presentation is

472
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:13,600
heifers from 525 pounds to 805

473
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,080
at a at a more rapid rate of gain at 2.8

474
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,080
pounds per day so a pound more than than

475
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,200
the previous two scenarios

476
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,559
and this

477
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,320
again will be a little bit more

478
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,480
expensive per day to do because we're

479
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:27,039
putting on more weight relying heavily

480
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,280
still on silage some corn and grass hay

481
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:32,160
and then and then a bit of ddgs as well

482
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,160
for this scenario

483
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,919
and here's how this particular scenario

484
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,720
shakes out you can see that uh the

485
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:43,600
animal is on feed for fewer days instead

486
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:46,880
of 170 it's down to 100 because we're

487
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:50,000
putting on putting on the weight faster

488
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,880
the beginning value the sales prices are

489
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,080
slightly different uh and the feed cost

490
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,160
is higher

491
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,000
but you'll know that the return to labor

492
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,919
and management is actually uh the

493
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,120
highest of all three scenarios in this

494
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,160
case

495
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,000
uh

496
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,559
this showing that putting on the weight

497
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,600
uh faster does in fact pay

498
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,400
okay

499
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,720
and

500
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,039
and you'll notice that the the risk of

501
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,120
keeping of this particular scenario is

502
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:17,360
probably lower because they're on feed

503
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,799
for fewer days so you're making just as

504
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,559
much money as you did in the last

505
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:23,440
scenario but not having it but keeping

506
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:25,200
them in the yard 70 fewer days so you if

507
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,600
you think of it from a risk

508
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,760
standpoint it's less riskier the long

509
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,840
the fewer days you have them less

510
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,000
susceptible to changes in feed prices

511
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,480
because again as i make these scenarios

512
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,559
uh we're assuming consistent corn prices

513
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,320
consistent cattle prices consistent well

514
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:43,760
feed across the board

515
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,760
consistent shipping costs etc etc etc

516
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,280
and if any of those

517
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,360
you know take a turn for the worse in

518
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,039
other words feed costs go up or cattle

519
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,679
prices decline

520
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:56,320
a lot of this is is going to change um

521
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,080
and so uh the the the the faster that

522
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,000
we're able to turn this the the more

523
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,600
likely this is to come true unless

524
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,320
you're taking advantage of some of these

525
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:07,520
uh these these price protection type of

526
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:09,200
type of avenues that our producers have

527
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,760
but you can see here this is a really

528
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,159
strong indicator that that

529
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,000
backgrounding heifers this year is is a

530
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,840
is a there's a there's demand for it

531
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,679
there's demand for animals that

532
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:23,679
at that 800 to 850 pound range and that

533
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,600
that again that finishers are looking

534
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,080
for for weight being on the animals that

535
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,080
they're buying

536
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:34,000
so here are the six

537
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,320
the six scenarios that were put together

538
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,640
and uh just comparing them all side by

539
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,760
side in terms of how many days they were

540
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,640
on feed the profit and loss total per

541
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,280
head

542
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:48,799
okay and then the dollars per day profit

543
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:51,280
or loss in in the one case and here we

544
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,840
see that this this final heifer scenario

545
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,799
the 2.8 pounds per day with 100 days on

546
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,600
feed

547
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,559
that's a really strong profit margin

548
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,200
making

549
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,400
about a dollar per day per head

550
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,400
that they're out there

551
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,640
so that's that's one of the better uh

552
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,799
scenarios that i have

553
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,280
and you'll notice that while you do make

554
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:13,600
about as much money at 1.8 pounds per

555
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:17,039
day in in terms of uh

556
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,960
total profit per head uh the the the

557
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,720
dollars per day is quite different and

558
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,200
that's simply because of how many days

559
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,400
you have to keep them to get them to 100

560
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,679
uh

561
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:30,400
850 pounds at 1.8 pounds per day versus

562
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:33,440
getting them to 805 pounds at 2.8 pounds

563
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,400
per day so you can see that that daily

564
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,799
uh

565
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,840
amount of profit for the for the 2.8

566
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:41,840
pound scenario the 525 weight to 805

567
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,880
weight that's a that's a pretty strong

568
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,799
indicator that that folks are paying for

569
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,200
our producers or backgrounders to put

570
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:51,280
weight on the animals themselves

571
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,840
and steers again

572
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,840
you know they're they're pretty strong

573
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,240
there's a strong draw to do that too

574
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,720
it's just that we you got to kind of be

575
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,760
pick pick the correct scenario to to

576
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:06,559
operate under and in this case the

577
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:10,000
best dollar per day scenario is 2.8

578
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:12,320
pounds per day from 575 weight to 855

579
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,760
weight which gets you about 67 cents per

580
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,880
day on your steers

581
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,400
for a total per head of 65 dollars now

582
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,960
feeding them all the way out to finish

583
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,600
does make the most money per head on in

584
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,840
in the case of steers at 85.43

585
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,760
per head but the dollars per day is 44

586
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,240
cents because they're on feed for so

587
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,960
long you know 195 days

588
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,400
so

589
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,400
you do make

590
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,400
total total profit per annuals higher

591
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,679
but your profit per day is lower and

592
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,280
then again you got to think about the

593
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:43,120
risk in the in the 575 to 855 weight

594
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,400
category they're only on feed for 100

595
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:49,440
days in the in the 575 to finish it's

596
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,600
it's an extra 95 days to be out there to

597
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,919
run the risk of death loss and shrink

598
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,159
and all kinds of weather issues that may

599
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,679
slow the rate and and caught and wind up

600
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,919
digging into your profits a little bit

601
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,000
not to mention market situations and

602
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,240
conditions that can that can change this

603
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,240
too

604
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,400
so the key points and the key takeaways

605
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,640
that i kind of want folks to think about

606
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,480
in in this uh from this presentation is

607
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,039
that essentially cattle buyers are

608
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:20,320
paying for weight uh they are they're

609
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:23,760
looking at uh 550 weight animals versus

610
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,679
800 850 weight or even 750 pound animals

611
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,080
and saying you know we're willing to pay

612
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:31,360
up for these heavier calves simply

613
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:33,360
because there's less risk uh

614
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:36,000
corn feed prices are relatively high

615
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:39,200
right now i would rather get my lot full

616
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,159
of uh animals that are closer to to

617
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,559
being

618
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,880
taken to market to to being fat

619
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:47,919
essentially so i'm willing to pay

620
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,240
and the price gap on heifers and steers

621
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:52,799
closes pretty remarkably when you go

622
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:56,159
from those 500 and 500 pound animals up

623
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:57,919
to 850 it almost disappears entirely and

624
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,919
it makes backgrounding heifers this year

625
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,919
extremely attractive one one of the more

626
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,679
attractive options

627
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,480
in recent memory

628
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,240
is

629
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,480
or at least since i've been doing these

630
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,000
uh comparisons that

631
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,159
if there was a year to background

632
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,240
heifers and put the weight on as quickly

633
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,120
as you could this is definitely one of

634
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,200
them

635
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,520
again a lot of things can happen in

636
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,960
markets and so you know if you're going

637
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,720
to do this it may

638
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,640
may pay to take advantage of some of the

639
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,679
pricing options available

640
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,440
to you

641
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,440
but right now it definitely looks like

642
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,799
something that if you have the means to

643
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,799
do it

644
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:36,240
money can be made

645
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,240
putting weight on and back grounding

646
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,679
and then a few more key points uh

647
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:45,600
putting on weight fast still pays

648
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:46,720
even even at 5.75 corn and higher hay

649
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,240
prices

650
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,360
it seems like

651
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,360
no matter

652
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,360
i i don't want to say no matter what i'm

653
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,960
sure we can find some situations where

654
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,080
that's not the case

655
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,080
but

656
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,720
it seems like that putting on weight

657
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,400
faster typically winds up paying more

658
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,559
and and part of it's a function of how

659
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,000
these budgets are set up

660
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,679
because what winds up happening is

661
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,440
yardage fees

662
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,360
eat into your daily profits pretty

663
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,880
quickly and if you're keeping track of

664
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,760
your own time

665
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:18,080
wear and tear on machinery

666
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,799
other labor costs if you have any kind

667
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,279
of paid labor utility bills

668
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:25,679
etc etc wear and tear on your

669
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:27,440
facilities the longer the animals are in

670
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,960
there the more of that those costs add

671
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,480
up and so if if you're making money on

672
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,600
feed

673
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,520
it is always going to pay more to to

674
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,159
you know if your feed if your returns on

675
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,960
feed or are positive just just wait

676
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:45,120
versus feed it's always going to pay

677
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,960
more to to basically put the weight on

678
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,520
faster that's just kind of what these

679
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,000
scenarios show and and what's been true

680
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,320
for the last several years that and and

681
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,640
even when when i've shown a loss the

682
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:59,039
loss is smaller when you put on weight

683
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,440
faster that's just that's been the case

684
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:04,720
and and right now it is certainly true

685
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,720
as has been in the past

686
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,360
well i want to thank everyone for
