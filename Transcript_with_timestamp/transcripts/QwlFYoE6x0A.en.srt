up and delivers water directly to the

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,320
roots. Conserving both water and

9
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,720

your fields thriving during dry spells.

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,239
How about using simple soaker hoses?

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,760
They're an affordable way to ensure your

15
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,079
plants get the moisture they need

16
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,399
without breaking the bank. And don't

17
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,800
forget about mulching. It helps retain

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,640
soil moisture and keeps those weeds at

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,160
bay.

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,160
Win-win. These techniques not only save

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,239
