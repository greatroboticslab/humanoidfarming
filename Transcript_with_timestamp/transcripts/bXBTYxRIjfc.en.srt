1
00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:10,000
all right so let's um get into this um a

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,440
little bit about my background I am a

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,280
biologist by trade nothing to do with

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:18,080
plant um I worked at the DNA level at

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,320
Indiana University um I recently retired

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,240
last year um but everything I've I've

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,240
learned in terms of fruit growing and

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,680
stuff has been in the last eight years

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,439
typically through people who are doing

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,599
the growing themselves so why fix um

11
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,000
this is not something that is common

12
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,559
here in the Midwest however there is a

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,160
demand for fresh DS in the midwest um

14
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,960
especially down um where I'm from I I

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,520
lived in Bloomington Indiana Indiana

16
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,320
University and I was also a student at

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,920
Purdue um a wide diversity of folks in

18
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,879
those areas many of them coming from

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,039
California or warmer regions or

20
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:57,640
countries where figs are common and

21
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,680
people eat them every day if you want to

22
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,640
get a fresh fig here in the Midwest kind

23
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,840
of good

24
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,000
right not easy and if you do get them

25
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,560
here they've been shipped from

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,600
California or someplace else and by the

27
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,080
time they get here they've been on a

28
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,080
truck for months or weeks or whatever

29
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,520
and they're not going to be great so we

30
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,560
know that there's a demand for fresh

31
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,920
digs if you can get them to grow um you

32
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,960
can probably command a very good amount

33
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,200
of money for what you grow so it is a

34
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,960
niche market um and so our goal in this

35
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,520
project is to work out the conditions

36
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,280
where more farmers can start growing

37
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,759
fresh pigs on a small scale scale or

38
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:35,320
bigger scale and provide them to local

39
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:38,240
markets if there will be an interest

40
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:41,000
okay um the beauty of things unlike

41
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,759
other fruits and and I'm not going to

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,079
get into you know the growth of a big

43
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:48,560
and whether not it's really a fruit or

44
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:52,320
not but um if you're growing apple pear

45
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,719
Peach um Simon pawpaw whether it's

46
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,360
native or non-native you're going to

47
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:58,840
take years before that tree can give you

48
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,079
fruit all right so the beauty of fig is

49
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,039
you can actually start to get bigs on

50
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:08,599
Oney old's

51
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:11,200
trees um and if if the stars align and

52
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:13,440
the climate is great and everything is

53
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,879
is perfect you can actually get a second

54
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,720
prop which is called a breva um the the

55
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:22,640
main crop is in the summer fall mostly

56
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:25,720
towards fall um but the secondary crop

57
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:29,959
can be in the spring right the main crop

58
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:33,720
grows on um New Growth from the season

59
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:36,800
the secondary bre cop crop uh grows on

60
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:39,519
last year's growth I won't talk about

61
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,840
the breba crop very much but um I can

62
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,400
direct you to some reading if you're

63
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,400
interested in

64
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,920
thats WR way all right so about this

65
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,400
project it's a partnership um and the

66
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,680
goal in this part this this partnership

67
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,239
it it includes three farms and we're

68
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,080
looking at um the production of cold

69
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,360
hearty fig varieties there's cold cold

70
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,239
hearty and not cold hearty so there's

71
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:08,840
two kinds we're looking at zones five

72
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:10,959
and six which covers Indiana and other

73
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,120
areas in the north central region and

74
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,640
our goal is to kind of try and establish

75
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,400
the best conditions for growing those

76
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,720
figs and providing new opportunities to

77
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,159
you guys as Farmers so those are the

78
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,280
main

79
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:25,080
goals and let's talk about what cold

80
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:28,120
hearty figs really mean

81
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,159
so a cold hearty fig typically and if

82
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,560
you if you've heard of fig Chicago Hardy

83
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,360
is probably the one you've heard of the

84
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,840
most it grows beautifully you can get

85
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:39,439
fixed if everything the stars align and

86
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:43,319
you don't get an early Frost but then if

87
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:44,799
you get uh temperatures below 20 degrees

88
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:46,879
that thing is going to dive back to the

89
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,120
ground and then it just Springs back on

90
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,560
it's like a peral comes back year after

91
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,200
year

92
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,560
ideally we would like to not let it die

93
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,079
back to the ground we'd like to get

94
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:01,640
conditions where the above ground part

95
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:04,519
stays alive and gives you a jump start

96
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,120
on the next on the year's growth the

97
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:09,159
following year so that you get F more

98
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:12,560
figs and you get figs um before the

99
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:14,000
frost so that's the goal so when we talk

100
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,840
about cold hearty figs we're talking

101
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,840
about figs that

102
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,000
survive and act kind of like as a

103
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,720
perennial they'll dive back to the

104
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,360
ground they'll come back but we're also

105
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,160
going to look at trying to not get them

106
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,520
to dive back to the ground that makes

107
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,440
sense for

108
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,240
everybody all right so the three Farms

109
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,120
involved in this project um I'll just

110
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,520
call them Farm one Farm two Farm three

111
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,960
like thing one thing two thing three and

112
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,960
drus um Farm one is my place down in

113
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,680
Green County I'm in Salsbury you've

114
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,400
heard of the Tulip Trestle that's I'm

115
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,320
just like three miles down the road from

116
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:48,440
the Tulip Trestle in the railroad L of

117
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:50,680
my property um we are Zone 6B now we

118
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:54,680
were 6A we've transitioned to 6B because

119
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:56,840
it's getting warmer um Farm 2 um Mimi

120
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,400
and Evan uh you heard them speak this

121
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,400
morning about the truffles they're in uh

122
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:06,919
par

123
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:10,960
County um which is right up here um and

124
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:14,440
they are now Zone 6A you wore 5B correct

125
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:17,520
yeah and then Zone 5B all the way up in

126
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:20,639
St Joseph at the very top um we're

127
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:23,000
looking at Big growth up there as

128
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,840
well all

129
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,680
right so the project overview when we

130
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,319
wrote this grant uh we said we would do

131
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,600
it on multiple Farms that's part of the

132
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:35,960
partnership in the USDA a program um we

133
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,919
said we would focus on three three cold

134
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,440
hearty varieties the ones that we

135
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,840
finally chose were Chicago hardy which

136
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,919
is kind of the the one that everyone has

137
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:50,520
heard of the most and is probably grown

138
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:53,479
the most um the uh other one Syrian dark

139
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:56,280
and the third one Abu George um those

140
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:58,479
are all cold hearty varieties and I will

141
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:02,440
get into why we chose them in a little

142
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:05,639
bit um um and then we're testing those

143
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:09,240
both in ground and comparing that to Big

144
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:11,000
thrown in pots so those three varieties

145
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,240
growing them in ground and those three

146
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,199
varieties grown in pots so the ones in

147
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,880
the ground were winterizing them so that

148
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,199
they try to survive and don't die back

149
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:23,400
to the ground and then the one the same

150
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:27,759
ones in pots we're putting them into um

151
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:29,639
a protected uh out building or garage

152
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,400
and over win again that way a lot of

153
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,759
people do this they grow fix and pots in

154
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,360
this area especially hobbyists and pull

155
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,720
them into their garage they do need to

156
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,800
go dormant

157
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,479
um but we're looking at the we're

158
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,840
comparing the two to see if we can get

159
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:45,759
those field ones to grow and you don't

160
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,400
have to worry about dragging pots in and

161
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,840
out every year the third component that

162
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,120
we said we would look at and I'm not

163
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,400
going to talk much about this today

164
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,919
because we haven't done a whole lot on

165
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,520
this yet is looking at Living mulches

166
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:59,960
that might complement the figs so um can

167
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:03,319
we possibly get a second crop out of

168
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,680
that same space um or can we put

169
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:07,039
something in there that's going to

170
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,800
protect the soil or provide more

171
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,240
nutrients to the soil so depending on

172
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,840
your interest there's you know different

173
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:16,080
ways to approach this but we do want to

174
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:18,160
keep the soil protected um and know

175
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:22,319
maybe get another crop out of it

176
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:24,720
something that um might be worthwhile at

177
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,800
Market so the three again that we're

178
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,120
focusing on are Chicago hardy Syrian

179
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:33,599
dark Abu George um each Farm is growing

180
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:36,919
minimally four if not five of each of

181
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:39,599
those in ground and also in

182
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:41,360
pots um these were recommended To Us by

183
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,039
Darren at brambleberry Farm if you're

184
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,960
familiar with Darren um and Darren had a

185
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:47,560
number of other cold hearty ones that he

186
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,400
started to play around with and he

187
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:53,280
thought might be fun for us so he uh we

188
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,960
got several of those from him um and

189
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,400
we're just kind of testing them here and

190
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:01,440
there they're not um on all three Farms

191
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,840
across the board un Ely but um we are

192
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,360
getting a little bit of data out of

193
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,639
these as we've uh started growing them

194
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,400
Brooklyn dark Brooklyn white brown

195
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:11,000
turkey that's probably the other one

196
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:15,800
that people have heard of the most

197
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,840
Gino's black um Lula LSU gold it was

198
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,879
created I believe at LSU University or

199
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,919
Lis

200
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,879
University magbar Hardy which Darren

201
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:28,400
believes is probably Chicago hardy but

202
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:33,360
there's a story behind it um Magnolia

203
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:35,479
Rond de Bordeaux sunflower and Viet de

204
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,839
bordo so let's start with the inground

205
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:40,919
fig what did we do so we uh Darren

206
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:43,560
rooted sign messenger if you're not

207
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:47,800
familiar with what that is is when the

208
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:50,959
figs go dormant you collect um Twigs off

209
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:53,120
of them usually oneye old growth and

210
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:56,440
then for figs you can actually root

211
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:59,600
those in sand or a combination of sand

212
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,920
and perite or sand and Peete Moss they

213
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,000
root very easily and then you start a

214
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,440
whole new tree that way so Darren did

215
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,560
this for us last

216
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,160
winter and we obtained those from him in

217
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:14,279
April of this past

218
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:16,240
year we got them planted the first

219
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:18,480
weekend in June which is a little late

220
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,880
but because the project wasn't awarded

221
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,800
until um later in the spring we had to

222
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,640
go with what we could do um so we

223
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,360
planted them the first weekend in June

224
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,600
and we planted them with a lot of

225
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,560
compost each Farm got a little a little

226
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,440
bit different amounts of compost and

227
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:38,600
that was based solely on how we dug the

228
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:41,360
holes so my farm farm one we don't have

229
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,959
a tractor we don't have mechanical stuff

230
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,640
we dug our holes by hand um so we did

231
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:50,079
not dig them very deep um and we didn't

232
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:52,880
put a lot of compost in Mimi and Mimi's

233
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:54,480
farm farm two and the farm farm three

234
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,160
they mechanically dug their holes so

235
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,640
their holes were deeper um and so a lot

236
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,839
more compost went into those holes just

237
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:05,240
kind of by

238
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:07,480
default mulching we uh or covering the

239
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:10,440
soil the bare soil that was there we did

240
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,240
that various ways my farm on Farm one we

241
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,600
put down a ton of cardboard and wood

242
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,800
chips so that we weren't um getting a

243
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:20,079
lot of weeds and that we were keeping

244
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:24,079
the soil um from being Fried by the this

245
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:28,200
the hot sun uh Mimi you guys did wood

246
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:30,200
chips and straw or straw wood chips for

247
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,519
for um

248
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:36,079
the mulching straw was for for the

249
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:40,040
winter yeah and then Farm three they use

250
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:41,800
landscape fabric up there watering

251
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,079
typically weekly but you know we had a

252
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,839
drought last year and so in some cases

253
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:48,200
we were watering a little more

254
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:51,360
frequently the original goal in the

255
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:54,399
project was to grow all of these trees

256
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:57,480
upright um so that we could then cage

257
00:10:54,399 --> 00:11:00,360
them and protect them in the winter um

258
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,959
however between the time the Grant was

259
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:06,320
um awarded or actually around the time

260
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:09,600
it was awarded Mimi went to Japan and

261
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,240
was able to see some um installations

262
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,160
where they're growing figs in an

263
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:16,200
espalier or Cordon style which means

264
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,600
you're training them and in this case

265
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,480
they're being trained to load to the

266
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,079
ground in a horizontal way so that you

267
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:26,000
can protect them a little bit more and

268
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:28,519
they they can benefit from um the soil

269
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,120
or the Earth as a thermal mass in the

270
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:32,600
winter time

271
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,040
um like a step

272
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:37,519
overhead no so we'll get into what this

273
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,240
looks like in a second yeah so Farms one

274
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,399
and two my farm and n's Farm um are

275
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,399
using this different support system than

276
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,560
what we originally said we would do farm

277
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:50,320
three is sticking with the original

278
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:52,760
upright um support system that we'll go

279
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:57,519
into so this is what the Cordon system

280
00:11:52,760 --> 00:12:00,959
looks like so um basically we have taken

281
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:03,680
and um hammered down down in a pipe it

282
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,200
could be either aluminum or steel um

283
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,160
down two feet into the ground leaving

284
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,519
one foot above the ground and then um

285
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,360
running a horizontal aluminum pipe down

286
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:15,079
the

287
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:17,519
row and then planting

288
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:19,880
um two

289
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,560
figs water bottle in my phone these are

290
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:24,399
two figs planting them with in a foot of

291
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:27,199
each other letting them grow up and then

292
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,399
letting them train this way along the

293
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:32,639
pole

294
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:34,399
so you're getting bigs coming up

295
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,480
training them to go horizontally away

296
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,320
from each

297
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:41,399
other and Loosely tying them down not

298
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,079
touching the aluminum pipe but just

299
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:44,040
tying them down so they start to train

300
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:46,360
once they're

301
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:48,279
trained um you don't need that pipe

302
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:52,600
really technically anymore but it'll

303
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:54,480
probably stay there for long it um and

304
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,360
then you plant two that way and then

305
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,240
eight later you plant another two So

306
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,480
eventually two coming up are going to

307
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,519
meet each other at some point point but

308
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,360
we'll keep them pruned and trained so

309
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,720
that they're not um interfering with

310
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:10,320
each other we're also if you'll notice

311
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:13,160
so you see cattle panel off to the right

312
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,440
um we put cattle panel both on either

313
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:18,160
side of the figs eventually to protect

314
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,440
them from Deer this also serves to help

315
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,839
us when we do the winterization this was

316
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:25,680
probably the most expensive part of the

317
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:27,839
project but it's a one andone once you

318
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,560
do it you don't have to do it again the

319
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,800
panels come down very easily so if you

320
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:35,360
want to get in and weed or pick figs um

321
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,839
they're 8ot cattle panel and you just

322
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,160
tie them down you know tie them to the

323
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,560
to the uh the chost you could just

324
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,399
easily take those down and get in there

325
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:47,120
and work with the

326
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:49,760
pigs any questions about

327
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,600
this so just give a little plug here so

328
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,800
this is an example on the right of what

329
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:58,600
a cordon fig looks like so this is one

330
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:01,279
that Dr Lee Reich has um uh posted in

331
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,759
his book growing figs in cold climates

332
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:05,680
um it's a very easy read if you're

333
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:08,279
interested uh but he has grown one of

334
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,839
his figs low to the ground um you can't

335
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:11,519
see it in this picture he did not use an

336
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,440
aluminum pipe to train it along he

337
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,440
actually just bent it over and secured

338
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,880
it down to the ground there's cheap and

339
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,720
easy ways you can do this um and this

340
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:22,680
one's probably been there for quite a

341
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:25,560
while but then you can see new Season's

342
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,399
growth shooting upwards about every

343
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,440
couple

344
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,560
inches and the idea is that fix start to

345
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,240
grow on that new growth every

346
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,759
year and so you get multiple places and

347
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,639
it's easy to go in and just quickly pick

348
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:38,639
those sticks as they

349
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:50,560
grow all D or what

350
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,279
what's they're in in Big World I'm wrong

351
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,839
I don't think there's any dwarf or semi

352
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:57,240
dwarf pigs so do all the same yeah yeah

353
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:59,600
and you just you're prone and train as

354
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,920
you need it won't if you just let them

355
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,160
go they're going to get maybe 15t tall

356
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,279
oh really and they'll look like a big

357
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,639
bush Okay um we'll do the same thing on

358
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:15,279
the on

359
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:15,279
the go 15 they could training for

360
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:34,240
time you know so if they are in a high

361
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,880
tunnel you suspend those new growths the

362
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,000
stems from the

363
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:44,440
ceiling yes

364
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:48,079
yes um in terms of D Scott the third F

365
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,079
uh he do

366
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:06,319
so and that's true for any fruit tree

367
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,680
you can you can train a regularly sized

368
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:10,639
fruit tree to be dwarf it's a lot of

369
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:13,160
pruning so if you stay on top of the

370
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:16,560
pruning you can you can manage a tree

371
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:18,480
and keep it keep it small okay I've seen

372
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:21,440
you know I've seen people growing apple

373
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:25,399
trees in a pot for 20 years and they

374
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:28,959
stay small so yeah and you you sourced

375
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:31,279
your um actual starts I guess brand be

376
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:34,199
from brambleberry brambleberry yeah

377
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:36,519
brambleberry Farm in P Indiana um if you

378
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:38,240
Google them you'll find them Darren is

379
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:40,720
free own that they will not ship you

380
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,800
have to go visit and it's worth the

381
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,680
visits not been to their place um it's a

382
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:48,839
lovely place to visit because they grow

383
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,839
all sorts of cool things down

384
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:56,079
there those all came from

385
00:16:51,560 --> 00:17:00,319
anars and I I'm happy to share that

386
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,319
information I'll give youil

387
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,720
all right let's turn to the Potted F fix

388
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,640
so again we want to compare inground

389
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,199
versus

390
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,760
potted um so we did pretty much the same

391
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:12,000
thing what the same size plants oneyear

392
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:15,120
old or slightly less that had been

393
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,199
rooted by by Darren at brambleberry we

394
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:21,079
he got we got them in small pots about a

395
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,480
four to a liter in size um we kind of

396
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:25,000
kept them in those small pots to get

397
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,120
them well established um probably kept

398
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,559
them a little too long but we hit that

399
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:32,400
drought in the summer and so it just

400
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,440
it was kind of a half dozen or the other

401
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,840
we ended up up potting them to 10 gallon

402
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,480
pots in early

403
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,360
August

404
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:43,000
um we I did not mulch I don't think you

405
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:44,520
mulched them did you put any wood chips

406
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,160
or anything on top not initially not

407
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,760
initially yeah um but we will definitely

408
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,520
be doing that this year you could do

409
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:53,360
wood chips you could do leaf mulch um

410
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,520
anything to kind of keep a lot of

411
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,440
evaporation from happening um that way

412
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,760
you can keep your watering down a little

413
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,039
bit and then we watered weekly or is

414
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,320
needed just like with the inrs no

415
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:05,919
support system at the moment um if we

416
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:10,200
want them to grow really tall we could

417
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:11,440
add um some sort of U like a bamboo post

418
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,760
or something in there to kind of help

419
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,760
stabilize those but again you can you

420
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,720
can prune and manage them and keep them

421
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:21,400
small and it depends on your

422
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:22,960
goal do they require a lot of water as

423
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:27,400
well you

424
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:31,200
know um I was watering mine so mine was

425
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,679
on the west side of an out building so

426
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,640
it wasn't on the south side it was on

427
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:37,039
the west side and so it did get some

428
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:41,440
morning shade I think I was watering

429
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:43,679
maybe a gallon once or twice a week each

430
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,679
of

431
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:59,600
those mine was on the west mine was on

432
00:18:55,039 --> 00:19:02,360
the west side of an building so it was

433
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:05,280
not getting Morning Sun um they were

434
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:08,480
finally getting Sun about um 11:00 or

435
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:12,760
noon they did do really

436
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:15,919
well yours is in full correct yeah yeah

437
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:19,840
yeah and I looking at yours versus m

438
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,840
suffer a little more

439
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,520
and that is one thing with with the Paw

440
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:37,760
I mean they're great in theory because

441
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,400
they're mobile and you can move them

442
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:43,200
around but if you go on vacation or if

443
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,240
you ignore them or you forget about them

444
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,320
you know they could suffer and so that's

445
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,799
one of the reasons why I think it's

446
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,520
really important that they get covered

447
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:51,960
with something like wood mulch I can

448
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:55,480
also tell you I have outdoor working

449
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:58,480
cats um and they love it as a litter box

450
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,480
so

451
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:05,200
um so yeah so this year I will

452
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,559
definitely be covering mine so that The

453
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,919
Cats won't get into it and it won't be

454
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,880
this moisture loss and those pots are

455
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:13,280
just plastic pots or they're yeah

456
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:17,360
they're heavy industrial molded plastic

457
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,360
pots get them from Amazon I think they

458
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:25,880
were remember what we paid I would say

459
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,880
for 20 pots it was like $10 a

460
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,640
pot and dra yes yeah

461
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,480
but they're not they're just about the

462
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:40,280
right size so if

463
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,960
you I let mine almost dry out or get you

464
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,679
know low moisture so I can pick them up

465
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,760
and move them but you know that's a lot

466
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,840
on your back so you could easily take a

467
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,720
dolly and Slide the dolly in and roll

468
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,200
them from place to place as long as

469
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,480
you've got something to roll that Dolly

470
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,919
on so that's do

471
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:00,520
that there's

472
00:20:56,919 --> 00:21:03,400
a a plant shot Nursery not far from

473
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:04,840
where we live they also do landscaping

474
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,240
and in the back of it they have what

475
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,960
they call a graveyard and that's where

476
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:11,320
they put all the pots that they from

477
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,320
their landscaping and anybody can go in

478
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:16,600
and again with no charge oh nice so that

479
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,600
might be

480
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,360
something all right so let's talk about

481
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,640
buling um

482
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,320
so one of the goals in the project that

483
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,559
we said we would do was try to explore

484
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:34,240
some living mulches um or perhaps a

485
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:37,480
secondary crop that help keep that bare

486
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,400
soil from uh drying out and and and

487
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,400
losing

488
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,039
nutrients um we have not really explored

489
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,559
that too much and if you thought what I

490
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,640
said earlier all of us kind of did

491
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:50,080
something a little bit different so um

492
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:52,120
my farm the inground uh figs got

493
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:55,000
cardboard couple layers of cardboard

494
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:58,360
followed by um mulch that I just got at

495
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,039
the local Nursery so it's a it was aged

496
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,440
um

497
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:04,720
uh wood mulch uh Mimi used mulch

498
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:06,720
originally um we'll talk about what we

499
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,320
did for winter mulching and protection

500
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,919
that's a little bit different with chip

501
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,880
mul we also planted the made of

502
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:16,799
strawberry oh on one end okay just to

503
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:20,480
see what happened and it it's there it

504
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:24,720
grows and it it's it pretty much

505
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:28,520
withstands like foot traffic um so I I

506
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:30,840
it was just a test right so as a as a

507
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:33,400
has a ground cover ground cover just to

508
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,400
deter

509
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:41,159
weed and I may consider on my property

510
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:45,039
putting in mint or another herb that's

511
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:47,039
more aromatic that will heat graab away

512
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:51,039
um and I do a lot

513
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:55,880
of later but um so another possibility

514
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:59,720
is an herb that might help protect um

515
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,919
and also keep some away

516
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:04,320
winterization let's talk about

517
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:05,600
winterization so um we have to protect

518
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,559
them in Winter and again one of our

519
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,000
goals to see if we can keep those sticks

520
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:12,039
from dying back to the

521
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,799
ground Darren all of his figs down at P

522
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:15,320
he never does any winterization and he

523
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:16,880
says all of them die back to the ground

524
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:19,240
so that's kind of our starting point

525
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,400
there um I do know people who have

526
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,559
winterized their cold their Chicago

527
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:27,679
Hardies and had some success at keeping

528
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:29,600
them from dying back um what we're doing

529
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,400
on Farm one and two again we're using

530
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,840
that Porton system so we're growing

531
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:36,720
those figs low to the ground that's

532
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,840
taking advantage of the thermal mass of

533
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,640
the Earth which means they're going to

534
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:42,679
stay a little bit warmer for a little

535
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,279
bit longer down close to the ground and

536
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:46,360
then we're covering them with a ton of

537
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:48,520
straw you'll see a picture of this in

538
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:52,520
the moment

539
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:55,360
um for 16 figs that I had in a row it

540
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:59,000
took 10 to 12 bales of straw to give you

541
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,799
an idea to cover those Farm three

542
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,360
they took a different approach they used

543
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:06,320
burlap um I'm wrong here in saying wire

544
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,880
cages they didn't use wire cages I'll St

545
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,840
about what they used and they used some

546
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,919
leaf mulch to protect we'll show you

547
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,520
pictures of what they did and then the

548
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,679
pots they got moved into an indoor space

549
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:19,080
you can let these figs stay out they can

550
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:21,080
they can handle a frost they can handle

551
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:25,080
multiple Frosty frosts they just can't

552
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:28,840
handle extended periods below 20° so all

553
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:31,240
of us left our P our potted figs outside

554
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:32,960
until late November early December and

555
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,279
that's when you do the you really want

556
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,960
them out there because you want them to

557
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:38,640
go dormant the figs need to go through a

558
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:42,159
dormy period so you want them to kind of

559
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:44,720
be um exposed to those cold temperatures

560
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,080
so they lose their leaves and they go

561
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,480
into that dormant phase and then you

562
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:52,080
pull them inside or protect

563
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:54,840
them so inground this is what the ingr

564
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:57,799
ones look like on Farm one and two um

565
00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:00,919
you can see we've got mult couple rows

566
00:24:57,799 --> 00:25:02,240
here and the cat cattle panels are down

567
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:05,240
for the moment so they could get in

568
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,760
there and cover those figs with straw um

569
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:11,320
and again you want to just cover them as

570
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:13,440
much as possible um I learned um that

571
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:15,640
straw settles with time especially when

572
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,080
you get snow so you want to put way more

573
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,679
straw than you think you need it's going

574
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:22,000
to settle through time

575
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,799
um it didn't take as long as I thought

576
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,159
it would and I also had um my nieces and

577
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:30,120
nephews help me and the fun family

578
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:32,880
project uh um so it didn't really take

579
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:35,120
long to do it we just got them covered

580
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:38,480
um and then they just stay there all

581
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:41,520
winter long Shing a little nap Farm

582
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,720
three um they approach theirs a little

583
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,080
bit differently so they've got the

584
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,559
landscape fabric they did if you see the

585
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:51,120
top left photo they first kind of

586
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:55,640
wrapped the fs first a little bit um

587
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:58,360
with some burlap and then they um used

588
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:01,640
tar paper which is the roofing stuff

589
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:04,679
it's it's um used for roofs and it's in

590
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,840
permeable terrain they used they used a

591
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:08,440
couple toost and they just kind of

592
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:10,399
wrapped it around the toost put tons of

593
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:13,960
leaves down in there and then wrapped

594
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:16,559
again with burlap you'll see that um

595
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:18,440
Carry there on at the bottom left she's

596
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,320
wrapping with burlap over the taret

597
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,080
paper and then the final step is put a

598
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,919
bucket on top but you're not getting ton

599
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:29,120
of ring there are those pred down before

600
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:33,440
they wrapped them um did you say pruned

601
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:35,039
pruned yes cut down yes I don't think so

602
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,159
um we'll talk about how much growth they

603
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:39,640
had eventually in if they in future

604
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,679
years they might have to yeah because

605
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:44,840
this is first year this first

606
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:48,039
year yeah they they will get into this

607
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:50,080
but um here their Farm I think um I'll

608
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:54,440
show you the tallest one how tall it got

609
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:56,640
but it didn't get above those two posts

610
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:58,360
so all right so what did we observe

611
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,679
these first five months I really did not

612
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:02,880
expect I mean we were just hoping that

613
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:05,159
everything would survive simple you're

614
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,080
one get everything to to survive but we

615
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:09,640
did I did do some observations on growth

616
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,320
um we did kind of check here and there

617
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,799
for disease and pest pressure and then

618
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,520
of course we didn't really expect to get

619
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:17,799
figs but we were kind of surprised so

620
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:22,760
we'll talk about

621
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:27,120
that all right so growth in year one so

622
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:31,600
those figs started out about this tall

623
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:34,960
okay um um this is Mimi uh she's on Farm

624
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:39,159
2 Zone 6A this was the tallest fig uh in

625
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:42,440
in the group um this was the LSU gold

626
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:44,760
fig um and so there was a ton of growth

627
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:47,120
on that particular tree most of the

628
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:49,399
trees depending on where they were in

629
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:53,279
the plots grew anywhere from 2 feet to

630
00:27:49,399 --> 00:27:56,559
four feet um in one year's

631
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:58,799
time uh the picture on the right is Farm

632
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:03,840
three and I believe that was the tallest

633
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:06,399
F that they had um on on their plot of

634
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:10,840
16 quite one year right because this is

635
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:14,840
in like early late summer yes yeah so

636
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:19,760
this is went in brown on June first week

637
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:25,159
yep and yeah so they grow fast that's a

638
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:27,159
plus um and so uh this this year I'll go

639
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:29,080
through and do a very um careful

640
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:31,880
analysis of how much grow on each

641
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:33,720
variety so I I was seeing some uh some

642
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:37,279
differences um and I'll kind of mention

643
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:40,080
those here in a second um I in zone in

644
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:42,760
zone 6B Farm one I had the least amount

645
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,240
of growth as everybody which is kind of

646
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:46,080
in a way surprising but maybe not

647
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:49,080
because a I didn't use as much compost

648
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:54,320
as the other two farms and B mine was in

649
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:57,159
a really lazing hot field and so I'm

650
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:59,799
thinking that I may consider in the

651
00:28:57,159 --> 00:29:02,200
future using maybe a 30% shade cloth

652
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:06,200
during the really hot months just to to

653
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,200
give them a little bit of a break we'll

654
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:13,279
see was that in the system where you

655
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:17,240
were trying

656
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:20,279
to before it it was before we before you

657
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:24,039
yeah this is kind of late summer and it

658
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:28,159
wasn't until fall like before the winter

659
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:30,480
that really started training to yes so

660
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:35,760
get them a good growth before this is

661
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:38,799
the tree not shoot off right so IDE

662
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:41,960
start well this is like you know the

663
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:45,799
first few months so I started training

664
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,799
after start training in the

665
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:51,000
fall

666
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:53,320
yeah yeah somewhere in there and then we

667
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,039
started I think we started training TI

668
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,320
it was cold when I started tying them

669
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:59,120
down start cold so they're really

670
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,559
flexible yeah yeah they're pretty

671
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,480
flexible so you know I I think you tie

672
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:05,440
them down to where you think you know it

673
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:07,840
feels pretty good and I use cotton by

674
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,600
the way all cotton just

675
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:12,760
spray and then and then like you come

676
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,760
back a week later or two you can tie it

677
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:17,760
down even tighter because you know you

678
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,760
trained Stu

679
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:30,640
give just the compost

680
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:32,559
and what do they

681
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,720
require they're pretty I think they're

682
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:36,480
pretty forgiving um we have not done

683
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:40,519
soil test that's something I should have

684
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:42,080
done last year we I'll do this um and I

685
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:45,240
I'll actually give you a little bit of

686
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:47,200
insight so um on me so Mimi has the most

687
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:49,480
figs um there's kind of a story behind

688
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,559
that I won't go into but um Farm one and

689
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:55,240
farm three we have 16 figs in ground

690
00:30:51,559 --> 00:31:00,159
Mimi that iot 4 or something like

691
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:02,200
that yeah okay yeah she's got a lot so

692
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:05,279
she's got the both of the Oddball ones

693
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:08,399
that we have um but on the space that we

694
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:11,039
planted those in I noticed pretty

695
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:15,360
quickly and I'll show this to you in a

696
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:17,919
easier thing um figs at one part of the

697
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:20,279
property are growing really well at the

698
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:22,960
other end they the growth was really

699
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:25,760
short sted and we do know if there was a

700
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:28,919
house or a building on that place yeah

701
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:33,159
so yeah this was the hill to hill now

702
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:35,440
yeah um and it had old house that yeah

703
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:38,799
I've never seen the house it was already

704
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,679
destroyed all it had was like concrete P

705
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:44,080
left or whatever so we were going to do

706
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:47,919
the WAP that's what happened right and

707
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:52,120
the price like okay so all this is

708
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:56,120
planted on top of that hill without

709
00:31:52,120 --> 00:32:00,559
any uh admendment to the soil other than

710
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:05,600
the compost where we the that was just

711
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:05,600
and so to see this grow

712
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:11,240
right I'm thinking that the area that

713
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,480
you had the least amount of growth was

714
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:15,559
probably where the main part of the

715
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:17,559
house might have been sit the both ends

716
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:19,000
so it's really hard for me to say that

717
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:21,720
okay you would think the house was more

718
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,320
Central for some reason that's yeah I

719
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,880
don't know and I say that because I have

720
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:27,440
black wall not planting we pl we had an

721
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,840
old house sitting down and we can we

722
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,279
knew where the house was CU we were the

723
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:32,120
ones who took it down we put black

724
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:35,360
walnuts and you can tell exactly where

725
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:38,240
that house was because those trees are

726
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,960
5T and the ones in the perimeter where

727
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,720
the house wasn't they're now

728
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:45,200
20t so you can tell there's a huge

729
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,440
difference in what the soil was I mean I

730
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,679
sat there for over 100 years so um

731
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:53,320
interesting so oh now that you mention

732
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:55,159
one so we cleared that entire Hillside

733
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:57,840
or the hill thinking we're gon to put in

734
00:32:55,159 --> 00:33:00,760
a wall of paint right so they basically

735
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:04,559
raised all of the trees and leaves

736
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:05,799
whatever was in there and there was a

737
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:12,399
huge

738
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:12,399
Walnut W on the North side and actually

739
00:33:15,639 --> 00:33:18,880
Matthew lot of

740
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:29,240
wals yeah it's possible there yeah so

741
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:29,240
they may resist

742
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:48,600
don't know we still have

743
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:48,600
around yeah we got

744
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:57,919
that so disease and pest pressure so um

745
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,960
I mean pretty this is first year so it's

746
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,320
really hard to say um I think the

747
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:03,080
biggest thing that we battled was the

748
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,880
drought you know keeping things from

749
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:08,879
frying and that just required a little

750
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:11,399
extra water here there um I never saw

751
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:13,520
any um I mean we got them in late so I

752
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:16,440
think we kind of missed the Japanese

753
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:20,879
beetle phase um did that how that

754
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:22,960
coincide for you yeah no it overlapped

755
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:25,760
because we got them in yeah it was

756
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:28,839
directly at the same time as the Japan

757
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:32,359
be Japanese beetles in our field

758
00:34:28,839 --> 00:34:34,119
this the pigs they they didn't seem to

759
00:34:32,359 --> 00:34:36,320
like them or something thank goodness

760
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:38,639
they didn't go up to Fig Hill so I mean

761
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,480
they're kind of close by but I don't

762
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:43,320
know we'll just have to

763
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:45,000
see that's interesting so then the next

764
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,480
question is Big production so in theory

765
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,320
oh go

766
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:53,639
ahead I so I'm assuming that the bigs

767
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:56,359
currently are still covered up yes so

768
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:59,320
you really couldn't report on

769
00:34:56,359 --> 00:35:01,839
like B

770
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:05,920
I'll talk about

771
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:07,040
that very good question um so before we

772
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,040
get to that let's talk about fig

773
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:12,240
production So in theory first year figs

774
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:15,160
should give

775
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,240
um should give fix however considering

776
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,960
that we didn't get these until the first

777
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,599
weekend in June I point I don't think

778
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,560
either one of us really expected to get

779
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:25,760
F right fix at

780
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:27,720
all we did we got things so um all three

781
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,960
of the main ones Chicago hardy Syrian

782
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:31,320
dark Abu

783
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:35,359
George I observed figs on all of those

784
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:38,359
at Mimi's place um on my place I had a

785
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:41,160
couple figs on Syrian dark um and I

786
00:35:38,359 --> 00:35:44,280
think Farm 3 got a couple figs as well I

787
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:45,839
don't know which one they got it was

788
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,880
like me they didn't get that many so we

789
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:50,359
didn't really document that too well

790
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:52,160
Mimi's place she also had figs on

791
00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:56,680
Brooklyn dark Brooklyn white brown

792
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:58,560
turkey Gino's black Lillo LSU gold and

793
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:00,480
the Magmar Hardy

794
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:04,520
the uh Magnolia is not in her place it's

795
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:06,680
in my place in a pot no figs um Ronda

796
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:08,760
Bordeaux sunflower and vet they were all

797
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:11,640
at one end and that's one of the areas I

798
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:13,160
think it's the soil um so they didn't

799
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:15,000
grow nearly as much and they also didn't

800
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:17,200
produce very many figs so there could be

801
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,280
something with the soil there that we

802
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:23,160
need to um check on a little bit closer

803
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:25,920
um the Potted figs I don't think any of

804
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:28,480
the Potted figs or potted fig trees

805
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:31,680
produce figs

806
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:34,640
so that's something worth noting as well

807
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:37,800
and were they planted pots did you just

808
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:39,800
use um compost or what kind of soil we

809
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,280
used to be kind of across the board

810
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,839
something that we all had access to we

811
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:49,040
just went to Menards and we bought um

812
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:54,440
The Miracle Grow organic and another one

813
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:59,359
just potting soils ra bed bed soils okay

814
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:59,359
so a question for you on the

815
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:04,160
there's a there's a variety I really

816
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:07,319
want to grow but it's I've avoided it

817
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:11,640
because it's Zone 8 n do you know the

818
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:15,040
zones on these and are any of them like

819
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:18,280
specifically a higher Zone that you

820
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:21,000
actually got fruit on um so all of these

821
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:23,280
are considered quote unquote cold hardy

822
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,720
so that they they've been tested they

823
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,720
you know hobby Growers have been growing

824
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,119
them in these scolder climat okay they

825
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:31,599
might not be

826
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:34,560
zon 89 used to I just want that tiger

827
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:36,359
pach one yeah that's really cool looking

828
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,680
but I it just seemed like a waste of

829
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:39,920
money if I knew it was gonna die if you

830
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:42,760
have the ability to bring it into a

831
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,240
garage it's well worth it okay um

832
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,359
there's a guy here in

833
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:49,920
Indianapolis um who grows 50 different

834
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:53,240
varieties on his little Urban plot and

835
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:56,280
he pulls them into a garage every winter

836
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:59,440
and he get Fs on all of them so all

837
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,440
po yes

838
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:03,839
y yeah you different varieties so you

839
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:06,040
could definitely do that if you want to

840
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:08,800
bring it inside I mean one's okay I'm

841
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:10,400
not sure

842
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:14,359
right

843
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:16,680
yeah on it but I I I'm not as familiar

844
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:18,800
with these warmer growth ones but they

845
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:20,839
probably need to go through a slight D

846
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,960
SC check

847
00:38:20,839 --> 00:38:26,079
that all right so here's the Fig I look

848
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:28,599
like okay

849
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:30,200
um one of things that I know Mimi did

850
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:31,920
when she started to see the figs and it

851
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:35,000
was getting really late in the fall you

852
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,560
know to kind of enhance rening she

853
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,200
actually plucked a lot of the leaves off

854
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:41,560
so they get more

855
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:44,200
sun um Lee Reich in his book talks about

856
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:46,160
you can enhance potentially Quicken the

857
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:49,960
ripening by putting a little drop of oil

858
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:51,520
on the eye so you can see you know like

859
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,880
olive oil or something right there at

860
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,960
that little point that little eye that

861
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:57,720
supposedly is supposed to help enhance

862
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:01,560
the ripening

863
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:03,839
um but yeah she got fresh shs so that's

864
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,839
pretty

865
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:10,119
cool so let's talk um a little bit about

866
00:39:08,359 --> 00:39:14,440
thinking outside the box so if you ever

867
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:16,720
write a USC Grant or any Grant

868
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:19,119
whatsoever I've been writing grants for

869
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,839
a long time in my capacity at NIU you

870
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:23,359
always want to think what if what if

871
00:39:20,839 --> 00:39:25,000
this doesn't work what can be salvaged

872
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:26,400
from this because people who are

873
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,599
reviewing grants and they're going to

874
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,920
give you money they want to know that

875
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:33,839
it's worth something in some form

876
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:35,200
fashion whether it's education or can

877
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:37,560
you get something else out of this and

878
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,560
so when we wrote this grant we really

879
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:41,960
kind of thought about outside the box

880
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:45,119
what happens if we do all of this and we

881
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:46,720
just can't get a lot of right things you

882
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:49,480
know we don't want Farmers to go through

883
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:51,160
all of this and all of a sudden say gosh

884
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:53,200
you know I invested all this money I did

885
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:55,880
all this work and now I have nothing to

886
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:59,040
take to Market so thinking outside the

887
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:01,319
box um we in the grant that we would

888
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:03,000
look at some other value added things

889
00:40:01,319 --> 00:40:04,520
that could come out of these figs even

890
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,200
if you didn't get right

891
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:10,839
figs or didn't get very many rights so

892
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:15,040
it turns out that you can make some

893
00:40:10,839 --> 00:40:16,920
value outed products from um fig trees

894
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:19,200
whether you get ripe or unripe figs or

895
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:22,560
none at all so you can definitely make

896
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:25,119
Jam jams from Ripe figs if you are

897
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:27,359
familiar with uh Dylan Farm they make

898
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:29,119
something called the Frog Jam which is

899
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:33,359
is fig

900
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:35,920
Orange uhr Raspberry G I think it's

901
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:38,200
grape so they blend three different

902
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:40,440
fruits and make this fantastic Jam if

903
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:42,280
you've not tasted it I highly recommend

904
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,359
uh going to your grocery store and

905
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,960
looking for

906
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:49,680
dilman you can also it turns out make

907
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:51,760
jams from unrip figs and so this is one

908
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:55,240
of those uh made me collected a bunch of

909
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:57,880
unrip figs froze them down um I just got

910
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:59,280
them from her yesterday or today

911
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:01,800
and I'm going to go play around with

912
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:05,319
some recipes I I know of one farm that

913
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:07,040
has made um jam from unrip figs so I'm

914
00:41:05,319 --> 00:41:09,000
going to play around with that and see

915
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:11,359
what that comes out to be okay but

916
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,160
that's definitely a possibility you can

917
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:17,200
make teas turns out figs whether it's

918
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:19,119
the figs or the leaves are highly highly

919
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,160
nutritional there's a lot of vitamins in

920
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:24,560
them a lot of

921
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:26,880
antioxidants um I can direct you to

922
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:30,240
research uh published papers on that if

923
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:31,960
you're interested um you can have you

924
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:35,480
can make a fig leaf tea of just the Fig

925
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:39,480
leaves Alone um I know me you love just

926
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:42,119
plain fig leaf tea um I collected fig

927
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:45,720
leaves off of these figs and I blended

928
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:46,960
them with some herbal uh dried herbal uh

929
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,240
things that are often used in peas

930
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,960
you're going to get to taste that today

931
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:56,760
um so there's definitely a market there

932
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:58,960
um I talked to um a woman who owns a um

933
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:02,119
she owns an Apothecary but she also has

934
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:05,319
a wild food uh bar in Greenwood it's

935
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:07,839
it's open to the public and they make um

936
00:42:05,319 --> 00:42:12,040
they make drinks and they make uh soups

937
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:13,839
and things out of either wild Foods or

938
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:17,160
herbales and I

939
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:18,920
said if we had farmers who could Supply

940
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:21,599
you with fig leaves would you be

941
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:24,480
interested her eyes went oh

942
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:26,359
yes so there are herbalists out there

943
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,880
who would gravitate to this in a

944
00:42:26,359 --> 00:42:31,200
heartbeat if you produce

945
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:34,040
this um we talked about living mulches

946
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:36,000
that are a secondary crop so let's say

947
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:37,079
you don't want to collect uh you don't

948
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,880
want to make

949
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:41,640
jam um but you got another living mulch

950
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:43,760
under there so you could eventually get

951
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:46,839
um two things out of it you get the tea

952
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:48,760
the leaves from the Fig for teas you

953
00:42:46,839 --> 00:42:49,760
could um have a secondary crack of

954
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:52,440
something underneath whether it's

955
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:54,640
strawberries or something um else that

956
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:56,800
somebody might be interested in there's

957
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,280
also a fourth thing that I I I'll just

958
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:01,680
mention

959
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:05,359
um I don't know anyone doing it but um

960
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:06,960
sober Mak a farm in Bloomington um if

961
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:09,559
you're familiar with thatan Carlos is

962
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:13,319
from South America and in South America

963
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:18,040
they use uh the sap which is a latex

964
00:43:13,319 --> 00:43:20,800
like um sap they use that medically for

965
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:22,240
um skin growths warts and things like

966
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,760
that just put a little dat of that sap

967
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:27,400
on it and the W disappears so it's

968
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:32,400
actually very traditional down there I'm

969
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:33,800
sure not well researched here uh but

970
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,680
something that that could potentially

971
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:40,599
down the line to get if you are allergic

972
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:41,920
to latex then you may not want to be

973
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:44,480
delving into that and if you are

974
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:46,240
allergic to latex the tees are probably

975
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:49,480
fine but you know don't risk it if you

976
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:51,680
are allergic to latex um but you will

977
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:54,720
get to taste some te here in a

978
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:57,160
second all right so I talked about this

979
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:58,760
early on um part of this grant also was

980
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:01,880
an educational component in speaking

981
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:03,400
here today is part of that um our we

982
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:05,920
promised in our grant that we would

983
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:07,839
reach a wide range of of farmers here

984
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,079
and that's why I sent that little uh

985
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:13,119
clipboard around if you are a female

986
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:15,800
farmer um a military veteran farming or

987
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:18,040
interested in farming or bipac or you

988
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:20,040
fall into more than one group um if you

989
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:22,720
would just let me know so that um I can

990
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:26,240
give that feedback to s that would be

991
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:28,000
wonderful um we will be giving more

992
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,680
updates through the North American fruit

993
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,559
explorers and the Indiana fruit nut

994
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:33,880
growers association again we've got

995
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:35,720
stuff up here that you can take from

996
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:38,160
those groups those were probably be via

997
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:40,319
zoom and I think um we'll try to have a

998
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,839
field day some at some point next year

999
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,760
this is a two-year Grant so we need to

1000
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:46,160
do something in the field before the

1001
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,440
grant is over and then lastly we'll do

1002
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,240
some feedback you'll give you some

1003
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,920
feedback on the sampling of the tea

1004
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:54,640
today and with that um we want to thank

1005
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:56,400
USDA and sah for funding this project I

1006
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,440
think it's going to be really cool with

1007
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,559
um offering some new opportunities to

1008
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:03,440
far Farmers here in the Midwest the

1009
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:05,720
North American fruit explorers um

1010
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:09,040
they're the so when you do a partnership

1011
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:11,000
they typically want an entity that um

1012
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:13,440
kind of supports you so that all the the

1013
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,559
money routes through them so the North

1014
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,920
American food explorers graciously

1015
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:19,640
offered to do that for us they get

1016
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:21,839
nothing out of this they just are the

1017
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:23,640
conduit through which everything goes

1018
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:25,240
and then the Indiana fruit and nut

1019
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:28,640
Growers assoc nut Fruit Growers

1021
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:34,680
support um all of our local fruit nut

1022
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:36,079
