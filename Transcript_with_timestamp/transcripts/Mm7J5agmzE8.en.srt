2
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:12,800
soil health you know isn't just one

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:16,189
thing it's like a system it's approach I

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:20,900
mean for us it's combining no-till crop

5
00:00:16,189 --> 00:00:22,730
rotation cover crops and then planting

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:25,999
like native grass species and our

7
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:28,699
sensitive areas and our wetlands and our

8
00:00:25,999 --> 00:00:31,270
salinity areas and along our watersheds

9
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:33,620
to try to make our land not only

10
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:36,620
profitable but sustainable for the

11
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:38,670
future it's a way to pull carbon out of

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,000
the air and put it in the ground and

13
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,010
[Music]

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,559
carbon them organic matter are basically

15
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:48,260
the same thing so if I can pull carbon

16
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:52,699
out of the air and put it in the ground

17
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:54,829
I'll make it to soil healthier we're not

18
00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:56,800
seeing the salt issues as bad we're also

19
00:00:54,829 --> 00:00:59,059
not seeing the mud when we go into plant

20
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:03,140
do you take care of the soil it'll take

21
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:06,350
care of you building a resilient soil if

22
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:09,320
it's wet if it's dry if it's cold if

23
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:11,869
it's hot I want a soil that protects me

24
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,729
with in those situations or is able to

25
00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:16,250
handle those situations without costing

26
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:18,229
me a crop there's so many living things

27
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,990
there and when you go out there and dig

28
00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:23,180
when it with the living cover it just

29
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,799
looks alive you're going to save money

30
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,420
on fuel you're gonna save money with the

31
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,540
fertilizer cuz that's staying where you

32
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:31,850
put it long run you're gaining yield

33
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:35,450
because you're increasing the value of

34
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:37,880
land it also helped our our workload

35
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:40,009
issues it allowed a better quality of

36
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,450
life for me and my family and as it

37
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:43,159
turns out it's a better quality of life

38
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:46,340
for the soil it's better for the cows as

39
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:48,740
well diversity is always improves the

40
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,479
biological health and actually cattle

41
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:54,399
prefer diversity rather than

42
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:58,280
monocultures we've made a real push to

43
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:01,640
involve our land owners on the on the

44
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:03,500
land that we rent and leased to to get

45
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,469
involved in to understand what we're

46
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:09,500
doing we have a pretty good crop

47
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:12,349
rotation that we're happy with we're

48
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,129
trying to have the soil covered pretty

49
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:15,140
much all the time

50
00:02:13,129 --> 00:02:16,640
feeding the soils and

51
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,590
carbon dioxide out of the air through

52
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,600
photosynthesis and feeding soil

53
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,200
microbiology increasing our soil organic

54
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,540
matter

55
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,780
it is accepting the responsibility to

56
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:29,209
continue to spread the word and to share

57
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,790
the things that you've learned over the

58
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:34,490
years share the the knowledge the

59
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:36,709
successes the failures of what it's all

60
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:37,480
about it's about leaving it better than

61
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:41,390
you found it

62
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:43,790
long term my kids talk about farming

63
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:46,580
they they love being out here you know

64
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:47,900
on AI that's up to each one of them if

65
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,540
they want to do this or not

66
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:53,980
I hope one or two of them decided to

67
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,980
come back and run the farm

68
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,260
you
