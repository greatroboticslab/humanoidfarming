single parent and solo Gardener I found

00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:13,719

[Music]

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,719
over the years I've discovered which

13
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,719
crops are the best for maximizing yield

14
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:39,920
and nutrition helping me stretch my

15
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:41,840
budget further from staple vegetables to

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,320
versatile herbs these crops are easy to

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,559
grow they're easy to bring to the table

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,520
and of course incredibly rewarding too

19
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,800
for the past 11 years I've been growing

20
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,920
in two different large Gardens my most

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,320
recent one being 28 raised beds I've

22
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,559
experimented with several different

23
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,440
varieties of peppers and tomatoes summer

24
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:02,000
and winter squashes pumpkins several

25
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:05,560
varieties of herbs potatoes sweet

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,080
potatoes onions garlic carrots parsnips

27
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:11,720
beets radishes cantaloupe and

28
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,880
watermelons um salad greens beans peas

29
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:16,240
corn tomatillos ground cherries

30
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,920
cucumbers and last to name a few these

31
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,920
past 11 years have been here in South

32
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,520
Carolina and before that I grew some of

33
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,159
these things in a much shorter growing

34
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,040
season up in Michigan now that I'm

35
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,400
moving it's going to be in the same area

36
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,880
I'm just downsizing I'm really trying to

37
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,320
analyze the things I've grown throughout

38
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,799
the years so that I can choose the

39
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,560
highest value crops for my smaller space

40
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,399
that are really going to help me cut my

41
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,240
grocery bill and feed my kids and I July

42
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:41,360
is the peak of the summer growing season

43
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,040
for most of us but it's also time to

44
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,479
think about summer planted crops that

45
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,159
will be harvested and fall and also

46
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,240
crops like garlic that are planted in

47
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,040
the fall here where I am in upstate

48
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,119
South Carolina that's mid October

49
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,119
there's also never a wrong time to think

50
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,560
about next year's Garden let's get down

51
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,560
to these top 10 valuable crops in no

52
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,920
particular order I grow hundreds of

53
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:04,000
dollars worth of herbs every single year

54
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,119
there are so many varieties of herbs and

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
most are really extremely easy to grow

56
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,000
in most climates there are varieties you

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,280
can grow that are perennials and that

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,239
means they're going to come back in the

59
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,680
spring year after year some of these

60
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:18,519
include chives mint Sage Thyme and also

61
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,560
Rosemary I know you've seen herbs in the

62
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:23,000
store but they are so expensive whether

63
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,640
fresh or dry and you can only imagine

64
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,440
the amount of them you could grow in

65
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,040
containers I've had chives growing from

66
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,360
the same initial plants that I started

67
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,319
from seed years ago and then every year

68
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,959
I divide them and rejuvenate them and

69
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,920
plant them in different places I do like

70
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,239
to grow almost all of my herbs and grow

71
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,599
bags because that keeps the ones that

72
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,000
spread separate from my actual raised

73
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:44,519
garden beds and they're also portable I

74
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,400
love that part based on the things that

75
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:48,400
I consistently cook for my family I

76
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,319
always grow my staple herbs which are

77
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,159
parsley basil chives and cilantro I've

78
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:55,519
also grown certain herbs for tea like

79
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:57,840
mint and lavender I use all of my herbs

80
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,159
both fresh and I also dehydrate them

81
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,680
they're also so very easy to preserve

82
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,319
you cannot go wrong with them you can

83
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,120
even freeze them in little cubes with

84
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:06,920
olive oil that you can conveniently

85
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,159
access while you're cooking you can also

86
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,560
grow hundreds of dollars worth of salad

87
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:13,280
greens even in very small spaces there

88
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,640
are lettuce varieties made for your

89
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,120
specific microclimate guaranteed lettuce

90
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,280
varieties I think are so much fun to

91
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,440
shop for and experiment with and one

92
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,200
seed packet will grow you at least a

93
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,680
couple dozen of those plastic pre-washed

94
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,080
containers of lettuce that you can find

95
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,799
at the store even if you live in a

96
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,040
Northern climate with a shorter growing

97
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:33,879
season you can extend your season by

98
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,360
covering your plants or using an easy

99
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:37,920
DIY hoop house if you live in a hotter

100
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,680
climate like this you can extend your

101
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,799
growing season since lettuce is normally

102
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,760
a cool season Croc by buying heat

103
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,400
resistant varieties and using shade

104
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,760
cloth lettuce is absolutely another

105
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,280
versatile crop that you can grow in

106
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,920
containers I used to grow it in

107
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,920
containers on my deck in Michigan I

108
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,879
don't know if you like kale or chard but

109
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,640
I'm trying to like those better because

110
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,400
they're so easy to grow and they really

111
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,680
do provide a bulky amount of greens they

112
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,200
just have haven't really been my

113
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,720
favorite but I'd like to keep trying and

114
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,000
making things like soups kale chips and

115
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,560
using them in my daily smoothies really

116
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,319
no matter how you eat your greens

117
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,200
growing your own will provide more

118
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:14,720
nutrition while reducing your grocery

119
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,799
bill really now we need to talk about

120
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,840
sweet corn because it's a staple crop

121
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,400
that you can grow a lot of in raised

122
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,720
beds I've even seen gardening friends

123
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,320
growing it successfully in grow bags I

124
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,320
made a really detailed video about how

125
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,919
to grow sweet corn successfully in your

126
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,520
backyard garden so I'm just going to

127
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,720
touch on a couple of the main points

128
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,479
here you can grow a lot of it at home

129
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,759
it's easy to grow and it's also

130
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:36,320
versatile in the ways that you can

131
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:38,320
preserve it which is huge when you're

132
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,880
trying to save money on groceries my

133
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,400
favorite way is to pressure can it but

134
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,560
lots of people prefer to freeze it to

135
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,280
use in recipes and eat as a nutritious

136
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,960
side dish throughout the year until

137
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,800
there's more fresh corn available from

138
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,440
the garden it can even be dehydrated for

139
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,280
long-term storage and if you grow an

140
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,600
open pollinated variety you can save

141
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,560
your seeds every single year it's really

142
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,080
easy to dry ears of corn as long as

143
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,919
they're kept away from birds and

144
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,720
squirrels because they will go out after

145
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,479
them in a split second two fruits I've

146
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,120
been consistently growing for the past

147
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:07,039
11 years are blueberries and

148
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,160
strawberries also if you have the space

149
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,840
raspberries and blackberries are totally

150
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,400
worth it because they're really low

151
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,240
maintenance and as you know they're

152
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,919
really expensive at the store I started

153
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,039
out with be root strawberry and

154
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,000
blueberry plants that I ordered online

155
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:21,960
from Organic Farms blueberry bushes are

156
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,960
going to produce for years but it does

157
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,479
take a few years to get them producing

158
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,000
heavily depending on the age of the

159
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:28,639
bushes that you're starting with you do

160
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,639
have to keep an eye on your soil because

161
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,639
they Thrive and more acidic conditions

162
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,520
blueberry bushes can self-pollinate but

163
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,960
for best results plant at least two

164
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,360
different varieties because you're going

165
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,240
to get a bigger crop of fatter sweeter

166
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,800
blueberries if they bloom at the same

167
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,840
time and then cross-pollinate you can

168
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,800
buy bar root strawberry plants once and

169
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,319
get free Plants every year by

170
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,919
propagating the runners I've made

171
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:50,560
detailed videos about this if you'd like

172
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:52,440
to see how to have fresh strawberry

173
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,039
Harvest every year both blueberries and

174
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,160
strawberries are versatile and can be

175
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:58,280
grown in containers squash is another

176
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,039
high value crop that can provide a lot

177
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,479
of versatile and nutritious food for

178
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:03,400
your family I've grown a lot of

179
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:05,720
different varieties of squash but I've

180
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,759
really honed in on zucchini butternut

181
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,639
and spaghetti over the past few years in

182
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,039
my raised beds I would actually really

183
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:12,840
like to look for varieties that the

184
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,199
squash Vine borers don't like because

185
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,759
they're so bad in my area and growing

186
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,520
varieties that they don't like is

187
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:21,360
probably the least maintenance and best

188
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,240
way to prevent their damage winter

189
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,840
squash stores for longer than zucchini

190
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,599
but I really like to make freezer meals

191
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,800
like zucchini enchiladas that my kids

192
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:30,360
really love and also zucchini bread and

193
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,080
I just freeze the loes I'm just going to

194
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,080
go ahead and group cucumbers with the

195
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,639
squash because they're also cucurbits I

196
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,319
grow cucumbers every single summer

197
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:39,440
because my kids and I love them but the

198
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:41,520
plants are also really prolific and the

199
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,960
cucumbers are so hydrating and delicious

200
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,720
to eat in the summertime broccoli

201
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,360
versatility makes it a valuable crop to

202
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,560
have on hand for meal planning and by

203
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,039
the way this is my bolted beta broccoli

204
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,560
that I just left alone after it started

205
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:53,280
to bolt earlier this summer because

206
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,240
we're moving broccoli is a cool season

207
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,039
crop so depending on your location it

208
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,639
can be grown both in the spring and the

209
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,400
fall which of course extends your

210
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,280
gardening season allowing you to have

211
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,800
fresh produce for a longer period

212
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,199
throughout the year here where I live I

213
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,199
have the best Harvest when I plant in

214
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,080
the late summer and then I harvest

215
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,199
around December but you can also plant

216
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,160
an early spring for a summer Harvest I

217
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,919
like to harvest my broccoli all at once

218
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,479
and then steam it and freeze it to pull

219
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:18,240
out as side dishes for the upcoming

220
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,840
months my kids will actually only eat

221
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,720
garden broccoli and I can't blame them

222
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,360
because the flavor is absolutely amazing

223
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,160
compared to store-bought broccoli I've

224
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,199
also figured out that bellstar broccoli

225
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,840
does the best in my garden so my

226
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,479
experience is to experiment with

227
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,520
varieties and until you find one that

228
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,039
loves your garden it's a lot easier to

229
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,680
grow than you think it is and if you're

230
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:37,479
growing it in the fall you're going to

231
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,720
most likely notice that there is way

232
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:42,199
less pest pressures tomatoes and peppers

233
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,400
peppers and tomatoes the quintessential

234
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:47,479
summertime heat loving crops and I kind

235
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,400
of group those together as one crop we

236
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:52,840
love tomatoes and peppers fresh in

237
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,720
salads sandwiches salsa and in sauces

238
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:57,319
I've also done my share of canning them

239
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,759
for salsa and sauce I've also Frozen

240
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:01,599
Roma tomatoes which I chop and use and

241
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,919
things like omelets and frittatas I've

242
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:06,360
chopped and Frozen and also dehydrated

243
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,440
Peppers to use in dishes like chili I

244
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,840
love pimento peppers and I love pimento

245
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,759
cheese and I love all different

246
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,319
varieties of hot peppers and I've canned

247
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,560
them but they're kind of a treat for us

248
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:16,680
and they're not really a household

249
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,159
staple so those varieties with the

250
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,440
exception of my favorite purple

251
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:22,000
jalapenos that I can't go without I'll

252
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,840
squeeze those plants in if I have the

253
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,479
space in my garden it really depends on

254
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,159
how you like to eat your tomatoes and

255
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:29,199
peppers but you can see that they're a

256
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:31,080
very versatile crop there are tons of

257
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,959
different varieties they are really easy

258
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,839
to preserve and they provide a lot of

259
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,880
food growing potatoes at home can

260
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:38,919
significantly reduce grocery costs

261
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,640
especially considering their high yield

262
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:42,519
and storage capabilities they can

263
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,680
produce a large yield from a relatively

264
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:46,800
small planting area in each little sea

265
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,800
potato piece planted yields multiple

266
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,440
potatoes providing an abundant Harvest

267
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,200
for you you know how versatile they are

268
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,880
in the kitchen and growing them at home

269
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,800
allows you to choose varieties you can't

270
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,040
even find at the store if your climate

271
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,360
allows and one stored properly in a cool

272
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,240
dark place potatoes can last for several

273
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,200
months if you're able to store them

274
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,120
longterm you can save them to plant The

275
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,959
Following season I've grown potatoes in

276
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,880
raised beds and lots of gardeners have

277
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:11,600
success growing them in large grow bags

278
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,320
I found sweet potatoes to be even easier

279
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,240
to grow and they store for a bit longer

280
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,120
for me in the pantry since I lack a cool

281
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,839
dry location in our climate you can buy

282
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,560
slips online or they're really easy to

283
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:22,800
start Yourself by just setting a few

284
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,600
sweet potatoes aside one raised bed can

285
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,360
yield hundreds of dollars worth of

286
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,040
nutrient packed sweet potatoes whole

287
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,800
beans and Bush Beans I think are the

288
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,839
easiest Garden crop to grow and the

289
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,720
seeds are so easy to save year after

290
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,680
year and have high germination rates

291
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,360
making them even more valuable in the

292
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,079
garden they're also legume so they

293
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,160
provide nitrogen fixation in the soil

294
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:43,440
after the plants die enriching the soil

295
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,839
and improving fertility for future crops

296
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,720
depending on when you harvest they can

297
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:48,839
be eaten as green beans shelling beans

298
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,399
or saved as dry beans to use in things

299
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,880
like chili and reff fried beans the

300
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,800
plants behind me are pretty much on

301
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,760
their last leg because I've let them go

302
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,560
so that I can dry these out and take the

303
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,480
seeds with me when we move beans can be

304
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,320
grown in a wide range of climates and

305
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,320
soil types making them adaptable to lots

306
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,079
of different gardening environments and

307
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,000
pole beans can be grown vertically to

308
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:08,800
maximize limited gardening space they

309
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,640
continue producing over an extended

310
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,640
period allowing for multiple Harvest

311
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,120
from the same plants I usually grow

312
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,760
rattlesnake beans because I like the

313
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,839
Savory and nutty flavor when they're

314
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,880
dried similar to pinto beans and they

315
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,880
make the best refried beans in the whole

316
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,480
entire world in terms of preserving I've

317
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,000
pressure canned green beans but my

318
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,839
favorite way to preserve them is to let

319
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,200
them dry out right on the plants and use

320
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:29,800
the dried beans in lots of different

321
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,519
meals throughout the year and finally

322
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,160
garlic is another really easy to grow

323
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,760
and low-maintenance crop that I keep

324
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,320
growing every year because you get a lot

325
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,920
of bang for your buck you get one whole

326
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,680
garlic bulb from each little clove you

327
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,320
plant and like the previous nine crops

328
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,240
we've talked about fresh garlic is

329
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,079
expensive to buy at the store especially

330
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,160
organic varieties most varieties you

331
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:49,639
can't even find in the store you can use

332
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,680
it fresh you can use it roasted dried

333
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:53,279
powdered and pickled making it a really

334
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,040
versatile Staple in the kitchen it's

335
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,959
easy to store long term so you can keep

336
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,440
your best bulbs for replanting every

337
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,880
single year I always grow garlic and

338
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,120
rais beds but it can can also be grown

339
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,839
in containers another benefit of garlic

340
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,959
is that it's in the ground for months

341
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,519
while being a natural pest deterrent for

342
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:10,320
most vulnerable plants making it a great

343
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:12,560
companion plant protecting from pests

344
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,399
like aphids and spidermites man that

345
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,959
breeze feels

346
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,959
good thank you for joining me today and

347
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,639
exploring the top 10 essential Garden

348
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,600
crops that I think can help feed your

349
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,279
family and stretch your budget further

350
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,320
remember though that growing your own

351
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:28,399
food not only provides fresh nutritious

352
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,519
produce but it also brings a huge sense

353
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,040
of accomplishment and sustainability

354
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:33,720
whether you're a seasoned Gardener or

355
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,959
just starting out these 10 crops are

356
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,920
sure to make a big impact on your garden

357
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:39,560
and your table if you'd like I'd love it

358
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,320
if you'd share your own favorite staple

359
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:45,560
Garden crops in the comments below and I

360
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,560
hope you'll join me again in the garden
