it possible for all of us

31
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,320
to hone in on very important issues

32
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,559
concerning agriculture

33
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,920
we have a very busy schedule before us

34
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,439
today but also in

35
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,960
greater scheme of things so let's get

36
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,960
started

37
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,159
we are facing a growing global

38
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,760
population

39
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,720
and thereby an increasing demand for

40
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,880
food both plant-based and animal protein

41
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,159
at the same time our food systems are

42
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,560
being undermined

43
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,560
often at least in part because of impact

44
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,119
of management practices and land use

45
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,840
changes

46
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,720
associated with food and agriculture we

47
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,680
are witnessing

48
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,439
imminence and in some cases irreversible

49
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,600
biodiversity losses

50
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,640
in countries around the world this

51
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,119
alarming trend

52
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,960
combined with advancing climate change

53
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,200
as well as water scarcity

54
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,119
and the loss and degradation of other

55
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,200
vital natural resources

56
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,799
underscores the urgent need to

57
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,520
transition to a more sustainable

58
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,360
agricultural practices and approaches

59
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,200
there is a growing consensus that

60
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,920
greening agriculture will require new

61
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,159
science

62
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,040
and new technologies as well as new and

63
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,560
improved management

64
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,640
policies and practices farmers

65
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,320
has an enormous capacity to serve as

66
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,080
agents of change in leading a shift

67
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,399
towards a greener and more sustainable

68
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,480
agriculture for the right policies and

69
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,360
conditions farmers can play a lead role

70
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,000
in transforming

71
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,920
agricultural practices this policy

72
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,599
seminar will focus on farmers as

73
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:23,680
agents of change in the green transition

discussion

on opportunities and challenges in

132
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,479
quote-unquote

133
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:31,199
green transition to a more sustainable

134
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,759
agriculture and food practice

135
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,680
for me what makes the discussion more

136
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,680
interesting today

137
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,840
is that we get to hear not just from

138
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,479
policy makers we get to hear not just

139
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,040
from technical experts but

140
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,560
most important of all we get to hear

141
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,320
from the farmers

142
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,400
farmers who are the real agents of

143
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,400
change and farmers who really

144
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,919
bear the brunt of climate change and its

145
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,520
impact

146
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,320
now since world war ii decades since

147
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,880
world war ii

148
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,880
world agriculture has become

149
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,880
considerably more efficient

150
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,720
we have seen production system and crop

151
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,520
and livestock breeding programs

152
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,039
are resulting in significant increase in

153
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,960
food production

154
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,600
however over the same period we have

155
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,639
also seen that climate change

156
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,039
as well as the need for feeding and ever

157
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,199
increasing global population has

158
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,520
exacerbated the existing challenges

159
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:29,120
faced by agriculture

160
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,199
now climate change is going to have a

161
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,600
profound influence or rather has already

162
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,840
started having a profound influence

163
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,880
on agroecological conditions under which

164
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,160
farmers

165
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:42,160
and rural populations need to develop

166
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,560
their livelihood strategies

167
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,840
manage their resources and achieve food

168
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,080
security

169
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,400
and other elite food security and other

170
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:54,080
ends but towards this

171
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:56,720
and a green transition is a must

172
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,360
easier said than done how arduous is

173
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,800
that jerry how arduous is the transition

174
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,039
what are the challenges what are the

175
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,199
opportunities along the way

176
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:08,000
how do the policy makers technical

177
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,880
experts farmers how do they perceive it

178
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,199
individually

179
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,120
are their thought processes and thinking

180
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,800
in sync

181
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:19,759

182
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,600

international cooperation we need

265
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:05,440
for the future i honestly believe

266
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,360
that farmers in reality holds the key

267
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,720
to the future climate solutions and

268
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,959
could be the ones

269
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,680
leading the green transition towards a

270
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:15,279
more sustainable production

271
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,600
and in the next few minutes i will

272
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,680
highlight why this is the case

273
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,040
and i will give a danish perspective to

274
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,720
this very important

275
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:27,040
topic i am a farmer and i'm also

full value chain

291
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,600

292
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,880
members are

293
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,360
the danish farmers including all sectors

294
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,440
and size of production organic or

295
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,000
conventional

296
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,560

298
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,839
and on top of that the agri-industrial

299
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,000
sector

300
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,040

additives and

302
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,959
enzymes and bioenergy are members as

303
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,600
well

304
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,480
and exactly this composition in our

305
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,360
member base

306
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,800
gives us a unique opportunity to unite

307
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,240
the food cluster

308
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:36,560
develop strong and sustainable solutions

309
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,920
a complete value chain and to better

310
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,839
handle challenges

311
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,040
and opportunities integrated in our

organization

313
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,240
we have a strong innovation and

314
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,519
knowledge center called

315
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:52,480
circus this is where we get involved

316
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,240
in research and develop projects either

317
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,040
together with public research

318
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,279
institutions or universities or by

319
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,079
initiating the projects ourselves

320
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,360
based on present or future demands or

321
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,800
needs

322
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:09,360
via segas we are able to stay updated

323
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,640
develop more knowledge and quickly

324
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,200
implement it into

325
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:16,480
everyday farming or processing through

326
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,720
our local advisory services

327
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,760
in our organization danish agriculture

328
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,880
and food council

329
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:26,720
we have a vision of a climate neutral

330
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:29,360
agriculture and food cluster by 2050.

331
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,920
it's ambitious but we have a clear

332
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,519
target

333
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:36,079
and we are committed in getting there

334
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,519
we have already come quite far in living

335
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,839
up to the ambition

336
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,399
we work determined in finding

337
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:45,760
progressive solutions in the fields

338
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:48,160
in the stables and the feeding within

339
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,160
transportation and manufacturing and

340
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,920
basically in every single link of the

341
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,560
value chain

342
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,560
and it's important to identify where you

343
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,399
can make a change at the farm

344
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,440
where can you improve where can we

345
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,680
invest and we are determined to get

346
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,639
better and strengthen our farmer

347
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:09,519
management tools

348
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,639
we have harvested the low hanging fruits

349
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,839
and now it's getting

350
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,839
more complicated we take responsibility

351
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,399
and we can do a lot on our own

352
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,680
but we also need cooperation we need

353
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,320
partnerships

354
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,600
and we need more r d in order to get

355
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,680
there

356
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,639
and i'm sure my fellow farmer from

357
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,800
denmark mr

358
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,560
anisnergo he will give you a more

359
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,720
specific examples of

360
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,760
what we're doing at farm level a little

361
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,519
later in this

362
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:40,639
webinar but there's one thing

363
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:44,240
i need to underline we are dealing with

364
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,360
biology and many people make the mistake

365
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,639
to think we can

366
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,600
change or stop emissions from day to day

367
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,760
just like pushing a bottom naturally

368
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,720
this is not the case

369
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,600
everybody needs to understand that it

370
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,240
takes time

371
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,360
to change and manage a biological

372
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,519
process

373
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,040
i know the time is running and we all

374
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,079
want to speed up

375
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:11,040
however modern farming is getting

376
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,160
more and more complex and challenging

377
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,399
education

378
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,839
and knowledge sharing is fundamental for

379
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,560
farmers to be in a

380
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:21,360
position to live up to the expectations

381
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:24,399
from society

382
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,880
in denmark we have for centuries had a

383
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:29,839
strong tradition in having a specific

384
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,680
system for education of young farmers

385
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,200
all young farmers have three to four

386
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:37,120
years of education

387
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:39,440
before they become farmers themselves

388
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,639
another proud tradition in denmark is

389
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,920
our knowledge

390
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,880
sharing we regard our neighbors as

391
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,160
partners

392
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:50,639
not competitors and that is why

393
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,639
we have managed to build up strong

394
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,399
farmer-owned cooperatives

395
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,079
between being among the biggest

396
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,800
companies in denmark now

397
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:00,000
and they have world-class performance

398
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,000
and on top of that

399
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,800
as i mentioned earlier we have

400
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,680
established a strong advisory service

401
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,360
owned and controlled by farmers so we

402
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,920
can optimize our production

403
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,639
in a resource effective and sustainable

404
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,800
way

405
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,240
by sharing the latest knowledge for

406
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:20,240
example from sigis

407
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,240
and share it among all farmers

408
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,160
we engage in international cooperation

409
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,880
at all levels

410
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,320
we believe that some of the findings

411
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,320
some of the knowledge

412
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,920
the products and the solutions we have

413
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,560
come across in denmark

414
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,440
they can also lead to a more sustainable

415
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,480
production

416
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:41,360
elsewhere in the world

417
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,639
recently we have created a global

418
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,440
climate task force

419
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:47,519
among our members and now we are mapping

420
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,440
all the many ideas and solutions that

421
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,399
can lead the green transition

422
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,120
internationally it's not just about

423
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,000
producing

424
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,040
sufficient food for a growing population

425
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,680
anymore

426
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,079
we must produce and manage our farms in

427
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,600
an

428
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:05,199
even more sustainable manner by using

429
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,800
our experience

430
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,920
educational skills knowledge advisory

431
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,720
service

432
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,360
tradition for cooperation and our strong

433
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,760
value

434
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,360
chain approach in a coordinated and

435
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,800
intelligent way

436
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,600
we can deliver we are and always want to

437
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,839
be

438
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,839
part of the solution in handling the

439
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,839
future

440
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:31,199
challenges so in conclusion

441
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,920
what we need is first to be regarded as

442
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,800
partners

443
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,880
to be included and involved to get a

444
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,839
stronger commitment

445
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,600
secondly to get clear and consistent

446
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,880
signals and directions from the

447
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,360
politicians

448
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,920
so we are able to plan our investments

449
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,360
and our

450
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,320
future development thirdly to have a

451
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,519
more

452
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:56,160
committed public and public private r d

453
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,399
approach so we can develop the knowledge

454
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,560
the technology and the solutions we need

455
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,560
for the future

456
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,560
a fourth element is to create more

457
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:07,600
incentives for farmers

458
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,360
to get engaged and spark the inspiration

459
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,240
and motivation

460
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,800
a fifth point is to have a strong focus

461
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,199
on

462
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,079
developing the agriculture and food

463
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,720
sector

464
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,920
not the opposite we have to respect the

465
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,360
specific condition

466
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:26,079
of a biological production and finally

467
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,279
to increase international cooperation

468
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,600
and partnerships

469
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,639
and recognize the international impact

470
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,040
of promoting

471
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:35,600
new climate smart and sustainable

472
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,800
solutions and projects

473
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,759
so it is our ambition to create and

474
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,839
develop

475
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,440
an even more climate smart and

476
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,360
sustainable agriculture and food

477
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,160
production in the future

478
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,440
we are on our way so under the right

479
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,079
conditions

480
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,880
farmers can show an even stronger

481
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,600
leadership

482
00:16:52,880 --> 00:17:05,839
in the green transition thank you very

483
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:05,839

thank you he stole my speech i spent a

512
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,840
lot of my time

513
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,600
trying to tell lawmakers in california

514
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,440
that the challenges in farming are that

515
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,840
we have to recognize that they are

516
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,840
managers of a biological system

517
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,440
and if you change one thing it's all

518
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,520
interconnected and so

519
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,760
i really appreciate that now i know that

520
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,360
my next climate smart ag trip is going

521
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,000
to be to denmark because i want to meet

522
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,840
you in person thank you

523
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,600
my friend and former boss and now

524
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,000
current secretary of the united states

525
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,200
department

526
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,760
of agriculture recently said

527
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,559
i think agriculture is the first and

528
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,960
best way

529
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,000
to begin getting some early wins on

530
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,559
climate

531
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,880
i think he's absolutely right i've seen

532
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:45,840
it i've seen it in california

533
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,679
and i've seen it around the globe i'm

534
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,160
really pleased that we're having farmers

535
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,640
here today and so i am going to be very

536
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,840
brief

537
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,120
in my remarks but the very fact that the

538
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,640
theme of this

539
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:01,600
is a focus on farmers and ranchers

540
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,760
as ages of change is exactly where we

541
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,160
all need to focus and i think that a

542
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,880
year

543
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,600
after a pandemic when we all feel maybe

544
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,320
a bit more

545
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,039
directly connected to our dinner plate

546
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,280
there is a

547
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:16,400
renewed appreciation for the role of

548
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:19,280
farmers and ranchers in our daily life

549
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,240
and the opportunity to create new

550
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,520
partnerships

551
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:26,400
and new collaborations is the only way

552
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:29,039
that we will be successful because we as

553
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:32,160
government cannot do it alone

554
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:34,320
academia can't do it alone farmers and

555
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,400
ranchers can lead on change but they

556
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:39,520
should not be expected to do it

557
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:42,640
and bear that responsibility alone

558
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:45,760
it requires all of us working together

559
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:48,640
to be able to share what we know works

560
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,280
to be able to learn from one another and

561
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,320
to

562
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,360
innovate in the ways that i believe the

563
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,320
next chapter

564
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,480
of agriculture in this globe will be an

565
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,120
exciting one because of the innovation

566
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,520
that is being unleashed on a daily basis

567
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,240
through ag technology and other new

568
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:08,400
systems approaches

569
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,360
the whole commitment to building a

570
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,559
resilient

571
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:15,120
sustainable food system one

572
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,320
that nourishes people and nourishes them

573
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,559
better

574
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,240
one that is equitable and makes sure

575
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:23,360
that every human

576
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,480
has the food they need to achieve their

577
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,240
potential

578
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:31,600
and be contributors to society a

579
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:35,120
a resilient food system that is part

580
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:38,960
of restoring our ecosystems

581
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:40,559
and preserving species and biodiversity

582
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,400
i've seen firsthand that that is

583
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,960
possible and yes

584
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:48,159
soren is right it is up to government to

585
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:51,360
give the appropriate policy signals

586
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:53,440
not to be overly prescriptive to be able

587
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,159
to recognize that we all

588
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,240
operate on the place where we are that

589
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,559
it is our farmers and ranchers

590
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,400
and their farm workers who have been on

591
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,720
this land for generations

592
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,640
and every day think about how to hand it

593
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,760
on to the next generation and the one

594
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,159
after that

595
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,000
they are the ones that know that land

596
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,880
and as stewards of our natural and

597
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,520
working lands

598
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,919
they can be the agents of change that we

599
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:20,559
all know and want them to be

600
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,400
so it is our role in government to first

601
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:23,360
of all give the appropriate policy

602
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,200
signals

603
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,760
we've recognized that throughout

604
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:31,600
governments by setting our own

605
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:35,039
climate goals in california as a state

606
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:37,840
our goal is to be carbon neutral by 2045

607
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:39,120
and we recognize with a natural working

608
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,440
land strategy

609
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,720
that is going to be the key for us to be

610
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,960
successful

611
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,919
that it is in agriculture and in

612
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,799
forestry

613
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,720
the opportunity to draw down carbon and

614
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:53,039
store it in our soils

615
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,080
and in doing so and focusing on our

616
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,799
healthy soils

617
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,000
we can be more productive we can be more

618
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,480
drought tolerant

619
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,280
with a water holding capacity we can

620
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,919
improve the efficient use of fertilizer

621
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:08,240
by improving the nutrient cycling and we

622
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:10,640
will be resilient over time

623
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,360
we have in just the last few years

624
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,159
invested

625
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,880
just in my department over 400 million

626
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,360
dollars

627
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,520
that have been made available to us as

628
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,559
incentive programs because

629
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:25,280
we use a cap and trade system and those

630
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:28,320
auction proceeds are being reinvested

631
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:30,000
into transitioning our economy to carbon

632
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,720
neutral

633
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,720
in total over the last 10 years almost 1

634
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,400
billion dollars has been invested in a

635
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,960
variety of programs

636
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,880
to benefit farmers and ranchers in

637
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,159
making this transition

638
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,799
at the department of food and

639
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,559
agriculture one of our largest programs

640
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:49,760
has been for the dairy sector

641
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,640
to reduce methane emissions very

642
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,200
important

643
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,520
and in doing that the co benefit of that

644
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,559
is improved water quality

645
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:01,520
by by mitigating nitrates and

646
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:03,200
also by producing renewable energy

647
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,679
whether it's electricity

648
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,480
low carbon fuels or renewable natural

649
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,640
gas

650
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,159
we've invested over 50 million dollars

651
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,679
in the last three years in our healthy

652
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:14,400
soils program

653
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,559
and over a 10-year period we've invested

654
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,240
over 80 million dollars for on-farm

655
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,080
water use efficiency

656
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,880
which also has the co-benefit of

657
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,440
reducing energy use reducing greenhouse

658
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,240
gases

659
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:29,039
and improving the efficiency of our

660
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:31,520
nitrogen applications

661
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:33,440
governments working together governments

662
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,600
coming together and sponsoring forums

663
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,320
like this one and the world food summit

664
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,440
and the un

665
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,919
food system dialogues is an opportunity

666
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,679
for us to share those best practices

667
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,279
to learn which policies work and how

668
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,000
they might be adapted for our own

669
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:49,120
country

670
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,600
and our own state i'm excited to hear

671
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:55,360
from our farmers and ranchers today

672
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:57,520
i am so appreciative and every day i say

673
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,400
a prayer of gratitude for our farmers

674
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,279
and ranchers

675
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,039
for what they do for all the rest of us

676
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,000
so that we can live the lives of our

677
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:07,360
choices

678
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,799
and not have to worry i hope about where

679
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,480
our food comes from and we can feel good

680
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,640
about what farmers and ranchers are

681
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,159
doing because of the way in which

682
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,799
they're producing it

683
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,200
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to

684
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,919
store

685
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,919
carbon in our soils to use water as

686
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,720
efficiently as possible

687
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,480
and to be as part of the solution in

688
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,360
preserving biodiversity

689
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,320
and restoring our ecosystems it is

690
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,880
possible

691
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,640
i have seen it i believe it and we're

692
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,120
going to hear from farmers who will give

693
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:42,159
us

694
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:42,159
daily examples of how to do it thank you

695
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,080
thank you thank you so much madam

696
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,480
secretary

for your always inspiring and insightful

698
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,000
remarks

699
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,840
and to your points on that agriculture

700
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,360
is you know local in nature

701
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:59,200
but it has global consequences and your

702
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,400
calls for action and cooperation

703
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,840
internationally

704
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,360
i would say we are looking very much

705
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,840
forward to hosting you in denmark

706
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,320

farmers

718
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:29,120
the steward of the lands and of the

719
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,880
animals first off is mr annas nargo

720
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,480
a dairy farmer from denmark and he's

721
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,200
also the vice president of holster

722
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,600
borussoa

723
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,760
agriculture council we are very

724
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,159
interested in hearing your story

725
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,919
how and when began the green transition

726
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,799
on your farm and what has made it

727
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:46,400
possible

728
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:48,720
mr nargo the floor is yours

729
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,080
thank you very much and thanks for

730
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,120
inviting me for this

731
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,760
uh webinar as we have a slogan in

732
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,440
denmark

733
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:59,039
danny's farmers talk about we don't

734
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,880
we are part of the solution not the

735
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:04,400
problem so i think it fit

736
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:06,559
pretty well in here i have made a

737
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,159
short presentation because my english is

738
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:09,919
not perfect so if

739
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,840
you can't understand what i'm saying

740
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:15,039
then i hope the pictures will do the ch

741
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:18,159
uh the the point for me

742
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:19,360
but as said my name is anas i'm a dairy

743
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,440
farmer from

744
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:26,320
the western part of denmark we have

745
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:29,760
about 850 cows and about 750 hives

746
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:32,960
we are milking primarily all the cows in

747
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:36,640
12 laylee milking robots

748
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:38,799
we have about 475 hectares of land

749
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,320
only with grace and maize for the cows

750
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:43,520
beside of that we have a

751
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,720
biogas plant and as you said toads i'm a

752
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,279
board member of

753
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,120
the local farmers union and i'm a board

754
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:51,200
member of

755
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:54,400
landford cattle

756
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:56,400
um i've been asked to tell a bit about

757
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,960
what we are doing sustainable today at

758
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,279
the farm

759
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,720
and i just made four slides about the

760
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:03,039
first things come to my head

761
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,640
we do a lot of small things as farmers

762
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,919
who are sustainable but this is a far

763
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,279
four

764
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:12,880
four things who's come first to my head

765
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:16,720
in 2018 we were building a biogas plant

766
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:19,360
at our own just in the end of the stable

767
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,159
it is today that means that we don't

768
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,279
have trucks

769
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:25,520
or similar to transporting the

770
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:27,120
manure we are just pumping it directly

771
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:30,159
from the stables into the

772
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,840
burgers plant the biogas plant is

773
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:35,039
producing about five and a half

774
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,960
million kilowatts electricity a year

775
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,399
it's the same as six times the

776
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,919
consumption of the farm

777
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:43,360
electricity or in other terms about 1200

778
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,919
houses

779
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,960
it runs primarily at manure and deep

780
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,520
leader from the farm

781
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,039
and the neighbor and at the moment we

782
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:54,720
have some waste from the

783
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:56,720
indrostial about for example we have

784
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,720
bread as you see in the picture that's

785
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,159
pretty funny every day we have a

786
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,720
truckload

787
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,440
and we also run some potatoes who can't

788
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,279
be sold

789
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:11,200
sold because of the covenant

790
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:14,240
situation it makes

791
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,159
also better utilization for the

792
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,320
of the nitrogen especially for the deep

793
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,960
leader but also the manure but at the

794
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:23,840
dip later we've moved for about 45

795
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,399
to about 75 so that's uh pretty

796
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:30,080
sustainable we think

797
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:32,240
the next thing um as some talked about

798
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,120
we have a lot we have a long history in

799
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,640
denmark about

800
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,039
working together in the whole food

801
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:40,080
cluster and we are very proud

802
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,559
to have today to have the digital feed

803
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,039
chain

804
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:44,000
where we can measure uh all the steps

805
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:47,279
between the field

806
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
and the mill tank and if we are

807
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,159
following

808
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,520
following the pictures then in the left

809
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,120
corner we have the chopper

810
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,279
at the field it's connecting to the

811
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:58,559
cloud and the database

812
00:28:55,279 --> 00:29:00,559
so with gps and near sensors we can

813
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,919
measure the production at the field all

814
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,600
the time

815
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:06,159
we are going into the silo and the

816
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,559
database of course the third picture is

817
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,640
from

818
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:09,760
our wheel loader where we have a tablet

819
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,240
solution

820
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,480
connecting in real time to the database

821
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,760
so it makes all the registration about

822
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,880
the food

823
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:22,399
and all this is ending up in a daily

824
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,399
feeding region for the cows

825
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,240
the good thing about that is the

826
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,960
database because we have all these

827
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,360
measurements

828
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,399
uh the database is making uh

829
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,840
automatically

830
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:34,559
efficiency report every day that means

831
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,799
for us

832
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:39,600
as farmers that we can go closer to the

833
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:42,799
limits so we have a better economy

834
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,480
for first point they caught their

835
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:46,159
feeding is the biggest cost at the farm

836
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:50,960
but we also have better

837
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:53,919
real resource utilization of the food

838
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:57,360
and third we have better health so what

839
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:57,360
can be measured can be changed

840
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:01,679
the next thing is about the climate

841
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:06,080
check

842
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:08,480
we have from ala our dairy company

843
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,240
climate calculation can be very advanced

844
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,720
and we have a big need

845
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,440
as farmers for similar calculations so

846
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,880
we can

847
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:19,840
move at this agenda

848
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,120
that's why we in allah have a annual

849
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,640
report

850
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,880
and it makes that we can see the

851
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,039
consequence of our actions

852
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,880
it's a very strong benchmark database

853
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:32,080
with about eight and a half thousand are

854
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:34,480
owners in five countries i think

855
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,520
so we have a lot of benchmark data to

856
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,559
benchmark

857
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:40,480
us against and we also once a year have

858
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:42,799
a visit by an advisor

859
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,640
where we are only discussing in this

860
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:51,520
case the climate issues

861
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:54,559
and where we could do better than today

862
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:56,960
the next thing is about our hood

863
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:58,080
we have a cross-breeded herd it's not so

864
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,120
normal in denmark

865
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,559
but we are cross-breeded our herd

866
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:06,080
between holstein red

867
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:08,559
and jersey and research shows that it

868
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,000
makes a six percent lower feed intake of

869
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:12,640
the cows

870
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
that's pretty easy it's just to insulate

871
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,120
with another

872
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,039
with another genes and research

873
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,399
also shows that we have better health

874
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:23,279
and the cows lived

875
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:26,080
longer so that's one of the things was

876
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:30,000
coming to my mind

877
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:33,440
at the next slide i was asked

878
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,039
what is it that

879
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,480
how do we get the farmers more

880
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,799
sustainable and what are you thinking

881
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,279
about and and we always been told that

882
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:42,960
the

883
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:44,720
gold is licensed to produce in my head

884
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,240
it have to be higher than license to

885
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,399
produce first of all

886
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,080
we are a company we have to earn money

887
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:51,519
if we don't earn money and we don't have

888
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,559
a strong economy

889
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,840
we can instil we can't invest in all the

890
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:58,840
green technologies

891
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,000
now and in the future so that's the main

892
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:03,279
cause

893
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,200
of course i'm also very important for me

894
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:07,200
to secure the company for the future in

895
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,679
a sustainable way

896
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,440
happily most of the things we are doing

897
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:14,960
improve both the economy

898
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:17,360
and its sustainable solution

899
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,080
so to get farming more sustainable in

900
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,960
the future

901
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:24,000
will require a better economy in farming

902
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:28,000
and a more stable political environment

903
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,480
thank you for listening

904
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,200
you so much mr nago very interesting

905
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,360
remarks

906
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,440
and uh very nice to see some concrete

907
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,200
examples of sustainable practices

908
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,360
you know the climate check program and

909
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,120
your points on on biogas

910
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,120
but i think also the correlation between

911
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:46,559
efficiency and making money

912
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:48,480
you have a family farm that needs to run

913
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:49,039
and secure for for you and your family

914
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,559
in the future

915
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:53,440
i think very interesting thank you so

916
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:53,760
much and please stay on and listen into

917
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,480
the

918
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,360
to the next ones and now we turn to

919
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,519
central valley

920
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,640
california where we'll hear remarks from

921
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,559
derek acevedo

922
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,120
executive vice president of boltz

923
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:06,559
farming company mr astava is part of a

924
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,320
sixth generation farm

925
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:10,559
where they produce cotton vegetables

926
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:13,360
fruits and nuts among other things

927
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:14,640
mr altaverdo how does bold farming

928
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,039
overcome the challenges

929
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:19,440
as modern farming are facing and how

930
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:21,440
have you made the transition

931
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:24,080
in central valley mr acevedo the floor

932
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,159
is yours

933
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,960
thank you yes and and uh bowles farming

934
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,720
company is a 162 year old farming

935
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,320
operation where the same family has

936
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,159
stewarded that land

937
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,000
the entire time and there's there's an

938
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:37,679
incredible sustainability story that

939
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,720
comes with that and during

940
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:42,559
that transition uh the the organizations

941
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,679
have the opportunity to reinvent itself

942
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:47,440
multiple times

943
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:49,440
and um you know one of the things that

944
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,039
that you can fall into is a lot of us

945
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,760
focus on providing

946
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:54,320
nutrient-dense foods for our food shed

947
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,320
and

948
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,080
and and and the consumers that we touch

949
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:01,120
and then and as it relates to the

950
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,880
the green transition you know my

951
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,640
my mark for that really begins when when

952
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,519
our current ceo ken and michael really

953
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,879
looked at

954
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:09,760
um you know the the simple fact that our

955
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:12,560
consumers are

956
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,159
asking for more than they're asking more

957
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,679
of their food than just to produce their

958
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,240
nutritional needs

959
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:20,079
and and asked us as the management team

960
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,240
to look at the farm a little bit

961
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,760
from a broader perspective you know you

962
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,399
can fall into the rut

963
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,079
of just growing stuff but if you look at

964
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,440
the farm as an opportunity to be a

965
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,119
carbon sink to draw down

966
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,359
excess carbon from the atmosphere if you

967
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,399
look at the farm as an opportunity to

968
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:38,159
grow habitat

969
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:40,000
and provide uh habitat for

970
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,919
the the birds and terrestrial species we

971
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,760
have on the farm you know that that

972
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:46,000
caused us to start a california native

973
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,119
seed company where we grow 52 different

974
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,280
species of

975
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:52,560
of california native plants that help

976
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:54,079
provide habitat for the local ecosystem

977
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,919
the farm is also a place to grow our

978
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,240
people as simple as it may sound you

979
00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:58,960
know

980
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,440
investing in scholarship opportunities

981
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,040
for

982
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,800
for our employees strengthens our

983
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,359
community and helps provide resilience

984
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,520
to our

985
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:06,960
our community and the customers that we

986
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,280
serve um

987
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:11,359
perhaps most importantly you know our

988
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,839
farm serves as

989
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:16,000
you know a laboratory a place for

990
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:18,400
research we we've aggressively pursued

991
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,200
some of the uh climate smart initiatives

992
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,200
that that

993
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,880
that secretary ross has fought so hard

994
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,640
for and and we invite

995
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,960
multiple stakeholders multiple

996
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,400
partnerships with ngos and biologists

997
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,320
and all sorts of different individuals

998
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,880
to come to the ranch and actually

999
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,480
advance the technologies that we have

1000
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,800
we've been on a

1001
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,240
continuous transition all of agriculture

1002
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,119
has

1003
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,160
with producing more food with fewer

1004
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:44,880
inputs

1005
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,800
over time and so one of the most

1006
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,040
exciting parts of

1007
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,040
of this green transition is to witness

1008
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,079
some of that

1009
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,040
cross-pollination between the technology

1010
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,599
of agriculture

1011
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,720
applied to native plants and the native

1012
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:58,240
plants you know

1013
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,920
forcing their way onto some of our

1014
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,839
agricultural fields and

1015
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,920
and offer offering opportunities

1016
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:05,599
potentially for food as medicine

1017
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,359
and even participating in the in the

1018
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:09,440
textile industry and so

1019
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:10,640
you start to bring in some of our ngo

1020
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,960
friends you bring in some of the

1021
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:15,200
biologists the water you get a chance to

1022
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,880
to broaden your scope and and for all of

1023
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,680
those reasons and we can get into more

1024
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,839
of the

1025
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,520
the the opportunities and and challenges

1026
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:22,960
a little bit later in the discussion but

1027
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,040
but for all of those reasons you know

1028
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,240
it's been um you know it's been

1029
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:29,040
incredibly exciting

1030
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,720
to be a part of and and um you know

1031
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,960
agriculture is one of those that

1032
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:35,359
that uh when you when you take that that

1033
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,359
that more zoomed out approach

1034
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:39,040
to to looking at the farm is more than

1035
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:41,200
just the place to grow stuff

1036
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,880
you know the the opportunities are

1037
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,480
endless and it's probably the most

1038
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,960
exciting business to be a part of in the

1039
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,960
world today

1040
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,320
all right thank you so much but derek

1041
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,400
for that i think uh

1042
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,680
that was very interesting points uh you

1043
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,640
made there on the farms and the

1044
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,320
practices

1045
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,720
and great points about consumer

1046
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:04,000
expectation local ecosystem

1047
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,400
r d incorporation and a broaden scope

1048
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
for

1049
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:10,800
ag in the future thank you very much

1050
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,119
and now we will move uh from the west

1051
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,599
coast to the heartlands to kansas

1052
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:17,920
our next speaker is mr doug keisling mr

1053
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,760
kiesling is the fifth generation farmer

1054
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,760
who has been involved in almost all

1055
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,320
aspects of farming from crop production

1056
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,720
to supply chain services and policy

1057
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,760
mr kiesling what is your experience in

1058
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,680
growing greener

1059
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,520
and more sustainable and what are your

1060
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,079
recommendations to farmers and policy

1061
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,119
makers

1062
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:37,119
mr kiesling the floor is yours

1063
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,160
thank you so much and welcome to all of

1064
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,839
you i know that

1065
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,680
if you're a producer you had several

1066
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:43,359
options today to get on other zoom calls

1067
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,280
to learn about sustainability and

1068
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:46,960
how to grow carbon for profit and

1069
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,640
different other things so i'm glad that

1070
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,040
you're here on this one

1071
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,240
um if you're a policymaker and all you

1072
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,000
know this is an

1073
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:56,240
opportunity that i can reach out to you

1074
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,119
and talk to you about our farm and how

1075
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,960
this works in the bigger picture first

1076
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,000
of all let me start and back up he told

1077
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,119
a little bit about my

1078
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,960
farm our farm started in 1876 so i'm a

1079
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:10,160
fifth generation farmer central

1080
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:12,720
kansas central united states rainfall

1081
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:15,440
here is 20 to 24 inches of rain

1082
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,320
so a lot less than some areas our top

1083
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,320
soil

1084
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,480
and you think i might be crazy but we

1085
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,560
only have one inch of topsoil compared

1086
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,480
to an iowa or an illinois or even

1087
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:27,920
central valley california

1088
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,480
so we take our conservation very serious

1089
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,680
here

1090
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:34,240
because we can't afford to lose any so

1091
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,680
some of the practices that we do are

1092
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,720
focused on them

1093
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,720
um to wrap up our farm history we are

1094
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,000
right on the santa fe trail where i'm

1095
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,240
sitting right here

1096
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,119
is smack dab in the middle of the santa

1097
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,200
fe trail

1098
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:48,880
so there's a huge amount of history and

1099
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,599
this was homesteaded before uh

1100
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,560
for before my family by a doctor so on

1101
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:55,359
our farmstead

1102
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,320
are a lot of native plants not only to

1103
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:58,400
the midwest

1104
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,440
but from other areas for municipal

1105
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,680
purposes

1106
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,520
that the doctor used so because of that

1107
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:07,200
come with this rich history

1108
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:10,320
of what it takes to make the full circle

1109
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:12,880
of the biologicals now

1110
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,000
on our farm we've been doing no-till or

1111
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,200
sustainability for

1112
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,440
30 years now keep that in mind because

1113
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,800
that's seven administrations that

1114
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,480
started in reagan

1115
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,880
and has come all the way through seven

1116
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,599
administrations so when we talk about

1117
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,480
this

1118
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,599
it's nothing new it's been going for

1119
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,280
quite a while

1120
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:32,880
but on our farm we do everything from

1121
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,839
conservation

1122
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,520
manure management with it which includes

1123
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:39,599
adding a lot of manure to our land

1124
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:42,400
instead of chemical fertilizers

1125
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:44,160
we do integral grazing to where we will

1126
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,800
graze different times in different

1127
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,119
fields

1128
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,240
so i don't really have pastures we use

1129
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:51,119
our cropland

1130
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,520
and rotate that around also but we do it

1131
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:54,160
with

1132
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:56,480
sources of using our crops which we have

1133
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:59,839
seven different crops plus our livestock

1134
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:03,760
about 200 head of cattle in in a full

1135
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:05,119
system of approach and with biologicals

1136
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,520
the cover crops

1137
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:08,480
some cover crops are used in portion of

1138
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,160
the grazing

1139
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,079
some of it is used just for organic

1140
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,440
building particularly if we took over a

1141
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:16,480
new piece of ground

1142
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,839
where we're helping we do custom work

1143
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,599
through our business and if we're

1144
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:21,200
helping someone build organic matter

1145
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:23,520
just to get started

1146
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,240
we start them and help them get started

1147
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,079
in a plan

1148
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:28,240
of building organic matter to capture

1149
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:30,400
that carbon to start with

1150
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:32,560
um i want to back up and talk about some

1151
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,359
terms we all think we know what it is

1152
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:36,880
but even in the ag industry we struggle

1153
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:38,960
sometimes with the terms

1154
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,480
so we talk about carbon sequestering

1155
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,319
what does that really mean

1156
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,000
does that mean for me and what i just

1157
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:46,240
said that i'm leaving residue on the

1158
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,720
field or i'm planning a cover crop

1159
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,520
that will just be mowed in or planted

1160
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,760
into

1161
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:53,680
probably because we want to capture that

1162
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,520
carbon for for later on and we want to

1163
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,680
build that organic matter and that one

1164
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:00,160
inch of topsoil i talked about

1165
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:02,480
sustainability man i think we all

1166
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,359
probably on this whole call we have 800

1167
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,480
different

1168
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:08,640
opinions of sustainability so we need to

1169
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,800
that's one goal that agriculture really

1170
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,040
has is how can we define some of these

1171
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,359
and

1172
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,560
encircle them in so that when we're

1173
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:16,319
talking to

1174
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,480
you know the secretary of agriculture or

1175
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:21,839
our legislators how can we

1176
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,440
make a rifle point of this is the exact

1177
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:24,800
point that we want to talk about with

1178
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:28,400
sustainability

1179
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:30,640
um how do how do we do that um

1180
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,680
you know well we have to build habitat

1181
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,200
uh one of the other

1182
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,720
speakers talked about habitat and

1183
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:37,760
grasses i i

1184
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:40,800
hunt but i do it more

1185
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,079
my habitat is for water quality because

1186
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,839
i want to make sure that the water

1187
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:47,040
flowing off my farm

1188
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:48,560
is cleaner than when it started

1189
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,960
a lot of times it'll come in from

1190
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,319
someone else it com goes across me

1191
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,000
and when it leaves i want to make sure

1192
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:57,200
that that water is clean

1193
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,079
the other thing is we farm about 3 000

1194
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,720
hectares which

1195
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:02,160
or or do custom work on which is about 7

1196
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:06,160
500 acres

1197
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:08,880
and so with that we have gone to where

1198
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:11,839
when my grandfather two generations back

1199
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,640
he farmed a lot of 20 acre strips in

1200
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:15,680
order to do

1201
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,319
wind erosion or water erosion we now

1202
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,720
plant

1203
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:21,280
the whole quarter or half section so we

1204
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:23,920
might have 320 acre fields now

1205
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,960
whereas he had 20 or 40 acre fields in

1206
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,520
strips

1207
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:29,359
but by doing this new technology by

1208
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:32,240
doing research we found

1209
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:34,560
that we can do this and we can capture

1210
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:38,000
the water make the water cleaner

1211
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:38,000
and keep wind erosion down

1212
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,560
how do i want to talk about some of the

1213
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:46,240
partners that we haven't talked about

1214
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:47,200
as a farmer i view several partners key

1215
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,520
within this

1216
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,720
they might be ngos like i serve on the

1217
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,800
board of

1218
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:54,000
cultivating new frontiers in ag a large

1219
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,560
ngo in dc

1220
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,599
and we do stuff all around the world but

1221
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:00,720
part of that is

1222
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:01,839
then we do research somewhere else as

1223
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,079
i'm traveling

1224
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:05,760
uh to multiple international countries

1225
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:07,599
and then i bring it back to my farm and

1226
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,160
i improve my farm too

1227
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:11,520
and then i perfect it and then i take it

1228
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,760
back internationally

1229
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:15,359
to some other country to make that

1230
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,400
better as i'm doing consulting in

1231
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:19,760
another country

1232
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:22,079
so that's a partner to me um community

1233
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,880
commodity organizations are a huge

1234
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:25,760
partner

1235
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,560
because you know in in kansas wheat and

1236
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,880
sorghum

1237
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:31,200
and some other crops are the big crops

1238
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:33,040
and so wheat and sorghum have done

1239
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,240
a lot of research in order to how to

1240
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,400
figure out which

1241
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:38,160
is the best way to do conservation

1242
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,800
tillage how to

1243
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:43,599
transition over to no-till how to use

1244
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:45,839
these tools that we talked about

1245
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:48,240
and they've also done a lot in order to

1246
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:50,240
make sure that our environment's better

1247
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,520
to where we can take our crops to make

1248
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,640
ethanol so

1249
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:56,079
that's the renewable source how we can

1250
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:59,040
use

1251
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:01,119
carbon neutral crops in order to sell i

1252
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,880
even sell part of my wheat that goes to

1253
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:06,000
the east coast right by dc

1254
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,319
to make carbon neutral beer and so you

1255
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,960
know

1256
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:10,720
it's all part of the situation of what

1257
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,440
can we do to make it better

1258
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:14,800
um we need the more technology one of

1259
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,520
the things i struggle with

1260
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:19,440
is using less fertilizer a synthetic

1261
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:21,599
fertilizer for like nitrogen

1262
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,359
i use manure but that's one of the

1263
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:24,960
things that you know i still need help

1264
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:27,280
with on more research

1265
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,040
in order to to get over that hurdle so i

1266
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,160
can raise more crops with less

1267
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,640
fertilizer

1268
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:34,240
a lot of the things we do that also

1269
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,319
helps with water retention

1270
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,000
i've already kind of talked on that some

1271
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:39,119
of the concerns that agriculture in the

1272
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,160
midwest have

1273
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:43,839
is the cost versus the return ratio

1274
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:47,040
for me to implement some of these

1275
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:49,920
practices it might cost 40.

1276
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,880
an acre and currently my return may be

1277
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,760
half that

1278
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:56,319
and so as we uh talk about bills or

1279
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,960
legislation or just trend lines

1280
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:59,920
how can we incentivize farmers to do

1281
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,680
more

1282
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,599
they already want to do it and i'm

1283
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,960
already doing things that cost me money

1284
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:06,480
more than make me money

1285
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,920
but i'm doing it because it's the right

1286
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,800
reason i want to do it for my

1287
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,640
environment i

1288
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,839
drink the water here so i want to make

1289
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:15,040
sure that it's better

1290
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:16,000
than what it was when i started and then

1291
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:20,160
the other thing is

1292
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:22,319
is i travel so much um the one key thing

1293
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:24,000
that's hard that's a challenge that is

1294
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,880
weather you know here i'm getting 20

1295
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,680
some inches

1296
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:29,440
in west texas it might be five inches so

1297
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,079
they have a hard time raising a cover

1298
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,560
crop

1299
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:34,079
and raising a crop also so things like

1300
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,160
crop insurance

1301
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:37,920
and all these things we think doesn't

1302
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:40,400
affect climate smart

1303
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,319
activities but they do uh because it

1304
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:43,520
affects the farmers bottom line and how

1305
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:46,240
do we move forward

1306
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:47,119
so all of these things and this is a lot

1307
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,119
to put in

1308
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,560
seven or eight minutes here but that's

1309
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:54,240
kind of what we do and

1310
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:56,160
i hope to have questions later thank you

1311
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:57,920
thank you very much mr keising for those

1312
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:00,800
interesting perspectives

1313
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:02,640
um and yeah please stay on i'm sure

1314
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,960
there will be some questions for you

1315
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,960
um some interesting perspectives on

1316
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,960
conservation and soil manure use

1317
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:11,040
crop rotation and how farms are

1318
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,560
integrated in the local biology

1319
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:14,319
and of course also on your points on

1320
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:18,079
knowledge sharing and partnerships

1321
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:20,160
so thank you so much and now um

1322
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:22,079
and before i hand over the floor to tom

1323
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,359
pasek who will be moderating the panel

1324
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,280
discussion and in the q

1325
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:26,400
s session i would like to remind the

1326
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,839
audience

1327
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,520
that we would very much like to hear

1328
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:31,280

or a global perspective on some of the

1347
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:08,800
key challenges

1348
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,079
and opportunities associated with

1349
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,240
farmers serving

1350
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:13,520
as agents of change in greening

1351
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,880
agriculture

1352
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:17,119
and we have the very good fortune of

00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,520
would like to turn first to my fao

1357
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:26,559

1360
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,119
based typically at fao headquarters in

1361
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,440

tony welcome thank you tell us that

1365
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,079
could you tell us a bit about how fao is

1366
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,480
supporting

1367
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:45,920
farmers as agents of change in greening

1368
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,720
agriculture

1369
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:50,400
and how farmers are being engaged in the

1370
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:52,800
global climate agenda

1371
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,920
to help achieve the goals of the paris

1372
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:58,400
climate agreement

1373
00:47:53,920 --> 00:48:01,520
and the broader 2030 agenda

1374
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:02,960
well thank you and um greetings everyone

1375
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,319
from wherever you are

1376
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,160
this is really very interesting

1377
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:09,680
discussion and i haven't listened to

1378
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:12,079
to the colleagues who spoke already um

1379
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,760
it it's good to to see the perspective

1380
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:17,040
from from those parts of the world

1381
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:18,559
um so let me start by um answering

1382
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,800
your question by looking at the global

1383
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:24,160
agenda yeah in fao

1384
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:27,119
we're supporting farmers at two

1385
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:29,359
um fronts if you like the first one is

1386
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:30,720
on the global agenda exactly as you said

1387
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:33,520
because globally

1388
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:35,599
um there are various initiatives and

1389
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,240
policies being put in place that will

1390
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:38,160
affect

1391
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:40,880
farmers will affect the future of

1392
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:42,480
farming so it's important that farmers

1393
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,880
are part of that dialogue

1394
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,760
part of how the future of farming is

1395
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:49,520
being

1396
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:53,280
framed is being um influenced and

1397
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:54,720
and and challenged and particularly

1398
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,960
on the international climate change

1399
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:58,640
agenda on the u.n framework conventional

1400
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,079
climate change and the implementation of

1401
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:02,400
paris agreement

1402
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:04,160
uh with support farming communities

1403
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,000
actually to come to the negotiation to

1404
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,960
see what it's like to see what is being

1405
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,640
discussed

1406
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,400
and to give them the opportunity to have

1407
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:13,599
a voice actually to

1408
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:15,920
to say what are the challenges

1409
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:17,599
they're facing and what are the issues

1410
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:19,040
that they would like to see really been

1411
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:21,280
addressed to achieve

1412
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:23,359
this sustainability that we talk about

1413
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,960
to achieve the transition

1414
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:26,720
and the point i want to make here with

1415
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,720
this global action is that you know

1416
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,800
the discussion we've been hearing and

1417
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:33,359
and the views so far

1418
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,880
um i would like to add one dimension in

1419
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:35,760
particular which which we haven't

1420
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,400
covered

1421
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:40,240
and and that of the smallholder farmers

1422
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,160
you know we spoke a lot about

1423
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:44,160
farmers who have capacities and

1424
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:48,240
knowledge etc

1425
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:49,200
but 98 of the world's agricultural

1426
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:52,640
holdings

1427
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:54,720
are 10 hectares or less

1428
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:56,640
and most of these smallholder farmers

1429
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:59,839
are in developing countries

1430
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:00,800
and you support around two billion

1431
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:02,559
people

1432
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,640
so it's really critical that when we

1433
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:06,800
talk about the change that we

1434
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:08,480
when the sustainability we need to

1435
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:11,200
include smallholder farmers

1436
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,240
in sub-saharan africa and south asia in

1437
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,400
particular we have 80

1438
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:17,520
about 80 percent of farmland is

1439
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:20,000
cultivated by smallholder farmers

1440
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,559
so this is really critical to include

1441
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,440
this

1442
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:25,040
this um community of farmers so the

1443
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:28,000
second point i want to make

1444
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:29,839
um is with regard to support in fact i

1445
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,760
talked about the global agenda and

1446
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:33,280
bringing farmers to where they need to

1447
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,640
voice their concerns and their

1448
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:37,040
priorities

1449
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,400
and their wishes but the second point is

1450
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:42,000
supporting actually

1451
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:45,040
farmers in their countries to adopt um

1452
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,400
climate smart practices but also as some

1453
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:48,160
of the colleagues said

1454
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:50,640
to have access to the knowledge to the

1455
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,119
information those farmers who actually

1456
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:54,000
would

1457
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:55,599
benefit from from access to technology

1458
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,520
from innovation

1459
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:59,200
and here again i want to highlight the

1460
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:01,520
point of when we talk about

1461
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,400
innovation and technology and supporting

1462
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:05,119
farmers

1463
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:07,599
we shouldn't forget about the local

1464
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:08,400
knowledge the traditional the indigenous

1465
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:10,640
knowledge

1466
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,440
and that's absolutely critical because

1467
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,680
um

1468
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:15,520
farmers do learn from each other and the

1469
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:17,040
knowledge just transfers from generation

1470
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:18,000
to generation from community to

1471
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,880
community

1472
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,000
so i hope this gives an overview of tom

1473
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,839
and give a chance to other

1474
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,839
colleagues to to come in and happy to

1475
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:27,200
come back and add more information thank

1476
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:30,000
you

1477
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:32,240
thanks i juni if if i could just like to

1478
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,040
ask a follow-up question i think in this

1479
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,760
session

1480
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:36,160
we've been hearing quite a lot about how

1481
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,079
uh

1482
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:39,680
if we're to address the the climate

1483
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:41,760
challenges we face

1484
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:43,599
we can't forget about agriculture and

1485
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:46,400
you've just reminded us that

1486
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:48,000
in considering and addressing

1487
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:50,240
agriculture we can't forget about

1488
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,040
smallholder farmers

1489
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,760
within that could you talk a bit about

1490
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:57,119
the role

1491
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:58,160
and the importance of of youth of young

1492
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:01,200
farmers

1493
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,200
and especially women

1494
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:05,040
yes absolutely well i think um you know

1495
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,680
we

1496
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:09,200
we think about the fact that if you want

1497
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,400
to achieve and i think this is the point

1498
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,520
to take away

1499
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:14,319
if you want to achieve this

1500
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:16,400
transformation in agriculture we cannot

1501
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:18,480
do it without involving farmers

1502
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:21,040
it's absolutely critical but looking

1503
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:24,160
into the future of farming and

1504
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:26,480
where actually um you know the the

1505
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:29,359
communities can be more active we can't

1506
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:30,480
exclude the youth particularly in some

1507
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:33,680
parts of the world

1508
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:35,520
where the population is is very young

1509
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:37,920
and take the example of africa for

1510
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:39,920
instance and i think we have to take

1511
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,520
that into account into looking into the

1512
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:44,160
future of agriculture

1513
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,640
and the role of youth is critical but

1514
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,880
the

1515
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:48,000
challenge the biggest challenge there is

1516
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:51,359
how would you make

1517
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:53,359
agriculture attractive to young people

1518
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:54,880
you know how would you bring uh young

1519
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:57,280
people into the

1520
00:52:54,880 --> 00:53:00,160
in into this profession and as you know

1521
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:02,400
in many areas there is um

1522
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:04,480
there is a problem in rural areas where

1523
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,599
young people are fleeing the rural areas

1524
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:08,960
to go to

1525
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:11,200
to live in in in urban areas

1526
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:13,359
and that creates of course problems in

1527
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:16,400
in the rural areas and also

1528
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:19,119
creates the lack of capacity

1529
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:20,319
in in taking up um profession in

1530
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:23,599
agriculture

1531
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:26,400
so there needs to be incentives in in

1532
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:28,960
in terms of creating investment

1533
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:31,119
opportunities in helping young people

1534
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:33,280
to have access to finance there are so

1535
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:34,079
many entrepreneurs who have ideas they

1536
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:37,280
want to create

1537
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:38,960
things in in rural environments but they

1538
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,319
need that financial support and i'm

1539
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,960
talking particularly

1540
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:45,200
in developing countries and women in

1541
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:47,839
particular i think the biggest challenge

1542
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:48,480
either young or otherwise is the land

1543
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:50,240
tenure

1544
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,680
uh particularly in developing countries

1545
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:53,200
i think colleagues have been talking

1546
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:55,119
here about you know the

1547
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,960
establishment of farms that you have

1548
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:59,599
with the size etc

1549
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:01,280
and the capacity been in many developing

1550
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:02,400
countries unfortunately there are many

1551
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:05,520
small holders

1552
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:07,680
whole all the farmers in particular um

1553
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:09,599
to whom the land is is not their

1554
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:12,240
property and that's again a huge

1555
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:13,200
challenge in really contributing to food

1556
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:15,359
security

1557
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,319
and land protection without being the

1558
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:19,040
owner of of

1559
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:20,319
um of the land the last point i would

1560
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:23,359
make tom is

1561
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:25,760
is really with regard to inequality

1562
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:27,200
uh that's again with regard to to youth

1563
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:29,440
and and and women

1564
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:31,359
it's absolutely critical that the issue

1565
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:33,119
of inequality is addressing these

1566
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:35,920
settings so that the

1567
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:39,280
access to technology access to finance

1568
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:40,160
is is is really uh available to everyone

1569
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:43,440
and is

1570
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:45,200
is affordable by everyone and the point

1571
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,480
the reason i'm saying this is because if

1572
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:49,200
we really want to achieve

1573
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:51,920
global sustainability then we have to

1574
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:52,960
address equality of access to knowledge

1575
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:55,280
to

1576
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:56,000
to to technology to the resources that

1577
00:54:55,280 --> 00:55:00,000
are needed

1578
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:02,559
thank you thanks so much

1579
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,240
and please don't go far from your your

1580
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:06,640
laptop i'm sure we'll be turning to you

1581
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:09,680
momentarily during the q and a

1582
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:10,559
i'd now like to introduce martian van

1583
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,960
nuke

1584
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:14,480
global director of agriculture and food

1585
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,440
at the world bank

1586
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:18,839
martin we've heard uh quite a bit about

1587
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:23,520
the importance of

1588
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:25,200
um farmers and their role in catalyzing

1589
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:27,760
a transition to greener and more

1590
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,559
sustainable agriculture and i think that

1591
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:31,200
that

1592
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:32,559
inherently assumes that they're

1593
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:35,280
sufficiently empowered

1594
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:36,640
or equipped to do so and zytonia just

1595
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:39,119
touched upon

1596
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:40,640
the question of finance and and given

1597
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:42,319
your role at the bank

1598
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:43,920
at the world bank i was wondering if you

1599
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:46,319
could uh

1600
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:48,000
talk to us about the bank's assessment

1601
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:51,440
of the relevance of current

1602
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:54,480
public support to agriculture and and

1603
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:56,960
in enabling farmers to serve as agents

1604
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,960
of change

1605
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,240
thanks very much thomas i'm very pleased

1606
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:03,359
to be here

1607
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:04,400
um and just for the sake of transparency

1608
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:06,720
you know originally i'm from the

1609
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:08,960
netherlands and i actually grew up on a

1610
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:10,400
family horticulture farm in the western

1611
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:12,480
part of the netherlands so i'm very

1612
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:15,839
pleased to be here with all the farmers

1613
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:16,240
still very strong roots there um i i

1614
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:18,559
think

1615
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:19,280
i i think i mean anders was talking

1616
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:21,200
about

1617
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:22,720
i mean we need stable policies i think

1618
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:24,400
syria was talking about we need clear

1619
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:26,480
signals from governments

1620
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:28,000
and derek was mentioning you know i mean

1621
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:30,720
the importance of incentives

1622
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,920
um so if you if you kind of look at that

1623
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:34,079
i mean um

1624
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:36,240
based on the data the best data that we

1625
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:38,559
have i mean governments across the

1626
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:40,319
world i mean provide about 700 billion

1627
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:42,880
dollars in public support i mean to

1628
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:45,760
agriculture i mean this is a big

1629
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:47,119
amount of resources so the question then

1630
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,760
is you know what is that doing for

1631
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:50,319
farmers

1632
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:52,240
um a couple of reflections there uh

1633
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:54,240
thomas one is that

1634
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:56,720
you know most of that support i mean

1635
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:57,839
does doesn't end up i mean with a small

1636
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:00,559
hold of farmers

1637
00:56:57,839 --> 00:57:01,839
c2 usa actually most actually ends up

1638
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:05,119
with the larger

1639
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:08,000
farmers um a big chunk

1640
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:10,640
is about 300 billion is provided for

1641
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:13,040
market and price support and output

1642
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:15,520
support uh this generates a lot of

1643
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:17,680
allocative efficiencies actually

1644
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:20,319
providing incentives to farmers to grow

1645
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:22,400
crops that actually shouldn't grow and

1646
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:24,960
better they should grow something else i

1647
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:26,400
mean think about farmers growing rice in

1648
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:29,760
the punjab in

1649
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:32,720
india a lot of public support also going

1650
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:35,280
to input subsidies

1651
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:37,599
that also leads actually to overuse of

1652
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,799
fertilizers

1653
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:40,160
and that creates all kinds of

1654
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:41,359
environmental problems and of course

1655
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:44,799
doesn't actually

1656
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:46,319
help the farmers bottom line electricity

1657
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:48,559
subsidies for

1658
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:51,200
pumping irrigation water i mean depletes

1659
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:52,000
groundwater tables that actually forces

1660
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:54,480
farmers

1661
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,160
to invest in pumps i mean that pump of

1662
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:57,920
water deeper and deeper

1663
00:57:56,160 --> 00:58:00,319
and actually thereby is undermining

1664
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:03,040
their resilience

1665
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:06,400
also one could argue that if you look at

1666
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:06,400
fertilizer subsidies

1667
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:09,920
to what extent are they actually

1668
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,400
relevant if you factor in

1669
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:14,240
the uh the risks the increasing risk of

1670
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,920
climate change i mean what's the value

1671
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:17,520
of a fertilizer subsidy the farmer

1672
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:19,520
doesn't have anything to sell

1673
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:21,440
because his crop is destroyed because of

1674
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:23,359
a drought i mean what's the value

1675
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:24,799
of a minimum price i mean for certain

1676
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:26,079
crop of the farmer it doesn't have any

1677
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:30,559
to sell because

1678
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:33,359
of a heat wave so so our assessment is

1679
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:35,599
i mean that this 700 billion dollars i

1680
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:37,680
mean can be used much better

1681
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:39,920
i mean actually to incentivize i mean

1682
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:42,000
farmers to invest in greener

1683
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:44,000
more sustainable technologies that also

1684
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,599
that actually reduce greenhouse gas

1685
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,319
emissions i mean can this

1686
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:48,720
700 billion be repurposed and that's a

1687
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:50,960
very

1688
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:52,880
important point that we actually are

1689
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:55,119
bringing up globally thomas

1690
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,160
as part of the food system summit i mean

1691
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:58,640
that the un

1692
00:58:56,160 --> 00:59:00,079
is working on the bank is very active in

1693
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:01,920
the finance level of that

1694
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:03,920
i mean to think of a kind of a new food

1695
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,559
finance architecture for the global food

1696
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:07,040
systems

1697
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:08,880
where farmers have clear incentives i

1698
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:10,240
mean to invest in green technologies and

1699
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:13,119
sustainable practices

1700
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:13,119
back to you thomas

1701
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:18,480
thanks martin you touched upon the

1702
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:20,640
question of incentives and

1703
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:21,760
you talked about some of the

1704
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:26,480
opportunities

1705
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:28,240
uh on the horizon uh to to support and

1706
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:30,000
further enable farmers i was wondering

1707
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:32,559
if you could elaborate a bit more

1708
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,319
as you look out across the international

1709
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:37,680
agricultural development

1710
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:39,599
landscape or or horizon if you will

1711
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:41,440
could you tell us what excites you in in

1712
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:44,079
terms of the opportunities

1713
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:45,119
before us to help empower and equip

1714
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:47,520
farmers to

1715
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:49,839
effectively serve as agents of change in

1716
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:52,559
in greening agriculture

1717
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:55,200
yeah a couple of reflections here thomas

1718
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:57,599
i mean one is

1719
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:58,880
the discussion about just about just

1720
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:02,640
rural transition

1721
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:05,280
um there was launch after the un climate

1722
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:06,720
action summit in 2019

1723
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:08,319
i think that's very important you know

1724
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:10,000
because this this there's something

1725
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:11,200
strange going on here and i think it was

1726
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,400
also reflected

1727
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:16,960
when you listen to our farmer colleagues

1728
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:18,559
that farmers are kind of be singled out

1729
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:21,599
as being part of the problem

1730
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:24,559
and farmers want to be part of the

1731
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:26,000
solution you know if you talk about just

1732
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:28,640
a transition

1733
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,440
you know the way coal miners are being

1734
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:31,920
projected

1735
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:33,200
in the public opinion is not as being

1736
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,960
part of the problem they're being seen

1737
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:38,240
as victims and we need to help them

1738
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:41,880
while farmers actually um you know

1739
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:44,400
we need to you know human mankind i mean

1740
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:45,119
7.5 billion people they're all affected

1741
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:47,680
by

1742
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:49,119
climate change but the 500 million

1743
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:51,040
farmers in this world

1744
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:52,480
are actually in the front line of

1745
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:54,839
climate change i mean so

1746
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:57,040
how can we actually help them and

1747
01:00:54,839 --> 01:00:58,480
incentivize i mean to kind of make sure

1748
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:00,240
that they can actually help

1749
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:01,760
deal with the climate change because in

1750
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:04,240
the end i mean the 75

1751
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:05,760
the 7.5 billion people depend on what

1752
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,960
farmers do when it comes to access to

1753
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:10,000
food etc so

1754
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:11,440
so given farmers voice i think that

1755
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,200
needs to be improved i think the just

1756
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:16,240
drool transition initiative

1757
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:17,280
i mean provides opportunities uh there i

1758
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:19,200
already mentioned the

1759
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:20,799
shift in incentives i mean particularly

1760
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:22,480
now with covet 19

1761
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:24,799
i think governments are forced to take a

1762
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:27,119
very hard look at the public support

1763
01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:28,400
programs everywhere in all sectors

1764
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:30,880
including in agriculture

1765
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:32,640
so i see a kind of opening up of

1766
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:34,640
ministers of finance including at the

1767
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:36,960
spring meetings that we had last week

1768
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:38,720
and seeing actually how they can use

1769
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:40,000
public support to agriculture and food

1770
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:42,720
more smartly

1771
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,799
um i mean why are we why are we

1772
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:46,960
subsidizing fertilizers i mean why are

1773
01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:49,200
we not providing incentives to farmers

1774
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:50,480
i mean to invest in soil health i mean

1775
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:52,079
why is the

1776
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:54,400
price of carbon the market price of

1777
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:56,799
carbon uh ten dollars while the

1778
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:58,000
uh shadow price the opportunity cost of

1779
01:01:56,799 --> 01:01:59,839
uh carbon

1780
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,039
is estimated by the imf at seventy

1781
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:02,559
dollars at all i mean

1782
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:04,000
imagine if that would be seventy dollars

1783
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:05,680
at all what kind of incentive that would

1784
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:09,119
be required

1785
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:11,680
and then finally uh what farmers need

1786
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:13,119
uh and i think the the the the secretary

1787
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:14,079
of agriculture of california mentioned

1788
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:15,920
it as well

1789
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:18,559
i mean they're managers of biological

1790
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:20,799
systems though so solutions

1791
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:21,760
do not call me silver bullets solutions

1792
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:24,240
do not come as

1793
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:26,559
blueprints i mean they come in packages

1794
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:29,440
and those packages need to be adjusted

1795
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:31,599
i mean to local conditions so investing

1796
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:32,880
in agriculture innovation more applied

1797
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:34,400
research

1798
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:36,720
and adapted research and better

1799
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:38,319
knowledge transfer systems

1800
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:40,400
are needed and idea and then i'm

1801
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:42,079
optimistic thomas i mean that the

1802
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:44,799
digital

1803
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:47,039
technologies and the digital revolution

1804
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:48,960
and digital and data driven agriculture

1805
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:52,640
provides new opportunities there

1806
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:54,240
to transform the food system back to you

1807
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:56,400
and thank you very much martin and

1808
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:59,920
you've made my job quite easy

1809
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:02,799
in providing the perfect segue to our

1810
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:04,160
last panel speaker but uh certainly

1811
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:06,240
certainly not the least

1812
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:08,240
and uh i'd like to now introduce thomas

1813
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:10,640
batchelor who's the vice president

1814
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:12,000
of agriculture marketing and strategy at

1815
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:14,559
novosimes and

1816
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,880
i'm hoping that thomas can take us on a

1817
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:19,599
tour or a visit to the laboratory

1818
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:21,599
as it were thomas martin just mentioned

1819
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:23,520
uh the importance of research

1820
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:24,640
i was hoping you could talk a bit about

1821
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:27,119
the role of

1822
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:28,960
research and science and innovation in

1823
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:30,000
helping to create the enabling

1824
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:32,240
conditions

1825
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,000
for farmers to effectively serve as

1826
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:36,720
agents of change in

1827
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,200
ushering in more sustainable agriculture

1828
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:39,280
and

1829
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:40,400
of course within that tell us of course

1830
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:43,440
the the role of

1831
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:44,880
novozymes in achieving this

1832
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:46,880
yeah i'll be happy to thank you and i

1833
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:48,640
think it is a perfect segue

1834
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:50,079
from all the other speakers here because

1835
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:52,319
over time we are

1836
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:54,400
a global market leader in developing

1837
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:57,520
biological solutions for the broader

1838
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:59,760
agriculture and food value chain

1839
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:01,599
and and our controlling shareholder is

1840
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:03,520
is a foundation of a foundation that

1841
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:05,359
also reinvests a lot of our proceeds

1842
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:08,880
back into fundamental research

1843
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:12,319
in in this area so it is it's very much

1844
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:14,720
our vision to be driving this innovation

1845
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:16,559
so what we are focused on is is really

1846
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:17,200
this biological system we all talked

1847
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:19,520
about

1848
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:21,039
unlocking the potential of that nature

1849
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:23,039
if we look at the comment from

1850
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:24,400
people who talk about applying manure

1851
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:26,640
back to the field

1852
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:28,799
understanding that microbiome so the

1853
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:31,280
natural microbes that are in

1854
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:32,960
the soil and in the manure you take a

1855
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:36,480
teaspoon of soil

1856
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:38,720
it comprises microbes that exceed the

1857
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:41,280
number of people on the planet it's a

1858
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:42,480
incredibly complex system and the

1859
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:45,280
potential of just

1860
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:47,280
unlocking what nature already has holds

1861
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,839
tons of potential so what we're looking

1862
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:50,400
at

1863
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:50,960
is developing those microbes and enzymes

1864
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:53,440
which are

1865
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:54,480
natural compounds as well and applying

1866
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:57,039
them for

1867
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:59,039
agriculture at an industrial scale so

1868
01:04:57,039 --> 01:05:00,640
growers can apply them

1869
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:02,720
and they can be adopted as a natural

1870
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:05,760
part of agricultural practices

1871
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:07,039
also for livestock farming a similar the

1872
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:09,680
microbiome within

1873
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:11,920
a cattle and so forth is also one of the

1874
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:13,280
ways we can succeed for solutions

1875
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:15,599
the methane reduction that was

1876
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:17,039
maintained for for dairy and cattle

1877
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:19,039
a lot of potential for that and and

1878
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:21,039
that's exactly what novosymes

1879
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:22,799
is driving and investing very heavily

1880
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:25,119
and to succeed

1881
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:27,599
enabling a more sustainable agriculture

1882
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:29,760
of the future

1883
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:31,440
and if i can allow just kick-starting

1884
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:33,119
the reflection on some of the things i

1885
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:34,319
hear here because i think it was perfect

1886
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:36,559
comment on

1887
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:38,079
this incentives which i think just

1888
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:40,079
looking at the real value that's

1889
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:41,839
provided for not only our solutions but

1890
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:44,079
others making sure we create

1891
01:05:41,839 --> 01:05:45,760
a real marketplace that that creates a

1892
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:47,119
profit for pharma applying the right

1893
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:48,640
practice is one thing

1894
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:51,200
but i think there's an even simpler

1895
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:52,880
starting point allowing a route to

1896
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:55,520
market for new innovation

1897
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:56,480
that is more expedited so we have safe

1898
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:58,640
and proven

1899
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:00,799
solutions that are spot on for some of

1900
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:02,880
the agendas we are talking about today

1901
01:06:00,799 --> 01:06:04,000
but it still takes five to ten years to

1902
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:07,280
get them there because

1903
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:10,160
we're going into the pre-existing

1904
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:12,160
chemical regulatory frameworks often uh

1905
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:14,160
that we think we can find ways of

1906
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:15,520
enabling a faster way to market and to

1907
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:17,680
the growers hands

1908
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:18,559
just by having more of the fast track

1909
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:20,799
mindset

1910
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:22,799
using some of the cobit experience if we

1911
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:25,200
really want solutions to the market

1912
01:06:22,799 --> 01:06:26,480
we can cut the time to get them there

1913
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:27,680
and i think that's part of the solution

1914
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:32,319
that i would

1915
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:34,079
argue should be seen as as a way forward

1916
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:36,160
excellent thank you thomas and if i may

1917
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:37,200
i'd like to ask a bit of a follow-up

1918
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:39,599
question

1919
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:40,880
number zymes of course is is widely

1920
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:43,440
recognized

1921
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:45,119
as a leader in providing and developing

1922
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:46,240
sustainable solutions for the

1923
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:49,760
agricultural

1924
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:52,160
biological industry particularly in

1925
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:53,280
developing solutions that contribute to

1926
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:55,920
solving

1927
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:56,799
the global challenges related to climate

1928
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:59,280
and water

1929
01:06:56,799 --> 01:07:00,720
and production as well as consumption

1930
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:02,640
and so within that could you just

1931
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:04,880
elaborate a bit more i know you've

1932
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:05,920
uh touched upon some solutions but

1933
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:09,039
within all of this

1934
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:11,119
could you elaborate a bit on novozyme's

1935
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:13,200
perspective in terms of

1936
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:14,400
some of the biggest challenges and

1937
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:17,599
opportunities you see

1938
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:21,039
perhaps over the next 10 years

1939
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:23,520
yeah i think the greatest opportunity is

1940
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:24,400
is to make sure that that we get

1941
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:26,480
innovation

1942
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:28,400
in the hands of farmers and get it

1943
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:31,280
widely adopted and that's a mix

1944
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:31,839
of the incentives and the path to market

1945
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:34,480
and then

1946
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:35,680
realize making both growers but but also

1947
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:38,240
policy makers

1948
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:38,720
aware that technology actually already

1949
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:41,280
has

1950
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:42,640
solutions that can kick start some of

1951
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:44,960
the changes we have

1952
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:47,359
but as in many cases there's a huge

1953
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:48,880
benefit for accelerating that adoption

1954
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:50,559
in various ways and we're already

1955
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:52,240
partnering with

1956
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:53,839
there was a mention of sega's trying to

1957
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:56,079
have these partnerships where industry

1958
01:07:53,839 --> 01:07:58,880
like ourselves partner with both growers

1959
01:07:56,079 --> 01:08:00,160
and organizations to make sure it's not

1960
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:02,880
seen as a

1961
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:04,880
corporate push of profit but it's a

1962
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:06,720
solution that's adopted broadly from

1963
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:09,039
policy makers growers

1964
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:10,880
and industry as partners i think that

1965
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:12,720
that will unlock a lot of value and if

1966
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:15,280
we're a little bit creative about

1967
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:17,759
combining incentives helping growers

1968
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:19,279
decipher a very complex technology so

1969
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:21,679
getting some validity

1970
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:22,960
from an unbiased side i think that

1971
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:25,440
adoption can be

1972
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:28,640
accelerated hugely to the benefit of all

1973
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:28,640
the targets we're talking about

1974
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:32,799
excellent thank you thomas and to our

1975
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:35,040
audience thank you for your

1976
01:08:32,799 --> 01:08:36,960
excellent engagement and and patience

1977
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:39,600
we're now turning to

1978
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:40,480
the question and answer portion of our

1979
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:42,960
event

1980
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:44,480
and i see we still have almost all of

1981
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:47,359
our speakers still with us

1982
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:48,560
i would now based upon what's been

1983
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:52,080
posted in the

1984
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:54,799
q a box by our audience by way of

1985
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:57,920
questions i would now like to

1986
01:08:54,799 --> 01:09:01,279
turn quickly back to our three farmers

1987
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:04,839
and to ask them each uh very briefly

1988
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:06,239
to talk about what they see as the big

1989
01:09:04,839 --> 01:09:09,520
opportunities uh

1990
01:09:06,239 --> 01:09:10,640
in engaging young farmers uh in this

1991
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:12,000
transition and

1992
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:14,640
perhaps talking a bit more about

1993
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:17,679
incentives so perhaps if i could start

1994
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:17,679
with uh with derek

1995
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:22,640
thank you um you know as i mentioned

1996
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:23,440
agriculture is one of the most exciting

1997
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:24,719
fields on

1998
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:26,640
on the planet and a lot of the

1999
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:29,040
technology that's been introduced

2000
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:30,960
uh to agriculture over the last hundred

2001
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:33,120
years has provided opportunities for

2002
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:34,480
non-traditional roles on the modern farm

2003
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:37,440
we know we've had a

2004
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:39,040
a position on our on our management team

2005
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:40,319
the vice president of technology for the

2006
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:42,640
last five years

2007
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:43,440
we have a biologist we have you know we

2008
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:45,600
have

2009
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:47,120
um you know different food safety folks

2010
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,759
and we've pulled people from other

2011
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:50,000
industries

2012
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:51,679
into our farm to to broaden our

2013
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,279
perspective but at the same time provide

2014
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:56,000
opportunities for folks that

2015
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:56,400
you know they never saw their their role

2016
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,840
as

2017
01:09:56,400 --> 01:10:01,920
as being working with a farm but the

2018
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:03,679
the data management that we go through

2019
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:06,480
the analysis that we go through i mean

2020
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:08,400
farming is a science-based profession

2021
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:10,159
you know the modern food supply is is

2022
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:12,320
grown by agronomists

2023
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:14,560
you know biologists chemists pest

2024
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:17,120
control advisors all these different

2025
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:18,000
science professions that provides a lot

2026
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:21,199
of opportunity

2027
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:23,040
for um for young people to to enter the

2028
01:10:21,199 --> 01:10:25,920
role of farming and

2029
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:27,360
to speak briefly about about incentives

2030
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:30,800
you know i thought about

2031
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:33,040
you know how how do we simply define

2032
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:35,280
the you know the role of the policy

2033
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:37,360
makers and and the opportunity

2034
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:38,719
uh that we have by showcasing the voice

2035
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:40,320
of the farmer and what i came up with

2036
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:43,679
was you know the

2037
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:45,920
the implementation and the success of

2038
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:47,679
of meaningful policy will simply be

2039
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:50,960
judged based on

2040
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:52,880
the ability to provide rewards to the

2041
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:58,320
private land steward who protects the

2042
01:10:52,880 --> 01:11:01,840
public good

2043
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:04,080
thank you derek i'd now like to turn to

2044
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:06,560
doug uh very briefly if you could uh

2045
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:08,000
respond to the same question

2046
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:09,760
sure i think there's a couple of

2047
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,920
different things some of the more

2048
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:14,880
logical ones is help through

2049
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:15,679
organizations like 4-h or ffa for future

2050
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:17,520
farmers

2051
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:19,199
i have two high school boys my two

2052
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:20,960
oldest kids are in high school

2053
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:22,960
and they both belong to those two

2054
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:24,960
organizations and i've learned

2055
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:28,000
quite a bit there one of the things i'd

2056
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:31,360
like to highlight is my 16 year old son

2057
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:34,719
was offered some land to farm and

2058
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:38,239
from an older farmer and he could not

2059
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:42,239
do it because the rules under our us

2060
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:44,400
f um through our government

2061
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:45,679
uh say that because he's under 18 he

2062
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:48,000
can't have it in his name

2063
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:49,280
so the farmer had to turn it over to me

2064
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,480
now granted he's going to be

2065
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:52,480
i'm going to make sure that he's

2066
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:54,239
actively involved in helping but

2067
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:57,760
sometimes we're our owners

2068
01:11:54,239 --> 01:11:57,760
worst enemy is what i want to point out

2069
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:01,440
thank you very much doug and i don't

2070
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:04,800
believe um

2071
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:07,920
our unders are our danish farmer is uh

2072
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:09,600
is still with us um so i won't uh turn

2073
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:12,480
to him but if i could

2074
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:13,840
i would like if possible to pose a

2075
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:17,840
question from the audience

2076
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:21,040
to secretary ross um which comes from

2077
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:23,840
cecile makani and the question has to do

2078
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:26,719
with whether it's possible

2079
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:27,520
to have effective partnerships between

2080
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:30,640
farmers

2081
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:32,080
in developing countries and those in

2082
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:36,159
developed countries

2083
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:38,480
such as the united states

2084
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:39,520
i think it's possible there was a time

2085
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:42,480
in in us

2086
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:45,600
history where we funded organizations to

2087
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:47,679
do exactly that kind of farmer to farmer

2088
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:49,520
um transfer and i think doug mentioned

2089
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:50,800
he's had an opportunity through his

2090
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:52,719
organization

2091
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:55,040
to travel the world and take his

2092
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:56,960
research to other parts of the world

2093
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:59,199
i think it's absolutely vital to what

2094
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:00,719
we're doing i think it can happen farmer

2095
01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:03,120
to farmer but i also

2096
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:04,960
think the investment that's made in the

2097
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:07,920
u.s we're very fortunate to have

2098
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:09,520
the cooperative extension system which

2099
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:12,000
is publicly funded

2100
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:13,120
that third-party objective source of

2101
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:16,000
doing trials

2102
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:18,080
and then sponsoring demonstration days

2103
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,800
for a group of farmers to learn from one

2104
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:20,480
another

2105
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:22,080
and i think that is an important place

2106
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:24,159
when i look at the world

2107
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:26,640
at the world bank i think that is an

2108
01:13:24,159 --> 01:13:29,600
important incentive that is the research

2109
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:31,520
that is that transfer of knowledge and i

2110
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:33,120
know that our cooperative extension

2111
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:35,199
even though it's underfunded from what

2112
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:36,800
it once was is still the envy of the

2113
01:13:35,199 --> 01:13:39,280
world because it's helping

2114
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:41,760
to do that transfer of knowledge and

2115
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:44,000
translating in a way that the end user

2116
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:46,000
from the smallest to the largest for

2117
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,440
animal and for crops and i think

2118
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,600
these are the types of things we need to

2119
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:51,679
think about globally and

2120
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:52,800
lobby our own governments to make those

2121
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:56,159
kinds of investments

2122
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:59,280
as well thank you very much

2123
01:13:56,159 --> 01:13:59,679
secretary um i don't believe we still

2124
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:01,840
have

2125
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:03,920
chairman's undergrad with us so i won't

2126
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:05,840
pose the same question to him but

2127
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:07,920
i could i'd like to turn to our three

2128
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:11,280
panelists from the world bank

2129
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:11,840
fao and novo zimes uh perhaps in that

2130
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:15,199
order

2131
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:18,640
uh martin uh zytuni

2132
01:14:15,199 --> 01:14:20,000
and then thomas the question we have

2133
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:23,920
here comes from

2134
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:28,640
ernie shea and ernie indicates

2135
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:31,360
that it's often hard to understand

2136
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:32,320
um how the voices of of farmers can be

2137
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:35,360
elevated

2138
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:36,719
in institutions like the world bank fao

2139
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:39,760
novozymes

2140
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:43,440
uh as well as how their voices can be

2141
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:45,679
uh accentuated in initiatives such as

2142
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:47,760
the un food system summit

2143
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:49,280
or in the broader climate agenda which

2144
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:51,120
was touched upon earlier

2145
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:53,440
so martian beginning with you briefly if

2146
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:54,480
you could share your thoughts on how the

2147
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:57,040
the voices

2148
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:57,760
of farmers can be further emphasized

2149
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:59,760
within

2150
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:01,360
institutions and and international

2151
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:05,040
processes

2152
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:08,640
i think thanks very much sir thomas um

2153
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:10,640
let me start at the global level um

2154
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:12,480
i you know i already mentioned that uh

2155
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:13,520
as part of the upcoming food systems

2156
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:16,640
summit

2157
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:18,239
i mean be very active as part of

2158
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:19,920
you know putting in place the food

2159
01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:22,600
finance architecture

2160
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:23,760
there's a finance lever there

2161
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:26,000
[Music]

2162
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:27,760
we are actively reaching out and working

2163
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,480
very closely i mean with

2164
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:32,239
um federations of farmers organizations

2165
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:33,600
to make sure that their voice is being

2166
01:15:32,239 --> 01:15:34,719
heard i mean the world farmers

2167
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:37,679
organization

2168
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:38,000
is for instance a example of it i think

2169
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:39,760
that's

2170
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,520
very important because there are many

2171
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:43,440
organizations who claim

2172
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:45,920
i mean to speak on behalf of the farmers

2173
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:47,199
um but if you then talk to the farmers i

2174
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:48,239
mean they tell me that's often that's

2175
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:49,920
not the case so

2176
01:15:48,239 --> 01:15:51,440
having the authentic voice of the

2177
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:54,480
farmers by reaching out

2178
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:55,760
i mean to membership organizations is

2179
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:59,280
key

2180
01:15:55,760 --> 01:16:02,480
at the country level when we do

2181
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:05,280
financing for the agriculture sector and

2182
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:06,560
a major kind of you know ag policy

2183
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:09,600
reform programs or

2184
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:12,239
working with governments in um

2185
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:14,239
redirecting public support along the

2186
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:16,960
lines i mentioned earlier

2187
01:16:14,239 --> 01:16:18,480
um i always tell the ministers of

2188
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:20,719
agriculture

2189
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:22,159
you know if you cannot explain what

2190
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:24,159
we're trying to do in the projects that

2191
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:27,760
we finance to a farmer

2192
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:31,280
and how it actually benefits her wallet

2193
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:33,040
i mean then it's a losing proposition

2194
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:34,719
so actually you know having that

2195
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:37,920
perspective

2196
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:39,600
to kind of think through and calculate

2197
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:42,640
true i mean what those reforms

2198
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:43,920
mean for farmers bullets is key

2199
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:46,000
and then at the final level at the

2200
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:47,360
lowest level in the um at the project

2201
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
level i mean because most of the bank

2202
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:49,920
financing

2203
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,520
is channeled i mean it's all kind of

2204
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:54,560
projects

2205
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:55,679
i mean we take public consultation i

2206
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:58,640
mean very seriously

2207
01:16:55,679 --> 01:17:01,040
as very part of you know of of our kind

2208
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:03,040
of project preparation procedures

2209
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:04,159
we work very closely with local farmers

2210
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:06,159
organizations

2211
01:17:04,159 --> 01:17:07,760
also the funding actually is directed to

2212
01:17:06,159 --> 01:17:11,280
those organizations

2213
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:13,760
um the kind of the the the the the

2214
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:15,280
where we do the economic cost benefit

2215
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:17,120
analysis of project

2216
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:18,560
i mean ultimately that's calculated

2217
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:21,440
based on the beneficiaries

2218
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:23,920
most of the time are farmers so both at

2219
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:26,400
the global country and local level

2220
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:28,239
i mean we are kind of you know reaching

2221
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:29,840
out at all those levels to make sure

2222
01:17:28,239 --> 01:17:30,480
that farmers views actually are

2223
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:33,440
integrated

2224
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:34,640
and that's key i mean to success back to

2225
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:36,800
you thomas

2226
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:38,560
thanks very much martin so tony over to

2227
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:41,280
you the same question if you could

2228
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:44,080
discuss uh how the the voices and

2229
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:47,280
perspectives of farmers can be further

2230
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:50,640
elevated in institutions such as fao and

2231
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:52,560
in international processes

2232
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:53,840
thank you tom well first of all that

2233
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:56,800
question raises

2234
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:58,800
one one issue which is well who are the

2235
01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:00,800
farmers we're talking about

2236
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:02,400
you know the farming community is not

2237
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:04,560
homogeneous

2238
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:06,960
so we need to to make sure that we're

2239
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:09,520
talking about heterogeneous uh

2240
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:10,800
community of different backgrounds

2241
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:13,360
different capacities

2242
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:15,280
different knowledge i think derek was

2243
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:16,320
saying that farming is the size based

2244
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:18,960
profession

2245
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:20,159
yes and no it depends to whom you know

2246
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:23,280
there are farmers who have the

2247
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:25,280
opportunity to be educated and to have

2248
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:26,480
access to knowledge to digital

2249
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:28,159
technology

2250
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:30,960
and there are smallholder farmers

2251
01:18:28,159 --> 01:18:33,040
obviously who are an educated some some

2252
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:34,960
are uneducated they don't have the same

2253
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:36,960
level of capacity the

2254
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:38,159
same level of access to knowledge and

2255
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:41,199
and and

2256
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:42,719
learning so when we talk about

2257
01:18:41,199 --> 01:18:45,199
you know the the access as you were

2258
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:47,280
saying we have to to just distinguish

2259
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:49,199
between the fact that we're talking

2260
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:50,080
about different kind of people in

2261
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:51,840
different kind of

2262
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:53,760
settings and i think that's absolutely

2263
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:54,880
critical so we don't give the impression

2264
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:57,040
that we're talking about

2265
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:59,199
farmers in general and everything we're

2266
01:18:57,040 --> 01:19:01,120
saying all the solutions we're talking

2267
01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:02,400
about they're going to apply to everyone

2268
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:04,239
they want

2269
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:06,320
um and the second point i want to make

2270
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:08,080
again with with your question is the

2271
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:11,199
fact that um

2272
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:14,239
there are possibly uh two avenues

2273
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:17,520
the first which is um again

2274
01:19:14,239 --> 01:19:19,120
farmers who have access to be involved

2275
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:21,679
to be engaged

2276
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:22,640
and they can be invited to to the table

2277
01:19:21,679 --> 01:19:25,360
you know either at

2278
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:26,800
fao or other processes no problem they

2279
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:28,560
can't travel they can

2280
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:30,480
have access they can read they can

2281
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:32,960
contribute fine

2282
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:34,400
um and and those who can't and this is

2283
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:35,840
the second category

2284
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:37,520
then you have to find out the means of

2285
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:39,440
doing that and the other means are to

2286
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:41,199
use the national representative the

2287
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:44,000
national policy makers

2288
01:19:41,199 --> 01:19:45,920
the mps the ministers and others who can

2289
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:48,640
bring their voices to

2290
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:50,080
to these platforms and also the ngos

2291
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:53,040
ngos they play an important

2292
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:54,800
part really in connecting with the local

2293
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:58,560
realities with farmers

2294
01:19:54,800 --> 01:20:00,400
and bringing those um needs those

2295
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:02,719
priorities that they have those

2296
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:04,239
asks to to the platform and that's

2297
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:05,920
absolutely critical

2298
01:20:04,239 --> 01:20:07,920
and the last point i would make

2299
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:09,600
particularly in the current era where

2300
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:10,880
we're talking about technology and

2301
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:13,520
innovation

2302
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:15,520
then we need to reach out to farmers and

2303
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:16,400
listen to them it's very easy to film

2304
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:19,679
these days

2305
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:20,960
so you can go to any community ask the

2306
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:22,719
farmers the questions

2307
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:24,320
you know we're talking about change how

2308
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:26,000
can we make any change if we don't know

2309
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,800
what the farmers want how can they be

2310
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:30,159
involved can

2311
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:33,199
they in what circumstances and how

2312
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:35,440
and also just to distinguish about

2313
01:20:33,199 --> 01:20:36,239
the changes we want to make some of the

2314
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:38,880
changes are

2315
01:20:36,239 --> 01:20:41,120
big and challenging and demanding and

2316
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:41,679
some changes for some small communities

2317
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:43,600
just

2318
01:20:41,679 --> 01:20:45,760
little changes will make a huge

2319
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:47,840
difference to the survivals to the

2320
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:50,800
livelihood to the income

2321
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:52,000
and that's absolutely critical so my my

2322
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:54,960
point is

2323
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:56,239
we need to be uh proactive as well to go

2324
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:58,400
and find farmers and

2325
01:20:56,239 --> 01:21:00,080
and hear what they want to say in some

2326
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:04,320
context you know they don't have

2327
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:07,120
time to be involved in in global agenda

2328
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:09,199
they have other worries other priorities

2329
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:10,080
so we need to go and see well how can we

2330
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:11,600
help you

2331
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:13,199
they're never going to think whoa whoa

2332
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:14,000
there is a conference on climate change

2333
01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:16,639
in glasgow

2334
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:18,080
we better go and and take part in that

2335
01:21:16,639 --> 01:21:20,480
absolutely not

2336
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:21,920
so we are responsible in reaching out to

2337
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:22,320
those people when we talk about leaving

2338
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:24,560
no

2339
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:25,679
no one behind that's what it means go

2340
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:28,400
and find the people

2341
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:30,880
see what they want and take ownership

2342
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:32,560
and help them thank you

2343
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:34,480
thanks itony i think you raised some

2344
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:36,239
excellent questions and made some

2345
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:37,600
some very important points there as of

2346
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:40,159
course did martin

2347
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:41,440
um before turning to thomas i would just

2348
01:21:40,159 --> 01:21:43,679
like to flag that

2349
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:45,120
just after promise i would like to turn

2350
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:47,360
to each of our speakers

2351
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:49,199
and ask them very briefly in about 30

2352
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:51,280
seconds to 45 seconds

2353
01:21:49,199 --> 01:21:53,120
to share with the audience what their

2354
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:55,600
key takeaway message would be

2355
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:57,280
if the audience is to remember one thing

2356
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:58,080
that each of you has said what would it

2357
01:21:57,280 --> 01:22:00,400
be

2358
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:01,920
uh so please begin giving thought to

2359
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:05,199
that but before turning to

2360
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:07,199
each of you respectively i would like to

2361
01:22:05,199 --> 01:22:08,560
ask thomas to respond to this question

2362
01:22:07,199 --> 01:22:10,880
of how the

2363
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:12,000
voices and perspectives of farmers can

2364
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:15,280
be better

2365
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:17,440
amplified within institutions or

2366
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:20,320
organizations or companies

2367
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:22,159
um and also if i may very briefly thomas

2368
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:24,560
a secondary question for you which has

2369
01:22:22,159 --> 01:22:26,400
come in from lauren hirsch um

2370
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:28,000
asking about what some of the key

2371
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:30,080
research gaps are

2372
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,840
still in need of investment over to you

2373
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:33,199
thomas

2374
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:35,520
and you can actually link a little bit

2375
01:22:33,199 --> 01:22:38,880
because i think one of the things that

2376
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:41,440
we as kind of corporate

2377
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:42,960
innovation drivers lag sometimes is

2378
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:43,600
actually the engagement with with

2379
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:46,239
farmers

2380
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:48,159
early on to really make sure that we

2381
01:22:46,239 --> 01:22:48,800
develop solutions that fit into the

2382
01:22:48,159 --> 01:22:51,360
reality

2383
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:52,400
simple application realities economic

2384
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:54,960
windows of

2385
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:56,400
reality because you have great lab work

2386
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:58,080
but it never hits the market because

2387
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:58,880
it's misunderstood the application

2388
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:01,199
reality

2389
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:02,639
so that's a simple uh you should be easy

2390
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:04,880
but it really isn't

2391
01:23:02,639 --> 01:23:07,120
but we have so many as we've exemplified

2392
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:09,440
today farmers that are progressive

2393
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:10,480
and actually eager to engage and that

2394
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:13,040
kind of engagement

2395
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:14,719
is is critical and then i would would

2396
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:15,440
tagline it over to the second part of

2397
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:17,360
the question

2398
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:20,080
of also creating these partnerships and

2399
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:22,800
alliances it can be with co-ops or

2400
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:23,520
individual farmers because sometimes

2401
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:25,199
it's also

2402
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:26,800
what is the willingness to pay if

2403
01:23:25,199 --> 01:23:28,639
there's not a market for methane

2404
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:31,120
reduction or if there's not

2405
01:23:28,639 --> 01:23:33,120
a credit given for carbon capture or

2406
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:35,120
soil health which is a longer-term gain

2407
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:37,040
than a yield one year

2408
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:39,199
well is it a is it a product concept or

2409
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:41,040
not and some farmers would love to pay

2410
01:23:39,199 --> 01:23:42,560
for it but they can't afford it

2411
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:45,600
and then you need to link it back to

2412
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:47,280
policy making incentives and so forth

2413
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:49,920
and coming as a joint

2414
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:51,120
a representation of farmers and not as a

2415
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:52,960
corporate innovator

2416
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:55,040
that's being perceived to seek profit

2417
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:57,280
only creates a much better

2418
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:58,400
partnership for policy dialogue and so

2419
01:23:57,280 --> 01:24:00,080
forth so i think

2420
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:02,239
that there's many of these which are

2421
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:05,600
these gaps that was asked to

2422
01:24:02,239 --> 01:24:07,280
like soil health a methane reduction

2423
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:09,760
which are nebulous

2424
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:10,560
business cases because who will pay for

2425
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:12,320
them

2426
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:14,239
so that answers kind of that question

2427
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:15,440
there's a long list of business

2428
01:24:14,239 --> 01:24:17,440
opportunities

2429
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:19,120
which should have capital value for a

2430
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:21,199
farmer but doesn't today

2431
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:23,360
and we can find a way to get that via

2432
01:24:21,199 --> 01:24:24,320
incentives and get a fast way to market

2433
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:27,760
that would be

2434
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:29,120
great progress fantastic thank you very

2435
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:31,120
much thomas i hope

2436
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:32,800
i'm not being too ambitious here but

2437
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:34,480
with the time that remains

2438
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:36,960
i would really like to turn to each of

2439
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:39,520
our six speakers who are still with us

2440
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:41,520
to ask them in about 30 seconds to share

2441
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:43,280
their key takeaway message with

2442
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:45,760
our audience and if i could start with

2443
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:47,280
you secretary ross

2444
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:48,800
i was afraid i was going to be first and

2445
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:51,679
there was so much here

2446
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:53,520
two things i'm going to touch on one um

2447
01:24:51,679 --> 01:24:55,120
i think thomas mentioned that we're

2448
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:57,120
trying to create some biological

2449
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:59,440
solutions and trying to fit them into a

2450
01:24:57,120 --> 01:25:00,960
regulatory framework for chemistry

2451
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:02,639
and i think that really is something

2452
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:04,719
every country could take a look at

2453
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:06,880
and two thank you zatuni for your

2454
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:08,960
comments because i'm keenly aware

2455
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:09,920
california ag is very diverse we have

2456
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:12,639
the smallest

2457
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:13,280
organic urban farms all the way to the

2458
01:25:12,639 --> 01:25:15,840
larger

2459
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:18,080
multi-generation but the small farmer

2460
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:19,840
and how do we engage on a global basis

2461
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:21,280
if we really want to make a difference

2462
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:22,480
that's where we're going to have to

2463
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:25,520
really work together and create

2464
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:27,440
partnerships thank you

2465
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:30,880
thanks so much secretary ross back to

2466
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:30,880
you thomas for your key takeaway

2467
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:38,000
sorry me yes yeah

2468
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:40,800
sorry um yes i would keep it back to the

2469
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:43,040
the central point about the potential

2470
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:44,639
and innovation is there it's a matter of

2471
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:46,719
unleashing it and getting it in the

2472
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:49,120
hands fast and an efficient way

2473
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:50,159
regulatory fast tracks ways to enable

2474
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:53,360
farmers to adopt

2475
01:25:50,159 --> 01:25:54,639
fast would be my key takeaway excellent

2476
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:57,920
thanks for your brevity

2477
01:25:54,639 --> 01:25:57,920
uh martian over to you

2478
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:03,520
thanks thanks tom um i i start um you

2479
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:05,760
know by

2480
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:08,000
referring to what derek said you know we

2481
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:08,960
need to reward private land stewards who

2482
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,440
protect i mean

2483
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:12,880
common public goods so my takeaway is

2484
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:15,199
that you know

2485
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:17,440
we need to kind of provide farmers the

2486
01:26:15,199 --> 01:26:18,800
right incentives to do so and when it

2487
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:22,320
comes to

2488
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:24,560
uh making farmers better agents

2489
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:26,320
of change in greeting agriculture i

2490
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:28,480
think we need to provide them

2491
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:30,719
the right incentives so that we actually

2492
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:32,639
can move to a situation

2493
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:34,639
where we it's where it's recognizing

2494
01:26:32,639 --> 01:26:36,880
where we redefine

2495
01:26:34,639 --> 01:26:38,800
what it is to be a farmer in the 21st

2496
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:39,600
century i mean not just a producer of

2497
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:41,440
food

2498
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:43,120
but also a provider of ecosystem

2499
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:43,920
services and this would be revenue

2500
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:47,360
streams

2501
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:49,520
attached to that thank you martian

2502
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:50,960
um is itunes over to you in 30 seconds

2503
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:53,040
or less please

2504
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:54,639
thank you tom what three three points i

2505
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:56,480
would say the first one is

2506
01:26:54,639 --> 01:26:58,480
definitely to include smallholder

2507
01:26:56,480 --> 01:27:00,719
farmers and to listen to them

2508
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:01,600
the second point is to recognize the

2509
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:04,320
importance of

2510
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:05,920
indigenous and local knowledge and the

2511
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:07,440
third point i would make was within

2512
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:10,159
touch on its match actually

2513
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:10,960
is changing models but also changing our

2514
01:27:10,159 --> 01:27:14,560
mindsets

2515
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:16,960
everyone thank you thanks itune

2516
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:18,719
i think it's only right and fitting that

2517
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:19,440
our farmer should have the the final

2518
01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:21,520
word

2519
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:22,800
as it were so if i could turn to derrick

2520
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:25,040
and then doug

2521
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:27,360
each in about 30 seconds or less please

2522
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:29,760
uh derek over to you

2523
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:31,600
thank you i think the sentiment from

2524
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:34,480
farmers everywhere is they feel

2525
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:35,760
like the villain and and absent from a

2526
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:37,760
lot of these conversations

2527
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:39,280
that's simply unacceptable not only is

2528
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:42,239
the farmer

2529
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:43,280
play a critical role but we have a lot

2530
01:27:42,239 --> 01:27:44,719
to be proud of

2531
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:46,880
in the food supply that we provide

2532
01:27:44,719 --> 01:27:49,440
everybody and not only is the farmer the

2533
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:50,400
you know not the villain but but but

2534
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:53,120
critical

2535
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:53,840
to the solution and the answers lie on

2536
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:56,560
the farm

2537
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:58,320
and so um again i i appreciate the

2538
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:59,120
opportunity to share our thoughts and

2539
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:00,719
you could have had

2540
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:02,239
hundreds of thousands of farmers from

2541
01:28:00,719 --> 01:28:03,600
around the world participate in this

2542
01:28:02,239 --> 01:28:05,040
discussion and you have had

2543
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:08,239
equally diverse and interesting

2544
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:08,239
perspectives from each one of them

2545
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:14,480
thank you derek doug over to you yeah

2546
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:16,880
on a couple of these topics you know

2547
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:19,360
some of the organizations are doing this

2548
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:20,239
uh we built a 40 million dollar research

2549
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:22,320
facility to

2550
01:28:20,239 --> 01:28:24,239
to study these type of things uh

2551
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:26,000
greenhouses the whole work sorghum is

2552
01:28:24,239 --> 01:28:28,639
working on it they're even doing virtual

2553
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:30,560
reality work with international markets

2554
01:28:28,639 --> 01:28:33,199
international grains program was

2555
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:34,080
developed in kansas and at kansas state

2556
01:28:33,199 --> 01:28:35,920
university

2557
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:37,199
in connection with about seven or eight

2558
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:40,239
different commodities

2559
01:28:37,199 --> 01:28:42,080
to address these issues so farmers are

2560
01:28:40,239 --> 01:28:43,679
reaching out doing a lot of this

2561
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:45,520
i think a lot of these governmental

2562
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:47,360
entities and organizations are not

2563
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:48,400
reaching out to the farmers like myself

2564
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:51,440
and others

2565
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:53,520
because that work is being done and

2566
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:55,040
but my final takeaway is just include

2567
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:57,440
the farmers in these rules

2568
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:58,800
because we all got to do it and as much

2569
01:28:57,440 --> 01:29:01,360
as possible

2570
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:02,239
the best way to do that is by making the

2571
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:04,960
carbon

2572
01:29:02,239 --> 01:29:07,040
a free market system because of its free

2573
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:07,679
market system as eluded by some of the

2574
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:09,360
others

2575
01:29:07,679 --> 01:29:12,880
the price of that carbon capture could

2576
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:15,280
go up and it will naturally happen

2577
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:17,040
thank you so much for today thank you

2578
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:17,840
very much doug i would now like to turn

2579
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:21,440
the floor back

2580
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:23,440
over to our moderator trolls

2581
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:25,520
thank you so much tom and thank you to

2582
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:27,199
the audience for all your excellent

2583
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:29,120
questions and uh to our panel and

2584
01:29:27,199 --> 01:29:31,520
speakers for a very insight

2585
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:32,639
full conversation and thank you tom for

2586
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:34,159
moderating it

2587
01:29:32,639 --> 01:29:36,639
and thank you for being the mastermind

2588
01:29:34,159 --> 01:29:38,719
behind this event tom and fao did most

2589
01:29:36,639 --> 01:29:40,639
of the heavy lifting behind this event

2590
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:42,960
so hats off to you guys

2591
01:29:40,639 --> 01:29:45,600
and now i would like to hand out the

2592
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:47,520
floor to vimlendra from fao once again

2593
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:50,880
this time for some concluding remarks

2594
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:50,880
remember the floor is yours

2595
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:54,960
thank you trolls and you've been quite

2596
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:56,400
modest i think

2597
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:59,199
the embassy really took it upon

2598
01:29:56,400 --> 01:30:01,520
themselves to make sure that we

2599
01:29:59,199 --> 01:30:02,639
have the event as successful as we did

2600
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:05,679
have it today so

2601
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:06,560
it was a extremely engrossing discussion

2602
01:30:05,679 --> 01:30:10,000
and

2603
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:12,400
i think even to expect to be able to do

2604
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:13,520
justice and summarize what we heard in

2605
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:16,800
five minutes

2606
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:20,480
i think it's beyond my capacity but

2607
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:23,920
i will try and uh

2608
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:24,800
bring out the main issues which i heard

2609
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:28,880
today

2610
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:31,520
both from policymakers the

2611
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:33,199
technical people looking at the global

2612
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:35,040
issues and definitely from the farming

2613
01:30:33,199 --> 01:30:38,080
community represented by

2614
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:41,679
three farmers online today

2615
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:44,400
uh i learned a lot

2616
01:30:41,679 --> 01:30:45,120
and i realized that more productive and

2617
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:47,679
resilient

2618
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:50,000
agriculture will require transformation

2619
01:30:47,679 --> 01:30:53,360
and management of natural resources

2620
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:54,159
and higher efficiency of in use of these

2621
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:57,600
resources

2622
01:30:54,159 --> 01:30:59,840
and inputs for production we heard uh

2623
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:02,159
to start with we heard from sauron

2624
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:04,000
sannega that farmers hold the key and

2625
01:31:02,159 --> 01:31:04,560
this point got reiterated again and

2626
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,880
again

2627
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:08,159
uh including till the very last in in

2628
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:09,920
take away messages

2629
01:31:08,159 --> 01:31:11,920
that they hold the key and they will be

2630
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:15,679
the one who will have to lead the front

2631
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:17,360
transition he also emphasized the need

2632
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:20,080
for a very effective partnership

2633
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:21,679
and strong r d along with strong

2634
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:23,600
incentives for farmers to bring about

2635
01:31:21,679 --> 01:31:25,520
this transition

2636
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:27,360
uh secretary kevin rose thank you for

2637
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:28,239
reminding us that agriculture will

2638
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:30,239
perhaps

2639
01:31:28,239 --> 01:31:32,560
be the first and best way to begin

2640
01:31:30,239 --> 01:31:34,159
getting some wins in climate area

2641
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:36,480
and your emphasis on keeping

2642
01:31:34,159 --> 01:31:40,000
sustainability and biodiversity

2643
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:42,400
from center in our policy prescriptions

2644
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:43,120
the greening of agriculture will also

2645
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:45,760
present an

2646
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:47,920
almost innovation challenge of producing

2647
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:49,920
more food and fiber without relying

2648
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:51,360
on most of the technological mainstays

2649
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:54,480
of productivity gains

2650
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:57,840
of the past so we need to innovate and

2651
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:58,719
we saw how andre nargo has led his

2652
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:01,360
organization

2653
01:31:58,719 --> 01:32:03,520
sustainable practices through biogas

2654
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:04,560
plans digital feed chain climate check

2655
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:06,159
etc

2656
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:08,320
and andre we totally agree with you

2657
01:32:06,159 --> 01:32:10,400
you're definitely not part of the

2658
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:11,520
problem you are the solution going

2659
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:13,360
forward

2660
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:14,639
a new demand is also being placed on

2661
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:16,239
agriculture

2662
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:17,920
and it has been asked to replace

2663
01:32:16,239 --> 01:32:19,360
environmentally damaging products and

2664
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:21,760
protect biodiversity

2665
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:24,080
and mitigate climate change as well as

2666
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:26,320
address livelihoods and lifestyles

2667
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:28,480
and what better way to go ahead with

2668
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:31,040
this than to follow the initiatives

2669
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:32,400
are shown by bulls farming company and

2670
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:34,639
the kiesling farms

2671
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:36,960
which see farms not just as a place to

2672
01:32:34,639 --> 01:32:39,520
grow but also to make

2673
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:41,360
farms work as a carbon sink as a habitat

2674
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:44,400
to promote biodiversity

2675
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:47,520
and also a place to grow human resources

2676
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:50,400
so the need to do all this

2677
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:51,040
and they've argued very strongly is to

2678
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:53,040
mention

2679
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:55,600
is to maintain the farming remains as

2680
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:58,159
remunerative activity

2681
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:59,440
we heard the community talk again and

2682
01:32:58,159 --> 01:33:02,719
again about

2683
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:05,440
how farming is no more

2684
01:33:02,719 --> 01:33:08,239
a very remunerative activity and how the

2685
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:10,000
youth is turning away from it so thank

2686
01:33:08,239 --> 01:33:12,639
you so toony and martine for bringing a

2687
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:16,000
global perspective to it

2688
01:33:12,639 --> 01:33:18,080
uh mr tooney he told us about fao's

2689
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:19,120
effort at integrating farmers voice the

2690
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:20,880
global agenda

2691
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:22,560
and also in handholding farming

2692
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:25,840
community at country level to make

2693
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:27,920
to take to climate smart agriculture

2694
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:29,920
and thank you for emphasizing once again

2695
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:30,320
the need to remember smallholder farmers

2696
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:32,639
because

2697
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:34,880
many times in our debate in north

2698
01:33:32,639 --> 01:33:36,400
america we tend to focus on what farming

2699
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:38,480
is in and around

2700
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:40,400
this part of the world but to remember

2701
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:43,679
the 98 percent of the farming community

2702
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:46,320
is still farms and 10 hectares and less

2703
01:33:43,679 --> 01:33:48,080
and your emphasis on being grounded in

2704
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:50,159
our traditional knowledge

2705
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:51,679
but looking forward to the future and

2706
01:33:50,159 --> 01:33:53,679
having the capacity

2707
01:33:51,679 --> 01:33:55,600
and the courage to embrace modern

2708
01:33:53,679 --> 01:33:58,159
science and evidence

2709
01:33:55,600 --> 01:34:00,000
martin thank you so much for explaining

2710
01:33:58,159 --> 01:34:00,560
so well the need to better apply and

2711
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,040
target

2712
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:04,159
public resources going into agriculture

2713
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:06,320
worldwide

2714
01:34:04,159 --> 01:34:08,320
uh can the 700 billion dollars be used

2715
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:11,440
much better can they be repurposed

2716
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:14,239
i think that's a extremely uh strong

2717
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:15,520
phrase how do we repurpose the 700

2718
01:34:14,239 --> 01:34:17,600
billion going in

2719
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:20,080
to ensure that they actually end up

2720
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:22,000
incentivizing farmers to invest in green

2721
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:23,679
technology and sustainable farming

2722
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:25,920
and that will require a lot of

2723
01:34:23,679 --> 01:34:26,880
coordination with policymakers policy

2724
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:28,480
framers

2725
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:30,960
across the globe and especially in the

2726
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:32,000
global south thank you for spotlighting

2727
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:34,080
that farmers are in the

2728
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,679
front line of climate change and the

2729
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:38,159
need to understand that they are the

2730
01:34:35,679 --> 01:34:40,400
victims and not the cause

2731
01:34:38,159 --> 01:34:41,520
thomas you so rightly highlighted the

2732
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:44,000
importance of

2733
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:45,760
biological solutions for agriculture and

2734
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,719
food value chains and the fact that they

2735
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:49,280
exist

2736
01:34:46,719 --> 01:34:50,639
and the need to change the regulatory

2737
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:53,199
framework to ensure

2738
01:34:50,639 --> 01:34:55,040
that the land lab to land transfer

2739
01:34:53,199 --> 01:34:57,679
happens extremely fast

2740
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:58,960
and the need for understanding the

2741
01:34:57,679 --> 01:35:01,760
requirements

2742
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:03,440
the economic reality the

2743
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:05,600
implementational reality

2744
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:06,719
of bringing modern science to to the

2745
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:09,679
land

2746
01:35:06,719 --> 01:35:10,480
so if we take all this together and

2747
01:35:09,679 --> 01:35:12,719
summarize

2748
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:14,560
i think i'm being too ambitious to put

2749
01:35:12,719 --> 01:35:15,920
it bring it in one sentence or two

2750
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:17,119
sentences but i would say that the

2751
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:20,080
potential of

2752
01:35:17,119 --> 01:35:22,000
new science innovation knowledge

2753
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:24,239
technology and partnership

2754
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:25,360
to contribute to sustainable and green

2755
01:35:24,239 --> 01:35:29,119
agriculture

2756
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:32,560
will depend on policy finding a way

2757
01:35:29,119 --> 01:35:34,719
to manage these changes in a way

2758
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:36,880
that provides a balanced outcome for the

2759
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:41,520
society and the environment

2760
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:44,320
and ends up help incentivize the farmers

2761
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:46,960
to make the transition so it it the

2762
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:49,440
policy has to give the right signal

2763
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:50,800
and with that signal and partnership and

2764
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:53,840
knowledge and innovation

2765
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:55,280
and science and finance at an end we

2766
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:57,600
need to go forward

2767
01:35:55,280 --> 01:36:00,320
always keeping the farmer as the focus

2768
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:02,639
point as the focal point

2769
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:04,080
and ensuring that he is front center of

2770
01:36:02,639 --> 01:36:06,239
all our policy making

2771
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:07,760
so as we close this discussion today i

2772
01:36:06,239 --> 01:36:11,280
think we need to take

2773
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:13,360
these lessons home and we need to help

2774
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:15,520
promote the urgent need to transition to

2775
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:18,400
green and sustainable agriculture

2776
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:19,440
i'm sure all of you would have taken

2777
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:21,199
your own

2778
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:22,719
lessons from the various points made by

2779
01:36:21,199 --> 01:36:25,600
our speakers and i

2780
01:36:22,719 --> 01:36:28,080
would end by thanking all of them to

2781
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:31,679
have taken time out of their business

2782
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:33,600
and attend this help us

2783
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:35,840
understand the issue with their ideas

2784
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:39,360
their thoughts and their perspectives

2785
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:42,239
thank you so much and back to you trolls

2786
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:43,360
thank you so much vimelendra as always

2787
01:36:42,239 --> 01:36:46,080
on the point

2788
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:46,719
um and that concludes today's special

2789
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:48,480
event

2790
01:36:46,719 --> 01:36:51,920
i think it has been a very interesting

2791
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:54,159
conversation and a much needed one

2792
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:55,119
we have less than 10 years to reach the

2793
01:36:54,159 --> 01:36:56,880
sustainable

2794
01:36:55,119 --> 01:36:58,719
development goals and some of the

2795
01:36:56,880 --> 01:36:59,520
ambitious national goals for co2

2796
01:36:58,719 --> 01:37:01,840
reduction

2797
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:03,920
the clock is ticking and even as we are

2798
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:04,880
still in a dire situation with covet

2799
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:07,280
around the globe

2800
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:08,960
there is hope as we have heard today

2801
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:09,920
from farmers from government global

2802
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:11,760
organizations

2803
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:13,520
private sectors there is a great

2804
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:15,360
potential that can be unlocked

2805
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:17,440
and that farmers and other actors in the

2806
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:18,239
supply chain around them can adapt and

2807
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:20,400
engage

2808
01:37:18,239 --> 01:37:22,159
with agility in a transformation for a

2809
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:24,480
more sustainable future

2810
01:37:22,159 --> 01:37:25,600
so once again thank you so much all of

2811
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,800
the speakers for your great

2812
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:28,719
contributions

2813
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:30,400
