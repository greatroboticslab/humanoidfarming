3
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,480
farmers often ask

4
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,680
whether they can combine their inoculant

5
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,480
with

6
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,399
seed applied pesticides when they're

7
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:56,000
sowing their legumes

8
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,600
in fact this was a leading issue

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,160
when we did a survey a number of years

10
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,399
ago that farmers really wanted to know

11
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,000
more about this topic so we're doing

12
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,199
some research on this at the university

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
of adelaide

14
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,200
and we're part way through that research

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,799
what we've found

16
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,880
so far is that of the fungicides and the

17
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,240
insecticide that we've tested

18
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,159
that thyram is particularly toxic to the

19
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,400
inoculant bacteria

20
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,439
so we haven't found any inoculant

21
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,080
bacteria that

22
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:30,799
are not killed by thyram and also

23
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,079
this goes to p pickle tea which contains

24
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,479
thyram as an

25
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,119
active ingredient plus evershield which

26
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:39,280
is

27
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:42,479
almost the same as p pickle tea so

28
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,240
thyram and people tea are the two seed

29
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,520
applied pesticides

30
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,680
to watch for and we have

31
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,320
some evidence from the lab and also from

32
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,280
the field that

33
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,880
the fungicides quite toxic to the

34
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,159
bacteria and can reduce

35
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,280
nodulation substantially

36
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:06,320
so what we're suggesting is that farmers

37
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,200
separate out the inoculant from

38
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,399
the seed by putting either a granule in

39
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,360
furrow

40
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,920
or putting a liquid stream in furrow if

41
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,200
they've got the capability of doing that

42
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,760
either a peat slurry or a

43
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,360
suspension of the easy rise freeze-dried

44
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,000
bacteria

45
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,160
in 2018 we did a field trial on the air

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,599
peninsula at the minipa

47
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,640
in the manipur region and the treatments

48
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,920
consisted of

49
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,160
peas coated with fungicide pickle tea or

50
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:41,360
not coated with pea pickle tea

51
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,640
then we added a peat formulation of

52
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,480
inoculant

53
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,640
or a freeze-dried formulation of

54
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,440
inoculant called easy rise

55
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,959
and we put the inoculant on either 24

56
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,360
hours before sowing or

57
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,560
one or two hours before sowing really

58
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,760
the only treatment

59
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,879
that gave us decent nodulation was

60
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,640
peach with no fungicide the other

61
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,879
treatments just failed to deliver on

62
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,360
nodulation and in fixation

63
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,080
in that field trial the fungicide was

64
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,200
quite

65
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,360
detrimental to nodulation

66
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,239
the other thing to note about that trial

67
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,720
was that

68
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,599
the conditions were really dry so we

69
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,640
think that

70
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:23,599
having that dry soil stress

71
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,440
plus the pesticide stress on seed the

72
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,720
combination of that really

73
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,519
affected the nodulation and in fixation

74
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,000
if a farmer does really want to coat the

75
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,519
seed

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
after applying the fungicide we've got a

77
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,319
number of suggestions

78
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,159
as to how to cope with that stress one

79
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,400
is to double the number of

80
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,680
bacteria double the dose of bacteria on

81
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,680
the seed

82
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,200
so we get a better chance of good

83
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,400
nodulation

84
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,599
and to sow as soon as possible after

85
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,720
coating the inoculant

86
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,239
because that will also lead to greater

87
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,120
numbers surviving

88
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,760
so into moist soil if you possibly can

89
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,439
as

90
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:07,760
ideal conditions and also finally

91
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,439
go into a paddock where you've already

92
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,959
grown that legume and have that

93
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,720
inoculant before

94
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,640
so you'll get a decent background to

95
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,720
start with we hope

96
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:27,880
so that should minimise any problems of

97
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:34,080
the toxicity

00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:36,160
