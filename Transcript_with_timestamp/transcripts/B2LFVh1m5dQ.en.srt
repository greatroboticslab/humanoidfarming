1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
welcome back everybody today we're going

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,759
to use an all-purpose plow from dirt dog

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,279
on a 10 25 r we're going to keep it

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,519
going with the spring tilling for some

5
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,480
seed prep later this year going to help

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,160
with the

7
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,519
the preparation for the screening plot

8
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,679
that we're going to put in

9
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,520
along kind of the perimeter so we used a

10
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,119
ripper previously the ground was a

11
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,640
little bit too frozen i think we're

12
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,400
probably close to a month beyond that

13
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,439
date now we've had plenty of warm

14
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,800
temperatures i don't think we'll have an

15
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,320
issue and now this is not going to go

16
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,560
down into the earth as far as that

17
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,760
ripper or that subsoiler would do so i

18
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,439
don't think we're gonna have as big of

19
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,200
an issue i've never used one of these

20
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,360
before i've always kind of been a tiller

21
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,280
guy right but i'm trying to branch out

22
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,040
try some new things give it a shot see

23
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,200
how it works as always we're sponsored

24
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,440
by borah wheel spacers they are made in

25
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,520
america have a lifetime warranty if your

26
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,960
tractor feels tippy side to side

27
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,559
especially if you have a cab on it then

28
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,160
adding a set of wheel spacers can make a

29
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,000
big difference get more information on

30
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,399
them at the link down below now dirt dog

31
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,239
makes these apps all-purpose plows in

32
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,399
various sizes so this is

33
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,399
a smaller one about four foot wide maybe

34
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,840
my hair over that but it's going to be

35
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,520
three shanks or three rippers they're

36
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,960
all spring loaded too so as you're going

37
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,119
along it's going to have some give to it

38
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,720
some flexibility so if you hit a a rock

39
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,560
or a root or something else or just have

40
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,159
some resistance it's going to it's going

41
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,840
to kind of give and go over top of it a

42
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,960
little bit and come back down i think

43
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,640
we'll probably have to do multiple

44
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,159
passes now i'm excited to play around

45
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,000
with it see how it works you can see

46
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,920
this is quick hitch compatible you can

47
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,840
also hook it up directly to a category

48
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,280
one three-point hitch we are a dirt dog

49
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,960
dealer we sell and ship all over the

50
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,159
country this is a made in america

51
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,560
product so if you're looking for

52
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,960
something pretty affordable to cultivate

53
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,640
or till up prepare your earth this could

54
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,479
be a good option for you to consider oh

55
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,720
yeah and one last thing

56
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,880
dirt dog does recommend seven horsepower

57
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,560
per shank so three shanks here 21

58
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,000
horsepower off the top of my head i

59
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,720
can't remember if that is engine

60
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,799
horsepower or pto horsepower this is not

61
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,720
using a pto so i would tend to think

62
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,320
they're referencing engine horsepower so

63
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,079
we should be just fine

64
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,360
i can't envision this having a problem

65
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,520
but i guess we'll find out soon enough

66
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,920
hey really quick not to interrupt but

67
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,840
this is part one of a two-part video all

68
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,880
right we're gonna compare the results of

69
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,640
an all-purpose plow versus a tiller

70
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,399
let you make your own decision on what

71
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,239
works best what has the best finished

72
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,640
results we're going to use a subcompact

73
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,160
tractor a 1025r so this could apply to

74
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,760
any tractor out there but we're talking

75
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,120
about the sub compacts right now there

76
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,200
are attachments out there sized

77
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,959
appropriately for small tractors medium

78
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,480
tractors big tractors you name it so

79
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,720
make sure you're subscribed to see part

80
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,720
number two

81
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:32,899
[Music]

82
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,319
so

83
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:51,780
[Music]

84
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,250

[Music]

90
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:56,610
[Music]

91
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,200
so

92
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,320
so

93
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:40,659

94
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,790

[Music]

105
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,960
all right so we're part way through i

106
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,039
have a down and back and a down and back

107
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,479
so four passes total but we're going to

108
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,560
go over it again

109
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,000
kind of figuring this thing out thought

110
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,880
it was going to be just to drop it down

111
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,400
and go uh right out of the gate but

112
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,000
started hitting a few roots and it would

113
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,520
actually bog this thing right down its

114
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,880
track so you do have to feather that

115
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,639
three point depending on your terrain a

116
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,160
little bit up and down

117
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,240
when it would really hang up and i'd be

118
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,160
sitting there spinning if i let let go

119
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,440
of the throttle let my foot off the gas

120
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,880
it would actually these spring loaded

121
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,400
ties would actually slightly pull the

122
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,680
machine backwards it was kind of funny

123
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,440
other than that

124
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,880
it's a piece of cake you know so just

125
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,000
keep your hand on that that three point

126
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,520
or maybe

127
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,120
don't go down all the way just go down

128
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,639
part way something like that and you're

129
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,400
gonna be okay

130
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,639
this is what it looks like with one pass

131
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,479
it doesn't well there's a lot of until

132
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,240
ground in between where those furrows

133
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,080
are at so we're going to go through and

134
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,759
try to dissect the difference there

135
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,639
maybe one additional pass can get it

136
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,639
done

137
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,919
it could take multiple passes i don't

138
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,840
know but this isn't very hard this took

139
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,520
maybe 10 or 15 minutes to go

140
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,960
down and back a couple times really easy

141
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,970
to do nice day to do it we're learning

142
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:09,240
as we go

[Music]

149
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,720
now you guys may have noticed this sweet

150
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,120
looking canopy right up above me and

151
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,440
this is a rhino hide canopy all right mr

152
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,120
don mccoy founded this company and my

153
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,120
brother and i were privileged enough to

154
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,279
be able to purchase this from him at the

155
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,479
beginning of the year so now

156
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,800
rhino height is something that we can

157
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,720
sell you directly now this canopy is

158
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,880
unique for several reasons number one

159
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,279
it's very lightweight all right so this

160
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,360
is a one person job to take it on to

161
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,519
take it off you have a couple of wing

162
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,040
nuts here that you just loosen up you

163
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,800
can slide it right off so if you want to

164
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,040
take it down the road if you want to put

165
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,560
it in your garage it's easy enough to do

166
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,080
with one person all right it weighs how

167
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,760
much does it weigh

168
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,920
yeah it weighs 15 pounds so it's very

169
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,080
lightweight but rhino hide that name

170
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,480
suggests something this thing is tough

171
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,839
as nails i'm telling you we drove over

172
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,519
it with a

173
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,480
5000 series tractor so that thing

174
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:20,000
weighed over 10 000 pounds don has shot

175
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,839
this thing with a shotgun uh we dropped

176
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,760
40 or 70 pound weights on this thing it

177
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,040
didn't break this thing is meant to be

178
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,560
indestructible all right that's a

179
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,560
downside of a lot of canopies they're

180
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,320
big and bulky they're heavy and they're

181
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,240
going to get damaged if you hit a tree

182
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,080
limb or a tree branch or something else

183
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,040
so this is meant to solve all those pain

184
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,880
points it's made out of similar to that

185
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,320
bed liner type material like a drop in

186
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,760
bed liner in your truck so if you know

187
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:46,040
what that is you know those things can

188
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,040
take a beating so can this

189
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:49,380
[Music]

190
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,950
so

191
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,950
[Music]

192
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,390
[Music]

193
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:16,760
[Music]

194
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,760
do

195
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:26,139
do

196
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,139
[Music]

197
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:54,350

198

[Music]

199
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,360
so

200
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:12,760
[Music]

201
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,640
okay lessons learned from pass number

202
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,920
two

203
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,440
this first one i'm a little bit

204
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,399
embarrassed about and i kind of let you

205
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,720
guys down at some point four wheel drive

206
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,959
early on i think disengaged so i was in

207
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,320
two wheel drive and i think that's why i

208
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,800
was spinning

209
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,000
my wheels literally i wasn't even paying

210
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,920
attention to the front wheels not

211
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,079
spinning but

212
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,160
just on the way back down and back on

213
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,360
the second pass the first time back i

214
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,760
noticed the front wheels weren't

215
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,519
spinning i was like what that's going on

216
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,360
i disengaged the four wheel drive

217
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,639
somehow so i re-engaged that that seemed

218
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,040
to make a world of difference being able

219
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,600
to put that plow deeper and just carry

220
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,200
on a lot easier but this is a very rough

221
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,800
ride that's what i'm finding out very

222
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,040
hard to stay

223
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,120
on line where i want to go the first

224
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,639
pass was easy the second pass was very

225
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,760
challenging with all these big clods all

226
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,200
around

227
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,040
who knows maybe the third pass will be a

228
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,440
little bit easier as it kind of breaks

229
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:14,000
them up a little bit i don't know but i

230
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,360
gotta try to get in between these rows

231
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,560
and that's been a challenge hopefully

232
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,560
this third pass knocks it out

233
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:28,920
[Music]

234
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,920
so

235
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:48,859
[Music]

236
00:12:49,040 --> 00:13:11,529
do

237
00:12:51,490 --> 00:13:11,529
[Music]

238
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:34,179
do

239
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:34,179
[Music]

240
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
so

241
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:54,899
[Music]

242
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,079
all right so third pass

243
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,720
three more observations for you number

244
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,800
one this ride does not get easier that

245
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,160
was like riding the broken buck there

246
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,160
for a while

247
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,920
it just constantly wants to go back into

248
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,920
the same furrows that have already been

249
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:16,480
created so it's very hard to try to keep

250
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:19,040
it aligned and and dig up more earth

251
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,199
i found it was easier i was trying to

252
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,120
use the outside of the of the tire to

253
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,800
line up with this outside

254
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,959
tine but i found it easier to use the

255
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,360
center line of the hood to try to stay

256
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,959
in the middle of a row instead and then

257
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,720
match up with the center tine here the

258
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:35,199
third observation is actually i didn't

259
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,040
bottom out in my seat once and i noticed

260
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,320
it late in the third pass and i had

261
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,920
forgot

262
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,440
i had this little air bladder thing that

263
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,639
i put in here a little

264
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,560
um inflatable shim it is and i put that

265
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,320
in here and it's really helped prevent

266
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,720
bottoming out completely on this seat

267
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,720
and it kind of just sprung into my head

268
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,560
that was the reason why because i was

269
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,000
hitting some major bumps this whole time

270
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,040
this whole machine was rocking and

271
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,480
rolling

272
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,480
that was a pretty uncomfortable

273
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,399
experience after the first pass and we

274
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,320
don't have a lot of big boulders here

275
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,320
there's a lot of smaller rocks that are

276
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,680
strewn throughout and this was an

277
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,360
overgrown field that had a lot of

278
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,959
automotive and other things in it too so

279
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,680
i think we're hitting some routes there

280
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:15,760
but this is pretty easy conditions to

281
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,000
work in overall now i can't say this is

282
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,320
my number one tool pardon me wants to go

283
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,800
grab a tiller and just make a pass right

284
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,399
next to it to see how it looks

285
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,519
but maybe we'll do that in another video

286
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,839
now i don't want to make it seem like

287
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,680
it's all bad i mean it's a decent tool

288
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,440
it's cheaper than a tiller there's less

289
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,360
moving parts there's no gear box pto

290
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,240
shaft anything like that it's a lighter

291
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,000
piece of equipment so i mean overall you

292
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,399
can see the results here this is what my

293
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,399
grandpa's fields used to look like

294
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,240
every year it seemed like so this will

295
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,320
work but i just think personally a

296
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,320
tiller does a lot better job with just

297
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,399
one tool where we've tilled virgin

298
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,639
ground all over out here in just one

299
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,880
pass or even a second pass and it's just

300
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,560
a completely level even

301
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,639
consistent seed bed that's prepped and

302
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,240
ready to go without doing anything else

303
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,160
this just doesn't quite hold a candle to

304
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,000
it so anyway if you are looking for

305
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,000
something to help till up your ground

306
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,680
whether it's a plow a disc a tiller

307
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,320
we're happy to help we sell and ship all

308
