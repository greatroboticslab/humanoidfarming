00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:06,120
hello and welcome to my garden today we

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,120
are looking at the onions that I have

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:12,120
planted here in containers I started

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:16,199
these from seed way back in January

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:19,440
February and we are now nearing the end

6
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:21,359
of July and these onions have all

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,240
flopped over as you can see that's a

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:27,359
sure sign that they are almost ready to

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,180
harvest I've left them laying here like

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,460
this for a week or so try to refrain

11
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,960
from watering them so that they dry out

12
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,660
a little bit

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,180
if we just zoom in here you can see

14
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:42,120
these are my yellow Globes

15
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:45,000
they have flopped over the necks are

16
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,980
soft they've started to develop kind of

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,260
a skin around them here

18
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,899
so I think it's time to pull them out

19
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,420
and let them dry out and cure and

20
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:55,680
hopefully we can store them for several

21
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,100
months

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:02,640
so hopefully I can get a nice supply of

23
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,500
these cured and can store in a cool spot

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,960
in my basement

25
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,900
so I'm going to start off by pulling

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,540
these onions and storing them in my

27
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,520
garden Wagon here so I think this wagon

28
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:18,000
here is going to be a perfect spot for

29
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,880
them to cure off for the next week or

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,340
two they'll get lots of air flow we can

31
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,520
store this in a spot out of the direct

32
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,799
sunlight where there's lots of wind and

33
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,640
hopefully this will be a great spot for

34
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,640
them to cure

35
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:37,079
so my onions aren't super huge but it's

36
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,460
it's an improvement from last year for

37
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:41,939
me personally

38
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:45,119
especially these yellow Globes here

39
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:47,400
they turned out really nice

40
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,560
pretty happy with those

41
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,020
so I'm just going to

42
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,939
pull them all out here

43
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,860
lay them out in my

44
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:58,740
wagon

45
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:02,100
I do have some Walla Wallas also in this

46
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:04,500
tub on this side I don't know

47
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,960
they could have been a little bit bigger

48
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:10,679
I know Walla Wallas are normally a lot

49
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,720
bigger than that but nonetheless

50
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:14,819
this is what I got

51
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,220
I'm pretty happy

52
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:19,680
so just kind of finger around them

53
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,700
gently pull them out so that they come

54
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,700
out with all their roots

55
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:30,800
so picking onions obviously a very easy

56
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,800
thing to do

57
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:36,060
definitely the yellow Globes are looking

58
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,560
bigger than the Walla Walla

59
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,560
so I don't do a lot of in-ground

60
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:44,459
gardening other than my potatoes

61
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,920
and I think these have done well

62
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:50,599
for container gardening

63
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,599
it's been very easy to maintain

64
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,160
pretty easy to pull weeds out of these

65
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,160
containers

66
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:03,720
I think I gave them a fertilizer once or

67
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:05,760
twice in the month of July early June

68
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,760
so these little tiny ones here will

69
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,800
probably get eaten up pretty quickly

70
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,000
and in this tub it's all Walla Walla

71
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,220
onions

72
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,379
I tried to keep them spaced out so that

73
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,420
they you know could get as big as

74
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:20,220
possible

75
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,440
I did a little spooning around them

76
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,700
early July when they were starting to

77
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,400
develop

78
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:29,760
try to thin them out by picking the odd

79
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,099
ones that were too close together

80
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,040
again not a bad size these will be great

81
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:36,480
just you know one for a meal when you

82
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,560
need an onion these are going to be a

83
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,560
nice size to cook with

84
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:45,840
we cook with a lot of onions

85
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:48,980
pretty much on a daily basis I'm adding

86
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,980
onions to my cooking

87
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:53,459
so I'm excited to have a good Supply

88
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:56,519
that'll hopefully lasts me

89
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:57,900
you know till the end of this year

90
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:01,879
I just think that's beautiful it's like

91
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,879
a bouquet of beautiful onions

92
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:09,360
so I don't have a cold room per se in my

93
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,879
basement we have in-floor heat in our

94
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,620
basement so don't have a cold room set

95
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:15,060
up down there unfortunately we didn't

96
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,040
think about that

97
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,359
when we built our house 20 some years

98
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,940
ago

99
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:23,580
it's a beautiful nice cozy basement with

100
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,720
that floor heat but there is one corner

101
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,660
of the

102
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,699
the space and empty bedroom now that uh

103
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,699
the core heat doesn't seem to be working

104
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:35,180
very well never did so that room is

105
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:38,520
actually extra cool it's in the north

106
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:40,800
west corner of the house it doesn't get

107
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,320
a lot of direct sunlight in that room so

108
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,880
I think that's going to be uh my new

109
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,280
cold room this winter so we're going to

110
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,400
hopefully get some shelves set up in

111
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,160
there to store potatoes and onions

112
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,460
and my last container here is the ruby

113
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:58,500
ring onion so these are a red onion

114
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:01,699
again we've been picking these a lot and

115
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,699
eating them fresh

116
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,979
so this is my ruby ring onion Harvest

117
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:13,139
here

118
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:16,500
so there is my onion Harvest for 2023

119
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:18,979
not bad for a little garden

120
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:22,800
so I'm going to leave these in this

121
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:25,139
wagon to dry and cure I'll push them

122
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,660
over in a spot that's kind of out of

123
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:30,900
direct sunlight it gets lots of airflow

124
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,160
if you want these stems here to kind of

125
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,740
dry up

126
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,259
maybe some more skin to develop around

127
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:39,960
that and that will help protect it and

128
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:44,100
keep it fresh so that it will store

129
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:46,259
longer over these next few months

130
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,360
so I've already done some harvesting of

131
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:50,220
my garlic a few days ago that I didn't

132
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,680
do any filming of but this is what I've

133
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:55,380
gotten so far so this is a hard neck

134
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:58,020
garlic variety that I planted last fall

135
00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:00,840
here in the in the ground some of the

136
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:03,060
cloves were from my previous Harvest

137
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,460
from last year that I replanted

138
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,960
somewhere I purchased from the store so

139
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,520
how you know that they are ready to

140
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,259
harvest is when you look down at the

141
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,660
base here and you can see that some of

142
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:16,199
the leaves are starting to yellow and

143
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:18,720
die back usually two to four leaves

144
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:20,520
is a sign that these are ready to

145
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,860
harvest

146
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,560
and like the onions you should try and

147
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:28,139
dry out the soil and not water them for

148
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:30,360
a week or two before you harvest just so

149
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:33,120
when you pull them out you don't do any

150
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,220
damage if they're too wet so I have my

151
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,560
soaker hose that runs through the garlic

152
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:40,139
here into my lasagna garden bed so I'm

153
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,360
running it every day or two so I didn't

154
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:43,979
really dry it out in some of these spots

155
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,080
like I should have

156
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:48,539
and then as you can see when I tried to

157
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,220
pull this one out it kind of ripped away

158
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:52,500
the roots because it was a little too

159
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,840
wet and soft so this one will probably

160
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,580
have to be eaten right away it might not

161
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:59,280
cure as well

162
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:02,460
but just to show you give you an idea of

163
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,680
the difference between a garlic clove

164
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:08,039
that's well watered and some that aren't

165
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:11,220
as well watered this one was growing

166
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:12,720
right next to my soaker hose all summer

167
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,720
same with that one there as you can see

168
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,680
they're a lot stronger and bigger so

169
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,539
watering definitely does make a

170
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,120
difference this is probably the biggest

171
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:24,020
garlic clove I've ever grown pretty

172
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,020
excited about that one

173
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:29,520
so the spot that I picked to grow garlic

174
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:32,819
in is right next to some of my Choke

175
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,979
Cherry bushes here which you can see are

176
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:37,020
almost ready to pick

177
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:39,120
and I'm dealing with a lot of suckers

178
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,199
from the choke cherries coming into this

179
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,880
area

180
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:43,620
so I've been kind of battling that I'm

181
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,639
not sure if this is the best place for

182
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,699
the garlic

183
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,580
I do want to try next year to grow

184
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:53,520
garlic in containers because

185
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:56,400
that's how I do most of my gardening I'm

186
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:59,400
just not sure how they will make it

187
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,319
through the winter in a container if the

188
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:05,520
cold weather that we go through you know

189
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:07,919
the minus 30 35 degree cold in the

190
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,900
winter can be pretty brutal on any

191
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,780
perennials that you're trying to keep

192
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:15,599
alive so we'll see how that goes we can

193
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:17,400
also plant garlic in the spring early

194
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:20,699
early spring so I might do that as well

195
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:23,340
but it's so easy to just put in the

196
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:25,919
ground keep it watered very little

197
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:28,979
maintenance and it's a great

198
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,720
Easy Storage over the winter garlic is

199
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:33,659
something that like the onions we pretty

200
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:37,140
much are cooking and eating every day so

201
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:39,599
the more I can Harvest and store myself

202
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:41,459
would be great

203
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,700
so I just want to show you how I'm just

204
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:46,680
trying to kind of work around the clove

205
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,720
here with my hand

206
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,940
kind of pull away that dirt you want to

207
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,760
be able to to pull it out without doing

208
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:55,920
too much damage to the roots

209
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,320
again it's a little bit

210
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,440
pretty moist right here because I've

211
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,540
been watering through here but I'm going

212
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,519
to try and pull it out without

213
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:08,459
doing too much damage you can use some

214
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,480
kind of a potato fork or I'm just using

215
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:13,200
my

216
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:16,080
hori hori knife here kind of get under

217
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,940
and then gently pull

218
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,839
there we go

219
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,839
the garlic

220
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,279
something else you want to remember to

221
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:29,399
do if you're growing garlic is to in the

222
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:31,800
usually early July the garlic starts to

223
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:34,080
send out these what we call Garlic

224
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:37,399
Scapes so they shoot this out it's got

225
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,779
seed in it so the garlic is trying to

226
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:42,839
self-generate some new seeds so that it

227
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:44,640
can you know grow some new garlic so you

228
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:47,519
want to make sure that you are watching

229
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,920
for these Scapes in your garlic and

230
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,260
harvest them off that way the energy

231
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,420
will go back down into the bulb and the

232
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:56,580
garlic will keep growing and be bigger

233
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:58,100
if you leave these on you know a lot of

234
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:00,420
the energy is going to go into

235
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:02,940
self-seeding so you want to just watch

236
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:04,740
for those and make sure you chop them

237
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:08,279
off they're usually kind of a spirally

238
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:10,140
circle and they make a great item to

239
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:11,640
cook with you can chop them up and put

240
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:14,399
them into your cooking they have a nice

241
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:17,100
garlic flavor as well

242
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,260
so this is the Garlic Harvest you know

243
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,480
it's not a huge huge amount of garlic

244
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:24,540
but I think it's a great

245
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:26,880
amount for two people my husband and I

246
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:30,660
are the only ones living at home now so

247
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:33,240
this will definitely last us a while

248
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:36,779
um next year I planted the really double

249
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:39,720
down maybe and grow a lot more garlic

250
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:43,740
trying some new methods in containers

251
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:47,579
maybe try growing some in the spring

252
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:49,680
and see which works best for us

253
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:51,839
so this hard neck garlic is is a good

254
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,839
variety for you know our growing zone

255
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:57,860
here in the Zone 3 Canada

256
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:57,860
used to do really well

257
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:03,959
so for now that's all I'm gonna do just

258
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:05,760
chop back the uh the tops I'm just going

259
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:07,440
to let them dry

260
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,959
so that some of that dirt comes off

261
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,660
naturally let them develop a little skin

262
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:15,600
layer cut back these roots

263
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:17,459
and get them ready for storage so thank

264
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,680
you for joining me while I harvest my

265
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:21,899
onions and garlic out of the garden so

266
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,820
I'll be storing this Wagon in a spot

267
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:25,800
kind of out of direct sunlight it's

268
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:28,140
getting lots of wind we haven't been

269
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,779
getting much rain so I'm not too worried

270
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:32,640
about them getting wet we'll leave them

271
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:35,040
to dry for a week or two and then

272
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,320
hopefully they'll be ready to store in
