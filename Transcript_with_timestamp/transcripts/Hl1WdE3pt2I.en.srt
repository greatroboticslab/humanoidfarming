1
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,920
uh pin bar do we need to worry about

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,960
insect at this early stage do we need to

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:17,560
spray no why not at this stage the the

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,880
insect damage is can be completely

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,160
compensated for by the plant so normally

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,560
the things you get at the early stage

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,800
are things like Leaf

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,400
folder little bit of Lea folder and whal

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,560
maggot wh maggot actually is the biggest

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:32,599
problem this time of year but as the

11
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,879
plant GR it just it just disappears

12
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:35,840
because the plant as the leaves get

13
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:38,360
thicker the maggots can't actually eat

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,039
the leaf but you know I I keep worrying

15
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,200
I see things on the leaves like this

16
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:45,000
here and some things chewed on it this

17
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,320
is a wh maggot that's a wh maggot yeah

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,640
there nothing to worry about no problem

19
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:54,760
no problem is yeah in fact this is even

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,520
light it's not even uh you know a normal

21
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:59,120
infestation of world

22
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,920
maggot what is this here there's a some

23
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:05,360
egg M on it here what these are these

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:09,080
are probably some sort of paracoid that

25
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,759
has so it's a wasp cocoon and these are

26
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:14,320
beneficial again so it's good news uh

27
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:16,680
these will fly off there's about 40 of

28
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:20,159
them there so they'll fly off then and

29
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:24,840
parasitize things like Leaf folder

30
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,600
um larvea or um other caterpillars so

31
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,320
they're again a beneficial

32
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:32,520
insect fin bar I saw already saw a few

33
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,880
lady beetles is what I would call them

34
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,000
are they are they playing much of a role

35
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,439
at this early they're also very

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,920
important they're also feeding on on the

37
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:44,680
natural of the the herbivore insects so

38
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:47,280
they eat eggs mainly um also good uh

39
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,240
predators of apids and also the

40
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,840
dragonfly there's a lot of dragonfly

41
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,439
flying around one of the things when you

42
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,600
think about insects and rice you have to

43
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:57,759
remember that in the water another

44
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,280
problem generated by rice is mosquitoes

45
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:03,079
and the dragonfly larva live in the

46
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,880
water they have a very big uh strong jaw

47
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:07,719
and they pre on the dragon on the uh

48
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,119
mosquito Lara so they're keeping your

49
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:12,959
mosquitoes down so really there's a

50
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:14,840
whole ecosystem here functioning to keep

51
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,360
everything in order I mean one really

52
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,680
has to look hard to see all these things

53
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,920
I see a little spider web here in which

54
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,480
some some little insects are caught in

55
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,720
there what are those these are those

56
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,720
midges that are flying around these are

57
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:29,560
the decomposer midg so they're again uh

58
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,680
beneficial and spiders are very

59
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,440
important

60
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:36,040
predators of things like plant oppers

61
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,400
mainly plant hoers so but but you know

62
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,360
when I look around I see lots of crits

63
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,319
here know insects of all kinds little

64
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,760
things flying or crawling or so is that

65
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,120
one of the reasons that some Farmers

66
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,879
think they have to spray because they

67
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,959
see all these insects well a lot of

68
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,640
people don't understand what these

69
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:53,720
insects are doing so a lot of people

70
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,480
when they see these swarms of midges for

71
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,640
example that are decomposing the the

72
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,680
material they think it's a PL and

73
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,360
they'll spray uh the same with the World

74
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,560
mag one of the biggest problems with

75
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,480
world magga is that it it induces

76
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:11,040
Farmers to spray but we never see any

77
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:13,640
yield reduction the same with um uh Leaf

78
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,440
folder looking quite good Lee do you

79
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,640
have any worries about insects when do

80
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,840
we need to start worrying about them

81
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:23,280
again a little bit in finbar's hands my

82
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,720
knowledge of insects is not particularly

83
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,560
profuse I'm probably more worried about

84
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,200
the rats I think the rats have just

85
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:33,040
given us an early warning over there

86
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:36,959
yeah look at this it's all chopped off

87
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:40,840
seedlings here whole SW chopped out

88
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:43,640
which uh probably looks like red damage

89
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:48,720
so some mean red went through here and

90
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,720
uh basically created a total empty patch

91
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:54,239
here just chopped off on the right on

92
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:57,879
the on the surface

93
00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:01,040
here horrible not much we can do about

94
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:01,040
that one
