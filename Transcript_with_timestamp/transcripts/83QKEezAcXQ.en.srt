00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:12,889
hi my name is anneka Kumar and the

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:14,629
founder CEO from quality digital I coach

3
00:00:12,889 --> 00:00:17,060
a platform that connects small-scale

4
00:00:14,629 --> 00:00:18,440
farmers with investors for the purpose

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,910
of booster food production in the

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,609
country

7
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:26,150
I'm proud of the startup in much about

8
00:00:22,609 --> 00:00:28,429
21 months ago and today we've been able

9
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:31,939
to work with about 7,000 small-scale

10
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:34,010
farmers across ten states in Nigeria so

11
00:00:31,939 --> 00:00:37,760
what we've done is we've pretty much

12
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:40,730
simplified how people now get involved

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,789
in farming practices so now you can go

14
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:46,430
on a mobile device or now move an app or

15
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:49,670
you've gone on websites and decide that

16
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:53,270
you want to be amazed rice or suya or

17
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:55,850
cassava farmer and then at that point

18
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:59,329
you make a decision and then invest your

19
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:01,730
money through the platform when you just

20
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:03,920
so we then engage a farm on your behalf

21
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:06,110
that becomes a partner with you where

22
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,820
then goes to work on the farm and he's

23
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:11,210
providing you with updates in front of

24
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:13,400
pictures videos and texts until the

25
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:14,869
farmer cycle is done in addition to that

26
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,909
you can also visit your farmer that

27
00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:19,159
you've partnered with to find out about

28
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:20,990
the progress of the fab right here at

29
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:23,210
the farm so that level of involvement

30
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:25,189
we're now partnering with real farmers

31
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:27,439
that are working on farms elsewhere

32
00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:28,850
gives people opportunity to now be

33
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:32,210
anywhere they are using mobile devices

34
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:33,920
and now I too have now become a farmer

35
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:35,720
because I got involved with hard rock

36
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,030
and then at the end of the harvest

37
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,250
season you don't get your body back

38
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:41,299
another return after habits so you just

39
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:43,880
be able to go through the full cycle

40
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:47,930
through your mobile device or or the

41
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:49,759
website top-quality itself is designed

42
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:52,009
for the guys that wanna invest but

43
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,390
always go to the farm and so you're not

44
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:56,270
able to bring it back through a platform

45
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:59,479
for us to do local fast on the father's

46
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:01,399
side however the advantage we able to

47
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:03,439
bring to their base that we be gettin

48
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:06,610
the imputes they need at low cost so

49
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:09,220
they get impious seed fertilize a label

50
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:11,710
they get technical know-how to work

51
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,900
Ferb's and they get back up access for

52
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:15,730
them to sell their five reviews in all

53
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,140
of these points when it comes to

54
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:18,970
impedance there's not much around

55
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,220
technology that we do with our regards

56
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:23,350
when it comes to technical know-how in

57
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:25,840
other extant the hands of our extension

58
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:27,520
extension workers what with this we

59
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,560
provide the fathers of the ability

60
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,560
building solutions around providing

61
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,790
focus our ability for them to start

62
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,760
interacting with tech coffee especially

63
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:39,850
that him physically physically PDA using

64
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:42,420
the SSD called touch points like that to

65
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:44,470
reach out to them together to provide

66
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,180
whatever questions they have at this

67
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:49,480
district caffeine specialist are able to

68
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:51,370
respond to that or the bucket side we

69
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,410
then provide the farmers with the best

70
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:55,630
bucket of evil as a result of the

71
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:56,920
efforts for I headway were able to

72
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:59,470
source for people that are looking to

73
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:02,080
buy the commodity or by reading habits

74
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:04,720
that we're now introducing African

75
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,720
farmers to the technologies we tell them

76
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,040
will help them improve their farm

77
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,100
operations or increase the yield by

78
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:15,459
provided demonstration farms where we're

79
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:17,110
able to now find a bastard of farmers so

80
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:19,150
in the competition 405's

81
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:20,500
each having a hectare we began two or

82
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,720
three that we can work with in the first

83
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,730
year I will be sure that see how we able

84
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,400
to improve this yield see how were able

85
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:29,800
to get him market access see how were

86
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,780
able to deploy the EPS with him and see

87
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,700
how much the farmer has speed that in

88
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,470
itself helps to sell and as the

89
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:38,290
irrespective of how ignorant the father

90
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:40,360
is he sees four by a do it well it's

91
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:43,230
enough knowledge for him to do that he

92
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,230
needs to chop all

93
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,699
