1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,460
my name is dawn delhi i'm a senior

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,830
scientist with dari indeed based in

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,420
canterbury but for the last 10 or so

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,210
years have been involved in research

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,759
projects around wintering in also fog

6
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:18,330
system design and Zetland

7
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:20,789
in South Otago and currently I'm leading

8
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,800
the farm systems implementation at

9
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:24,330
southern Derry hub and a couple of

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,300
projects relating to what a bit of

11
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,560
feeding so today and my session what I'm

12
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,300
going to try to do is bring together

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,820
some of the key messages that you've

14
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,700
heard from Nick and Helen and relation

15
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,940
to good management practice and animal

16
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:42,329
welfare and talk about the importance of

17
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:44,850
pedak setup and contingency plans for

18
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:46,620
adverse weather and partway through I'm

19
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,739
going to flick over to Olivia and she's

20
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:53,129
going to give us some perspective from a

21
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:55,610
max livestock point of view so next

22
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:55,610
slide please

23
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:02,680
so why is it important that we have

24
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:05,740
pedak grazing plans well first of all it

25
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:08,920
helps to see wintering expectations and

26
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:10,600
if you can do this with your team it

27
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,520
means that everybody is on the same page

28
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:15,490
and they know what success is going to

29
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:18,670
look like for your farm it also helps

30
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:20,920
the team to understand the way that you

31
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:22,870
do things in a particular way on your

32
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,760
farm so we know there's lots of

33
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:27,130
different systems out here and everybody

34
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:29,560
does things slightly differently so

35
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:31,180
understanding the why for your farm

36
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,300
means that they'll be in a better

37
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:38,619
position to make informed decisions if

38
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:40,869
things are going off plan also by having

39
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:43,060
individual paddock grazing plans you can

40
00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:45,640
identify and highlight the risks of

41
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:48,310
specific paddocks so if I think about

42
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,560
the southern dairy hub we went to on

43
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:53,680
both our upper terrace and also on our

44
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,619
lower flex we know that the soil type on

45
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,680
our lowest terrace for a lot of the flat

46
00:01:56,619 --> 00:02:02,590
as Hibiya we have a number of paddocks

47
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,140
with critical source areas and also we

48
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:07,210
have a waterway that runs through the

49
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,030
middle so those paddocks have quite

50
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:11,799
different risks in terms of

51
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:14,950
implementation of grazing compared with

52
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:16,690
the ones on our upper terrace the other

53
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:18,880
thing was having these pallet grazing

54
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:21,160
plans is it allows you to discuss

55
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,959
implant for the adverse weather events

56
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:26,260
and think about some of those things

57
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:29,290
that Helens just highlighted in relation

58
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:31,660
to animal welfare and it yes the the

59
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:34,390
overall objective is really looking at

60
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:38,920
maximizing the chances of achieving your

61
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:41,140
spring curving in lemon targets so what

62
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:43,500
I'm going to go through an exercise

63
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:47,880
thank so much

64
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:49,650
as just the key factors to consider in

65
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,720
the plane and it's really about bringing

66
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:55,770
together things that neck in hello

67
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:59,310
talked about onto into a concise form

68
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:01,770
and sharing it with the team or

69
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:04,050
developing with the team so what I'm

70
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:04,830
going to talk about is and they recently

71
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,770
released

72
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:10,140
brickbeard wintering resource it's an

73
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:12,240
update obvious accessible imposture

74
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,550
wintering material that's been out there

75
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,800
previously so in terms of the plan

76
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:20,940
thinking about your critical source

77
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:24,030
areas in waterways putting them on your

78
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:25,770
on your map then with it you can look at

79
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:28,410
your grazing direction and how you can

80
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:30,180
utilize in a shelter where your bales

81
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:32,130
are going to be placed how you're going

82
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:35,340
to manage your portable troughs and

83
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:37,800
alongside the back fencing and then also

84
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,320
looking at more access points you've got

85
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:43,140
to the paddock and do your specific

86
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:46,709
access points for people animals and

87
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:49,080
vehicles so we'll just move on and look

88
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:51,510
at what the resources are that you need

89
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,200
to develop this plan so it's not

90
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:59,580
actually a lot of resource required

91
00:03:54,200 --> 00:04:02,430
either affirm map or within the brake

92
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:04,260
feed wintering guides there are some

93
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:07,320
resource templates that you can use if

94
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:10,650
you don't have a farm that you need some

95
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:15,750
writing material pens or pencils the

96
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:18,299
farm team in some dedicated time so what

97
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:21,150
you may choose to do is if you've got a

98
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:23,910
number of panics on your farm and you've

99
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:25,080
got a few on your team maybe give each

100
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:27,000
member of the team

101
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,160
I've had it to go away and think through

102
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,419
the initial plan for and then come back

103
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:35,160
as a group exercise or n discuss what

104
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:36,990
everybody's come up with one of the

105
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,900
things that we've found valuable at the

106
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:45,479
southern dairy hub is using Google Maps

107
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:48,500
over our farm map and from there we can

108
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:51,060
pick up sometimes some more subtle

109
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,740
critical source areas that we might need

110
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,410
to deal with they might not be weak when

111
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,380
they're in grass but potentially can be

112
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:59,800
a challenge

113
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:03,700
when the Herren crop so yeah just get

114
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:06,520
your farm team involved and start

115
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:08,950
documenting how you're planning on

116
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:13,990
grazing those paddocks next slide thanks

117
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:17,050
Hamish the other thing with developing

118
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:19,660
those pellet plans is thinking about

119
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:22,690
your how that fits with your address

120
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:25,420
with a contingency plan so Helens

121
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:28,090
highlighted some of these aspects were

122
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:31,530
really so from the animal welfare

123
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:34,240
perspective the plan needs to consider

124
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:37,240
access to shelter so we have you've got

125
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:42,820
those opportunities what does the you're

126
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:46,810
lying surface look like and also the

127
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:48,970
access to feed so in potentially having

128
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:51,340
additional feed available for periods of

129
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:52,960
adverse events from an environmental

130
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,390
perspective we need to take into

131
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,730
consideration and you salt right and

132
00:05:55,390 --> 00:06:01,840
what that looks like after 2 or 3 days

133
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:05,560
of heavy rain in wet weather looking at

134
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:10,540
any areas that maybe came come larger

135
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:14,380
risk in terms of runoff and to surface

136
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:16,390
water ways and and particularly any

137
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:18,820
flooding risk that there might be as

138
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:21,160
well in the third area for our

139
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:24,130
contingency plan to consider is around

140
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:27,280
people in safety so having developed the

141
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:31,810
plan as everybody on board with it and

142
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:34,660
how easy is it to implement when they be

143
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:40,180
it may arise how can you keep your

144
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:43,150
people safe and being able to access the

145
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:46,090
the paddocks in the animals through that

146
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:50,440
period of time and for snow means

147
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:53,140
keeping particularly animals safe if we

148
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:56,560
lose power during that event so just

149
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:58,450
move on and look at some of the factors

150
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,570
or things that you can consider in terms

151
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:03,939
of an invis plan for cash walk so things

152
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:07,460
Hamish

153
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:09,349
so in terms our contingency plan for

154
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,419
cattle some of the options well

155
00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:13,909
initially we need to think about and

156
00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:16,819
their feed budgeting process having an

157
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:20,449
additional feed on hand for that period

158
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:24,169
of time so recommendations having an

159
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:26,270
extra team sit there looking at options

160
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:28,669
to increase the area are available

161
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:32,029
through this adverse event so that might

162
00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:34,849
be by giving an extra break up of crop

163
00:07:32,029 --> 00:07:37,430
we need to be mindful with Fatih Beach

164
00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:40,099
and depending on what the allocation

165
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:43,219
level is that that may not be feasible

166
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:47,000
option without risking animal health

167
00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:50,090
issues however there may be instances we

168
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,150
actually taking your back fence further

169
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:56,120
away from the crop face may allow the

170
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:58,069
animals to EXCI some drier areas that

171
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,810
I've already been through and gives them

172
00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:02,839
more space to spread out and find those

173
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:06,620
those better areas when you're

174
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:10,159
developing your pet grazing plan looking

175
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:12,379
it is their opportunity to save crop and

176
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:14,599
a drier lower risk part of the paddock

177
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:17,150
may be a week's worth of feed Thea that

178
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:21,319
you can bring animals back to if

179
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:23,300
necessary or as I mentioned earlier what

180
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:25,189
we look at the southern dairy hunters

181
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:28,069
the opportunity to bring animals of a

182
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:31,610
heavier soils on to dry a lower risk

183
00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:33,740
Penix up on the upper terrace if you're

184
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:35,740
looking at out of pedak options there

185
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:39,289
might be opportunity to stand off and

186
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:41,089
laneways or yards or some rough grass

187
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:44,120
areas but it's important to remember

188
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:46,160
that cows don't particularly or animals

189
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,320
don't particularly like lying on hard

190
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,130
concrete surfaces so that's really a

191
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,899
short-term solution and there are some

192
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:56,480
may be opportunity to use some safety

193
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:58,010
blocks when I say save tree blocks

194
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,860
probably not a good idea to have your

195
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:02,990
pregnant animals and areas with

196
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:05,209
macrocarpa but there might be some pine

197
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:07,190
plantations you can use so now I'm going

198
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:08,870
to hand over to Olivia who's going to go

199
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:10,220
through and what you might need to

200
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:11,060
consider differently from the sheep

201
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,790
perspective

202
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:15,920
thanks for that dawn use some of those

203
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:17,779
cater options obviously guys can be used

204
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,339
but for other livestock

205
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:20,689
including sheep and deer there might be

206
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:21,680
some other options that you haven't

207
00:09:20,689 --> 00:09:23,269
thought of and I'm just going to go

208
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,269
through some of them for you to consider

209
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:28,160
so getting livestock to shout in areas

210
00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:29,899
with water you may be able to consider a

211
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,300
grass runoff paddock when the weather is

212
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:34,220
foul and have other options like

213
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:36,110
utilizing green and sheet nuts while in

214
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:38,059
those areas if it's going to be for

215
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:40,759
extended period of time to make sure you

216
00:09:38,059 --> 00:09:43,180
can maximize shelter again you can use

217
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:45,949
those lower risk Drive headaches as well

218
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:47,779
you may consider larger breaks or day

219
00:09:45,949 --> 00:09:50,059
breaks or no number of people are doing

220
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:52,339
that now as well from a deer perspective

221
00:09:50,059 --> 00:09:55,279
do you require bigger breaks than cattle

222
00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:57,379
and some deer farmers have been giving

223
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,269
deer the whole paddock rather than strip

224
00:09:57,379 --> 00:10:02,149
grazing ensuring that critical source

225
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:04,100
area is well protected the BET fencing

226
00:10:02,149 --> 00:10:06,199
of deer can increase stress which can

227
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,329
result in spacing so it's best to

228
00:10:06,199 --> 00:10:10,300
properly avoid that if possible but each

229
00:10:08,329 --> 00:10:12,889
situation again is going to be different

230
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:15,559
you look at prioritizing your stock

231
00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:17,209
classes so body condition scoring at

232
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:19,160
skinning could be an option and look at

233
00:10:17,209 --> 00:10:21,170
transferring liner animals to grass and

234
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,990
supplement you could be looking at doing

235
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:26,870
some of us now as well if Fleming dates

236
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:29,360
are split ensure that you feed stock

237
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:32,509
based on their lemming and carving dates

238
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,550
and if you want to share and I'm sure I

239
00:10:32,509 --> 00:10:36,920
don't need to tell you but the shearing

240
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:38,899
increases feed demand and freshly shorn

241
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:41,509
sheep are at higher risk in bad weather

242
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:43,970
so make sure that you're considering the

243
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:45,949
use of cover combs to reduce that risk

244
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:48,620
lifters may be needed as well depending

245
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:50,750
on their season and reduce that risk by

246
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,430
just sharing one full sheet at a time

247
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,290
and having a three-day get between

248
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:56,660
especially if their weather is really

249
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:59,620
unpredictable so that pretty much covers

250
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:03,949
it the adorne so proceed back to you

251
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:05,750
thanks for that Olivia so just a few of

252
00:11:03,949 --> 00:11:10,579
the factors to consider in terms of your

253
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:13,519
abuse with a plan does all the team know

254
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:17,540
when and how to implement that plan it's

255
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:19,490
really important if you're the maybe the

256
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:21,730
key decision-maker and you're going to

257
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:24,350
be on farm for a period of time so

258
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:27,690
having some clear triggers is to win

259
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:30,840
that plan as needed is really important

260
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:33,600
need to consider the crop type that the

261
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:35,400
animals are grazing as well and can you

262
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,310
keep feeding it during the adverse

263
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:41,100
weather event this is particularly

264
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:42,960
important for for the beach where we

265
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:46,200
know it's really important that animals

266
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:49,260
are transitioned onto on to the crop and

267
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:52,650
have a consistent diet so if you're

268
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:55,470
pulling them off and are for more than a

269
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:57,810
couple of days then you might you would

270
00:11:55,470 --> 00:12:00,510
need to have some re transitioning

271
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:02,190
picked it into your plan or an

272
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:03,630
alternative might be to hit some lifted

273
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:06,450
for the beach that you can give them a

274
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:09,240
net out of paddock area so they stay on

275
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:13,560
that drive through that period thinking

276
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:16,500
about the impact of a decreased feed

277
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:18,780
utilization during those adverse events

278
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,790
on and take and how you're going to

279
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:24,420
manage making sure that your animals are

280
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:27,210
getting enough feed through that period

281
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:29,790
of time and as I've mentioned previously

282
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:30,360
thinking about your access in and out of

283
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:33,270
paddocks

284
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:36,780
for stock in people if you do have to

285
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:39,360
move your stroke out and maybe that the

286
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:41,550
gateways not not looking the beasts are

287
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,820
the options to drop fences and move them

288
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:47,760
out over a bigger area we acknowledge

289
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:50,910
that it's pretty difficult to completely

290
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:53,700
mitigate the conditions but by having a

291
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:58,020
plan you can definitely look at options

292
00:12:53,700 --> 00:13:02,700
to minimize the impact so just in terms

293
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:04,560
of finishing up by hemming sitting down

294
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:07,410
taking some time and developing these

295
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,830
plans it's a really great opportunity to

296
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:12,360
see clear expectations around what

297
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:15,030
success looks like for wintering on your

298
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:17,040
property by involving the team and the

299
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:20,130
process they can understand the why

300
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:22,020
behind the activities and tasks that

301
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:24,420
they're going out in doing on a daily

302
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:28,080
basis and why it might be different

303
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:30,330
between parrots on the property it

304
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:32,400
encouraged you to steel with pride and

305
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:37,230
any ideas from your farming colleagues

306
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:37,420
is Helen mentioned people do have lots

307
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,530
of

308
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,330
really good ideas and they're doing

309
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:42,970
things differently so just look just

310
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:45,430
talk to your neighbors and and others

311
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:48,190
and find out what are doing especially

312
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:51,040
in terms of the adverse weather and I

313
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:52,690
guess really encourage that doing

314
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:57,430
something is better than doing nothing

315
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:59,650
and real value in their pain and

316
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:01,780
everybody being on the same page at the

317
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:07,600
start of winter so I just want to finish

318
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:12,060
off by with a quote from Napoleon that's

319
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,060
his plan your work and work your plan
