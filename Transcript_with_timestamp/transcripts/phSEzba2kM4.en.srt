1
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,240
Ghana's local rice revolution takes

2
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,720
viewers through the thriving landscapes

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,359
of rice farms across the country,

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,920
highlighting the dynamic innovations and

5
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,640
success stories emerging in the

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,679
industry. The documentary showcases the

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,320
important roles played by young farmers

8
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:37,280
and processes while emphasizing the

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,640
significance of local rice production

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,640
for Ghana's economy by exploring various

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,280
stages of the rice value chain and

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,520
promoting local

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,760
consumption. This film encourages deeper

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,239
engagement in the country's agricultural

15
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,559
sector. The West African country's

16
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:58,000
fertile land holds the promise of

17
00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:01,280
feeding the nation. Today we dive into

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
the stories of resilience, innovation,

19
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:08,720
and national pride shaping the rice

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,840
industry. We took a trip to one of the

21
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,040
popular places known for rice

22
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,600
production. We caught up with a young

23
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,159
farmer whose experience started on a

24
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:22,280
family land in 2010. I'm in the person

25
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:25,200
of Emanuel from

26
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:28,439
Asetary. Currently we are on the KIS

27
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:32,600
project that's irrigation scheme project

28
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:36,240
but me managing my own started from

29
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:38,400
2020. So managing my own farm is just 5

30
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,159
years now. Yeah. Initially I wasn't

31
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,159
having the intention to become a rice

32
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,680
farmer.

33
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:48,880
Uh let me say as at now farming

34
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:52,960
activities is generating a lot of money.

35
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,880
So I have decided to keep in that side.

36
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,680
Initially I I have the intention to

37
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:02,079
become a bank accountant. Yeah. Because

38
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:05,680
I have a degree in accountant. Yeah. I

39
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,680
know mainly to become a rice

40
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:12,319
farmer. Immano shared insights on the

41
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,720
impact of technology and investments in

42
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,720
enhancing livelihoods and creating

43
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,440
employment opportunities in his

44
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,879
community. When we started, you know, uh

45
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,280
we control is done manually like you go

46
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,200
and hire people yourself, you enter into

47
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,760
the right farm and be putting the weeds

48
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,680
yourself. But as time goes on they they

49
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,680
brought some chemical that's selective

50
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,560
herbicide that when you see the weeds

51
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:42,239
when you spray all will go. So it's

52
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,959
making the work to become easy and pling

53
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,760
to first you hire people to come and dig

54
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,080
it with normal hole. But now due to

55
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,239
technology we have machines that they do

56
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,959
all the plowing which make the work to

57
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,040
become easier. So now if you just have

58
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,440
the startup capital the farming will be

59
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:03,440
very easy for you. Um the packaging let

60
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:06,920
me start from the patty care. Yeah we

61
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:10,640
dry the patty and we blow the

62
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:15,120
chs then we we weigh them we weigh them

63
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:17,280
90k that's one bag and milling then we

64
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,599
move to the milling center where they

65
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,040
mail the right or the dehask. Okay. The

66
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:26,239
milling side the packaging is done per

67
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:31,040
um the customer requisition. Yeah. But

68
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:33,680
ideally you package them 5 kg, 10 kg, 25

69
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:37,319
kg and 50 kg. That's the maximum the 50

70
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:40,319
kg. Normally it's the the farmers who

71
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:42,480
convey the patty the wet patty to the

72
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,640
mailing center to process. Then after

73
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,680
that if the farmer said oh okay let me

74
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,519
sell it with the husk for any a third

75
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,840
party to process it. Fine. We have

76
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,799
people who buy with a patty the patty

77
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:58,920
like that and they process it per the

78
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,920
way they they like it.

79
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:08,319
Rice production in Ghana has evolved um

80
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:12,000
and mostly as you mentioned previously

81
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,480
rice production had um stones and it

82
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,199
wasn't

83
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:20,560
well gra I mean the it wasn't well

84
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:23,520
graded and also didn't have that kind of

85
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,880
polishing that uh the market demanded.

86
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:31,199
However, um, new age of limited

87
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:33,600
currently through our M foods brand, we

88
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,919
beyond production, our farmers farm and

89
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,800
gets good yields. Now when the farmers

90
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:41,520
get good nutrition, then the patty rice

91
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:45,919
is well filled and obviously the

92
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:49,040
nutrition becomes better. Now we have um

93
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:54,199
a state of the arts melee facility where

94
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:56,800
we mail hall with stone then we do color

95
00:04:54,199 --> 00:05:00,639
separation or more like color sortter

96
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:04,639
where we sort out then on white rice

97
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:06,280
from the lot then we grade we grade on

98
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:11,199
to long

99
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:12,800
grain 75% broken 50% broken so now

100
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,720
because we have now graduated we can now

101
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,800
be able to base the different segments

102
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,919
of the market. Some individuals want

103
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,240
long grain. So we sell a premium a long

104
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,720
grain rice to them. Some also want the

105
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,080
bin maybe for

106
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,000
um for other processing into uh p brown

107
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,160
or the rest. For them we sell the

108
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,639
brooking to them as well. Then we also

109
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,199
have the rice brand which animal farmers

110
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:40,400
are also using as part of their their

111
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:44,000
feed composition and feed formulation.

112
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,080
So I believe because of we are in a

113
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,080
global village. So we are taking

114
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,400
technologies not only from Ghana but

115
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,720
technologies from across the world as

116
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:56,880
well and the state of the arts machiner

117
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,320
that we have indeed um is can be able to

118
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,400
give us that right can be able to

119
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,400
compete with any other imported rice.

120
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,520
They also mentioned branding. So every

121
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:08,000
long green rice is well branded h and

122
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,600
it's because we are growing and then we

123
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,680
decided to now meet the demand of the

124
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,680
farmer and demand of the consumer which

125
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,759
is they looking for well branded

126
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,880
packages and that's where our market and

127
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:23,360
research have also led us into having

128
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:26,000
heavily having the arguably the best

129
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,479
branding or packaging in the country.

130
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,400
The labeling is done at different site

131
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,000
and you bring the sacks with the labels

132
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,319
then you come and do the packaging here.

133
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,560
We have people who do the labeling per

134
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,560
what you want them to put on the sack.

135
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,800
Yeah. So they do the labeling they bring

136
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,360
the sack here then they package then

137
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:47,280
kilo 5 kg and the rest and they sew them

138
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:49,280
they they seal them there indirect way

139
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,240
of employment to the other committee

140
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:55,520
members. Uh we have printers those who

141
00:06:52,240 --> 00:07:02,599
do the printing and we have the factory

142
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:02,599
who uh um do the sack a transparent one

143
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,080
While the coid9 pandemic posed

144
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:32,639
challenges, it also sparked innovation

145
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,800
in the food industry, attracting

146
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,840
investors who saw potential for

147
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:41,199
long-term growth. I'm Alex, a factory

148
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,680
manager for Max Industries Limited. The

149
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:47,280
mats industries is in currently a steady

150
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:51,360
year of fishes and it's into providing

151
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:54,400
dry and milling services for uh farmers

152
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:57,360
right I think uh considering cover you

153
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:00,319
realize that during that time food the

154
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,720
food and beverage industries became very

155
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,720
very important when everybody was I

156
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,960
think in lockdown they were allowed to

157
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,160
operate and all that he realized that it

158
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:13,520
dawned on the CEO that no you will have

159
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:17,199
to put this in place to also help the

160
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:19,840
country in terms of uh this disaster. So

161
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,800
it was doing that he gain inspiration to

162
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,280
come out with the opmax industries right

163
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,000
I think uh local rice has come a long

164
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,080
way uh born with the days that we used

165
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,440
to have stones and all these things in

166
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:36,959
local rice and now we have proof seed

167
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:40,080
method of growing and I mean process it

168
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:42,719
we are using state of biat dry and the

169
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:47,120
milling composite meal so currently we

170
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:51,040
have a 30 metric tier which uses as as a

171
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:54,560
floor is to grind the rice. Then we have

172
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,800
a capacity of about 100 tons melon rice

173
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,600
that uh processes the rice the dried

174
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:03,200
rice. So we have from the melon side we

175
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,440
have the pre- cleaner which cleans the

176
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,640
patty rice as the name implies it leans

177
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,200
the patty rice frees it from this uh

178
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,519
debris chaff and all that. Then he

179
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,000
passes it on to the the stoner which

180
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,519
takes stones, clay pebbles, other solid

181
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,200
materials from the rice. Know when

182
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,560
you're harvesting rice, you can pick up

183
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,399
clay pebbles because you go, stones and

184
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,040
other foreign materials, solid foreign

185
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,519
materials. The diston takes the house.

186
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,640
So from there we have the ma that is

187
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:35,519
what the husk the rice. It takes the hus

188
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:38,320
of the rice from the kennel and from

189
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:41,040
there spalled onto the separator. He

190
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,519
separate the hacks rice from the ketta

191
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:47,440
from the passes it on to the polisher.

192
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:49,360
We have the three polishes. We have the

193
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,519
primary polisher, the secondary and then

194
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,760
the chair polisher. Now the primary

195
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,800
polisher will first take the first coat

196
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,560
of the brand of it. Secondary one will

197
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:03,200
continue polishing to make it a bit

198
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:06,160
whiter and then it is passed onto the

199
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,880
grader. From the grading machine it

200
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:12,120
sorts the rice into different grades.

201
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:15,040
That's the long gray, the pera

202
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:18,640
grid halfb broken and then the very fine

203
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:21,760
broke. So now the grater sends the long

204
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,959
gray to the water polisher. The dust

205
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:27,760
polisher using mist the dust polisher

206
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:30,720
using mist like with me have liquid

207
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,880
polish polish. That's that's the purpose

208
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,240
of the wonder polisher. And from there

209
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:40,720
it sends it to the laser color. It takes

210
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:42,640
multiol base from the uh the polished

211
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,880
grains because you are not interested in

212
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:48,480
those multiolent gears and then from

213
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:50,720
there it is part onto the and bag unit.

214
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:54,000
So based on the best you are being for

215
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,240
that period they set it to the whiskey

216
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,200
which is electronic and from there it is

217
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,519
back and please don't h one significant

218
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,399
hurdle needs to be addressed for the

219
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,160
industry to achieve sustained growth and

220
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,200
uh one of the challenges local rice

221
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,920
producers face is they don't really have

222
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:15,279
good distribution channels. They are not

223
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,519
all over. So when it happens like that,

224
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,920
yes, uh there's a little downtime with

225
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,079
respect to processing or receiving raw

226
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,640
materials

227
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:26,800
from clients. Nevertheless, we sometimes

228
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,800
do receive them. However, we are not

229
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,640
able to process for them. The reason

230
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,279
being that they are not having any

231
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,920
demand for your side. You know, this

232
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,920
packaging, you have to wait for you to

233
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,839
get customers before you package. If you

234
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,920
package it and you put it down maybe and

235
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,600
you don't get customers to buy it and

236
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:48,320
it's there for a longer time

237
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:50,320
and this uh maze w can enter which will

238
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,640
decrease the quality. So you have to

239
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,440
wait for you to get customers before you

240
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:58,240
you you package.

241
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,920
Every business has its own ch every

242
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,480
business has it own challenges and angel

243
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:06,240
business um is not alien to that.

244
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:09,360
Um as a company we've also have our own

245
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,920
fair share of uh issues. Key among the

246
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:16,720
challenges we have faced as a company is

247
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:20,240
um the rates of uh interest on credit or

248
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,000
capital or bank loans. Um we actually in

249
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,360
a market we in global village we are

250
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,279
competing uh with a market where the

251
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,560
agricultural sector are getting loans as

252
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:34,920
single niggets. Unfortunately in in

253
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:38,800
Ghana loans are in excess of 20s and

254
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:40,800
30%. Where in very difficult for

255
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,680
um agricultural business to be able to

256
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,200
pick such facilities and be able to

257
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:48,000
produce to compete with those who are

258
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:51,120
coming with a single digit interest rate

259
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,120
financing. The second issue is also uh

260
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,480
with

261
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:57,600
insurance when the way we have car

262
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:00,480
insurance, home insurance, agricultural

263
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,959
insurance is still in it. There are some

264
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,320
interventions with Ghana agricultural

265
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:08,000
insurance pool which is no more in

266
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,839
existence. We know some few private

267
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,399
entities are also doing some insurance

268
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,880
for agricultural businesses. uh there's

269
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:17,920
a need for us to have I call aggreate

270
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:20,560
aggreate insurance as a big concern

271
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,360
where we provide insurance to cover a

272
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:26,240
lot of the I mean the activities along

273
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,079
the value chain especially for an agri

274
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,480
business sector where we are fully

275
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:34,560
relying on rainfed or rain for

276
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:37,760
agriculture it is because we don't have

277
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,440
enough irrigation supports neither we

278
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,079
have there enough resources to be able

279
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,000
to go in for proper irrig irrigation

280
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,720
facilities to help with our production.

281
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,200
So we rely on God to leave us and that

282
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,760
is also one of the risk factors. So when

283
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,320
we have credits which is sorted out at

284
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:57,040
very low rates and we have insurance

285
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:00,720
that will provide that level of or layer

286
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:04,000
of support for farmers or for businesses

287
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:07,680
then we believe that we are on road of

288
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,360
drisking agriculture uh in a long short

289
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,639
long term by sharing knowledge and

290
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,480
expertise industry players are

291
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,959
empowering young people to become

292
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:20,320
innovative entrepreneurs.

293
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:24,959
Yes. So the opportunities for young uh

294
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:26,959
individuals um the 72 that I mentioned

295
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,120
it's interesting to know that we are we

296
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:32,000
are all young

297
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:35,440
people. I think the the the highest band

298
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,240
of age will be just the the first the

299
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:42,800
early part of 40 and we have a majority

300
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:44,240
of the youth being under 40. So yes

301
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,839
there there are opportunities for young

302
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,320
individuals who have the who have the

303
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,800
the capacity to be able to join our

304
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,639
growing and our growing force. Uh

305
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,639
additionally individuals who might also

306
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:59,040
want to farm there's opportunity for

307
00:14:54,639 --> 00:15:01,519
them as well. Uh outgoers we we have our

308
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,480
production hub or production arm called

309
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:06,160
Tigaba. Tik

310
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:08,240
T and out grower social enterprise for

311
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,160
out grower companies out grower farmers

312
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,160
who might want to farm h they can be

313
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,920
able to reach out to taban and tab can

314
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,440
be able to help them out there other

315
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,279
individuals who are also not green

316
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,519
fingered I mean they don't want to do

317
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,440
the agree but they want to do agre we

318

always see our best they can be able to

321
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:30,639
benefit from agricultural space we also

322
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,800
have the new age economy which is our

323
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,760
newest kid of the block where we are

324
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:38,399

those who might want in-depth analysis

327
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,279
or in-depth appreciation can also come

328
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:48,880
on board our master class where we can

329
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:50,320
be able to help them set up uh the test

330
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,920
we are young individuals we've been able

331
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:55,040
to achieve it and we know we can be able

332
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:57,519
to um get to a lot of young individuals

333
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:00,160
who have interest in agriculture to also

334
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,759
come on board one of the major giants in

335
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,480
the

336
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,800
uh Rice value chain which is aok thing

337
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,199
they started I happened to see their

338
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,360
humble beginning they started and now

339
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,920
they are very they being a client of

340
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:17,040
ours and we went through taking thing

341
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,480
with them and then as now I can say that

342
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,120
they are producing one of the best

343
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:24,079
quality of prepar rice you can you can

344
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:27,120
have in in Ghana. We try our best to

345
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:30,399
make our doors open for students. Abuk

346
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,399
is behind the brand of Nar. They mostly

347
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,639
deal with some of these young of

348
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,480
students. They sometimes bring them here

349
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,920
have a look at whatever is going on

350
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,519
here. When they come out those are

351
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,560
always we take them through the

352
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:44,639
processes. We take them through and they

353
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:48,160
see the final product. They appreciate

354
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:51,720
it. Yeah. So as a company uh we

355
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:56,199
commenced 5 years ago with uh barely 10

356
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:58,560
staff. uh currently we have

357
00:16:56,199 --> 00:17:01,680
72 individuals who we have employed

358
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:06,079
there and 50% of them being female. Now

359
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:09,600
this 72 are on new ages or in the

360
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:12,240
group's payroll. Then in terms of uh

361
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:16,720
support we have tagged or directly

362
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:19,000
supported six over 16,000 farmers who by

363
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:22,880
extension have also reached out to over

364
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,520
60,000 individuals who have also been

365
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,480
engaged along these value chains that

366
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:31,840
we've been undertaking. When it comes to

367
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:35,600
tonnage of of rice, we have contributed

368
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:38,160
every year on year we produce this year

369
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:42,720
we intend to produce 10,000 metric ton

370
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:45,280
of of rice on the market. Uh last year

371
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,799
with this just barely 4,000 metro ton of

372
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:51,280
rice. This year 10,000 of rice on the

373
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,919
market and going forward we are planning

374
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:57,280
on doing exceeding it in our next

375
00:17:53,919 --> 00:18:00,960
production years. When it comes to rice,

376
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:03,919
it is a very important crop in Ghana at

377
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:07,600
the moment. It it didn't used to be. Uh

378
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:10,880
but consistently as we urbanize, our

379
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:13,280
eating patterns change. We always want

380
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:16,320
something convenient to eat. So rice has

381
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:19,120
become a convenient food for the

382
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,280
Ghanaian population. And we are over 50%

383
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,440
urbanized.

384
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:26,960
So if you look at the grains when it

385
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,799
comes to our food, maize is number one.

386
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,440
We actually need to produce about 6

387
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:33,600
million metric tons of maze every year

388
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,360
if we can meet our needs. In fact, over

389
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:40,640
6 million metric tons because beyond

390
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:43,440
what we eat for bank, cocoa, et and kink

391
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:46,160
and all those things. You also need maze

392
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,640
to process all those processed foods by

393
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,880
the big manufacturers like uni liver and

394
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:54,400
all those companies. And then you need

395
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:57,039
maze as a main component in animal feed,

396
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:01,480
especially poultry feed. The poultry

397
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:05,919
feed usually would have about 60 to

398
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:09,440
70% maze making the bulk of the food. So

399
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:12,240
maze is very important. Then comes rice.

400
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:15,120
Rice has gradually grown to be number

401
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,200
two when it comes to the grains and

402
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:21,200
cereals that we eat a lot in the in the

403
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:25,200
country. And we import over 50% of the

404
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:28,640
rice we we we need. And rice is also

405
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:31,280
labor intensive, capital intensive and

406
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:34,400
land intensive. For example, if you have

407
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:37,840
a hectar of land, your average yield is

408
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:41,600
5 tons for rice. Your average yield is 5

409
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:43,280
tons for rice for a hectar of rice. Uh

410
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,360
if I should give you an example, if you

411
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:49,919
have the same hectare of rice, you can

412
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:52,400
get over 20 tons of tomatoes or pepper.

413
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:55,720
and tomatoes and pepper are higher value

414
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:58,600
crops than rice. So if you look at

415
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:01,120
rice is become very

416
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:04,160
important. The return on investment is

417
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:07,000
not that great and it requires a lot of

418
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:10,960
resources. Land,

419
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,720
irrigation, water and inputs. Your

420
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,960
average acre of rice would take about

421
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:18,160
four bags of

422
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:22,559
fertilizer. So it's a lot of work. Now

423
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:25,120
what we can do to get the best out of

424
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,960
rice is to apply industrial ecology

425
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,039
principles in the rise value chain. In

426
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,840
fact not just the rise value chain you

427
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:35,919
can apply industrial ecology principles

428
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:38,159
in every other value chain where one you

429
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:40,880
try to be as efficient as possible in

430
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:44,880
the production your water use your

431
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:47,840
material use input land use. Two, you

432
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,600
apply the principle of consistency where

433
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:53,600
the inputs that go into that

434
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:55,520
system generates products and byproducts

435
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:59,440
which become inputs within the same

436
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:03,360
system or another system for growth. Now

437
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:06,080
on the rice husk we can also um add rice

438
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,080
husk and other organic materials to

439
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:12,960
generate energy bio gas. So if you have

440
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:15,280
rice husk plus poulry manure um cow dang

441
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:18,240
even plantain stems and all those things

442
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:23,120
any form of organic material you can um

443
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:24,320
mix them up um for for for for biogas

444
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,480
generation. So there's a lot of

445
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,880
opportunity there. I know a company a

446
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,600
startup in Tamil that uses rice rice has

447
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:34,159
to make BS like this you see on this

448
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:37,120
table and like what we've used for the

449
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:39,200
partitioning behind me for furniture and

450
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,679
if you are producing so much for example

451
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,400
if you have 3 million tons of patty rice

452
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:46,640
and about a million of that is going to

453
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,640
end up as rice husk that's a million

454
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,960
tons of rice husk that we can use to

455
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,880
make MDN walls for furniture for

456
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,320
construction for ceilings for all sorts

457
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:58,559
of things that will cut down uh import

458
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,360
bill on importing some of these things.

459
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,480
So rice presents a very great

460
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:05,440
opportunity going forward. The state

461
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,600
needs to invest in or support farmers to

462
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:12,400
get a lot of irrigation because rice

463
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:14,559
drinks a lot of water and um and also

464
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,200
support with mechanization

465
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:19,679
um land preparation and harvesting. If

466
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,919
you have mechanized harvesting you

467
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,159
actually get better returns. Sometimes

468
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,400
harvesting manually you lose a lot of

469
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,640
the patty but if you have mechanized

470
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,120
harvesting you reduce your post harvest

471
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:34,640
losses. And another important element

472
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:37,360
are dryers. If we have dryers in the key

473
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,360
rice production areas rice farmers can

474
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,120
actually dry their patty. Once they

475
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,960
finish drying their patty they can store

476
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,600
and even wait for a better market to

477
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:48,240
sell. The value chain from farm to

478
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,480
market holds the backbone of Ghana's

479
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:53,320
rice production. technological

480
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:56,000
advancements are boosting efficiency and

481
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,520
profitability and offer other business

482
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,159
opportunities.

483
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:03,919
So how do we approach that? Once you

484
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:05,919
farm rice and the rice stock grows, what

485
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:09,200
you take out of of that is the grain

486
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,880
which is the patty rice. Now the stock,

487
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,320
what opportunities are there to use the

488
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,280
rice stock? There are thousand1

489
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:18,720
opportunities for rice stock. Aside them

490
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:22,000
being composted and to return nutrients

491
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,360
back into the soil, you can use them for

492
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,440
all sorts of things in the fashion

493
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,480
industry. For mats, for a lot of

494
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,679
different things in the fashion

495
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,120
industry, you can use them in

496
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:36,080
upholstery. You can process them and

497
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:38,080
pack them in upholstery. You can use

498
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:41,520
them in different different forms. So we

499
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:43,200
need to start thinking about how we can

500
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,200
harvest those things. In Ghana, usually

501
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:49,600
once the harvester comes to harvest to

502
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:52,400
cut uh and and get the patty uh will

503
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:55,200
usually set fire to the to the stalks on

504
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,919
the farm. That's one of the easiest ways

505
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,559
to clear them and repair land for the

506
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:03,120
next season. That also introduces a lot

507
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:05,200
of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

508
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,120
So one of the things we can do is to

509
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,120
strategically also get machines that can

510
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,200
help us. We don't even need machines. We

511
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,039
have a lot of people who need work. Once

512
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,360
we are adding value to the right stock

513
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:17,840
and creating a product that returns

514
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:21,120
capital value, we can engage a lot of

515
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:24,120
people to do that work. That's one. And

516
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:28,080
then when it comes to the rice patty

517
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:30,799
itself, for every ton of rice patty,

518
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:34,000
you'll get about 60, let's say average

519
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:36,080
60% of actually milled rice. Then you

520
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,200
get your rice brand and you get your

521
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,880
rice husk. That rice husk is a problem

522
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,559
for a lot of rice mills. So you go to a

523
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,440
lot of the rice mills the rice husk is

524
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:48,240
packed and they either set fire to it

525
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,400
and the few of them who have dryers will

526
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,360
use will burn the rice husk to dry the

527
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:56,400
rice patty there's an opportunity to

528
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:59,440
converse rice husk into MDF boards for

529
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,200
furniture like this even the rice straw

530
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,760
you can use them for furniture like this

531
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,480
you mill them into fine powder you add a

532
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,200
binding agent you compress and become

533
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,279
bolts like this that you can use for

534
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:13,039
construction for partitioning in like um

535
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:16,480
drywalls and all those things. So

536
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:19,039
there's an opportunity to use that. Also

537
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,679
the broken rice and the discolored rice,

538
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:25,480
there's an opportunity to use them for

539
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:28,880
animal feed, for rice wine, and for

540
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:31,760
other nutritional products. Ghana's

541
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:34,799
local rice market is growing, yet

542
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,880
misconceptions linger. What will it take

543
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:39,840
for local rice to become the preferred

544
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:42,400
choice on every table? So if we have to

545
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:45,120
meet our rice needs and be

546
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:48,320
self-sufficient on rice, that is if we

547
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:51,039
don't pivot another um commodity to take

548
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:54,960
away the dependence on rice, we need to

549
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:58,799
grow about 2 3 4 million metric tons of

550
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:04,000
patty rice which we will then mill and

551
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:08,240
get uh maybe 2 2.5 million metric tons

552
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,960
of actual rice. then we meet our our

553
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,919
rice needs to a certain extent. So rice

554
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,000
is very important and I think largely we

555
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,159
also need to accept the fact that 1

556
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,919
kilogram of broken rice is also the same

557
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:24,480
as 1 kilogram of um long grain rice. So

558
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:26,240
that if we educated the population to

559
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,679
agree that 1 kilogram of broken rice

560
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,640
when you eat is the same nutritional

561
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:33,679
value and is the same stomach it will go

562
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:37,200
to 1 kilogram of long grain rice is the

563
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:39,600
same nutritional value then we in in

564
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,320
selling our rice we can actually mix the

565
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,799
broken rice with the long grain rice so

566
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:48,080
that we can reduce the price per

567
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:50,320
kilogram of um rice so that people can

568
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,960
afford rice. What the industry does is

569
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,799
that once we mail rice, we take the

570
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,159
grade A, which is the full long grain

571
00:26:54,799 --> 00:27:01,120
rice. That's where a lot of rice um

572
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:03,679
investors get their returns from. So

573
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:05,840
they price that higher and that's what

574
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:08,720
people want. Everybody wants to buy long

575
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:11,679
grain rice. So you pay more for that

576
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,840
long grade. The grade B sometimes is

577
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,159
mixed with the grade A and then the

578
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:18,400
grade C it goes to school feeding

579
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:21,880
program or for animal feeding. But once

580
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:24,880
we able to mix this in a good um

581
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:27,360
percentage, we can then not concentrate

582
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,600
the final retail cost of the rice on the

583
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,440
grid A. We can spread it among these

584
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:34,880
three so people will still get the

585
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,960
volumes at a better uh uh price which

586
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,080
will help the industry. So I think it's

587
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,559
something we need to do with the

588
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:43,600
industry. Ghana's agricultural potential

589
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:48,960
is vast. With your support, we can make

590
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,960
local rice a symbol of national pride.
