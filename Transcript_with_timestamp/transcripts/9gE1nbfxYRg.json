  "text": "so I've recently come out with a couple videos talking about how we're getting $44,000 a week in production on this vegetable farm and in this video I want to explain a little bit about our yields that we're harvesting every week to get to that $44,000 I think that'll kind of clear up uh any confusion you get from that because just the number could mean a lot of different things but I want to really explain how much food we're really producing on a half an acre of land which is Tiny amount of land you know you could do a half an acre of production in Chicago downtown in in the city of Chicago you know that's not a lot of land so um I'm going to go over that today I'm going to go over our core crops that are producing those kinds of numbers and some of the crops that produce less um and the point I'm making with this video is not to brag or anything because I think eventually that number is going to be a lot bigger for our farm but once we expand because eventually we're going to be doing one to one and a half acres of production but the point I'm making here is that you can grow a lot of food on a small land base and make a living or grow food for your family and I do offer a gardening course called gardening 101 the link is in the description where I'm teaching you the similar techniques that I use on this Farm to use in your backyard and grow a truckload of food for your family on a couple hundred square feet of land you know you don't need a lot of land to do this kind of production so on every bed that you see behind me we're trying to get two crops a year in the field some of the crops grow so big and bulky that we don't really need to get two crops to make money and produce amount of food like this celery is an example this celery is going to be almost double the size dies by the time we Harvest it and it'll be worth at least $5 each um so we don't need to get two crops for that but most of the other crops you see behind me like these carrots um they're the second crop this is a fall crop so the technique that I'm talking about is growing really high yield crops and growing multiple crops in the same space if possible um so both of those things combined is how we get to $4,000 a week on a half an acre of production so let's get into it and highly encourage you to check out that gardening course in the description it's a game changer um you'll be able to grow $1,200 worth of food in 200 square feet with the techniques I talk about in that course so check it out and let's get into the video okay so you could probably take a guess what about what I'm going to talk about next and that is tomatoes so tomatoes are one of the most profitable crops that we grow on the farm and uh I guess I should actually explain that a little more it's not exactly about profit that they bring in but the yield that they bring in in this small amount of space is incredible so these are our granadero paste tomatoes and they are just exploding this year it's the best crop I've ever had and um we're getting we're not just growing paste we're growing paste beef steak heirloom and cherry tomatoes throughout the farm um we've got one this is our second crop right now the first crop is still producing really well um that we planted back in April this crop we planted late May and they're just exploding right now we're in full tomato production right now we're doing 3 to 400 pounds of tomatoes per week that's a lot and it's the most I've ever done and um that yield is uh for indeterminate tomatoes so we're getting that every week and we've been getting about two to 250 every week since like Fourth of July and it just exploded once we had the second crop come in so that's between all four different kinds but the paste tomatoes are really exploding right now as you could see um and the way we're getting these yields is these are grafted tomatoes so we've graphed them onto a root stock uh back in March and in February for the first crop so that's a separate variety of tomato that you splice onto the variety you want to produce and that increases yield a lot if you get the right root stock and that's really complicated I can't explain it in this video and that's in that farm course that I've talked about in the past and it's very hard to do I'm not going to lie I've screwed it up many times and I've I got a pretty good results with it this year and certain varieties do better but that increases yields a lot um so that's a big reason we're getting the kind of yields we're getting because there's only about a little over 200 plants in this greenhouse and about uh 150 in the other one so it's not a lot of plants if you know about tomato production but we get we graft them we prune the bottom leaves and prune the suckers so they're all growing uh up a string and so that increases yields also in the space that we have they're in a greenhouse also and then they are um on drip irrigation as well the drip irrigation we have on a timer so it's a completely even watering and we don't have any problems with splitting or anything like that so it's a pretty complicated process but it's worth it to get those kinds of numbers because right now we're actually getting $5 a pound for all those tomatoes and $7 a pound for Cherries $6 a pound for heirlooms they're very valuable and climate nobody can grow them in their Garden here because it's still below 50\u00b0 at night so very few people can have tomatoes in the western mountains you know again I'm in Cody Wyoming for anybody who's new so it's a very mountainous cold climate so it's very hard to grow tomatoes here so they're very valuable I'm the only guy at a big city market with them so it's pretty easy to get that price and I just heard that organic Tomatoes at the store are $5 a pound anyway so I don't feel bad at all about that price I used to think that was really expensive um but after doing the work involved with this we're pruning these and maintaining them every week I have employees managing them it's a very intense process so that's how we can get those numbers but when you get that kind of price it's it's quite a bit of money so that's almost ,000 a week in tomatoes right now probably more uh and it goes up and down depends on the yield they ripen uh differently depending on the weather there's all sorts of factors in there but those kinds of numbers are possible with that that amount of space we're only using a quarter or a little less than half of the greenhous this whole Greenhouse for tomatoes so we still have room to grow all sorts of other stuff like cucumbers which are the other ridiculously profitable crop that we get great numbers on um we're getting about 200 cucumbers a week right now and that's actually kind of low for the amount of plants I'm sure we can get better um and uh we kind of do the similar technique with tomatoes we prune the bottom leaves in the suckers with those and grow them up a string with drip tape um similar fertility we're doing um we fed these crops every week um with uh alala meal and stuff that also helps a lot I've noticed um just after this is like the third year I've been doing this so it's working really really well um and so that's those all that work gets you those kinds of numbers and if you have really good employees it doesn't cost that much it just you you need to do it fast and um make sure that those F fertilizers aren't that expensive so it's it becomes really profitable when you do it that way um but those two crops are bringing in the bulk of that $4,000 it's about $1,500 a week um between the two of those and it's every single week it's just like Clockwork um I don't have to replant another crop it just keeps coming you know so it's a really nice crop it's you know we've been getting those kinds of numbers with tomatoes for since the 4th of July um and the other thing about it is it helps sell all the other crops I'm going to talk about tomatoes just when you are the only guy with tomatoes at the market you could sell almost anything you want so the other crops I'm about to talk about are even more profitable um but they're harder to sell so when you put them right next to your Tomatoes you can really make a lot of money that way so um yeah I think that's kind of helpful information for people who are kind of getting into this and learning what kind of numbers you can make but this is literally what we're making right at this minute and I'm sure we can make a lot more in the future and it's hard the the big caveat with tomatoes is it takes a lot of skill to grow like this I mean I screwed up bad this is the fourth year I've been growing them like this and it was not even close to those numbers the first three there's a lot of little um intricacies that I can't explain in this video um that you have to learn um to get those kinds of numbers it's not really that easy especially and it all depends on your climate too so there's a lot of things I don't want to make it sound like it's easy to get those numbers but um that's the numbers we're getting right now let's move on to the next [Music] crops all right so next thing I'm going to talk about is uh probably the biggest money maker of all which is salad greens and I'm kind of leaving that as a broad category because it kind of um cut greens we grow like a bunch of different kinds of those we grow salanova lettuce is the biggest um arugula is second biggest we grow tons of both of these but we also do tons of spinach miners lettuce baby kale all cut salad greens that are Bubble spun dried and baged and it all pretty much is the same price just depends on you know the volume people are buying but um the price changes a little bit in the winter when we're you know really the only person with any fresh produce that's a little more expensive but bottom line is uh we're doing about 60 to 80 pounds of salad greens a week right now and lots of other Farms do way more numbers than that but just at the level that we're at in our Market that's what's working um we're selling about 30 40% of that no actually bought 50% of that to restaurants um we're slowly selling more and more at this new market we're at at full retail price so we're getting anywhere from s to $10 a pound on the greens um lots more of them are starting to go to the Farmers Market at $10 a pound and that's working really really well um you know it's taken me a while to get to that level it's hard to get a top dollar for them when that's all you're selling but now that we're selling at a bigger Market with a lot more people we can get a better price and um the real key with this is the yields you know the price is definitely important but uh you know the more yield you can sell keyword selling um is where you can really make the money there so you know that's that's providing you know $600 to $800 a week basically uh and we really want to sell them more more and more at the uh Farmers Market but you got to be careful with it because these are the one product that definitely have a shelf life the Salen NOA has an incredible shelf life for a cut lettuce it probably lasts 7 to 10 days I've had it last two weeks and I probably would still sell it it's incredible I don't know why but it just when it's growing well it lasts a really long time but arugula is really about a week max four to seven days and most of the other greens don't last as long spinach lasts a really long time so you got to make sure you sell it um because if you cut it and wash it dry it and it goes bad you got problems and having a cold room is a really key detail here that's what's going to pretty much guarantee that you sell it all when I used to do this before I had a cold room it was just so much riskier if there was a slow Market I lose all you know half the crop so key detail is being able to sell it and having a cold room because once if you have a slow Market you could at least bring it back to the cold room and find another Market but um salad greens are a huge part of the business um you know and you can't it's hard in my market to sell these by themselves you got to sell them with some kind of draw in the summertime at least you know so those tomatoes are what I'm talking about that's a huge draw um we're the only people with tomatoes at the market right now and that's how we're able to sell you know 40 pounds of this at full retail price um you know and uh this particular Salon NOA lettuce also is just a spectacular product um it lasts really long time people love it it's very versatile you can put it on sandwiches restaurants love it um it's easy to harvest you know the way we can get really good yields on this this whole B when we cut it will probably yield 50 60 lbs cuz it's going to this isn't really ready yet this is two two weeks away and it'll get way bigger um it'll fill out the bed and it'll be completely like an ocean of lettuce and we'll cut it and then it regrows a slightly lower yield the second cut but it does grow a second cut and um you'll get at least 80 pounds per bed that's a lot of money right there that's if you do the math on that it's just say you get $7 a pound I think that's oh it's seven time eight I'm not um I don't know I can't remember it off the top of my head but uh you know that's between like6 and $800 you know on in about 60 days um that's really profitable you know most crops don't yield that kind of number so we really try to focus a lot on this um it's a very expensive seed there's a lot to Growing lettuce but once you get good at growing lettuce you can grow any kind of lettuce and it works well so that's a really big part of our business is cut greens so 60 to 80 pounds is part of that $4,000 number let's move on to the next crop so these are probably the most underrated crop ever these are peases and uh I started growing these two years ago and um I just started actually selling them in the summer this year I normally was just doing it in the winter because I figured they'd be really hard to sell and they are pretty hard to sell but in when you have a really good market and you have a draw crop like tomatoes you could sell a lot of these and um we also do sunflower shoots and a couple other micro greens um but these yield incredible amounts of shoots per flat this one flat right here will probably yield 2 lbs just about two pounds of peash shoots at $16 a pound I could sell at the market all day and people really love them after they try them it's great on a sandwich um it's a great little rabbit food thing to add to the salad department on your booth and um you know we're selling about eight pounds at the market a week right now of this in sunflower shoots it's doing really really well um so that's a huge Money Maker um we also sell this to restaurants the restaurants love to buy it um and uh you know it a lot of um wholesalers are selling peas shots anyway and a fancy restaurant's going to be buying them anyway so your product is going to be 10 times better than theirs anyway because it's so fresh it has a great shelf life it's almost better than salad greens for some reason I'm finding it lasts like two weeks no problem I don't know why you know every sing you'll find that every single leaf crop has a different shelf life like herbs are really weird too certain herbs will last forever certain ones won't but shoots are a huge Money Maker we're doing eight pounds a week at $16 a pound so that's a huge part of that $4,000 and we just started really doing well with that about two weeks ago um but it works really well when you play it off salad mix and arugula you can do a two for nine deal or something where you mix and match and people will buy one bag of salad mix one 5 oce bag of this works great um and uh you know it just it's a very very good money maker so you got to try doing it if you are doing any kind of farming and very easy to produce once you learn how um and it's I can't explain how to do it here but there's a lot of videos out there on how to do it so highly recommend you try shoots okay so you might be able to guess what our next crop is if you've ever grown them and that is carrots I've talked about this in a couple other videos but um we have like oh I forgot how many there are 1 two three four five six at least six beds of carrots growing out in the field right now and about eight or so growing in the G green houses so um that can tell you a little bit of how important carrots are for the farm um we're doing about 150 to 200 Bunches of carrots a week so one of these beds gets harvested every week at least sometimes two um we have enough labor right now where we can do that it does take quite a while to harvest carrots um but carrots are just they're just like a bombproof crop because you're always going to sell them um you know you can either sell them bunched or you break them down and sell them into one pound bags and people are going to buy them um so we grow them a lot of them fresh Bunch that's the best way to make money um but you know worst case scenario you break them down after the market and sell them bagged and that's pretty good as well um a lot of what you see right here is our storage crop that we're going to sell in the winter um so there's variety that's supposed to last six months or something um so we're going to do like 600 pounds of those um and sell them slowly over the winter you know um I don't want to do too many of that too much of that because it's pretty hard to harvest 600 pounds in like a day uh and we try to do it quick because you want to harvest that before it gets too cold um otherwise they've turned a little bit crunchy and weird but they don't store as well so we'll Harvest those sometime in October probably this year but carrots are a big backbone of the farm and basically all root crops but carrots are the most important because a lot of people can grow beets and radishes and stuff in their Garden but very few grow carrots well because it's hard to germinate them and it's uh that's the number one reason I think um most people just can't germinate them or they forget to plant them again in July you know we plant them basically every every month we'll do a big planting uh four or five beds at a time and do uh you know start that in like March through July you know and that's our carrots for the whole year pretty much I've tried doing a couple weird plantings in January and that sort of works um but yeah we do lots and lots of carrots it's a big back pone of the farm and so we're doing 150 to 200 bunch is it depends on the size of the carrots um how big of our bunches are how good the germination was on that bed and sometimes I'll Harvest them before it's going to yield us 200 bunches because I need to flip that bed to some other crop it doesn't really matter if we wait to get the full yield but you know at a minimum of $3 a bunch that's a lot of money that's at least $600 a week more usually um we do this thing where we're doing Rainbow carrots and regular carrots and you get two for six at the market and that works really well but you charge $4 for one so you're getting basically 350 a bunch that way and it works really well because not everybody buys two and all sorts of stuff so carrots are a big part of it we do a fair amount of Beats radishes probably about the same amount in those three crops beets radishes and green onions um a week but our yields on those have not been as good as I want them to be um mostly that's just because of just stuff going wrong and I don't really try that hard on Beats because they don't make that much money um they're a lot harder to sell also carrots just I'll sell three to one on Beats um you know people don't get as excited about Beats radishes have been very good but they don't grow well in the summer I can't get them to produce well when the flea beetles are going crazy and it's hot so I wish I could grow more radishes I think next year I will be able to but um so that's a huge part of that number two let's move on to the next crop all right so herbs in general are um a huge part of our business now um slowly built that into the business because it is hard to sell them on their own but we're selling a lot to restaurants right now and a lot at the farmers market so right now we're only doing parsley cilantro and Dill and they're all kind of of growing roughly the same and bunched the same priced the same we're doing about $3 a bunch for roughly a 4 o Bunch but sometimes it's 6 oun or8 ounces depending on what's going on but um these are really profitable crops I mean this one B of parsley will probably bring in $800 and that's because we're going to harvest it at least twice and there's going to be probably 300 something bunches coming out of here um and uh it might be a little less than 800 actually because this one won't uh go as long but that first bed we had did at least $1,000 because we harvested it like three times parsley comes back again and again and again and um you know it's really valuable at a market like mine because you're if you're the only guy with it people want that and if it's really fresh you they get a big bunch that looks way better than the old stuff at the store it's a huge huge Money Maker you just got to have a cold room and you know be able to store it um and this one has a great shelf life um cilantro and Dill which is what you see behind me um we do a lot of that as well that's probably even more profitable but well not quite because it's just you have to plant that so much more often partially you plant it once and it just keeps going but the cilantro and Dill will bolt but we're getting at least two crops out of that each bed and it's just a truckload we're selling a lot of those to restaurants and the cilantro is just going like hot cakes at the market because people are making salsa with the tomatoes um so we're doing 150 to 200 Bunches of of herbs per week right now between the three of those crops um at between two to $3 a bunch you know depending on who's buying it so that's a huge part of that number I anticipate we'll be doing at least 500 bunches a week soon um not not this year but next year um because the Market's just going to keep as our production of things like tomatoes and those draw crops increase and our reputation increases we'll just sell more we'll sell more the restaurants we're going to also start doing perennial herbs like oregano Rosemary stuff like that you could charge more for those um and they all herbs grow back so you get at least two cuts per per bed and um it's it's not a super sexy crop you know it's not G but once you get people into it they're going to come back to your booth just to buy those like deal people I have a lot of Eastern European customers that are coming back just to buy deal and our deal looks so much better than most deal at the market because it doesn't go to seed it's always fresh we plant it all the time to keep it that way but it's worth it because of the amount of production you can get and yield so um really big part of our business you know that's uh what is that you know $500 to $600 a week just in those crops and um we did it terrible with basil this year basil is another huge Money Maker but um I just didn't do a very good job of growing the plants this year so they're really behind and not growing well but basil is even more money so herbs are just a big big part of making a lot of money in a small space so let's move on to the next crops okay last but definitely not least is um what I'm calling miscellaneous crops which is like a lot of different crops but um they all we kind of sell them all the same they're all about like three to four dollar per unit um and we're doing 250 to 300 of those units per week on between all the different stuff you know it depends on the week so like cabbage was really hot the last couple weeks we're almost done with that that was three a unit we're doing 50 60 heads of those a week head lettuce 50 60 heads of those a week celery um that's just going to start coming on in a couple weeks um we're actually doing Bunch celery right now we just started that I just did a hundred Bunches of those today um and those were selling at $4 a bunch celery is a very profitable crop because nobody grows it and it's delicious tastes so much better than the store organic celery right now is $4 a pound or something right now at the store so it's like exactly the same as the store but Whitey years better um celery is a really good one um it takes forever to grow but once you have it and people have tried it it's it's a big money maker because you could charge a lot for it people who are juicing are going to buy a truckload of it because it's actually really cheap for juice because it's like 100% juice and the juice quality is off the charts so um saler is one of my favorites um we sell we're trying it as head full head and bunched this year the bunching you can actually pick we're going to get at least two crops out of that batch um if you plant it early enough you could get three you just take the outer stems and then it regrows from the center um big big money maker um so between those all those it's like $1,000 dollar a week in those miscellaneous crops and that means that's including kale chard um stuff like that you know so we try and incorporate a lot of those to add variety to the table we're growing 25 different crops right now um I don't know if that's going to change a whole lot in the future and we might go up to 40 maybe a maximum but um there's just this there's a I don't want to do too much variety because it gets hard each crop is a definitely a skill set in growing I'd say actually throughout the year we do probably grow about 4 different crops but right now it's about 25 that we're actually harvesting that's including stuff like summer squash and zucchini but all those crops add up to money um at your Market table and so um so between all of the crops I've talked about in this video that's where we're getting the average of $4,000 a week and last week was almost five this week will be probably close to five and then it'll start to go down again so it really depends on what's going on you know we're going to harvest shallots soon and that's going to be that'll make it like 6,000 but that's something we sell throughout the year and when I say 4,000 a week it doesn't necessarily mean we're selling that every week although right now we pretty much are um some of it we store and sell later like carrots bagged will sell later if we have a bumper crop we could stretch that a little bit because we have a cold room stuff like cabbage also if I needed to harvest a whole bed at once I could sell that months later if I wanted to celery I could probably sell a month later it's forever um salad greens we got to sell that pretty much that week but kale even you can stretch that for a while so um we have sold every almost everything we've grown this year there's a couple pounds of greens that we didn't sell at the very beginning before the markets really picked up but we're selling everything right now so we are producing $44,000 a week almost everything we sell is in about a $3 portion that's kind of standard Farmers Market thing the tomatoes those more just cuz if we didn't do that we would sell out in an hour and then everything else would stop selling you'll notice if you're in that position that if you sell out of tomatoes in two hours the last two hours your sales drop because the draw to your Boost stops so we are trying to sell it slow throughout that whole period to sell out of the salad greens and stuff and it's working really really well um right now I don't think we're have any problem we have so many we'll start freezing and selling them in the winter but um and even with tomatoes if you don't sell them you freeze them and you could sell them $4 a pound in the winter and people use them in in stews and stuff and it works great so you know that $4,000 a week is just a rough average um and um it depends I I mean we could really bump that up if we had everything going perfectly like I had planned might have been five but you know in farming a lot of things go wrong I'm still pretty young farm and I'm a young farmer I'm still learning a lot so I still make mistakes and um things go wrong so um that's like you know a real nice solid number for me I'm very happy with that this year um given the the size of the farm and again we're a half an acre Farm I think we have a total of about 80 50 foot beds that's not that much 50 foot means 50 feet long 2 and a2t wide so this this this bed right here is a 50ft bed of celery that's a 50ft bed of lettuce so um we're doing that and some of those you know the tomatoes is like I did a video a long time ago earlier this year about how much money you can make in a greenhouse and I talked about some of the numbers you can make on one bed of tomatoes one bed of tomatoes this year for us is about $2,000 in Revenue at least um and it depends on you know how early it is and stuff but uh those numbers are just numbers you know it depends on how successful you are that the weather all sorts of stuff but Baseline numbers that's what you can expect if you're good and that's a key detail you know I I saw those some of these numbers a long time ago and I got really excited my first year and I expected to get them and I didn't like things just don't work well until you build your skill set as a grower and um I'm still at myself so there's a lot of factors involved and labor is another Factor too you got to have really good labor to make all these numbers happen easily at least and not break your back um and we do this year I'm very fortunate that we do um but um this is just kind of a glimpse of what is possible because again we're only doing a half an acre of production um I think it's pretty incredible to be able to bring in that kind of Revenue on a half an acre because lots of places in in the world have a half an acre to grow on it's not very much land um especially with the price of land going up now so just wanted to put this video out there because when I first started I looked for these kinds of numbers like the yields that uh Farm was getting because it helps you kind of plan a potential of uh of your business I think it's it's helpful to know what other Farms are accomplishing so you know what's possible at least um and um there's a lot of factors to yields and I'm sure my yields can be a lot better that that you know I want to get better at growing more food on a small space every single year in the same beted and that's how you can really make money with this and I know that as as my skills improve that will be possible but um this is what I'm accomplishing right now and um you know hopefully this inspires somebody's out there to uh you know think twice about starting a farm or something so hope you enjoyed that and I will see you in the next one",
