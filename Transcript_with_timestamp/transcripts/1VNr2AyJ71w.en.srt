00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,599
today's video we'll be looking at the

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:12,559
top five pieces of farm equipment every

4
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:15,880
modern farmer needs to increase

5
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:17,640
efficiency save time and boost

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:20,519
productivity whether you're just

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,560
starting out or looking to upgrade these

8
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:25,880
machines are essential before we get

farming tips and Equipment reviews

12
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:36,160
first up is the tractor the most

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,760
versatile tool on any farm from plowing

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,360
fields to hauling heavy loads tractors

15
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,760
are the backbone of modern farming they

16
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,840
come in different sizes from compact

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:50,280
models perfect for small farms to larger

18
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:52,160
high-powered machines for big operations

19
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,440
when choosing a tractor make sure to

20
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,840
match its horsepower with the size and

21
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:00,039
needs of your farm remember investing in

22
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,280
a good tractor can save you both time

23
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:05,960
time and effort regular maintenance like

24
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,840
checking tire pressure and oil levels

25
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:11,640
will extend the life of your tractor

26
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:14,280
next is the combine harvester designed

27
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:18,080
to streamline the process of harvesting

28
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:21,159
grains like wheat corn and soybeans by

29
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,799
combining three tasks reaping threshing

30
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:26,240
and winnowing this machine dramatically

31
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:29,400
cuts down the time it takes to bring in

32
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,240
your crops with features like automated

33
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,960
steering and yield monitors today's

34
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,600
combines are smarter than ever making

35
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,680
them a crucial investment for larger

36
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:44,119
Farms some Modern combines can Harvest

37
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,960
up to 30 acres per hour third on the

38
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:49,960
list is the plow an essential tool for

39
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,719
preparing the soil plows break up and

40
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:55,439
turn over the soil helping with ation

41
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:58,000
and weed control making it easier for

42
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,680
crops to take root there are various

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,600
types of plows such as B board and

44
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:07,280
chisel plows each designed for specific

45
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:10,239
soil conditions for example chisel plows

46
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,520
are great for loosening compacted soil

47
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,599
without disturbing the entire surface be

48
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,879
sure to adjust the depth of the plow

49
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,760
based on your crops requirements for the

50
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:21,360
best

51
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:24,160
results fourth is the fertilizer

52
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,800
spreader a must for maximizing crop

53
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,280
yields a good spreader ensures that

54
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,560
nutrients are distributed evenly across

55
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,480
your field f s promoting healthier

56
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,920
growth there are two main types

57
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,840
broadcast spreaders which cover large

58
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:42,720
areas and drop spreaders which provide

59
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,720
more precise application choosing the

60
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,120
right type depends on your crop and

61
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:51,000
field size a well-calibrated fertilizer

62
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:54,159
spreader can reduce fertilizer waste and

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,200
boost Crop Production lastly we have

64
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:59,480
irrigation systems proper irrigation is

65
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,080
key to maintaining healthy crops

66
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,120
especially especially in regions with

67
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,640
inconsistent rainfall drip irrigation

68
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,159
systems are highly efficient delivering

69
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,040
water directly to the roots of plants

70
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:14,840
which saves both water and money for

71
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:17,200
larger Fields pivot irrigation systems

72
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,519
can cover a lot of ground and ensure

73
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,599
even water

74
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:23,799
distribution Pro tip installing moisture

75
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,400
sensors can help you track soil water

76
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:28,799
levels and avoid over or

77
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,799
underwatering and there you have it the

78
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,439
top five pieces of of farm equipment

79
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:36,200
every modern farmer needs whether it's

80
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:38,599
plowing planting fertilizing or

81
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,200
harvesting the right Machinery can make

82
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:43,120
all the difference in your Farm's
