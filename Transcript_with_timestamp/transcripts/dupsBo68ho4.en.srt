00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,180
most studies were exploratory and

10
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:23,580
focused on local scales relying heavily

11
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,680
on ground data and local knowledge

12
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,740
future research should focus on using

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,140
multiple sensors land stratification and

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:33,360
expert knowledge driven methods

15
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,160
Additionally the Sentinel constellation

16
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,380
will provide improved monitoring

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,600
capabilities for food security and
