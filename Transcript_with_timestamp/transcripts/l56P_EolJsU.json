  "text": "[Music] so we're here in buber today delving into the depths of the online soybean manual we're here with agronomist and Growers really looking at the whole soybean production cycle so the online soybean production manual is a really effective tool for both agronomist and Growers just looking at all areas of the soybean production system it does include lot of updated information to do with both diseases storage every different section of the soybean production [Music] process the consumption of soybean and the processing of the soybeans in Australia has changed back in the um 80s whilst we had a crushing plant that was a main focus but from the demise of that sort of plant there was a more focus on the edible type Market the edible Market being the Asian influence of tofu and also the introduction of soy milk as a dairy alternative those two sort of products have sort of paved the way for additional high-end edible sort of qualities uh the baking industry is is a major sort of consumer of soybeans as flour as an additive in the baking process through improvers soybeans in Australia grow from the the tropics all the way down through into Victoria uh your main production areas are concentrated in the Southeast corner of Queensland where the major manufacturers uh and processors are situated there is still plenty of demand in the marketplace in Australia we're still not producing enough soybeans that's going to meet all the market demand that we [Music] have so soybeans are a rotation option in our Shan farming system so are really a key pillar in in maintaining soil Health in our Coastal farming systems initially in the early days it was we wen't promoting it initially as a grain crop it was just to get Growers familiar with it as a rotation crop in in the in the sugar system so a lot of guys were just green manuring it but then it became very obvious that we could grow it for grining I was humbled at one event where one grower stood up and mentioned that you know unless he had grown soybeans for grain as part of his his farming system he still wouldn't be a cane farmer today because it got him through tough [Music] times in my role we're really looking at how to store the soybeans most effectively and trying to incorporate that extra Avenue into farming businesses in the region storage in these sorts of regions can be a bit tricky we often see them in coastal or Northern regions and that's where the relative humidity really comes into play we often see that the conditions can be a bit challenging for storing soy beans so we really look to go to a bit more uh technology in these sorts of regions looking at automated aeration controllers to really try and overcome some of the issues with manual aerations the manual itself came together in about 2012 so I was due for a refresh and now uh so it's been reviewed refreshed brought up to date and having it online it's an easy mechanism for Growers advisors or anybody Al like just be able to access that most current up-to-date information it's great that there's been a renewed push from grdc and the Queensland government to promote soybeans and I think there's a real opportunity there for other farming systems to consider soybeans not just cane and it's the kind of crop that people should be thinking about using when they're changing farming systems as a bit of a cleaning up the padic so to speak but the benefit is that you can also earn an income from it I think it's just a win-win all around I think it's a great crop I did access the online manual before I came to the workshop it sort of helped me decide whether I needed to come or not and I saw that there was plenty of extra information and more detail that perhaps hadn't been in older Publications so I was really pleased with that and I thought the online manual was quite easy to [Music] use I found the workshop today and yesterday absolutely brilliant I mean some of it I sort of knew before I've heard before of course but a lot of it was is a great refresher some of those little gems of wisdom that you sometimes forget uh but also because the speakers have been given plenty of time to talk they've gone into quite a lot of detail of their various subjects which has been brilliant because often when you talk to them it's on the fly or they do a quick presentation at a field day whereas this has been a lot more in depth and then we've of course got their great notes to refer back to glob soybeans are a new crop for me so it's been awesome to see like the whole picture of soybeans right from planting all the way to marketing at the end of the season yeah it's been fantastic the online manual is really good it's so easy to get through and you can see all the modules really easy just there click on them and go through all the information it's great [Music]",
