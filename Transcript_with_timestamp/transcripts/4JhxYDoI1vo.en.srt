1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,080
good afternoon I'm Caitlyn youngquist

2
00:00:02,679 --> 00:00:06,600
with the University of Wyoming extension

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,480
and I'm going to talk to you a little

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,400
bit today about soil testing for Gardens

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,000
soil testing can be a very useful tool

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,360
uh for gardeners and hopefully I'll be

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,760
able to share with you some information

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,000
today that will make it easier and um

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,199
more useful for

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,680
you one thing to keep in mind when we're

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,560
talking about soil there are a lot of

12
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,720
different

13
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:31,599
factors chemistry is an important part

14
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,280
of managing soil biology and physics and

15
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,640
when it comes to soil testing what we're

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,800
specifically talking about is the

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,239
chemistry of the soil so we're looking

18
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,280
at the pH or the acidity the salt

19
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:45,399
content your macronutrients nitrogen

20
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:47,440
phosphorus and potassium and the

21
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:48,800
micronutrients when it comes to biology

22
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,520
what we're looking at is the nutrient

23
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,559
availability for the plants uh crop

24
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,440
condition the the microorganisms living

25
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:59,519
in the soil we're looking at bacteria

26
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:01,399
and fungi earthworms the organic carbon

27
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:03,879
content of the soil which is what feeds

28
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:05,600
the soil biology disease pressure there

29
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:07,759
are a lot of different factors we look

30
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,840
at with soil biology I'm not going to

31
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:11,400
talk about that much today but there is

32
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,119
a different set of tests that can be

33
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,400
done to look specifically at the

34
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,119
biological condition of your soil but

35
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,640
the best thing to do really there is to

36
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,560
look at crop condition are the plants

37
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,920
healthy and are there earthworms in your

38
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,320
garden those are the two most important

39
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,360
things really as gardeners that you can

40
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,040
look at and when it comes to physics we

41
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,600
look at things like erosion and

42
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,920
compaction um how and water infiltration

43
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,799
how does the water move through the soil

44
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,799
does it P puddle on top of the soil does

45
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:38,600
the soil dry out very quickly and then

46
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:40,119
tilt the workability of the soil um does

47
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,079
it just look and feel like really

48
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:44,159
healthy soil so these are all different

49
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,640
factors we look at when managing soil

50
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,680
there's different ways and different

51
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,000
tools and methodologies to test for a

52
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,560
lot of these different factors but today

53
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,360
we're going to talk about specifically

54
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:56,360
the chemistry of the soil and that's

55
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:59,000
what a soil um nutrient test will show

56
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,719
you it's greatly impacted by fertilizer

57
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and water

58
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:05,439
and the way we have an impact on soil

59
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,119
physics or the physical condition of the

60
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,599
soil is through disturbance and bare

61
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,680
soil primarily so tillage and leaving

62
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,239
our soil bare and then the way we

63
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,040
improve or impact the biology of the

64
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:16,560
soil is through plant roots keeping

65
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,720
living plant roots in the soil as long

66
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,080
as possible and adding amendments like

67
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,560
manure and compost organic materials to

68
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,519
the soil and when we have all three of

69
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,239
these things Balan the biology chemistry

70
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:30,400
and physics of the soil we have a really

71
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:32,560
healthy functioning high functioning

72
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,400
system so keep in mind when you're

73
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,879
managing a soil to keep all of these

74
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,560
factors in mind today we're just going

75
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:40,159
to talk about

76
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,680
chemistry so why might you soil test as

77
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,440
a gardener there are a few different

78
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,319
reasons the primarily would be to

79
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,080
identify problems so something in your

80
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:49,879
garden is struggling there are certain

81
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,440
crops you can't grow well um everything

82
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:54,000
is struggling you're trying to figure

83
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,319
out why and a soil test can really help

84
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
identify those challenges it can also be

85
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,959
helpful to establish a baseline maybe

86
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,239
you're putting in a new garden and you

87
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:02,800
want to see where your Baseline and your

88
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:04,040
soil is maybe you're looking at changing

89
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,879
some of your practices you're going to

90
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,319
change from a rotail garden to a noil

91
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,879
garden and you want to get it Baseline

92
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,239
on where your organic matter is you may

93
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,760
be going to spend a lot of money on

94
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,040
fertilizer maybe you have a very large

95
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,879
garden and you're are going to invest a

96
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,120
lot of money on fertilizer compost or

97
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,400
manure and you want to know what your

98
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,480
soil um nutrient status is before you

99
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,519
spend that money maybe you're just

100
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,959
curious maybe you just really find soil

101
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,879
chemistry fascinating and you would just

102
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,280
like to know what the chemistry of your

103
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,640
soil is like

104
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,720
you can also test the nutrient content

105
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,000
and the salt content of manure and

106
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,400
compost uh it's very similar you use the

107
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,920
same Labs there's similar reports but it

108
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,519
can be very useful if you are going to

109
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,120
add a large quantity of compost or

110
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:46,319
manure to your garden or to your small

111
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,799
farm and then you can test the nutrient

112
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,799
content of that

113
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,400
Amendment so soil chemistry test what

114
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,879
will the lab test for right you can

115
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,519
select variety of tests from any

116
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:02,040
different soil lab but here are some of

117
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,439
the Basics nitrate nitrogen so you're

118
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,879
going to be testing for nitrogen but it

119
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,599
comes in many forms it comes in a

120
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,840
nitrate ion it comes as an ammonium ion

121
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,439
and it also comes in the organic form so

122
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,920
what the soil is gonna soil labs are

123
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,560
going to test for primarily is nitrate

124
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,919
nitrogen ammonia nitrogen phosphorus and

125
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,479
potassium those are your big three your

126
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,519
macronutrients then some of your

127
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:23,479
micronutrients calcium magnesium and

128
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,320
sulfur they can be lumped in as macro or

129
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:27,080
micro they're kind of in the middle and

130
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,080
then some of your micronutrients zinc

131
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:32,280
iron manganese copper Boron um they're

132
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,120
variety of others but those can be also

133
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,759
helpful for identifying where your what

134
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,440
the nutrient status of your soil is also

135
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:41,160
you'll get a test for soil organic

136
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,600
matter they use um uh very very high

137
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,800
temperatures basically they burn off the

138
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,840
organic matter and then look at the

139
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,520
difference in the soil so that can be

140
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,160
very useful for monitoring over time uh

141
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,639
pH or the acidity of the soil and salts

142
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,000
also very useful especially here in

143
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,400
Wyoming where we have a lot of very

144
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
alkaline and very saline

145
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:03,080
soils and then the EC which is your

146
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
total dissolve salt so so that's the

147
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,199
that EC stands for electrolytic

148
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,919
conductivity and that is what you'll see

149
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,320
on your lab report typically is either

150
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:12,520
total salt or EC and I'll talk a little

151
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,840
bit more about that here in a few

152
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,360
minutes and then your sodium absorption

153
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,400
absorption Ratio or your your the

154
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,080
percent of the exchange sites in the

155
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,840
soil that are occupied by sodium and

156
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,199
that identifies the sodium hazard in

157
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,720
your soil or your water and there are

158
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,479
many different um ions that form salts

159
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,479
in soil and in water sodium is

160
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:35,360
particularly problematic and can be very

161
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:37,680
difficult to manage because of its large

162
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,080
ionic size so if you are concerned that

163
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,880
you have sodium issues in your soil the

164
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,880
getting tested the sodium absorption

165
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,880
ratio can be very

166
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,080
helpful this is a list of our primary

167
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,240
plant nutrients you can see at the top

168
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,880
your macronutrients nitrogen phosphorus

169
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,680
and potassium this list includes calcium

170
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,720
magnesium and sulfur also as

171
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,039
macronutrients and then it gets into all

172
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,520
your micronutrients here down the list

173
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,120
and what's interesting is this is just a

174
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,759
reminder about that why they're called

175
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,919
macro and micronutrients the relative

176
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:11,599
number of atoms in Plants right so for

177
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:15,720
any PL every plant for every one million

178
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:17,520
atoms of nitrogen you might have one of

179
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,160
meibum or nickel so that's why these are

180
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,080
called micronutrients you the plants

181
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,039
just need a lot less of them compared to

182
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,960
the

183
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:27,080
macronutrients this is also interesting

184
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:29,080
because it shows you the primary form of

185
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,039
plant uptake so for nitrogen plants

186
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:34,759
primarily take up the nitrate and the

187
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:37,240
ammonium ion for phosphorus they take up

188
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:39,280
phosphate and for potassium calcium and

189
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,680
magnesium they take up the pure ionic

190
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,599
form for sulfur they take it up in a

191
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,960
sulfate form and down the list so that's

192
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:47,440
just kind of interesting thing to see

193
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,440
what the plants use and then where these

194
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,400
nutrients come from organic matter is a

195
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,759
big one and then minerals um as the

196
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,199
minerals are weathered in the soil and

197
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:59,199
they start to break down slowly through

198
00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:01,000
biological and um chemical processes

199
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,400
they rele nutrients into the soil that

200
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,800
the plants can use into the soil

201
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,919
solution so this just is a good example

202
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,000
of all the different um essential plant

203
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:11,919
nutrients that that come from the soil

204
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,599
of course the oxygen um or the carbon

205
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,120
and the hydrogen come from the water and

206
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:18,560
the air so this interesting things to

207
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,560
look at

208
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:23,720
here this is the nitrogen cycle and the

209
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,840
reason I wanted to share this is just an

210
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:29,720
example of of how all of these nutrients

211
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:32,280
move through the soil and go from um the

212
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,199
plant to the soil to through the or

213
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,479
through the microorganisms in the soil

214
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:37,680
back to the plant again it's a

215
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:39,280
continuous cycle right and remember a

216
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,160
lot of nitrogen comes from the organic

217
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,680
matter and what happens is as the

218
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,280
organic matter is is is broken down by

219
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,800
organisms in the soil by the bacteria

220
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,159
and fungi it releases nitrogen in the

221
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,280
ammonium and the nitrate form and this

222
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:54,520
is the primarily the form that the

223
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,759
plants can use some of that nitrate can

224
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,599
be lost through leeching through

225
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,280
excessive water moving through the soil

226
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,919
right and it's continually going back

227
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,280
and forth into organic matter and into

228
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:05,720
microbes and then back into the soil

229
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,720
solution so the plants can take it

230
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:10,599
up that's why when you have a lot of

231
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:13,800
organic matter in your soil it generally

232
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:17,680
Pro provides over time a slow steady

233
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,680
release of nitrogen for the plants to

234
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,440
use this is the phosphorus cycle there

235
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,680
are some key differences here notice the

236
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,720
small the pool of organic matter is cons

237
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,840
considerably smaller and there's a

238
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,680
little bit of Sol ution phosphorus here

239
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,519
right and then a lot of it comes from

240
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:37,120
the secondary minerals and compounds

241
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:39,560
what's particularly key is that this

242
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,440
small pool of of phosphorus in the

243
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:44,200
solution that the plants can take up

244
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,000
right that the plants can use it very

245
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,360
quickly depending on the soil chemistry

246
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,120
moves over here into these minerals and

247
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,240
is not available to plants the

248
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:56,040
precipitation process here right and and

249
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:59,920
and because of our high pH our very

250
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:01,240
alkaline and um saline high salt soils

251
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,079
but especially because of our alkaline

252
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,040
soils a lot of the phosphorus that might

253
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:06,720
otherwise be available to plants moves

254
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,760
over here into these minerals and is

255
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,519
unavailable however if we have high

256
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,000
organic matter in our soils and we

257
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:14,399
really work on building the organic

258
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
material in our soils this phosphorus

259
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,560
here is more available to the plants so

260
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,959
just something interesting here to keep

261
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,560
in mind with the with the phosphorus so

262
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,640
often there'll be phosphorus in the soil

263
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,360
but it is not available to the plants

264
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,279
interestingly enough iron is the same

265
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,880
here in our soils and so that's why

266
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:31,000
often we'll see iron deficiency even

267
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,160
though there's plenty of iron in the

268
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,640
soil it's just not plant

269
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,800
available manure and compost are great

270
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:40,680
sources of

271
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,240
phosphorus potassium is very simple um

272
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,000
it there we tend not to have shortages

273
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,920
here in our soils although occasionally

274
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,880
I've seen s shortages on Farm crops that

275
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,000
are grown in heavy Sandy or very Sandy

276
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,800
soils but again we have a lot of it in

277
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,720
solution means dissolved in the water in

278
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,720
the soil and um very little of it gets

279
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,839
gets um bound up in the minerals that

280
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,760
the plants can't use and so it's it's a

281
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:02,680
pretty simple story we rarely have

282
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,880
shortages of it but it is a it's very

283
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:07,079
important nutrient and it's important to

284
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,079
have

285
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,079
enough I mentioned soil PH a few times

286
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,320
that's the alkalinity of our soil

287
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,920
remember acid is low numbers down here

288
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,760
on this chart it starts at four for an

289
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:22,360
acidic pH and up to 10 for an alkaline

290
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:24,600
pH neutral is seven which is where most

291
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,519
plants prefer to grow based on nutrient

292
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,399
availability most of our soils in

293
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:31,200
Wyoming are the high sevens and even up

294
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:34,000
to eight and what you'll notice here is

295
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:37,600
that um the nutrient availability is

296
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,760
greatly affected by soil PH so um as the

297
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,480
pH creeps up above seven uh we start to

298
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,040
see a decrease in the availability of

299
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,279
phosphorus and a decrease in the

300
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,440
availability of a lot of these other

301
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,959
micronutrients iron copper and zinc for

302
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,120
example doesn't affect calcium very much

303
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:53,639
we actually see an increase in the

304
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,639
availability of magnesium potassium and

305
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:57,639
sulfur aren't greatly affected nor is

306
00:10:55,639 --> 00:11:00,079
nitrogen but particularly phosphorus and

307
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:02,680
our micronutrients are less plant

308
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,040
available as the pH creeps up again

309
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,120
increasing the organic matter in the

310
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,519
soil will really help with this and some

311
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:11,000
plants are more tolerant of a high pH

312
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:12,639
than others right so uh those and

313
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,079
there's lists of that that you can get

314
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:16,160
that will help you determine what can

315
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,720
thrive in your soils blueberries are

316
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,680
kind of a classic example that really

317
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,480
prefer an acidic soil they're bog plants

318
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,440
typically so they don't Thrive here in

319
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,920
Wyoming without a lot of careful soil

320
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,320
management because they really prefer

321
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,320
acidic

322
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,120
soils soil solinity is another challenge

323
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:34,399
we have here in

324
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,200
Wyoming what happens is if you have ever

325
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,639
boiled a pot of water on the stove and

326
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,279
then what is Left Behind is a little bit

327
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:41,959
of these white residue and then less the

328
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:43,880
water's boiled off and the salts are

329
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:46,360
left behind that's what's happening in

330
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:48,320
the soil and so salt when it comes to

331
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:51,240
when we're talking about soil salinity

332
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,760
are basically positive and negative ions

333
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,240
that dissociate in water and almost all

334
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,600
of those ions with the exception of

335
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,680
sodium are essential plant nutrients and

336
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,320
so really it's an excess excess amount

337
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,200
of nutrients more than the plants can

338
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:06,200
use and what happens particularly when

339
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,880
you have bare soil and it's hot and you

340
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:11,040
may have salt in your water as the water

341
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,240
evaporates off the surface of the soil

342
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,720
the salts remain behind and accumulate

343
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,839
right and water um moves upward through

344
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,839
capillary

345
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:20,519
action so this is an important thing to

346
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:22,160
keep in mind what you'll often see white

347
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:24,480
crystals on the surface of the soil that

348
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,480
salts that have left been left behind

349
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,399
low-lying areas um will often have more

350
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,199
salts in them or on the surface to the

351
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:32,920
soil one of the most important things

352
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:35,079
you can do here is keep your soil

353
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:37,440
mulched no bare soil in the garden make

354
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:39,639
sure everything is really well mulched

355
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,760
that will keep the soil cool and mean

356
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:43,639
less water will evaporate and less salts

357
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,959
will be brought up from from under from

358
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:49,199
deeper in the soil the other thing you

359
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:50,720
can do is grow more salt tolerant plants

360
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:53,000
University of Wyoming extension has a

361
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,720
great bulletin that lists the salinity

362
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,560
tolerance of various Horticultural

363
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,440
plants that's a good

364
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,800
reference the other thing you can do if

365
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,920
you're really concerned about salty

366
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,399
irrigation water is to have your water

367
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:07,760
tested when you have your soil

368
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:10,160
tested and if you have high saline High

369
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,160
salts in your soil very saline soils

370
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,120
take care with what fertilizers and what

371
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,880
manure or compost you add because again

372
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:20,000
you have an excessive certain nutrients

373
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:20,000
in your soil so it's important to manage

374
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:26,920
carefully this is a general

375
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,760
classification when you get uh your soil

376
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,720
test results back you'll get a number

377
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:33,120
for your electrity electrolytic

378
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,720
conductivity and your soil PH and po

379
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,480
potentially your soil absorption ratio

380
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,240
if you have asked for that and this

381
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,959
shows you if you have greater than four

382
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,480
of an e EC greater than four you'll have

383
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,959
a Salan soil and your pH and various

384
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,519
things so these this is just an example

385
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,560
of what you're what you're looking at

386
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:50,040
here and again your the soil lab that

387
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,360
you work with or your local Extension

388
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,079
Office can help you interpret some of

389
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,240
these

390
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:57,199
results um so this is your total salt

391
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,519
and this is the ratio of sodium to

392
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:02,440
calcium and magnesium and that

393
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:04,920
determines your your sodium

394
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,959
problems so that was a little bit of a

395
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:09,399
chemistry lesson now let's talk about

396
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:12,079
how to collect samples for an accurate

397
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:14,120
lab interpretation so if you do do not

398
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,639
do a good job collecting samples the lab

399
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,000
will um only be able to give you results

400
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,360
that are as accurate as the samples

401
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,959
you've collected right so um divide your

402
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,880
property into management zones so you

403
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:28,399
may want to sample your lawn or your

404
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,800
garden or your pasture or maybe you have

405
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,839
two different Gard one in the front of

406
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,079
the house and one in the back of the

407
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:35,120
house that have been managed differently

408
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:37,360
over the years so separate your colle

409
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,720
sample collection areas into management

410
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,839
zones and leave out any really strange

411
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,800
areas so say you have a one acre garden

412
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,440
and one corner of it's always really a

413
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,880
little wetter or it's lower or it's

414
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,399
always really problematic SE sample that

415
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,240
separately because what you're going to

416
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:53,120
do is collect a variety of or collect

417
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,360
samples across the landscape or across

418
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,199
the garden and mix them all together for

419
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,160
what we call a composite

420
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:01,839
sample now if you have some really

421
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:03,079
strange area um one section that behaves

422
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,160
differently than the others and you mix

423
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:05,759
everything together you're not going to

424
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:09,040
get accurate results for either section

425
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:11,240
so separate those out you need about 10

426
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,759
s 10 to 15 samples collected for a

427
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,959
garden typically if you're sampling

428
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:17,959
pastures um or larger areas you'll need

429
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:20,560
more samples but for a garden typically

430
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:22,399
10 to 15 cores across the garden will be

431
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,399
just fine if it's a very small garden

432
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,440
you can get away with less but keep in

433
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,160
mind the more composite samp the more

434
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,399
samples you you take to make your

435
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,759
composite the more ACC accurate your

436
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:33,279
results will

437
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:35,440
be use clean tools don't use anything

438
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,880
that's Rusty or galvanized and you're

439
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,720
going to collect your sample down to a

440
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:43,839
depth of about six inches for Gardens

441
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,680
remove any bits of root um don't sample

442
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,600
where there's manure or anything like

443
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,399
that try and get a really clean sample

444
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,720
and then layer your samples out to air

445
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:52,959
dry on a clean paper bag or paper towels

446
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,480
or something where animals aren't going

447
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,480
to get to it or you're not going to

448
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,680
spill anything on it and keep everything

449
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,040
really

450
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,800
clean these here are some tools that you

451
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:05,000
can use um this is a soil probe here on

452
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,720
the left and soil augers it's a very

453
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,759
simple tool but you don't need to go buy

454
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,079
one often your extension um local

455
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,440
extension office or maybe your

456
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:15,399
Conservation District will have one you

457
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:17,959
can borrow but you can also use a shovel

458
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:19,639
so you'll go take your 10 to 15 core

459
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:21,959
samples across the landscape mix them in

460
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:24,079
a clean bucket and then lay them out to

461
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:26,680
dry that's the simplest way to do it

462
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:28,519
most Labs ask for about two cups of soil

463
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,959
if your sample um when you're done

464
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:31,440
collecting all your different cores and

465
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:34,079
you mix it together and you have maybe

466
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,160
four or five cups of soil mix it

467
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:39,440
together really uniformly and then take

468
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:41,199
out about the two cups that um the lab

469
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,880
requires and but make sure that that

470
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,720
soil is Thoroughly mixed so you don't

471
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,279
end up with sending a sample into the

472
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,600
lab that only accounts for half of your

473
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:50,959
pasture or your

474
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,759
garden if you don't have access to a

475
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:55,680
soil core a shovel can work really well

476
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:59,240
just dig a hole down about six to eight

477
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:03,160
inches and then take a slice off an inch

478
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:05,280
or two slice off the side of that hole

479
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,880
then um you can use that slice you can

480
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,520
actually slice down the middle of this

481
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,439
to take a strip of soil that's going to

482
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,199
be about similar to taking a soil core

483
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,799
right down the middle of this shovel

484
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,919
dump it in the bucket do that 10 more

485
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,720
times mix it all together and then

486
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:19,760
separate out your two cups if you do it

487
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,000
this way you're going to end up with a

488
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,199
lot more soil than you need so it's very

489
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,120
important to mix it uniformly before you

490
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:27,120
take out your sub

491
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,440
sample and there are a lot of videos if

492
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,840
you look particularly look at extension

493
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,440
resources and look up on YouTube some

494
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,240
videos on soil sampling they'll give you

495
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,799
some good resources and examples of how

496
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,320
to do

497
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:44,240
it so where do you send your sample

498
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,880
that's the next question find a lab that

499
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,919
is certified by the North American

500
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,840
proficiency testing program you can go

501
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,720
to their website and you can look up

502
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:55,280
different Labs there are several um

503
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,480
neighboring states we don't um have a

504
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,520
University of Wyoming lab anymore but

505
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,799
there are several in neighboring states

506
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,360
Colorado State University extension or

507
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:06,400
the Colorado State University soil

508
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,559
testing lab um is easy to work with as a

509
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,280
gardener because if you tell them that

510
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,159
you want a garden soil test their

511
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,200
results um are very easy to interpret

512
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:15,840
and they're designed for gardeners but

513
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,159
they're a little slower some of the

514
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,000
commercial Labs will turn around um the

515
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:21,760
samples a lot faster and get you results

516
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,919
faster but they may be harder to

517
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,559
interpret so there are many choices I

518
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,080
would suggest going to this website and

519
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:30,760
looking up some different labs in the

520
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,760
area make sure it's a certifed

521
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:37,520
lab so you get your results back this is

522
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,799
an example of um the soil test report I

523
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,679
should say though also when you're

524
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:43,039
looking at these Labs on their websites

525
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:44,960
they should have sampling um shipping

526
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,320
instructions and how they how much soil

527
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,400
they want and where they want it shipped

528
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,200
so if you have any questions you can

529
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:53,440
call the lab directly this is an example

530
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:55,640
of the result from a soil test that was

531
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,360
done by Colorado State University

532
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:00,440
extension specifically for Gardens now

533
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:02,320
notice it says native vegetation and the

534
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:05,080
proposed plant type is vegetable garden

535
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:07,440
so this individual was putting in a new

536
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,000
garden now the other thing to keep in

537
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,919
mind is that when you fill out your soil

538
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,400
test forms be as detailed as possible

539
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:14,480
about what was grown there what you're

540
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,240
going to grow because then they can give

541
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,679
you more accurate recommendations if

542
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,960
you're asking for a soil test or um

543
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,880
fertilizer recommendation so in this

544
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,080
particular case they go this is why the

545
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,600
CSU lab is great for for folks who are

546
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,760
less familiar with soil chemistry

547
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,240
because they very specific spefic

548
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,679
recommendations uh pH is high but native

549
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,000
and introduced plant species that are

550
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,240
adapted to this pH should not be

551
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,520
negatively affected EC is less than two

552
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:44,679
two so your salinity is not a problem

553
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:45,640
organic matter um the texture estimate

554
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:48,440
even

555
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,520
nitrate um they say nitrate here is low

556
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,360
apply and they give you some

557
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:54,679
recommendations for that um phosphorus

558
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:56,159
there's your soil test results and they

559
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:58,000
give you some recommendations on how

560
00:19:56,159 --> 00:19:59,799
much to add um per square foot as

561
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,480
opposed to per which is Handy for most

562
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:03,000
gardeners they use give you some

563
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,400
different examples of what types of

564
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,080
fertilizer you can use to meet that need

565
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,799
they go through your micronutrients and

566
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:12,400
then um sometimes put some additional

567
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:14,400
comments here so this can be a a really

568
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,840
useful resource they just they sort of

569
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,720
provide everything you need here for the

570
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,000
interpretation and again be very

571
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,200
specific about what um what you're

572
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,640
growing so that they can give you

573
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,000
accurate

574
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,799
recommendations this is the CSU report

575
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,960
that's that's designed for agricultural

576
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:32,760
use notice it's um has it's it can it

577
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,360
has results for multiple Fields so this

578
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:38,880
particular producer sent in only one um

579
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,159
sample at a time but you could send in

580
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,480
five or six samples and they would all

581
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,000
come back on the same report maybe five

582
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:46,320
or six different fields that you had pH

583
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,760
salts um texture estimate that's

584
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,919
optional if you ask for it organic

585
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,200
matter percent and then it goes through

586
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,880
all of your um in parts per million all

587
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,159
of your different nutrients here now the

588
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,880
fertilizer recommendations this

589
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,440
particular producer asked for fertilizer

590
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,000
recommendations for oats and in order to

591
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,360
get accurate recommendations they need

592
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,039
to put the proposed crop and the yield

593
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:08,360
per acre goal so they wanted to grow

594
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:10,960
oats and with a yield goal of 110

595
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:12,559
bushels per acre so the soil lab can put

596
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,760
this information and the soil

597
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:16,400
information into their formulas and come

598
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:18,520
up with some fertilizer recommendations

599
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,720
they are suggesting 40 pounds per acre

600
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:23,559
of p25 and 80 pounds per acre of

601
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,159
nitrogen now as a producer you would

602
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:26,440
know your own field you may know what

603
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:30,320
you've done in the past but this gives

604
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,320
you a good place to start

605
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,760
this is a different lab this is Midwest

606
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,240
Laboratories uh again these are the

607
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,520
numbers the lab assigns this is the

608
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:42,640
sample identification that the producer

609
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,919
sent um that the producer labeled their

610
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,120
samples with so that this means

611
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,840
something to them has something to do

612
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,720
with their fields organic matter percent

613
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,000
and then the different phosphorus and

614
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,640
they have little notes here that says

615
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,640
very high medium

616
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:59,120
High um very low and that's their a

617
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,520
little bit of interpretation there that

618
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,880
can help you determine how to use these

619
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,799
numbers cation exchange capacity this is

620
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:09,960
the ability of the soil to exchange

621
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,840
nutrients um their nitrate is down here

622
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,520
you can also do depth so sometimes

623
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,880
you'll sample 0 to six inches and then

624
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,960
six to 12 inches depending on what

625
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,640
you're doing but again these are more

626
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:20,720
detailed reports so just another example

627
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,360
of what might come back from the lab for

628
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,120
you to look

629
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:27,960
at this is another interesting thing you

630
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,720
can do at home this is um this little

631
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,400
infographic says it's t to identify your

632
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,880
soil type but that's actually inaccurate

633
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,279
what you are really identifying here is

634
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,240
your soil texture your percent of sand

635
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:38,520
silt and Clay so this can be an easy

636
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,000
thing to do at home do it with the kids

637
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,919
it's kind of interesting it can help you

638
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,120
look at some of the different um

639
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:46,480
characteristics of your soil makes the

640
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:48,799
water in the jar with the soil and let

641
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,080
it sit for a day or two and it settles

642
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,880
out into sand silk and clay and organic

643
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,440
matter kind of floats on the top and

644
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:58,880
then you're able to see what the soil

645
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,880
textural differences are in your soil

646
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,919
so I I think it's important to touch

647
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,440
briefly on the difference between a

648
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:07,080
fertilizer and a soil amendment when it

649
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:08,840
comes to identifying the needs in your

650
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,559
soil so a fertilizer when you're

651
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,720
applying a fertilizer it's a source of

652
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,960
very specific nutrients Rapid Release

653
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,080
and availability generally has your

654
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,880
macro it's labeled with your

655
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,840
macronutrients you'll see numbers there

656
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:23,559
10 10 10 or something that says uh 10%

657
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:25,720
nitrogen 10% phosphorus 10% potassium so

658
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:28,320
it tells you what's in it uh it can be

659
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:30,000
synthetic or organic um and some manure

660
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,039
like ping manure would could go into the

661
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,919
fertilizer category but Rapid Release

662
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:36,320
and availability it's for use now or

663
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,559
within a growing season a soil amendment

664
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,640
is a source of organic matter typically

665
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:43,159
and long-term nutrients and a benefit to

666
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,840
soil Health it's a long-term investment

667
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:46,360
it's going to release nutrients slowly

668
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,679
over time it's going to support the soil

669
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,840
biology and it's going to increase your

670
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:53,279
soil health over time compost rage

671
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:55,799
manure and cover crops are examples of

672
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:58,000
this so for example Miracle Grow plant

673
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:59,880
food that's an example of a fertilizer

674
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,240
see the number here Aller purpose plant

675
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:08,679
food 24816 that means it's 24% nitrogen

676
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:10,960
8% p205 and 16% uh k2o or poach right

677
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:13,559
and you can look down here it has it has

678
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,919
the breakdown of what that is right and

679
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:16,760
then you'll notice that there they are

680
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:19,840
slightly different blends based on All

681
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:21,720
Purpose this plant food um or the rose

682
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,880
plant food is slightly different right

683
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,640
so that's when you know it's a

684
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,760
fertilizer right and it tells you what

685
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,559
it's made of these are synthetic

686
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,480
fertilizers here on the label it tells

687
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:31,520
you what's in it

688
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:33,520
these are examples of soil amendments so

689
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,520
composted manure look at the very low

690
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:39,520
nutrient content per weight based on

691
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:41,880
compared to the fertilizer a um

692
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:45,080
0.05% right as opposed to here we're

693
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:47,279
looking at like 24% nitrogen so again a

694
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:49,480
nutrient-rich blend promotes root growth

695
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:52,559
improves soil quality over time

696
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:55,960
long-term investment in soil Health very

697
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:57,480
important over the long term uh uh grass

698
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,039
clippings and leaves you can compost

699
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,640
that at home food waste is is a worm bin

700
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:03,039
that I keep at the office worm castings

701
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,960
are great for the soil so think about

702
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:07,559
you're going to have less short-term

703
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,039
nutrient benefit long more long-term

704
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:12,120
slow release nutrients and benefit of

705
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:14,480
soil

706
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:16,159
health so how do we interpret our

707
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,600
results now we understand the chemistry

708
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,159
we've talked a little bit about biology

709
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,360
we got these lab results in front of us

710
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:23,080
what do we do with those these are two

711
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,120
of the best bulletins that I found for

712
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:27,080
interpreting um soil test results for

713
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,480
gardeners one is the soil test

714
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,000
interpretation guide that comes comes

715
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,919
from Oregon State University you can

716
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,559
look that up and then Colorado State

717
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,279
University has a soil test explanation

718
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:38,120
bulletin that's also very good and

719
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:39,520
simple and to the point so I would

720
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,760
encourage you to look up both of those

721
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,159
if you have a soil test you need

722
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:44,520
interpreting and um speak with the lab

723
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:47,080
that you're working with they often have

724
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:50,840
interpretation guides available as well

725
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:52,080
so good luck um and if you um need

726
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,880
assistance or might need to borrow some

727
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:58,720
tools contact your local extension

728
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:58,720
office and best of luck in the garden
