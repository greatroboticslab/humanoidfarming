1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,020
a little happy day outliers in

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:06,420
woodworkers mana here with heartwood art

3
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,799
do you have a messy garage or shed full

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,650
of garden tools that you could never

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:12,509
find well that's easy and cheap DIY

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,610
palette project it's gonna solve that

7
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:17,190
problem for you now I'm gonna take you

8
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,529
on a short video tour of how I built

9
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,140
this but for all the details come on

10
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:24,930
over to heartwood art comm and see each

11
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:29,330
step in the process plus how to fully

12
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,330
customize it okay let's dive in and

13
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:37,980
since this palette will be freestanding

14
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,350
meaning that it won't be attached to the

15
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,899
wall will be adding feet to it to ensure

16
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,640
that it can't tip forward so the first

17
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:46,980
thing we'll want to do is stand the

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,320
palette up to find the most level in

19
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,000
that will make less work for you to

20
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,969
level it to add the feet later

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,430
now while the palette is stood up insert

22
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,710
your long handle tools to get an idea of

23
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,719
best placement for them and determine

24
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,390
how many cross rails you'll need to cut

25
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,909
so that you can easily lift them out

26
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:09,180
I had an industrial pallet that was 45

27
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:12,030
by 45 inches and I had to remove the top

28
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:14,610
three cross rails so lay your pallet on

29
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:17,159
the floor and cut those cross rails I

30
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:19,830
use my circular saw guide to make a

31
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,530
straight cut and to support the saw as

32
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,900
the rails fell out and you can see how

33
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,750
to make a guide like this yourself over

34
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:31,020
at hurt wood art okay now let's add the

35
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:33,270
feet I used two of those rails that we

36
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,400
cut out and I'm mounting them flush to

37
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,990
the back but you can have them stick out

38
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,659
in the back a little bit if you want to

39
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,909
mine stuck out the front by 11 inches

40
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:46,140
and that was enough to make the pallet

41
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:48,450
tip roof I used number 8 by 1 and 3/4

42
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,759
construction screws and drill pilot

43
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:53,070
holes with a countersink to get the

44
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,290
screw head flush or below the plane of

45
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:58,259
the wood ok let's move on to mounting

46
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:00,060
the tools I have several axes and wanted

47
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:01,680
to mount them on the bottom front shelf

48
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,840
now because they're so heavy

49
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,360
I thought supports running through the

50
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,190
pallet would be a good idea I use more

51
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,800
of those rail cut-offs for this and

52
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:13,080
because I had a back and front rail

53
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,680
parallel that's how I decided to mount

54
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,290
them

55
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,719
just now that the support rails could

56
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:21,239
interfere with your long handle tool

57
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,609
placement so be sure to check that tool

58
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:26,310
placement again before you mount the

59
00:02:23,609 --> 00:02:29,909
supports and I attach them with screws

60
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:32,219
into the back rail and then next I built

61
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:34,109
that act shelf I just happened to have

62
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:36,810
torn down another pallet that was the

63
00:02:34,109 --> 00:02:38,639
same size and I had a scrap piece that

64
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,430
was exactly the right width and length

65
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:43,709
so that's what I used i clamped that

66
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:47,129
piece to the lip of my bench then I

67
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:49,919
glued and clamped a scrap 1x2 for the

68
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:54,720
lip edge and tacked it in with my nail

69
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:57,870
gun using 1 and 1/4 inch brad dales okay

70
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,450
this was a little bit tricky I stood the

71
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:02,159
pallet on its side so I could screw the

72
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:05,609
Shelf to the supports from underneath

73
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,299
there was nowhere to clamp so I used the

74
00:03:05,609 --> 00:03:10,260
pickaxe

75
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:13,049
as a spacer okay now it's time to mark

76
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:15,930
our tools for Dow placement I used these

77
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:18,840
pre-cut groove Dells because they're the

78
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:21,720
same size of the corresponding drill bit

79
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,269
and they expand a little when wet with

80
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,220
glue down rods tend to be a little

81
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:28,739
smaller than the corresponding drill bit

82
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:31,620
and they're not the easiest thing to cut

83
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:34,590
squarely either so drill your holes and

84
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:37,590
try not to go all the way through then

85
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:38,280
glue your dowels in fit snug using a

86
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,639
rubber mallet

87
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:44,009
I like that bottom act shell so much

88
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:46,290
that I decided to build a few more

89
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:49,409
shelves on the front of the right side I

90
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:51,870
made them the same way as the act shelf

91
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:54,989
but since they wouldn't be holding much

92
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:57,269
weight I simply glued clamped and tacked

93
00:03:54,989 --> 00:04:00,540
nailed them into the Crossrail from the

94
00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:03,359
back now a few of my tools were perfect

95
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:05,129
for hanging so it decided to add angled

96
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:07,349
dowels to the front of the cross rails

97
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:09,389
on the left side you really don't have

98
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:11,879
to angle the drill very much to get this

99
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:13,919
effect and I did drill all the way

100
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:16,440
through so it can insert a little more

101
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:19,380
of the dowel as these would be holding a

102
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:22,380
bit of weight and I also had a few

103
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:24,810
screwin type J hooks and I mounted them

104
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,729
on the side to hold these dirt breaker

105
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,250
things for lack of knowing what else to

106
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:29,830
call them

107
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:32,770
all it took was drilling a pilot hole

108
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:34,960
first and they screwed right in now on

109
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:37,420
the other side I wanted to hang my ice

110
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,540
scraper my two and 1/2 inch construction

111
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:43,060
screws had enough of a smooth shoulder

112
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:45,160
that one of them were perfectly for

113
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:48,670
hanging the handle without marring the

114
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:51,820
surface of it and last I wanted a place

115
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:54,220
to put my kneepads I used another piece

116
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:56,620
of the Crossrail boards I cut out and

117
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:59,560
mounted it to one of the inner structure

118
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:02,980
blocks it was the perfect width to mount

119
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:05,110
inside there and to hold my kneepads now

120
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:07,720
my garden tools get pretty dirty so I

121
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:09,790
decided not to paint my pallet but you

122
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,490
certainly could if you want an even more

123
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:17,380
rustic look by giving it a whitewash or

124
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:19,120
using milk paint or such I hope you've

125
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:22,270

126
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,520
