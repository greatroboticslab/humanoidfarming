  "text": "hi this is Stephanie Dale from the home front today I'm going to be taking you on a tour of our drip system I'm going to show you what a well planned out drip system can do for your Farmstead and what exactly you can do with it right off the bat as you can see there is no PVC pipe in the strip system it's all done with drip tubing the great thing about drip systems is that it saves water saves you money it saves you time and it's low pressure and um if we had to we could tear it apart and reassemble it to work with our rain barrels this is the beginning of our drip system this should be the beginning of a any good drip system ours is connect connected up to this outdoor spet the spet has a built-in back pressure valve so we don't have to um buy a separate piece and connect that up but if you did you would connect it up right here most low pressure drip systems should be connected after a timer or a shut off valve this is because the components of a low pressure drip system like the screen filter will not hold up under constant pressure so you shouldn't connect it directly up to a faucet you should connect it up you know after timer after a shut off valve the nice thing about having a timer on your drip system is that it prevents you from overwatering it prevents you from forgetting about the system and leaving it on overnight or leaving it on for an hour longer than you should um it's just one more tool you have that saves you time and increases the efficiency of your system you can set this to come on every day every other day you can set it to come on for an hour or for two hours um they're just really really handy inexpensive tools for your garden what you're looking at right here is a 200 mesh screen filter that's keeping all the water clean before it hits your system stuff gets in your system algae debris other stuff like that it clogs it up and and it doesn't work right and you want your system to be as low maintenance as possible also you'll see here is a pressure reducer or a pressure regulator that's bringing the pressure down to 10 psi for our system and this is an adapter what this is doing this is bringing the size down to where our half in drip tubing plugs right into it coming off here is a little qu in line and that goes in these are raspberries this is our Mainline tubing if you follow it for long enough it it will hit our garden here's the mainline tubing in the garden this goes off to all my beans peas which are done for the for the year Dale it's all taking off from the mainline tubing right [Applause] here and these are just drip tape takeoff adapters that are plugged into the main tubing is all that is and we've used drip tape known as has tea tape and that runs up each one of these rows and Waters it see right here you can see it working a little bit at the end of a drip tape we have it crimped it's not a plug it's a crimp however at the end of a of a Mainline tube you can see there's the plug this is still my upper garden lettuce is mostly done and been harvested and uh each row I have going is being watered at this point in time by a line of drip tape of tea tape this drip tape is pretty cool stuff it will operate just as efficiently as you're seeing right now under as low as 4 PSI right now everything's running on T 10 psi it will work just the same with four which you can accomplish through a gravity fed system it's also watering my beans P beans some sunflowers back there beets onions good stuff another thing that we do with our drip system is we use it to water our chickens so we we just get tired of falling water to the chicken so we've taken um a tea we've installed a tea right here we have more this is Mainline tubing it runs off of here up and around and we've installed a little valve right here and if I were to open that well if I would lower it and then open it um water would come out and here I have my container containers and and rais beds and they're all on the drip system too there's my uh Mainline tubing right there I have little um quarter inch lines with emitters running off of each one let me see if I can grab one this is an inline emitter right there you can see it that's the emitter that's the inline emitter right there and it's giving this uh couple squash plants a half a gallon an hour I believe and in this bed you can kind of see it it comes up we have a line coming off the mainline you come over here and you can see two lines of drip tape and that's our cucumbers you come over here and we have potatoes and these are also connected to the drip system if I can find the line right here goes in and right there's an emitter and right there is an emitter you can see the red thing the red thing is an emitter when you want to increase the amount of water a plant is getting you can add another emitter um rather than getting one of those variable rate emitters which I think are garbage and messing with it all the time you can just add another emitter it's not that hard okay if you follow our main line tubing by the Cucumbers you can see how it goes into the garden that way you can there's also a te we installed a te here and we're going to follow it this way oh there's another line right there coming off little Quin line and that is feeding another rhar plant and you follow this tubing line right here it was feeding my my apple tree but it doesn't need it's on its thir deer now so it does not need to be on the drip system but you can put a fruit tree on a drip system you follow this tube around there it is and it goes around to another Garden so here we have the other Garden still no PVC pipe and we have corn growing this is again these are um I used row takeoffs and drip tape see and there are the tomatoes the tomatoes are also on drip tape you can get drip tape to emit different amounts of water um it just depends on on on what you're growing and you can hit the end of the line here right there the drip tape ends like the other ones do it works really efficiently weeds don't like to grow in between the rows photo bomb by the dog weeds don't like to grow between the the rows because there's no water it makes weeding easier it makes keeping your garden up easier now let's go up to the front and see oh actually there's one more thing that's not the end of the line for this particular Zone if you keep following it along the main line comes over here it uh is watering my comfrey and this uh 1 quarter inch line comes off of here here and into this little whirl barel R rust Rusty whirl barel planter I got some Feverfew and what is that oregano [Applause] growing little quarter inch line comes along this [Applause] way to the black caps and these are my black caps I put them in this year they're growing pretty good okay and we got more4 in line taken off from that he those lines go to blueberry bushes okay there's a tea there's like a little mini tea see a little mini tea in the little quarter line little mini tea and that's how it goes off to all these fruit bushes and one cherry tree which hopefully the Gophers will leave alone right down here double emits that's so that this little tree can get four gallons of water in 1 hour okay well that's my drip system I hope you enjoyed the tour if you enjoyed this SC video and you enjoyed the the article that I I'm going to link to this video then um I'd appreciate if you'd visit my blog check it out it's um called the home front and I believe the web address is Stephanie dale1 blogspot.com um I'd appreciate it if you'd swing by leave me a comment and check up and see how how things are going here on the home front",
