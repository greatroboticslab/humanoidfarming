1
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,560
Water scarcity affects more than 40 percent
of the global population.

2
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,300
Water scarce regions in particular struggle
with crop failure,

3
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,680
soil degradation and,

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,020
if it rains, with floods.

5
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:27,620
Land-based rainwater harvesting is one solution
to the water scarcity problem.

6
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:31,720
It entails the collection of water and
subsequent storage in reservoirs

7
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,880
or directly within the soil profile.

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:41,620
This rainwater harvesting method can be classified
into micro-catchment and macro-catchment harvesting.

9
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:46,500
In micro-catchment rainwater harvesting,
rain falls onto a small catchment area

10
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,620
and flows directly to the adjacent cropped basin,

11
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,080
where a single tree, bush
or row of crops is planted.

12
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,300
The purpose of this is to store water
in the root zone,

13
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,540
to provide enough water for the plants
throughout the growing period.

14
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:06,000
There are various ways of implementing
micro-catchment rainwater harvesting.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,500
One is strip catchment tillage,

16
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,080
which consists of alternating rows
of cultivated crops

17
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,920
with rows of uncultivated grass.

18
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:21,240
The grass acts as a catchment to collect rainwater
and then drains it to the crops next to it.

19
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,220
Contour or keyline barriers are constructed
perpendicular to the slope.

20
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:33,320
Their function is to intercept rainfall,
encourage infiltration, and to reduce soil erosion.

21
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:38,740
Barriers are built from vegetative material
in trashlines, stones or soil.

22
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,580
Other cross-slope systems are swales
and living terraces.

23
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:46,440
Basin systems are closed diamond
or square shaped catchments,

24
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,360
surrounded by low earth bunds.

25
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,980
Water falling into this basin is channelled
to the lowest point,

26
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,000
where ideally food trees are grown.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,640
In macro-catchment rainwater harvesting,

28
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,140
the catchment area lies
outside the application area.

29
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:06,420
This means the rain is not collected
where it is used.

30
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,480
The land cover of the catchment area
can be manifold,

31
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,180
including cultivated land,
roads or settlements.

32
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:17,700
Often, the catchment area is located
on a hill or mountain slope.

33
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,880
To provide water in dry periods,

34
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,320
the collected water can either be used
for groundwater recharge

35
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:29,000
or stored in open or closed systems
like farm ponds or underground tanks.

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,360
There are three broad categories of
macro-catchment rainwater harvesting systems.

37
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,800
The first are hillside systems.

38
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,480
Here, water flowing downhill
accumulates on barriers,

39
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,880
where it is used for crop irrigation
and groundwater recharge.

40
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,680
In stream-bed systems,

41
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,580
structures such as sand dams or check dams

42
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,360
are constructed across temporarily flooded channels.

43
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,920
They are built from upstream to downstream
to reduce the force of the water flow,

44
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,400
to infiltrate water
and to control erosion.

45
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,500
Ephemeral stream diversion systems divert
water from seasonally flooded channels

46
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,302
to large, low-lying areas,

47
00:03:08,302 --> 00:03:12,960
where the water infiltrates
and provides enough moisture for crop growth.

48
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:18,320
Land-based rainwater harvesting contributes
to the reduction of soil erosion and flood occurrence,

49
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,320
while also enhancing groundwater recharge.

50
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:27,420
Where climate change and mismanagement
threaten the availability of water as a resource,

51
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:31,620
rainwater harvesting systems can help
increase agricultural activity

52
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,900
and thus food availability.
