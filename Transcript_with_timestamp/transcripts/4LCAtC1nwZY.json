  "text": "a signant just where he was needed claiming back as night just in the nobody is Los it faces Merchant change but your face remain the same will be when we're finally sober they'll be gone the trees will Bloom the nights will melt we'll always remember how so that was actually filmed about 3 weeks ago and yeah I'm trying to film everything a little bit earlier so that I can schedule a video and get a video out every Friday so that's what I'm aiming for hopefully that'll happen yeah but uh since since all that was filmed it's actually dried out here a hell of a lot all the mats have dried out including the path and I've moved the electric fence that was all the way down there so that they could have that area and I've moved it over here so that I can protect this bit of land here and just let that grass recover a little bit I don't think we're going to have to lift the patio area I don't think those mats are going to need releveling or anything because they're fine but the path yeah the path is a little bit higgledy piggledy as you can see it all sort of goes a little bit up at the edges and down at other edges and it's not very flat so yeah I do think I'm going to have to take that up but what I'm going to show you first is how Simon and Bruce fix the rails that hope had broken on a main Paddock area around the Caravan that one's right at that sh it straight up does it fit you know the idea of that hmer it's called a pin hammer okay what you do is you got a little Staple in between your fingers see you can hit in between your fingers without bashing your fingers so you start it off like that then you turn it around and knock in did you bring your nail with you staple can't get to there I staple you got to give give me the stuff to use I need the players as well you're not going to bash my fingers are you well I can't cuz you're using that I don't know it depends how bad your aim is is your own really bad no wait I like that one more go down here like I did and you can hit it straight on then kneel down Crouch down brce you want me to start it and you can finish it off yeah I like that Watch How I do it we I'm doing much different I'm pushing up a little bit so come on you can finish it off see if you can get it in straight the rest of the way get down a bit so you can your arms Bel yay go on try again see I was getting lower and knocking it upwards yeah but I'm small those easier for you so why can I stand up so you're still hitting downwards you need to hit upwards oh that'll do just knock it in so it doesn't fall out it'll do the job so they really did do a great job didn't they and that's another thing tick off that Hope Has dismantled that we've had to fix do you know what if she didn't break so many things then I reckon a lot more would get done around here but well that's the joy of having a heavy cob another thing that Simon and ruce was filled in the big holes at the side of the stable that well they've been there since we first got here and well they needed filling in so they got on with that too and this is how they did it it's lap lch isn't it no remember it can't remember what it's called it is shiplap feather shiplap shiplap thick on that side thin on that side you can see that and it is to replace this section here that is missing and this little square that's just behind Dream It's actually something that hope didn't break they were just never there in the first place and well if you've been watching our Vlogs for a while then you'll know that Bruce has done a few little like And subscribe things through them haven't you Bruce don't forget to like And subscribe to stay tuned for other videos we're going to pull these now H or the which one okay I love this thing you my favorite' got that your favorite tool and I forgot how to use it I it is we all going to be able to use it what oh oh where did it go Bruce that's your job have to get the magnet have to drag it through the dirt oh God too strong there it is they're all 17 in how many do we need one I think turn that one a bit T kind a bit muches one underneath isn't it bit St so I think the bottom look the bottom cuz it was straight originally yeah is buted up and then the top isn't because the whole thing on I'm just going to try and do it as straight as possible hi why does that say my name hi B look oh no that's all we've got can't put a tiny piece on you keep your window ho cuz some wood wasn't quite long enough well what a difference that makes little things you know for the cost of I think it was4 for that one board and it's done all that and made that look so much neater so that's amazing right I'm going to have a go getting these mates up now see if that's possible and until next time bye-bye",
