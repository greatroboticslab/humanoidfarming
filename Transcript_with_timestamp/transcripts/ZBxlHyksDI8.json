  "text": "oh hey phillip what are you doing here hey well i'm about to go into a meeting with some state legislators uh well so i got stanley to cover those meetings for you because i have another job for you to do okay you might want to change your clothes [Music] hello hi i'm matt hey i'm phil how old i understand you're my new hire for for now i guess so all right all right look you ready to get to work yes sir let's go all right these are some good cows you want you want to stay between the back legs okay and keep your fingers off these pipes okay when she kicks her hawk spray this on to clean the cow and we'll dry it off and put the melting unit on all right just prior to sunker down and then you move to the next cow okay you want to try this one sure you don't have to touch the couch just prayer from the distance so you'll get kicked and she hit you right here okay so you never put yourself just go all right when i first heard that the government affairs uh worker was coming out to to be my employee for the day i was very skeptical i'll have to admit i'd give him high scores on his his dress he looked the part he's a little too clean you could use some paper towels all right and now we're just going to dry they're cleaner in the process of drying raw you get about two towels and just gently dry her off and get clean like that all right go ahead and reach in there you're okay go ahead she's not kicking i might dance a little kid [Music] okay that's pretty good we're gonna get a little drier now [Music] i was hoping to learn a lot about what our dairy farmers do in arkansas and uh i've learned a lot about that and um you know just get my hands dirty get those were my expectations and i got them dirty a couple of reasons to dry them off one's to disinfect the other to have a clean location to pull the milk from and two is to for cow health you want the utter dry okay while the machine's honored pockets [Music] and it'll do its job so how many uh how many gallons would you get what do you usually get from each cow um about eight gallons per cow per day how many cows do you all do in a day about 180 and twice a day you get half your milk in the morning half in the afternoon with your your left hand and dry hair easily how's that yeah you got that one pretty good all right just throw your towels in the bucket and you push the button to release it [Music] just like you guys turn it around oh god [Music] oh that one you gotta hang your black oh yeah look in this chain [Music] so i will say milking the cow was uh more automated than i thought it would be you know once matt showed me how everything works you know just making sure i put everything in the right places and don't get hit by the cow or don't have anything drop on you uh once i understood that process it seemed very straightforward oh yeah she left you a present she was she left the presents for you oh thank you thank you now the trick is to dodge it did i roll up my sleeve for this one [Music] i think i found my new job guys sorry stanley i think this is the business for me we have to increase our speed or we won't get to milk twice today when deal when's the first time y'all do it in the day well you started four in the morning oh i changed my mind i like my job now [Music] oh [Music] and then there's that thing all right a particular reason why y'all do it at uh those times of the day it takes you about three hours to milk so you want to get done in the afternoon at a reasonable time so you have to start early enough to get finished do you take naps in between at night you know so when y'all get all this milk where does it go got a refrigerated storage tank in the other room as it's coming out of the couch going into this small tank and as it fills it automatically pumps with the storage tank okay storage tanks refrigerator and then yeah somebody come pick it up yes the marketing clock comes every two to three days to pick the milk up okay haul at the market but see it's coming out of the couch body temperature 21.5 degrees for a cow and two hours after it comes out of the cow we'll have it down to 36 degrees okay the milk comes through stainless steel pipelines and goes into the refrigerated tank you can hear the tanks running right now and it's already cooled to melt down to it's 38 degrees okay okay you go up and inspect the milk that you fly what's good to me maybe take a milk bath anybody ever fallen in no from time to time you don't have to go in and clean it oh is that what you have your sons for well unfortunately i get to do that [Music] [Applause] [Music] um you can see the stalls hence the barn gets its name free stall the stalls don't have gates on them the cows are free to come and go they've got water on the outside in the center they can have access to at all times and they've got feed in front of them all the time so the cows that you just milked came back down here and they're in in their living environment after we got started with the milking process showed him what we expected and how to perform the task after monitoring the task for the day on a scale of one to ten i'd have to give him about a six well uh you know i enjoyed what i did today but i think i'll leave the milken up to the professionals these guys know what they're doing but me on the other hand i'm happy to go back to the capitol and advocate for these guys make sure they can stay in business and so that their children can keep doing it it's important to keep our dairy farms here in arkansas well matt thanks for having me out here i was really excited to learn about what y'all are doing uh everything you told me when in one ear and out the other [Music] anyway sorry such a bad joke [Applause] [Music] [Music]",
