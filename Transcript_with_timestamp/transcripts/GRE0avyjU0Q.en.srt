i am taking you guys along

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,439
my whole day you guys have asked what do

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,519
i do and what my life is like

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,559
uh every morning i wake up around seven

14
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,000
in the morning

15
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,440
with these two delilah and benelli who's

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,399
begging for my food as if it's gonna

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,160
fall

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,520
on the counter they already ate their

19
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,600
breakfast i took them on a walk it's

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,440
about 7 30 here now

21
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,719
now after since i've just got done

22
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,360
making my coffee

23
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,000
and all that fun stuff i'm going to get

24
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,960
dressed

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,680
and then head to the farm because we all

26
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,399
know

27
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,760
i don't live at the farm i live about 20

28
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,480
minutes away from there

29
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,079
so let's get this day started and you

30
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,440
guys are able to come along and see what

31
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,479
my life is like

32
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,080
good morning do you say every morning i

33
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,680
go out on the patio and i bark at the

34
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,799
neighbors

35
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,960
but nelly begs for my breakfast and

36
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,439
sometimes delilah actually reaches it

37
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,720
so she'll probably push it back and

38
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:22,000
she'll steal my breakfast

39
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:25,280
and share with benelli sometimes

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and going back out to the patio

41
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,840
we're following mommy to get dressed

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,680
come on now

43
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,439
but now he swears that the food's gonna

44
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,439
fall for her look

45
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,880
as if a ghost is magically gonna push

46
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,680
the food down and she's gonna be able to

47
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,320
eat it

48
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,079
come on now 20 minutes later still

49
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,079
trying to get my sandwich

50
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,240
no benelli it has ham in it now they're

51
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,720
both begging great i just got in the car

52
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,680
i had to literally move all these bags

53
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,600
of green

54
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,720
and cat food from that vehicle to this

55
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,320
vehicle and load all this stuff in here

56
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,840
into this vehicle from that vehicle so

57
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,759
that took me a little bit

58
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,439
and it is freezing here i know you guys

59
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,560
are going to say it's not that cold but

60
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,799
in florida we're not used to this

61
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,520
weather it's 41 degrees here

62
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,000
but let's go to the farm this is my

63
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,200
favorite

64
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,599
part getting stuck behind tractors

65
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,400
this is like the mile road the six mile

66
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,440
road to

67
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,280
the farm there's a little bunny

68
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,680
walking into the gate i have to open the

69
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,599
gate to pull the truck

70
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,680
the sun's so bright but we're here at

71
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,239

72
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,360

73
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,760
first

74
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,519
part of my day even though i just

75
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,879
unloaded my last vehicle

76
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,280

there's bp and

89
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,800
oreo and then look how cute is that

90
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,000
though

91
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,840
oh tater's definitely like the king

92
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,440
of all the bunnies he bosses everyone

93
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,879
around

94
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,080
and then we have some new babies down

95
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,760
here let's see there's the mama

96
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,440
i actually did put a bunny in a stall

97
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,040
last night

98
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,239
because she looked a little sad

99
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,239
which i'm probably gonna end up taking

100
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,280
her home she's actually super sweet

101
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,120
i just felt like she wasn't getting

102
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,560
enough attention hi baby look how sweet

103
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,959
she is

104
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,799
remember how i told you guys the jobs

105
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,200
never end well this water line

106
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,239
hose snapped i would turn on but i would

107
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,360
get sprayed with water and i don't want

108
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,599
to be wet all day

109
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,720
so i have to redo this the crack is like

110
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,840
right here

111
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,000
but if i was to turn it on it would

112
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,280
literally go all over me so i have to

113
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,959
replace this water line

114
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,439
i mean obviously you guys can see i've

115
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,000
replaced it plenty of times

116
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,799
and then kind of a lazy job so i'm going

117
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,879
to

118
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:07,599
fix it the right way today but first

119
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,360
i have to turn the well off so the water

120
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:13,200
doesn't go everywhere when i

121
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:16,320
snip the line so the well is up here

122
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,239
in this pasture and to turn it off

123
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,799
you're gonna go like this

124
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,960
it's off so what i'm gonna do is snip it

125
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:29,840
down here i hope i don't get super

126
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:29,840
water on me

127
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,360
cool

128
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,639
[Music]

129
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,400
what i just realized is that i could

130
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:42,880
save this piece

131
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,080
so i'm going to make it like this

132
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,919
so i thought this little twisty thing

133
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,440
was cool i mean i could do it short but

134
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,479
i'm gonna make a longer one

135
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:54,400
so i need a cup link

136
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:56,800
which is right here this one will work

137
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,759
i hate this glue it gets everywhere and

138
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,960
it sucks when it gets on you

139
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,880
so what we're going to do is we're going

140
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,720
to cut link this

141
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,440
try not to get it on you because it

142
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,440
sucks getting it off

143
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,120
one part done i like to use a lot of

144
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,800
glow so it stays

145
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:18,000
if you all can't tell okay cool

146
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:21,120
great and what i need to do is now

147
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,280
cut another pvc pipe up here to adapt

148
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,800
to this part i'm like the messiest

149
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,000
worker ever when it comes to doing this

150
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,560
stuff

151
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,560
at least i try to measure

152
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,080
so we'll go ahead and do this part first

153
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,280
and get more glue all over me why

154
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,639
katrina

155
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,560
why are you so messy when you do this

156
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,400
stuff it never fails i'm literally

157
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,639
always covered in this stuff

158
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:53,680
but acetone takes it off so let's go

159
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:56,000
like this

160
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,000
whoop

161
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:06,560
okay cool but guys check out this water

162
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,400
line compared to the new one

163
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,000
i would say it looks pretty good what i

164
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,479
have to do still is

165
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,759
take my drill and then just click it on

166
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,199
here so the horses don't play with it

167
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,840
because the horses love to

168
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,440
break these apparently especially during

169
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,280
the winter time the pipes freeze all the

170
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,720
time and look damn's probably on his way

171
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,720
over here to mess it up

172
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,000
so i do do pretty much all the water

173
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,720
line fixes

174
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,720
on the farm i actually was

175
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,160
here digging all the water lines with

176
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,080
the guys that dug them here

177
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,600
so i can learn how to do it if we ever

178
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,800
did have a break because that's part of

179
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,759
owing a farm

180
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,400
shut the front door did i not fix it

181
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,720
properly

182
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,680
i was like tell me i didn't tell me i

183
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,960
fixed it right

184
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,360
and i realized it was coming from here

185
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,720
so i did good job katrina

186
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,440
go waterline girl tilly decided to join

187
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,400
me

188
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,880

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,560
go run some more errands

291
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:11,519

drive

305
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,279
the reason why i go up there to get

306
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,920
shavings is because it saves a lot of

307
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,519
money

308
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,920
and i don't want this guy to waste his

309
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,800
wood shavings so i go and pick them up

310
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,959

311
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,160
