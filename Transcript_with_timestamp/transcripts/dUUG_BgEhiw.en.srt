1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
I want to do it how the wildlife did it

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:06,420
where they rotated constantly every day

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,280
how the Buffalo did it how the antelope

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,080
and deer did it before fences stopped

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,960
them from rotating they were never in

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,240
the same thousand acres for you know 40

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,520
50 days it just never happened I want to

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,260
create deep thick roots and deep soil

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,020
and by doing that the only way you can

10
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,119
do that is rotate livestock and keep a

11
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,900
living root and green grass growing as

12
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:26,900
long as possible
