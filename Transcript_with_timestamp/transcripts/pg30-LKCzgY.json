  "text": "So much of Australia's story is to do with water. There's often too much or too little. Drought is a constant threat. Cattleman Randall Crosia averages just three good years in 10. Yeah. Well, it's uh 24,000 km or 6 million acres. Well, it's meant to be the size of of Belgium, so to say, but I've never been there, so I couldn't tell you. Randall manages Anna Creek Station. the world's largest cattle property. It survives on 8 in of rain a year, if it comes at all. We live in a desert, so it always looks like it's dry, although uh most of the stuff that grows here is very nutritious. We don't need very much rain to make it spring to life, you know, and it um it's a very productive country if if you get the water on it. Across twothirds of Australia, no rivers flow, just parched channels flooded fleetingly by rain, which hasn't come to Anna Creek in 4 [Music] years. From when we get a decent rainfall until the dams go dry, we've got about probably 9 to 12 months maximum. [Music] Well, that's the way this country is, you know. She is she's got to learn to live with it a bit and uh go along with it. You can't go against it. You'll never win.",
