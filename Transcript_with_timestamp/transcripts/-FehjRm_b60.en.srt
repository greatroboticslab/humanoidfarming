00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:29,039
hello viewers welcome to Elm TV a

2
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:31,439
station where you watch you interact and

3
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,440
also you learn your teor today is

4
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,239
Mr an agriculture teacher in today's

5
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:40,320
lesson we are in form three lesson 10

6
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:43,719
and the topic is uh livestock production

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:47,360
form and the subtopic is uh livestock

8
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:50,120
rearing uh practices on to the lesson or

9
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,719
objectives uh by the end of this lesson

10
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:57,199
you should be able to explain uh State

11
00:00:53,719 --> 00:01:00,320
uh various uh methods of controlling

12
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:03,359
parasite and disease other than

13
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,119
vaccination and the second one state any

14
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:10,040
three types of

15
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:14,280
vaccines uh the second uh the second

16
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:17,119
routine Management on RTO rearing that

17
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:20,720
is Parasite and Disease Control remember

18
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,920
we covered the first one is feeding uh

19
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,000
the first one feeding is a routine

20
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,720
Management in the previous lesson and

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,159
there are several methods that we

22
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:35,399
normally use to control uh parasite and

23
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:39,560
diseases a parasite is a an organism

24
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:41,720
which normally uh leave on another

25
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:46,240
organism at the expense of the other for

26
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:48,680
example a we have also parasite like the

27
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,960
ones which normally causes diseases and

28
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,680
therefore they are supposed to be

29
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:55,200
controlled so that you can end up having

30
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,200
high levels of production then the first

31
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,960
method of controlling parasite and

32
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:03,680
diseases is dew Waring and therefore

33
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:07,560
during Waring you can use appropriate uh

34
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:11,000
tool to to put the Dew all to introduce

35
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,000
into the dewers into the livestock you

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,840
can see there is a diagram here of a

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,640
person who is doing Dew Waring in ship

38
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:22,519
and the person is using a drenching gun

39
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:25,239
to introduce the antih helin tis those

40
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:28,360
are the drugs which are meant for redu

41
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:31,800
uh for controlling warms then we have

42
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:35,319
the second one is dipping and this is

43
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:37,879
aimed at controlling the Ecto or

44
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:41,760
external parasite where chemical such as

45
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:44,280
aide they are used then we have spraying

46
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,720
also acaricide is used but in spraying

47
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,159
you can use the hand spray method then

48
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,480
the fourth one we have pasture

49
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:55,120
management and during pasture management

50
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:59,480
you can use structures such as the pck

51
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:03,959
whereby you will be uh regulating the

52
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:06,560
the P or the G the greasing unit using

53
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:09,280
different bules and therefore whenever

54
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,680
the the animals are feeding on a

55
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,799
particular product the other products

56
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:18,720
should be closed to make sure that the

57
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:20,440
heat of the sun heats the eggs of the of

58
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,680
the parasite and therefore are

59
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:27,319
destroying them and therefore breaking

60
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:30,360
the cycle of parasite uh uh parasite

61
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:32,400
cycle then uh we go to the do that is

62
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,799
another one that is referred to The

63
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,560
Cutting of the tail or or tailing it is

64
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:40,239
also referred to as tailing and the

65
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:44,360
importance of this is to control the

66
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:46,720
bluefly infestation and the other one we

67
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,360
have the hoof triming whereby a hoof

68
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,439
cutter is normally used to cut the

69
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:56,319
overgrown Hooves so that you can control

70
00:03:52,439 --> 00:04:00,519
the hoof rot diseases then we have dust

71
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:04,680
bath a dust bath is an example of a d b

72
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:06,040
here we have a pit Ash uh we have a pit

73
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,000
Ash

74
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:12,599
here which is normally provided to the

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,959
Potter so that they can bathe with it

76
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:19,639
and the pet Ash is is very very

77
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:23,840
important because it will kill the

78
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:25,639
parasite which normally affect Potter uh

79
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:29,320
then we have vaccination is another

80
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:31,560
method of controlling uh diseases or

81
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,400
controlling in the spreading of diseases

82
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,000
vaccination you can vaccinate your

83
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,960
animal you can

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,639
inject your animal with a particular

85
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,400
vaccine so that you can control the

86
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:46,199
disease from uh spreading then methods

87
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,000
of vaccination we have you can

88
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:52,600
administer the vaccine through injection

89
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,240
as you can see in this diagram the

90
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:59,280
animal is injected using a vaccine then

91
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:02,120
we have the second method we have Oro

92
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,479
vacine that's where you introduce the

93
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,440
vaccine through the mouth then we have

94
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:10,560
inhalation inhalation is through the

95
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:14,039
nose and also insertion at the caka when

96
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:17,759
it comes to poort Tre then uh types of

97
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:19,520
vaccines we have four uh in today's we

98
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,400
are going to cover four the first one

99
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,560
you have life varent vaccine is the one

100
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,160
which is administered when the disease

101
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,360
causing microorganism actually vaccine

102
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,720
is a disease causing microorganism who

103
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,800
ability to cause the disease has been

104
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,560
reduced and therefore for Life variant

105
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,639
vaccine is the one which is introduced

106
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,880
when the disease C microorganism or

107
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,960
pathogen is live then we have life

108
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,720
attenuated is the one which is normary

109
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:50,440
the disease CA microorganism is mixed

110
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,720
with some chemicals to reduce uh its uh

111
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:56,160
poers therefore it will not affect the

112
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,759
animal and the form the examples of

113
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,440
diseases which are controlled using this

114
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:04,280
meod or or this type of vaccine we have

115
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,599
Anthrax and also we have brucelosis we

116
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:09,080
have killed an all dead vaccine that is

117
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:12,680
where you kill the disease causing

118
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:14,199
microorganism then you mix it with

119
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,680
formal

120
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:20,240
forde there is a chemical uh then uh you

121
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,400
introduce into the body so that the body

122
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,639
of an animal can become stimulated to

123
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,280
produce its own antibodies then we have

124
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,240
the toxine vacine uh it is in form of

125
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,280
for marine and they actually once it is

126
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,280
introduced to the body of animal the

127
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:38,560
animal is stimulated to produce its own

128
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:41,520
immunity then we have properties of good

129
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,599
vaccine should be a good immunity it

130
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:48,039
should be as good as natural immunity

131
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:50,919
then the second one a long shelf life

132
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:55,440
the the immunity which should the

133
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:58,599
vaccine should have a a long uh keeping

134
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:01,400
shelf life that is the time the lifespan

135
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:04,120
uh before it EXP should be longer then

136
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,720
single dose should produce lifelong

137
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,960
immunity then the fourth one easy to

138
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,639
administer it is should not be

139
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,400
complicated when it comes to uh to

140
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:17,319
introduction of the vaccine into the

141
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:20,080
body then no side effect should not the

142
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:23,479
the animal or also should not harm the

143
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:25,840
farmer who is administering them to the

144
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:29,680
animal then compatible with other

145
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:33,120
vaccine yes a good vaccine should uh be

146
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,879
compatible with other types of vaccine

147
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,120
we have come to the end of today's

148
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:39,440
lesson and we are going I'm going to

149
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,160
give you assignment the first question

150
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,639
Define the following terms as using

151
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,960
lifestock production for uh the first

152
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:48,560
one is vacine and the second one is

153
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:51,879
vaccination then the second question is

154
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:55,840
highlight any four types of vaccine used

155
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:58,440
during uh life stock uh production then

156
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,000
we have refer uh reference you can refer

157
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:03,680
