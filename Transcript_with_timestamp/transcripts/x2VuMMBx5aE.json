  "text": "yeah ever wish you had a list of equipment and supplies for post construction cleanup well I actually put one together for you and you'll be able to find it in the janitorial store in the Donald library but here's the what I did is I actually created a list of for general cleaning you know this this here is the equipment and supplies that you would use on just about any type of post instruction cleanup that you would do you know you know all your knees an extension ladder pull a stepladder of some sort backpack or a vacuum you know dustpan broom you know different things like that there you know just all the con con come items that you would use trying to also eat the supplies you know it's always good to have a tote for your supplies because once this stuff is all just you know handheld items so it's good to have you know I listed some of the chemicals that you would use you know and some of the other supplies that you might have to brush grout brush and so on and so forth also then what I did because I went ahead and I did one for hard floor care because in some of the cases when we're doing post construction cleanup they're gonna ask us to go ahead and strip VCT tile and apply one or two coats of floor finish so here I listed the types of equipment that you may use so in most cases maybe you're going to use a floor machine either a rotary or cylindrical you know that's just a personal preference I like rotary I can do a much more with that type of equipment and I always have brush drives I use brushes I don't buy any pads anymore then if you're doing any searching the ceramic tile and grout you know recommend that you use a you know a 1200 PSI extractor with an X X 15 one that's just the way to go it's just a much much better system to have I listed some of the supplies on the other side here you know for you floor strippers neutral pH floor cleaner razor knife knee pads floor finish etc I left room for you to expand this to four items at my thought of I am putting also here for carpet care you know sometimes majority time probably will do is they'll ask you to do some carpet spotting but there I had a job one time where they didn't do put any protector on the carpet and then it got trashed and they hired us to go ahead and clean the carpet so I brought in our hot water extractor you know did a hot water extraction on it and dry it and everything and it looked great so some of the things like I listed your foot equipment is you know the three gallon pump up sprayer you know those are just great for applying your your neutralizers and your pre sprays you know some of your supplies that you'd have is obviously a carpet spotting kit within that kit you can have the different chemicals that you'll need for spotting the carpet to remove whatever it might be there'll be a tapping brush in there you'll find you should also have in your carpet spying kit you know some kind of carbon spider so it kind of walks you through what you the steps that you want to do for various types of stop spots I've got window cleaning too so on this side again I've got the equipment so you know you may have a window cleaning pocket you might use a five-gallon bucket you might have a hip bucket on a belt so for any of y'all set I have done a lot of window window cleaning them then I bought a stepladder and or a extension ladder you know a hip bucket on a belt is the way to go because now you got all your tools right there on your belt you'll be able have your t-bar applicator and your squeegee and your your sponges and your cloths and everything on your belt some of the other things that I put in here was the t-bar applicator obviously extension poles they're always handy then I put an adjustable offset adapter so for for use uh for those of you that don't know what that is this is it this is an adapter and what it does is it connects onto your extension pole and this one here is a longer then you have an actual swivel you can adjust the angle of this here to whatever angle that you need for for when you're washing and overhang or something like that this here you're in a hall you're going to go ahead and put your applicator on there or your squeegee or fixie clapper or some you know whatever it is that you're that you're trying to do but that's all this is it works great so you should have these in your arsenal if your window cleaning what I put on the supply side was some of the you know dish just soap that's probably one of the best things I always used done dish soap you don't need no fancy window clean solutions or anything like that microfiber cloth chamois is sea foam sponge you know for our steel wall hard water remover you know and lint-free gloves and microfiber pads now the microfiber pads are for a telescopic handle with a microfiber pad holder when you're doing that oh let's say you got two story windows or some that are kind of kind of difficult to to wash where you don't want to drip water on anything well you're gonna use a telescopic handle with a microfiber pad holder on it and you're gonna attach a microfiber pad to it that you pre sprayed with glass cleaner and then you just raise that up and take it to the window and you clean the window that way so you really minimize the amount of water that you put on put on the pad and and apply to the window and that's really the way to go so I hope you found this helpful if you liked the video go ahead and subscribe down below and don't forget to click on the like and share go ahead and share this with other people and you know I've got many more documents like this cleaning a section of the download library of the janitorial store you'll find proposals letters you know I'm gonna put some brochures in there and some marketing materials and different things like that to you'll find helpful and you know we'll keep on putting this stuff in there and giving you some good information to help you grow your cleaning business until then have a good one",
