  "text": "my name is areum young jr. but and I was born here in Christian County in the Herndon community on the seventh day of January 1919 when my dad first got the idea of no-tillage and as I said that was in southern Illinois George McKibben had had the test plot that he saw he came home and said I think I can do that so he found an old two row mule drawn planter that was sitting in the fence row rusting he got the idea of how he could adapt that for no-tillage he took it to a local shop because my grandfather my uncle my dad at that time didn't even have a welder on the farm so he took it down to the place where everybody went to get their welding done Rob's shop run by Rob Thomas and he explained to him what he wanted to have done he made it adapted to go underneath a 140 Farmall tractor and Rob Thomas did the welding put it together we mounted it I say we my dad mounted it on the 140 and took the chance of his life to go out and actually plant a crop that had not been tilled in any way previous to that planting and that was the way it began what does Katherine think of no tillage on the farm do you have an opinion on no tillage on the yeah no tillage is the way we plant crops with the planter instead of plowing up the ground we burn it back with chemical and then we put the seed right in the ground without doing anything so it's there is no tillage involved that's why it's called no tillage it is an honor to be part of the lineage just the the heritage I guess that's an overused word I think when you talk about generational farms but it really is a family tradition one of experimentation and innovation in 1962 their total corn crop was 92 acres he and my uncle and my grandfather at that time farm together right now my son Alexander and I and the other family members and land owners plant about 2300 acres of corn 2300 acres of wheat and 2300 acres of soybeans so we have in the neighborhood of 4600 acres of land from which we get those double crop soybeans planted behind tweet so I guess that would be around 69 hundred acres so that's quite a change quite a quite a enlargement but you know that's kind of the way things are the farmers have to get bigger in order to support their families it's a very tight economic situation has been up and down for years and that's some of the reason why we've had expansion our spray program has changed quite a bit over time believe it or not though one of the standard chemicals that my dad used in 1962 atrazine is still with us and it has still been a remarkably good product and very little resistance at least effective resistance has developed other things have come along that attack different modes of action and I must say that the the chemical companies have done more to advance no tillage and therefore the saving of topsoil than just about any other part of the agribusiness community without herbicides without those chemicals no tillage would not work and if no tillage doesn't work then you have the topsoil which is going to end up in Kentucky going all the way to New Orleans and forming sediment that increases the Delta there's always a trade-off in anything that we do you can only be one place at a time you can only go to one church at a time you can only be the member of one family at a time and as far as agriculture goes you can only do one method at a time on any given location whether it's an acre or a field and that's why I say that it's very or that we understand that if we go back to the time when we till the soil whether you want to do it from organic production or any other method if you're going to tell the soil you're gonna lose the soil it was proven to be the case before there was no tillage and I think it's still the case you cannot tell the soil without losing the soil no tillage it's the best thing I know of at the moment it may not be perfect but it's the best thing I know of at the moment to keep the soil where it belongs and that's right here on the family farm well it's a great act of conservation the conservation of the soil the preservation of our ecosystem you know the the breeding of wildlife that comes from no-till farming it's really neat to be part of that tradition no tillage was started as a way to preserve the soil and to conserve the soil to keep it where it where it needs to be which is on the home farm we've seen a lot of improvements in that the sheet erosion is pretty much controlled now even though there is some problem with gully erosion no matter no matter what kind of practices you use you can have a permanent pasture and you still have some gully erosion but the land itself is improved as the soil organic matter is improved some people nowadays call it carbon sequestration I call it soil organic matter because that's what really allows us to maintain fertility and tilth and productivity in a soil when I was a child and my dad was first starting this back in the early 1960s an average soil test would be about one and a half percent organic matter we consistently have three percent or three and a half percent organic matter now in our soil tests simply because the land has been allowed to accumulate the carbon which is in effect organic matter and that in turn keeps it from washing away as easily it makes it more productive it keeps the nutrients where they belong and it doesn't allow things to wash down the river and and cause trouble and pollution the old saying used to be no-till no crop and that was people who cast aspersions at it to say well if you want to try that you can but you're not going to get anything out of it well he knew it would work because he had tried it in fact when dr. Shirley Phillips came down for the very first time to talk to my dad by his own statement dr. Phillips said he came down to prove that it wouldn't work and he got down here and he checked and he found out that it did work and my goodness we better get on board with that you know I'd like to sit guaranty that I could see all this opportunity developing and so forth but I was about as reluctant about it no-tillage about as much as anyone at the point in time in fact I guess I really started out to prove that it wouldn't work and much to my surprise it did so he and my dad became fast friends there were still a lot of skepticism and there still is there still farmers who don't plant their crops no tillage I can't explain why you'd have to ask them but for us it's been good it has proven itself to be a highly productive highly efficient way of farming and I'm thankful that he did what he did Shirley and I early on we had worked very closely together in developing no tillage techniques and one day he was coming down and I met him at a country store to get a sandwich and we got to talking and at that time we thought we had amassed enough information that we could write a book and so we sought of dared each other why don't we why don't we put what we know and what we have been able to learn research people in other states together and write a book on no-tillage farming we decided to do it I spoke to a group a few years ago the local Daughters of the American Revolution about no-till farming and one of the articles I referenced was a conservation study Wildlife numbers and things that you wouldn't associate with row crop farming they found that the numbers of not endangered species but species of animals that were thinning were bolstered in a no-till system you have greater greater life in the soil which attracts birds and things that would be attracted to the worms and the bugs that come into a no-till system and then you have predators that prey on the birds and you just have an increase in that ecosystem it is really amazing how such a small thing as not working your soil and letting it wash away impacts the whole environment and so to be part of that not just to have a grandfather that helped pioneer it but to take part in it to use it on the farm it's really an awesome opportunity you know we've been doing cover crops for 50 years our cover crop is called wheat we plant wheat immediately following corn and then we plant beans immediately following the wheat so the only time that our ground is not covered specifically with a cover crop might be in between the November harvest of the double crop soybeans and the April planting of the next year's corn crop so we've done cover crops in Western Kentucky Wow for decades I would love to be able to plant cover crops after the soybeans and have something that I can actually harvest and sell before I plant corn the following spring I have yet to find that and I have asked a lot of people about what I can what I can find to sell they say well you're you're missing the point John you need to just plant it for the benefit of the cover crop itself and to some extent that's true the land is always better when it has something green that's growing on it it's just like every bit of Agriculture there's always more to know we don't know a lot in fact I'll reference one of my favorite quotations from one of my favorite inventors Thomas Edison he said and I think it's still true we don't know one millionth of 1% of anything there's so much yet to discover and so much yet to develop we just think we know it all but we really don't God knows it all and we don't know one millionth of one percent of anything unfortunately we've had a rainy weekend we cannot plant corn we would love to be in the corn fields here but instead we're hulling last season's corn we've got our grain system here we're loading out a truck it's going to go to our local farmer owned cooperative and they'll sell it for ethanol for carbon dioxide and for animal feed and there are other sub markets some of it goes to distilleries some of it goes to hog houses chicken houses dog food but they do an excellent job of marketing the owners the farmers commodities that we deliver you know my dad graduated from the University of Kentucky with a master's degree and I did my undergraduate work at the University of Kentucky and we've had a lot of communication through the years with the staff at Princeton Experiment Station dr. Lloyd Murdoch is a good example Lloyd Murdoch is a man who I would say if he says something you can take it to the bank and he has specifically done work with cover crops and I think most recently on rye grass on a corn soybean rotation and how it has helped alleviate the pain the natural occurring pan in some of our Western Kentucky poorly drained soils I will I would go to them in a heartbeat if I have a problem either with an unknown disease or a soil fertility question and I'm looking forward to the expanded Experiment Station at Princeton and I hope they'll prove to be just as efficient and professional as the ones that I've known in the past [Music] you",
