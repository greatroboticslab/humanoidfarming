  "text": "all right thank you for the introduction as he said I'm Cody and I'm an adjunct at SDSU which which means they kind of like me and I kind of like them but they don't actually pay me it's the Dakota Lakes research farm that pays me how are we doing at the microphone we need to we okay now a little better okay thank you Sarah do I need to move this around maybe or maybe get this out of here maybe we'll work a little better outside okay so I consulted the Dakota Lakes research farm I have for the past several years now and it's been a fantastic experience for me I wanted to start things today just by recognizing my grandfather who passed away this past year he when he was 14 years old his dad gave him the choice of buying some cows and raising cows or he could go to high school and he chose to to stay on the ranch and raise cattle and because of his hard work throughout his life and his generosity his kids and his grandkids like myself didn't have to make that choice between the cattle and going to college and so I just want to wanted to say thank you grandpa and you know he's one of the many reasons why I'm able to stand here today with with education and with the background on the ranch that I've got the impossible burger you guys probably have heard of this it's a it's a veggie it's one of the latest veggie burgers right and when you look at the picture the the whopper on the left and the impossible burger on the right they don't look a whole lot different you know when they're presented this way and I'm not here to talk about whether it's a good idea it's a bad or good things or bad things about it my interest in it is something else and and there's the question of why will people buy it and what does that mean for people who might be raising livestock or raising beef in particular and number one on this list I've got up there is to save the earth if you look at the website from the the company that produces the burger they're very straightforward about saying that's why they're doing this because they believe their product is better for the earth they're saving the earth if we're eating the impossible burger rather than animal products in our burger and like I said I'm not going to go into what those claims and whether they're they're correct or they're not correct I wanted to focus a little more on the other two points the number two I've got there is taste and then I've got the price you know research has shown that people who grow up eating grass fed beef prefer it to grain fed and vice versa you grow up with one thing you tend to like it better and it's in my head I wonder if you know people who grew up eating veggie burgers might actually prefer that to the to a regular beef burger in any case there are a lot of people who do eat it there are people who like it and so it's it's out there people are eating it people are going to enjoy it right and finally and not not not that everyone will but some certainly will and then finally price if I understand right right now the price is probably a little bit higher than your regular burger but this is a this is made in a lab it's an industrial process and I assume that they will get better attic this is a pretty new product right chances are they're gonna get better at simulating the flavor of beef and the eating experience of beef and they'll probably get be able to do it cheaper too and so what happens if they do get that price point down to being the same as a beef burger or less and they get the taste to be pretty close what happens in what are people going to eat well I suspect we'll see a lot of a lot of people choosing the burger right and it might not be one or the other might eat some one and some some beef and some of the the veggie burger and right now keep in mind less than 2% of the our population in the States now they say is involved directly involved in agriculture so most people most people are eating don't have a real clear understanding of where their food is coming from and the main choice that they've got is something kind of like this you know most of the beef is coming through our conventional methods which includes a feedlot and then we've got you know the impossible burger on the lab on the other side and when people are presented with this choice some will choose one some will choose the other right that's that's the way it's going to be but those don't have to be the only two choices and that's what I'm suggesting is another way that we may produce some of our beef and I think when the consumers are presented with this choice that we'll get some more people choosing to to eat beef and I'm I want to put out there the idea of this artisanal beef and I've got under there wine coffee tea and chocolate those are products that where this idea is already is is already out there and I in the back near the coffee there's a little table set up there's a bottle of wine and a box of tea back there I encourage you to go back there read the labels on those products because when you read those labels you you find out all kinds of information about how they were produced what the soil was like and maybe what the weather was like what the guys name was who ran the vineyard what this product is gonna taste like and you get all this information before you even you know open the bottle or the package and I wrote there's some pieces of paper there too I wrote up some examples of what that might look like for beef in central South Dakota and and I just the idea the main idea is this sentence I've got here down at the bottom tell people how we care for the land and the animals because if we're doing a good job of it caring for the land of the animals we want to communicate that message to other people and chances are we can be rewarded for it in the marketplace and I think we can get a better price for the products that were that we're producing because there are a lot of people in this world who are buying food who care about how it was produced and they care about how we how we took care of things and I think that along with this there's the opportunity to develop some terroir for South Dakota beef this is a fancy word usually you see it with in relation to wine and the idea is that the particular environment where those grapes were grown impacts the quality or in the taste the particulars later of the wine and right now we think of beef mostly as a commodity where it's all the same but I think there's a lot of opportunity to develop particular you know tastes or flavors or terroirs of beef and market it that way so today I'm gonna I'm kind of gonna talk about several different ideas and I'm hoping that in at the end they'll all come together and it'll make sense why why I jump around a little bit in it we'll have this constellation that comes together that was the marketing part Kay now integrating livestock with crops why in the world would we do that because as you guys know having livestock around is a lot extra work they can be a real pain in the butt especially if you're trying to calves you know during the middle of a snowstorm and so why would we do that well some of the reasons on the left that I've got some of your standard crops on the right I've got some forage and perennial crops if you want if you integrate livestock in your operation it gives you a lot of it gives you some opportunities for Biological and economic diversity so you could these forage crops I've got on the right you could grow those even if you don't have livestock but the livestock if you grow them and you have livestock now you've got an opportunity to harvest them and make some money at at the same time so if you believe that you need more diversity in your rotations if you want to put more you know you want to grow a cover crop after the wheat that you had after you harvest your wheat and you want to make some money on it at the same time and not just put all of it back into the soil that's where the livestock come in and you can you can make some money on it and because if you're if you're just growing these for for hay and you cut the hay and you sell it to your neighbor or to wherever your export you just lost the benefit that you had most of the benefit you had from from growing that crop because you didn't keep the nutrients in the biomass the organic matter right there on your farm so you get the opportunity for diversity and a couple of these things here I have down to the bottom alfalfa and switchgrass those are both perennials you have the opportunity now to put some perennials in the rotation and make good use of them why would we want to do that well this is an amazing picture this is a big bluestem plant you can see we're just a little bit of green up on top and look at that massive root system below it this is why we'd like to have perennials in our rotation for those massive root systems that's one of the big reasons anyway and in full disclosure these these plants were grown in special containers you know that allowed them to get nice deep roots and then they can harvest them and wash the roots out and make a nice picture so there is that but they didn't just go out into the field and dig them up but you know these perennial grasses like these these warm season native perennial grasses like big blue stem switch grass they can have roots that go well beyond six feet under the right conditions and so you know compare that to our our annual crops which have much shallower root systems typically but even if they do get their roots way down deep like say a corn plant it that corn plants starting over every year so those roots even if they do reach a pretty good depth there's very little of the growing season that they actually get down to that depth whereas the perennial has those roots down there all the time once they get established so what are some of the advantage of these deep roots well nutrients going up so those deep roots are extracting nutrients from lower down in the sope soil profile nutrients that your annual crop can't get to and they draw those nutrients back up incorporate them into their bodies so so now after that perennial has been there what your annual crops are going to be able to access some of those nutrients that have been brought back to the near the nearer the soil surface wine being one of those examples another reason to have those deep roots is bringing the water table down that's something that people are probably more interested in now than they were five years ago with you know those deep roots there they're gonna be able to access a lot of that water that's your annual crops can't get to so now going transitioning a little bit from the ideas to what we're actually doing at Dakota Lakes native tallgrass plantings and we can point to an example of where some of this idea came from in Argentina there used to be a traditional practice of having seven years of crop an annual crop followed by seven years of a pasture and so these pastures typically would be a grass legume mixture and and so they go back and forth and that's one way they would maintain some of the fertility of the soil at Dakota Lakes we're trying something it's a bit similar except we've got 15 years of crop followed by five years of perennial pasture now we just started this and so I can't say that these are the magic numbers that it's 15 and 5 right but we believe that this is going to really benefit the soils that we have in this rotation during those 15 years of cropping we still have a crop rotation where so as you can see here we're gonna go from winter wheat to corn or sorghum and a cool season broadly so we do that for 15 years and then we transition into the perennial now this is so this is a picture of our switchgrass so the perennial that we've used so far this first time around has been switchgrass it's for the most part it's a monoculture of switchgrass half of it half of the field we designated for seed production this year and harvested seed off of it the other half we grazed and we've grazed that for two or three years now you can see the cattle out here in July advantage by grazing of course is that the nutrients are going back to the soil in the organic matter now one of the challenges with putting that perennial in and only having five years of of having that perennial in and remember our objective of putting it there is to benefit our soil now when you start a perennial like a switchgrass or something that first year a lot of times they only get about yay big even if you've got you know good conditions and you're good a good stand you might not get much growth second year they're getting bigger but they're still not at say maximum capacity so there's establishment year down second year we're doing okay but now we've got two years gone by and we haven't done anything for our soil yet in fact because of the low productivity in the first year I wouldn't even be surprised if we returned less biomass than usual so that just leaves us over three years to this five year of a perennial to try to to really do a lot of good stuff for the soil and we're choosing we chose switchgrass it's it's a high biomass crop and it also has a high carbon to nitrogen ratio so idea there being that we're gonna put a lot of carbon back into the soil to build up that soil organic matter but we only got three years to do it so something Dwayne and I have talked about and we've tried out is try to accelerate that at that establishment process a little bit by planting the switchgrass in a year when we still have a grain crop there so what we did last year was we we planted two rows of wheat and then a row of switchgrass two rows a wheat and a row of switchgrass we also tried putting the wheat and the switchgrass together in the drill and planting them all at once and then the other thing we did we planted the wheat and then we came back later and planted the switchgrass overtop after the weed had already come up and that last treatment it appears that we we did damage our wheat yields with that all three treatments I went out there and counted switchgrass plants which was rather tricky because they're they're pretty little but it looks to me like we probably got a pretty good amount of switchgrass out there in all of those cases not to say that you might not have to come back and receive some but this this coming well this growing year now when things start greening up again I'll be going back out and checking on winterkill and that to see if the switchgrass survived because it you know we didn't get very big especially being there under that wheat canopy this is a picture of a mixture of switchgrass and big bluestem this is on some heavy clay soils and a pretty shallow soils heavy clay and this picture was actually taken in 2018 which was wet and a lot of parts of South Dakota but it Dakota Lakes it was extremely dry and it was just amazed me how much productivity we got out of these native warm-season grasses even in a drought a year like that and this picture was taken in July end of July and it's it's headed out here and so is in terms of quality I mean you can see the cattle are here grazing this is not great quality at this point it would be better to graze it earlier in the year but you know also depending on your objectives if your objectives is to return a lot of biomass to the soil it can still meet that objective even if the quality's low and so right next to that we had some degraded rangeland and I say degraded you know it didn't include these warm season grasses there were some native grasses some exotic grasses and I just went out there and I took some samples to check on the productivity 3,600 pounds of productivity at the on the native range and about double that where we had planted the switchgrass and the big bluestem just amazing what they could do now in terms of quality from a new animal nutrition perspective the the neither one of these is very good but the the switchgrass and big bluestem was was very poor quality but a key factor here is this is taken on July 26th so we wouldn't expect it to be very good that time of year another thing I like to do on the farm we've got I want a lot of the field margins we have switchgrass planted and so you know we've got the field over here switchgrass over here and in this particular case we've got smooth broham growing back here you can see it's it's brown and it's headed out the date here is July 8th of this past year and I'll go a lot of times to these areas on the farm and try to make a fenceline comparison you know side-by-side because a smooth brown that you know that's something we have in a lot of our pastures and if you've got cattle you know you know it's really good forage early in the year cattle love it it's high-quality but what happens as you get in you know towards the end of June into July you know it gets mature same thing with crested wheat grass you know they're great early in the year but we don't have enough cows to graze all that lush green grass we have early in the year we get into summer and then it's not much good anymore so on this date on July 8th when I took these samples one either side of the fence the switchgrass was three and a half percent higher in crude protein than the the smooth Brown was so that's that's a big advantage now typically you would think smooth bromes a better quality but again it all has to do with the date because at this time the the smooth Brome was already mature this and the switchgrass is kind of just getting going in June and here in early July it's still high quality so we've got some good good quality for the cattle to graze that time of year I made a similar comparison for the past several years I've made a similar comparison in the ditches by Dakota Lakes switchgrass and big bluestem on one side smooth Brahm on the other side this year I actually didn't find very much difference in quality again this was in early July but in past years I usually find in early July the switchgrass and and big bluestem are a little better than the smooth bromb but in all these years I find I will find that the we're getting more productivity out of the big blue stem and switchgrass than the smooth bromb and that's you know in early July that's the case but they're not done growing if I waited until later there'd be an even bigger gap in terms of productivity for getting more productivity from those tall grasses rather than smooth broma okay so now transitioning those are some more of the planted stuff now transitioning to a pasture situation three years will ago Dakota Lakes rented the pasture that's right across the road from the farm and this pasture had been continuously grazed for a long time and mostly dominated by exotic cool season grasses like crested wheat grass and smooth bromb some we have some cheatgrass and some Kentucky bluegrass out there too and so we wanted to transition it from that into more of a more of a native dominated pastures so specifically looking at putting things in like the big bluestem and so in order to do that we were tried a lot of different strategies so we set up experiment where we we sprayed out with glyphosate so going north south we'd sprayed with glyphosate or atrazine or both or no spray at all and in this picture you can probably you can make it out I think that you know there's a brown strip here and a green strip here brown strip you know so you can tell where those strips are so we sprayed out and then and and I don't I don't I don't want to advocate spraying good going out and just killing everything in native range land that's I have to give that disclaimer because this I as a rangeland guy I definitely don't want to suggest that this is a case where we pretty much had exotic species and I think a lot of this land where we did it may have been go back land it was probably farmed at one time so mostly there wasn't a whole lot of native that was that was left there to spray but so we've got the spray treatments going north south and then we seeded going east west so what we end up with is a big checkerboard of treatments we did a mixture of grass is mostly big bluestem and then we did that also with some forbs or some broad Leafs and then we did areas where we didn't seed anything and after and those first two years were just bone dry at Dakota Lakes 17 and 18 and we saw very little results from that but this past year we finally got to see some of those grasses coming that we had planted and what it looks like now is that you know after three years where the story's not over but so far what I can tell you is that where we sprayed glyphosate and where we drilled we had fairly good success at getting some noose grasses established there but if we only drilled or if we only sprayed neither one of those treatments really worked and we did do one other thing one other change in management besides the spraying and the seeding and that's the grazing so rather than the continuous season-long grazing we've been moving moving the cows in this particular pasture sometimes more than once a day in other cases you know maybe a day or two and we don't do that all year long we don't do that all the time but eat with this this rapid grazing even that was not enough to you know to bring those species back on their own over three years so there's kind of a lot of caveats there I don't want to say it can never happen but I think that this this particular land where we were working we didn't really have big bluestem there to begin with - I don't know that if we even had a seed bank left - for it to come back on its own and one exception to the rule of having to spray and drill both is that we there were some areas in the swales you know some wet areas if you follow along these where the lower places in the in the landscape where it's wet some big bluestem that we planted did come up there even without herbicide in those spots and what's circled there you probably can't really make it out very well but that is a big bluestem plant that's not very big you know it's only about this big and if there's a lot of that out in this pasture and so I think that over the next year or two we're gonna see a lot more but the chances are you know if we continue to get a little bit of rain chances are this is project is gonna look more and more successful as time goes on three years really isn't enough to judge it and this picture is in here just to basically show that there's a lot of diversity out there in this pasture which as an ecologist that's something we always like diversity ok similar issue but a little bit different site now Dakota Lakes just this past year got a lease on the land between the farm and the river and so this is was the core land now the game fish and parks has it and there's a little spot there that's just beautiful it's full of Indian grass which is one of our native warm-season grasses and Maximillian sunflower you can see them here but this is the real exception to the rule most of this land is just like that pasture dominated by the exotic grasses that we wish we didn't have so much of it and I I loved this picture because I took it on October 3rd and most of the landscape is brown and and you know there's no flowers to be seen but this Maximillian sunflower if you're interested in you know wildlife and pollinators where else are you going to find flowers like this in October so one of the things we're doing there we're trying to get those grasses back and we're doing the rapid grazing thing again and what we do what we're focusing our grazing early in the year in the spring because these are those cool season grasses we're trying to hurt them right and tip the scales in favor of the warm season grasses that we planted so we grazed this several times really early in the year and the other thing we did is we broadcast some seed out there and then we just just did that we also broadcast seed and rolled with some bales out over top and then we also drilled some spots and so you know this is what it looks like in May or after right after we've rolled the bale out there here is in July there's still a lot of it visible and and even into September a lot of that bales still visible in some places it was on pretty thick and so to this point we don't have many of those species that we planted if not many of them have come up I you know I looked around and I did find a few plants you might even have a picture yeah I'm holding one there you can't really tell but there are a few out there but Isis I'm hoping that a lot of those seeds are still viable and as the bail breaks down maybe we'll get more of it out there and those bales we used bales of mature switchgrass and big bluestem so there was a lot of seed in them as well okay now I'm gonna transition to front front while all those perennials to the lives the cropping side of things but being an ecologist even when I transition to the cropping side of things I start you out with a slide with bison and grass on it right because because if I'm gonna talk about a cropping system and trying to to design it for wherever your farm happens to be I think the FIR the place you need to start is think about how mother nature did things there and learn lessons from her right and so you know this is a picture that could be taken in a lot of places in South Dakota we've got grass and bison and so you've got a diversity of plant species in this picture you've got some of them that are green some are brown so some are actively growing some are not we've got an herbivore eating it this this and we could imagine that there are they're not in the picture but the antelope are just over the hill and the rabbits are hiding in the grass and the you know we've got all lots of different we've got lots of diversity both plants and animals and this is what built up our soils right this is what gave our soils fertility and if we think about the flows of nutrients here there wasn't there was hardly any export right because the animals eat stuff and they're not shipping it across the ocean to another country they're not we're not taking stuff very far away and that's a that's a real key factor and if we dive into a little bit of the details of that if we talk about nitrogen for instance there's a lot of nitrogen in the atmosphere and gets into the soil plants can take it up this is a picture of a lead plan which is the legumes like enough alpha or P or soybean you know it's gonna along with the bacteria it's gonna fix nitrogen when that nitrogen or when that plant is consumed by the animal in fact very little of that nitrogen stays in the animal almost all of it is going to leave the animal in feces in urine and go back to the soil and if we look at what those actual percentages are we've got the the retained nitrogen and this is on pounds per acre here so it's only about a pound or two per acre retained and this you know to do to put numbers to this sort of thing you have to make some assumption so I said 10 hit 10 acres per head for six months and what's the nitrogen that's retained well if you have a growing animal nitrogen is a key component of muscle right so that's where most of that nitrogen is going to end up so if you've got a you know a stock or calf or something out there that's growing that's that the nitrogen is going to that if you've got a mature cow her she's not really changing much in weight so she's not keeping a lot of the nitrogen but if she's got a calf at her side and that calf is growing that cat when that when you sell that calf you're taking nitrogen away right but it's not very much it's not very much nitrogen relative to what they ate most of what they the nitrogen they eat stays in your field or pasture in the form of urine and feces all right now suppose you put that calf into a feedlot instead well if we again we have to make some assumptions so what I said here is well suppose you had a 500 pound calf and you fed him to gain at a rate of 2.1 pounds per day now that's a pretty low gain for a feedlot but but let's just so so basically what I'm giving you is a kind of a baseline scenario kind of a best-case scenario if you want to feed that calf and you have no waste so again that's not realistic right it's going to take 56 pounds of nitrogen so you're going to take 56 pounds of nitrogen off field and bring it over here to the feedlot to feed the calf and that's best-case scenario at the same time that that and when I say you're taking it off you know you're taking it off in the hay or the grain or whatever you're feeding that calf that's how much nitrogen you need if you don't waste anything you're also taking off a lot of phosphorus and the nitrogen you can get back from the atmosphere the phosphorus you're not getting it back from the atmosphere it's gone once you take it away and and then you're taking off a lot of organic matter too now in contrast if you look over here if you these are what the numbers look like if rather than taking it from the field and giving it to the calf in the feedlot what if you took the calf and you put him over here in the field so everything he eats all the manure and urine and everything is going back onto the land well when he's after six months that calf has grown and that's why you're still taking away some of the nitrogen and some of the phosphorus and some of the organic matter but you're keeping a lot more on your land and if we take a look if we just subtract these numbers like 56 minus nine and six minus two I've got that on this next slide what's the difference well 47 pounds of nitrogen if it cost 30 cents a pound you know that's worth 14 dollars how much is the phosphorus worth 340 and this is elemental phosphorus not p2o5 so you've got $17.50 roughly worth of nutrients just in nitrogen of phosphorus and then organic matter I know it's very valuable but I didn't put a number there because I know whatever price I put in for it was going to be wrong so I don't want us to forget about the value of the organic matter so with that in mind then that to me that presents the challenge of that I've got stated up here how long can we keep our animals and the nutrients that they eat on the land so to me that's that's the question that's the challenge that we have to look at so specifically what are we doing at Dakota Lakes this is something that we're we're just beginning to try these are electronic feeding stalls and they're actually designed to be used in a dairy if we flip around and look at them from the back this is the end that the cow would come in so she walks in there this Green Deal reads an electronic ID that she's got on her hanging from her neck and it says oh this is you know Cal number 326 and today she's gonna get her Ashton of its a pound of corn and then a pound of peas and a half a pound of soybean meal and it's so it's tailored specifically to this animal so if I've got a sixteen hundred pound cow out there and I've got an eleven hundred pound cow out there there they can get different amounts of supplement based on their needs same thing if I'm trying to fatten calves out on on field and and pasture and I've got it you know a six hundred pound calf and a nine hundred pound calf with different nutrient requirements they can get different levels of supplement and the way we've got three right up here there's one two three of these little black things with the yellow sticker on them that's that's where the feed comes down so we can actually provide three different kinds of supplement in any combination that we want any mixture that we want and we envision that these things will move around field and pasture with the cows and that's where this comes in Duane and Jim Jim's our fabricator Jim's they've been working on designs Jim has mounted this solar panel on top of an irrigator and so we envision that this will also have shade on it it'll pull those feeders around we may have the water a point getting pulled around with it we eventually maybe we can build other things on like scales and fly control things like this and if we can because if we can move this around the pasture we can get better grazing distribution and we can get we can have that urine and the manure spread out all over the pasture all over the field rather than having it all end up in the you know the one spot where you set the feeders right so with any with any luck we'll have this operating time this summer now what have we been doing visiting to kind of run through a year in the life of the cattle at Dakota lakes here what kind of what are they eating at different times of the year and what what's the quality they're early in the year we start on those exotic cool season pastures the crested wheat grass and the smooth bromb they're very very good that time of year and then we as we get into June and July we tend to we transition more to our tall grass our native tall grass species like the switchgrass and this one in this particular picture you can see we actually interceded some peas and it was a kind of basically a cover crop mixture into the switchgrass they didn't actually graze this until early July but I can tell you they they really enjoyed being out there with the combination of the tall grasses and those cover crops it was a good diet in this picture when we are grazing the tall grasses we we prefer to move the fence pretty frequently and you can definitely tell in this picture where the fence was yesterday right right there and at this point it's July 30th the quality of this is quite low the crude protein is getting to be down pretty marginal even for a dry cow and so it may require this time of year may require some crude protein supplementation another thing we did in the middle of the summer was on the the pivot corners we had some cover crop swaths and we grazed those and being that it was in the middle of the summer you can see dates down here going from late July to late August it was hot and it was humid and those are great conditions for breaking down organic matter right so I was wondering what was going to happen to the quality of these swaths over the summer and that's why I took samples at several different times and you can see that for crude protein you know we lost a couple percent points of crude protein and tdn that's the energy content stands for total digestible nutrients so that's the energy or the calories you know it's what you need to put pounds on to on an animal and we can see you can see we lost some quality there too just over the course of a month as we get into week Ave in August and September and on this particular field this is a dryland field not irrigated and we got to forage crops off of it and so the first forage crop was we bailed up and set aside and in fact before we bailed it we while the swaths were on the ground we went through and we drilled the the next crop which was the German militancy here in the foreground and so then when we were ready to graze it with our cows that are calving we started putting the bales back out onto the the field and so they've got a mixture of you know they can graze the bales and they've also got some of the German millet we moved the fence every day for this too so we kind of ration it out little by little and it worked very well this year with rain now this is a picture taken from the same spot last year when it was very dry it did not it didn't work quite as well but we got the first crop we got the bales but we didn't have enough moisture to get that second forage crop the idea was the same in fact I think I think the previous two years it did not work very well this year worked excellent so back to this year or to 2019 this is the same field from the other direction you can see you know all the manure that we're leaving behind here just what we wanted to do they also had access at the same time to some standing corn to graze and as you can see we that was we fed a lot of soil we fed the cows with it but we fed the soil quite a lot to a lot of it gets trampled but they I think they had just gotten into this area so they would be able to clean that up a little bit better I mean the cows would eat a little bit more of it that's on the ground there and the other thing is that they we gave them some switchgrass there's a so at the same time they had access to all three of these different crops and the switchgrass at this time of year it's not that good of quality and so it's providing it's more of a bedding sort of probably but it was interesting to me see that they still ate some of it and it just goes to show that I mean we all like some diversity in our diet even chocolate cake if you hate it for every meal every day you get tired of it eventually and cattle are no different you know they like to have some diversity in their diet moving into September now we grazed a standing cover crop and the quality on this was just fabulous you know 26% crude protein and 64% digestible nutrients okay now where as we're getting close to the winter one of the questions we've been asking in the last couple years is about fertilizing or not fertilizing our cover crops and this is a picture from 2018 and I put this in here because you can really see the difference between the you know fertilize and not fertilize you can see these strips out there however when I actually went out and took collected the samples I couldn't find very much difference in in yield between the fertilized and the non fertilized strips you know sometimes our eyes can be be deceiving but another thing but there I mean there's definitely some impact there or I mean you can see it you can see that there's some impact but it was not as dramatic as you might think and in fact the statistics said that there really wasn't a difference in how much grew but another thing we noticed is that where we've fertilized we see this we got green up again so the Fertile I the strips that had been fertilized after we swath they they they grew and greened up and where we had not fertilized they did not but that didn't really add a whole lot of biomass to the equation in terms of forage or soil health so we did it again this year and this year it besides going out there by hand and cutting stuff and weighing it and all that I also used a drone to take images and we got you know the regular visible light images we also use some near infrared cameras and calculated a NDVI which is supposed to tell us how much is out there and so I did both the drone and the hand sampling and on this particular field which is not irrigated you can see the yields that we've got here 3,000 pounds per acre fertilized 2,400 pounds per acre not fertilized but whether I collected my data with the drone or by hand the statistics say there's no difference there that was hard for me to believe and I'll get a little bit more into that in a minute but the other thing we see is that the fertilized part had a little higher crude protein and so that's also beneficial but again the statistics didn't didn't support me there and saying that there's really a difference but statistics aside we've got a 25% increase here going from not fertilized to fertilized and if we calculate just on the non fertilized part it costs us 62 dollars per ton if we assume that we had to hire someone to go out there and do all the field operations and that and bought the seed and everything 62 dollars per ton using custom rates and then if we if we consider that we put on 45 pounds of nitrogen and the extra forage we got for that the use of fertilizer it cost us $59 per ton for those that extra tonnage so neither one of these is bad a bad price for the quality of this forage we did the same thing on one of our irrigated fields it did get irrigated one time 3/4 of an inch is all and on this field the yields are very similar 3,100 pounds of 2200 pounds very similar to the other field to the field that was not irrigated at this time though the statistics support the difference and they say yeah yeah there really is a difference you know the fertilizer really did something and we see it in the crude protein also and so cost per ton for the non fertilize is similar you know $68 per ton to produce the non fertilized but then with the addition of fertilizer it cost us forty dollars per ton the cost of that fertilizer to produce some extra forage so again good prices for this high quality forage so what we do with it then this is following wheat we've planted this cover crop and we're planning to graze it over the winter and we swath almost all of it and if we have the cows eat the swaths Duane also left some standing strips this year so we can make a comparison between the swaths and the strip's but mostly it's just the swaths you can see 11 days later this picture I took now a lot of the green has faded out of that out of that standing crop and me a lot of you are probably familiar with this but with the way we prefer to move the fences over the winter is with the irrigator so we don't have to be moving posts all along you can see the the white wires those are our hot wires there they're hanging from the irrigator and so you go out there and you press the button on the irrigator and it moves your fence four or twenty feet or whatever so we've got the swaths running one direction and the fence running perpendicular to it like this and we just move that fence along the line so the cows get an extra 20 feet or whatever the number is you know every day we just give them a little bit more ration it out to them if you take in a tour at Dakota Lakes you've probably been on top of our calf shelter here on the backs that you can't see in this picture about the backside of it there's a piece that we can flap down and then it covers up the backside the calves can get in there here you can see the defense is back here in this picture and this undisturbed snow right here the cows haven't been there yet you can see yesterday this is the area they were working in and so here's a swath you can see this swath in the foreground that they were eating and they haven't bothered the snow near as much in between and then here's another swath the cows are they do a fine job of finding it and if you think about the grazing the swath versus grazing the standing if you've got a 20 foot swath or you take all that 20 feet and you condense it down into two feet right and now if there's no snow that doesn't make a whole lot of difference but once it starts to snow and cover that up now the cow only has to search these two feet where the swath is right and so the kind of the action does she she reaches down in there and she kind of takes a bite and at the sit and then she actually picks her head up she kind of flips some of the snow to the side and she reaches down she picks it takes a bite and she kind of flips them and so he's almost like she's tunneling along where that swath is moving the snow to the side and because we're moving this fence every day she can see where that swath was yesterday and she knows where to look for it tomorrow now you get a bunch of new snow or if it you cross over on top sometimes you might have to come through and help them out a little and maybe drive over top and they can see where it is or they so they can kind of get in there get that first bite in there and start working at it but they don't they don't come at it from above they come at it you know from the the side horizontally and they work through it that direction the cat you know the calves even get out there and do it because we're fall calving so we've got the calves out there eating swathes - so I did the same thing here as I did during the summer with those swaths I went out every month and I collected quality samples to see what's happening and of course during the winter we expect it to be preserved better than during the summer so with those cold temperatures we expect the quality to be maintained versus the the hot humid summer and and that's pretty much what we see we lost a couple percentage points just like in the summer but it took three months to lose it rather than one month and the difference between the you know one of these is standing one is swath well you know there's a little bit of difference here but there's a lot of variability in the data not not much difference between them in terms of quality the difference I think is mostly in the cows ability to get to it I also measured the tdn again remember this is the energy or the calories that's in it and we see a decline over these several months but and this is one field I collected the data on another field - and if we look at this second field the loss of crude protein isn't much at all same with the the energy not a whole lot of loss of energy so we can see that we do lose some quality in these swaths over the winter but it's not real dramatic and it's better than the summer so besides giving the swaths every day we also give them some some corn residue every day and the the swaths are high-quality and if that's all the cows got it would be a great diet the corn residue is not as good at quality and but it provides some fill and they do find some some ears in there that the combine missed and so you put those two together the diets not as good as what we'd like the cows to have over winter and so we also give them a little bit of supplement which could be in the form of flaxseed meal soybean meal that we produce on the farm could also be you know it could be corn or peas or lentil sorghum this is another drone image that I took and this is on a a corn field you can see this spot up here where we had some really wet soils this year and all this this part of the field is on the right that got planted later because it was wet and so from the drone imagery you can definitely see those differences and this is this is supposed to be telling us where we had more corn or less corn right I also have cages out there with that we don't let the cows into because and I do this on a lot of the fields where we let the cows graze to find out what kind of impact they're having and so I thought and I go out there and I harvest with I do some hand harvesting or some small plot combines to harvest those and try to compare yields to say well if we had a cow out here last year you know is it hurting our corn yield is it hurting our soybean yield and so far I haven't been able to find any differences so this year I enlisted a drone to help me out and the drone couldn't find the differences either so so I'm I have not been able to find evidence of the grazing hurting our yields at Dakota lakes and I so so how do I explain that I know some there are some people who have said that they have had trouble and I I don't have a scientific study where I set this up to make the compare and yet but I suspect that what's happening is it's the particularly that we're managing things at Dakota Lakes you know these soils have been in long-term no-till for decades and the way we graze those cover crops is first we have a wheat crop and we harvest it with a stripper head and this is a picture of what the soil looks like you know we have I mean look at that you mean it's just completely covered with the straw from from the wheat and then we've we've got our cover crop in here and the cover crop gets gets swathed and concentrated in one spot but that ground is still covered with the wheat straw so when our cows are out there they're stepping on that armor the wheat straw is the armor and the other thing is we're moving these fences everyday right and so they're never staying in one spot for a long time and if we do get really soft soils you know it's some moisture and the soils are not frozen well tend to move the cows off of that field and put them into a perennial grass area for a while and feed them some bales but even if they're you know if everything doesn't always work out perfectly it's a you know the Dakota Lakes it's a real it so even though we do a lot of research there we have this challenge as everyone does and sometimes the cows are on the field when it's the soils a little bit soft you know and you can see some hoof prints but even then we're moving that fence every day so they're not camped out in one spot beating that soil to death for a month at a time and I so that's what I that's the speculation as to why we're having the success we are so that is the end of my presentation and but I just wanted to post this question up here again at the end the challenge that I see is how long can we keep our animals and then nutrients they eat in our land and I hope that the all those stars form the constellation the marketing part and the the read the beef label in the back you know how that if we can get a higher if we can get a premium for doing the good things we do for the land and keeping the cattle on the land and the nutrients on the land and there again matter on the land hopefully we can we can bring that all together so I should have time for a few questions at least if there are any yes sir on the question was on the shields pastor when we did the grazing how many head were out there we have thirty cows and so you know from year to year plus or minus thirty cows and the whole that whole pasture is around eighty acres but that part where we're doing the experiment we tent we have them in paddocks that are less than an acre like the smaller some of the small paddocks are about two-tenths of an acre and then the larger ones are about four times that I think so just just under an acre so 30 cows and in that area so it's not it's not as intensive as some of the really high stocking rate mob grazing but it is much more intensive than typically what you would see any more questions okay thank you very much going right thank you [Applause]",
