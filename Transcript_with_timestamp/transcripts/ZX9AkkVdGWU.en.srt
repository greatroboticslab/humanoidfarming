00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,120
here in ghana but one major thing they

103
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,079
lack

104
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,720
is access to factories or processing

105
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,040
plants

106
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,880
that can aid farmers if they are not

107
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,120
able to sell immediately

108
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,920
or go and put it in their warehouse they

109
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,440
can process

110
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:41,760
the raw you know pepper into powder foam

111
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,000
and sell we always go to buy from other

112
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:47,279
countries to come in so that is no good

113
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,480

it wasn't easy hide and seek issues

196
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,760
when i was a baby and my grandmother

197
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,520
encouraged me

198
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,480

199
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:17,600

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,919
songs you have so far

204
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,600
yeah it's good it's good but sometimes

205
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,520
people don't really pay attention

206
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,200
okay but i mean it's a matter of time

207
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,480
i'm dropping my songs i'm doing

208
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,919

so for how many songs do you have out

210
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,320
