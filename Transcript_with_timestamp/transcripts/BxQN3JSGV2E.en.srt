1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,480
good afternoon this is um my name is

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,040
Henry newfeld I'm head of the climate

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:18,439
change unit um at the world Agro

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:22,039
forestry Center ikra in Nairobi in Kenya

5
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:25,279
and I welcome you very much to this uh

6
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:30,119
discussion forum organized by erra

7
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:32,719
together with FAO and um while we start

8
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:35,680
going through a quick round of

9
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:39,559
introductions um I hope that there will

10
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:42,280
be more people coming in and uh so that

11
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:43,920
we take as much time as we can for

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,640
discussions

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,960
afterwards the title of this uh session

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,640
is called using climate Smart

15
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,199
Technologies to scale up climate smart

16
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,640
Agriculture and forget the practices

17
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:57,600
it's a bit of a toogy but and I

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:01,840
apologize um climate smart agriculture

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:06,080
has had quite a bit of a um let's

20
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:10,600
say it's it's been a very shiny kind of

21
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:13,320
brand coming up um it's managed to unite

22
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:15,680
sort of the development the Agriculture

23
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,720
and the climate change communities under

24
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,119
one brand and in doing so it's raised a

25
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,159
lot of

26
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:25,240
expectations um term has been around for

27
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,079
about four or 5 years there are a couple

28
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,400
of

29
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:30,520
Publications uh that have been put

30
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,280
forward around CL climate smart

31
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:37,520
agriculture what it really is what it

32
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,520
could be and um still we lack we still

33
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,640
do lack a bit of an understanding of

34
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:47,520
what it could actually do and this

35
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:50,600
session here is uh also meant to bring

36
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:54,520
shed a bit of light on that question

37
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:56,119
um there has been uh a Global Alliance

38
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,560
for climate smart agriculture which was

39
00:01:56,119 --> 00:02:01,000
launched uh recently at the climate

40
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,280
change Summit in September m in the in

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,679
New York uh there was also there's also

42
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:10,119
an African uh Alliance for climate smart

43
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:13,280
Agriculture and we will also talk about

44
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:16,599
these um two new institutions and what

45
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,560
they can potentially deliver uh in

46
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:20,879
resolving issues around food security uh

47
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,000
adaptation and

48
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:28,000
mitigation so uh let me just quickly

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,200
introduce uh our speakers first um we

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,599
have Alexandre Maybeck who is a senior

51
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,440
policy officer uh on agriculture

52
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:36,800
environment and climate change in the

53
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,800
office of the assistant director General

54
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,840
uh within the FAO then our second

55
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:45,440
keynote speaker is Todd rosenstock who

56
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,920
is an agro ecologist with erra and he

57
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,879
investigates how smallholder agriculture

58
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:54,200
affects the environment and

59
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:58,360
Society um and then we have panelists

60
00:02:54,200 --> 00:03:00,640
here sitting U next to me we have here

61
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:04,920
uh sorry where is she she

62
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:07,920
Lami in I'm sorry I can I I can't get

63
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,360
the name right in inua I think is she's

64
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,440
a manager for communications and

65
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,599
knowledge at feran the food agriculture

66
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:17,319
and natural resources policy analysis

67
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:19,000
network with 21 years of experience in

68
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:22,120
policy research and

69
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,400
advocacy uh then we have Martin Bia he's

70
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,280
the head of the comprehensive

71
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,879
agriculture Africa agriculture

72
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,519
development program katup within uh

73
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:33,720
nepad and

74
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:35,959
finally last but not least Austin Tibu

75
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,080
uh he's been working as a land resources

76
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:40,040
conservation officer at Malawi's

77
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,439
Ministry for of Agriculture irrigation

78
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:45,959
and water for over 10 years and he's

79
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:47,920
also the FAO focal point for economics

80
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:53,040
and policy Innovations for

81
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:55,480
CSA in the epec Epic program and then um

82
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,560
we will have Richie auua who's sitting

83
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,000
here in front he is um an expert in

84
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,799
business development strategy and

85
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,560
spearheads the environmental defense

86
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:06,159
funds engagement in Asia uh he will be

87
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,799
rapturing he will give us a short

88
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:11,599
summary at the end of the the session so

89
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:15,319
without losing any more time I'm going

90
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:17,799
to ask Alexandre to say a few words

91
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:20,199
about um what climate smart agriculture

92
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:22,960
is some backgrounds opportunities and

93
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:24,639
challenges and then we'll hear what uh

94
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,919
Todd has to say about climate smart

95
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,240
agriculture Panacea or prop propaganda

96
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:35,800
okay please Alexander thank you very

97
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:41,400
much and yeah move that yeah

98
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:43,440
y so uh I will very briefly introduce or

99
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,320
reintroduce for those of you who who

100
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,759
already uh know what climate smart

101
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:52,440
ulture is what the the way we understand

102
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:55,240
climate smart agriculture in in FAO

103
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:58,240
which can be slightly different some

104
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:00,560
from some of the things uh that are

105
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,120
around more and more

106
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,880
and just extremely briefly giving

107
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,960
examples because examples is probably

108
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,160
the best way to understand what uh

109
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:13,800
climate smart agriculture uh could

110
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:16,320
mean so once again agriculture has to

111
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,000
address a triple challenge more food in

112
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,280
quantity quality and diversity

113
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,880
everywhere for everyone adapt to climate

114
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,080
change and contribute to mitigate

115
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,120
climate change the important point I

116
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,319
think is that this triple challenge has

117
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:32,039
to be seen at very various scales Global

118
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:34,199
local local and and household and we

119
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:37,000
always need to keep in mind these

120
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:39,240
various scales when you look at systems

121
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
and and what can be their contributions

122
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,319
to climate smart

123
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,479
agriculture growing demand all over the

124
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:50,840
world um due also to to diet changes but

125
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,440
especially in some countries and and

126
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,360
many of these countries which are

127
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:58,759
already food insecure and which will be

128
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:01,120
the most affected by climate change and

129
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:04,280
globally worldwide fa estimates that

130
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:07,639
production has to increase by

131
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:09,120
60% very briefly main effects on of

132
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:10,960
climate change on agricultural

133
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,680
production a decrease of production in

134
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,080
certain areas a change in the geography

135
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,520
of of production between countries and

136
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:22,000
inside countries and also and especially

137
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:26,759
uh an increased variability of

138
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,199
production so the the impacts on on food

139
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:32,520
and nutrition security have have been

140
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:36,720
well described in in the hlp reports

141
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:40,479
2012 and now in the ipcc report uh

142
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,319
recently released with impacts on the

143
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,720
most vulnerable countries and the most

144
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:47,960
vulnerable people mainly and with

145
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:50,240
impacts on food security and nutrition

146
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,479
which are much more than just decreasing

147
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,960
yields decreasing yields and the

148
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:58,039
consequences of decreasing yields

149
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,440
changes of the geography of production

150
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:02,440
and so vulnerable all countries having

151
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:05,599
to import and price volatility and the

152
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,599
combination of all these

153
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:12,039
effects so agriculture can also

154
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:15,720
contribute to mitigate and the way we

155
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:18,479
see it uh in in FAO given the fact that

156
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:21,039
agriculture has to produce more is to

157
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:23,479
understand mitigation as a reduction of

158
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:26,840
emissions per kilo of

159
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:30,240
output globally having emissions

160
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:34,160
increasing less than production

161
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:40,120
and also uh enhanced agricultural soil

162
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:40,120
carbon sinks which means sinks above and

163
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:46,879
underground so the concept has first

164
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:49,319
been introduced in 2010 it with the

165
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:52,599
title of a brochure that FAO prepared

166
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:56,440
for the the ha

167
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:58,599
conference one so it's amazing how the

168
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,919
the word is now all over the place

169
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:04,199
probably because this idea that we need

170
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:07,039
to address various

171
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:10,120
objectives at Farm level at Country

172
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:14,039
level and globally is really

173
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:16,120
needed and also one other important

174
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:18,879
point about the climate smart a culture

175
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:22,120
approach is that it is not only

176
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:24,680
practices or systems but also systems

177
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,120
from an ergonomic point of view but also

178
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:32,719
the policies and institutions and the

179
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:35,760
finance which are necess to enable these

180
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:39,839
changes so it's really the three of

181
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,800
them with to a certain extent why I

182
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,039
climate smart I don't know what is a

183
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:47,320
climate smart technology i' I'd rather

184
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:47,320
think about climate Smart

185
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:53,080
Systems and when you try to take these

186
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:55,080
three objectives together food security

187
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,320
adaptation and mitigation globally what

188
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:00,800
we want to do is more resource efficient

189
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:03,760
systems and more resilient systems Sy

190
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:06,360
but be also careful to what we mean want

191
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,000
to mean by resource efficient systems

192
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:12,839
it's not only more crop per drop it's

193
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,839
also more income per drop more jobs per

194
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:18,200
drop in the countries where agriculture

195
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,600
is the main source of jobs and and

196
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:23,399
income for the

197
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:26,560
population which means that it is very

198
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:29,560
country local system specific the the

199
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:33,040
way you imagine the Technologies and the

200
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:36,640
way they are integrated in a system and

201
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:39,360
globally what what we think is that the

202
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,440
tradeoffs are not really between food

203
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,200
security and mitigation or food security

204
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:47,160
and adaptation but rather because

205
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:49,480
between increasing resource efficiency

206
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,800
and increasing

207
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:55,279
resilience and this is where you have to

208
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:57,680
look at tradeoffs and

209
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,519
synergies an important point which is

210
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,640
why I was insisting on the various

211
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:05,760
levels in the system is that we need to

212
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:09,440
increase the general resilience of Food

213
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:12,160
Systems which means the physical

214
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,120
resilience environmental but also the

215
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:18,079
economic and social resilience of the

216
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,800
system one of these Dimension being able

217
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:23,399
to compensate for a certain time but not

218
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,800
for a very long time but for instance

219
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:29,320
social protection can help farmers

220
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:31,399
resist a physical shock avoid them

221
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,040
selling all their livestock for instance

222
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:37,000
and enable them to recover

223
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:40,680
afterwards but resilience has also to be

224
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,959
seen at various levels each level being

225
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:45,000
able to compensate for another the

226
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:48,680
resilience of his household depends on

227
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,320
the fact also on the fact that they're

228
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,920
Diversified the Diversified sources of

229
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:56,320
income but also it can be compensated by

230
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,880
social protection for instance trade can

231
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:02,320
play a role to a certain extent provided

232
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,920
that there income so that why I we were

233
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,920
insisting on the need to understand how

234
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:09,079
the various systems relate one to

235
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,800
another household to the farm the farm

236
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:14,440
to the landscape the the farm to the

237
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,560
food chain and all of that constitutes

238
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:21,519
various Food

239
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:25,680
Systems so really very very quickly and

240
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:28,680
and you'll hear much more about it after

241
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:31,079
me understanding climate smart

242
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:35,120
agriculture has to be done on the ground

243
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:37,279
in the field in in in real systems so

244
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,959
these are just examples of a brochure

245
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,680
you'll found you'll found

246
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:45,320
downstairs where we

247
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:50,120
tried uh to look

248
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:52,560
at the various dimensions of the impact

249
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:55,360
of a technique in in other words and to

250
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,680
come back to the title of my

251
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,240
presentation we believe that there are

252
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,760
opportunities to have climate Smart

253
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:06,120
Systems more efficient and more

254
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:09,040
resilient but the challenge is to be

255
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:11,480
able to properly measure the various

256
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,639
impacts of the techniques both

257
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:16,720
environmentally economically and

258
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:18,959
socially and in various time frames and

259
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,959
these are very different according to

260
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:24,519
the system it's not the same if you

261
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:28,120
introduce Ura de placement in Bangladesh

262
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:29,720
where jobs are very uh low coast and you

263
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:34,000
need more jobs

264
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:36,440
and in China for instance where job

265
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,800
labor is much more coly so you need

266
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:41,320
mechanized systems and and the impact on

267
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:44,079
food Security will be totally different

268
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:48,240
in the various systems and very often

269
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:49,680
what happens is that which is what where

270
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,760
climate smart agriculture makes the

271
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:55,199
change we've introduced a technology for

272
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:57,600
a precise objective and we measure that

273
00:12:55,199 --> 00:13:00,760
precise objective we have the basine on

274
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:04,440
water and we and we measure how water is

275
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:07,720
used very often we don't have the impact

276
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:11,680
on economics on livelihoods on income on

277
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:14,240
social issues on gender sens sensitivity

278
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,800
Etc so these are some cases where we

279
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,760
have them sustainable grazing for better

280
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,720
livelihoods in China this is an

281
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:23,160
interesting project because in the

282
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,639
beginning it was introduced as a

283
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:29,600
mitigation project uh to increase carbon

284
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,440
sinks but in fact it is totally

285
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,680
transforming the systems and the

286
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,519
livelihood of the people and it's much

287
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:40,720
more a food security and an adaptation

288
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:43,639
project with a carbon Finance component

289
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,639
but it is this carbon Finance component

290
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:47,680
which began triggering the the

291
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:50,279
institutional

292
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,399
changes uh you'll hear probably more

293
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:54,519
about these one uh

294
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:57,480
afterward insisting also on the

295
00:13:54,519 --> 00:14:02,279
important of genetic di diversity just

296
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:05,560
as an example of of things that that we

297
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:07,759
need in order to be able to react to

298
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,560
uncertainties and this is another very

299
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:11,199
important dimension of climate smart

300
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,839
agriculture when we say increasing

301
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,720
resilience we mean resilience to

302
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:17,480
everything because we do not know

303
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:21,040
exactly what are going to be the changes

304
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:23,920
in 30 or 40 years in in whatever area

305
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,800
landscape approach is also a key

306
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,839
one um I've already mentioned that one

307
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,839
and I will stop here to leave the floor

308
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,959
to

309
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,959
my colleague thank

310
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:40,399
[Applause]

311
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,320
you so what I'm going to be talking

312
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,399
about today is trying to answer oh it's

313
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,680
cut off hopefully not all of the slides

314
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,120
are like that uh what I'll be talking

315
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,639
about today is trying to answer this

316
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:53,600
simple or somewhat complicated question

317
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:56,279
climate smart agriculture propaganda or

318
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,320
Panacea and here in like this title

319
00:14:56,279 --> 00:15:00,320
slide this question is incredibly

320
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,320
complicated especially for climate smart

321
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,920
agriculture because with climate smart

322
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,440
agriculture what we're talking about in

323
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,199
many cases is multiple Dimensions we're

324
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:11,040
talking about multiple practices here

325
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:12,839
you can see it's Agro forestry

326
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,880
intercropping uh conservation

327
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:16,839
agriculture improved cook stoves as well

328
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,480
as multiple outcomes so we're looking at

329
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:20,320
nutrition security we're looking at

330
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,560
poverty alleviation we're looking at

331
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,519
natural resource management and so how

332
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,199
do we even begin to think about and

333
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:29,000
begin to analyze this type of complexity

334
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:32,160
I would tend that it's this type of

335
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,920
complexity that has largely made the in

336
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,399
and helped spur the debate about whether

337
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,959
or not climate smart agriculture can

338
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,360
actually achieve some of its Ambitions

339
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:43,319
and it's because of this we need to pull

340
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,440
back from some of the sort of IND

341
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:47,440
idiosyncratic case studies and try to

342
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,360
get to the real big issues that we can

343
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,040
then uh start to bring these these

344
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,800
topics to

345
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:56,000
scale so over the next about 10 10

346
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,759
minutes or so I'm going to be telling

347
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,680
you about the initial results from a

348
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,560
meta analysis that that we've been

349
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,240
conducting about specifically to try to

350
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,519
answer the question of How do farm

351
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,720
management

352
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:10,120
practices affect food security uh add

353
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:12,000
adaptive capacity and mitigation and so

354
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,440
I was sort of inspired to take on this

355
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,199
topic largely because I was seeing

356
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,120
things like this in the news uh the

357
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:19,360
Global Alliance for CSA wants to reach

358
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,560
500 million small holder farming

359
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,399
households uh the African CSA Alliance

360
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:28,279
and the knad vision 25 by 25 want to

361
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:30,680
reach 25 million households by 2025 this

362
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:33,639
type of effort will require a Herculean

363
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:35,360
change in how we as scientists and we as

364
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:37,680
development practitioners actually

365
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,720
Implement agricultural development and

366
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,600
so but the real question here is what is

367
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,800
the evidence base all of this type of

368
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,399
development initiatives is fundamentally

369
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:49,639
based on the assumption that we have

370
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:52,560
evidence for that improved practices CSA

371
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:54,319
uh will improve food security uh

372
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,160
adaptive capacity and mitigation

373
00:16:54,319 --> 00:16:58,519
objectives while and also it's based on

374
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,240
the fundamental assumption that we have

375
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:02,360
so idea about the synergies and

376
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,160
tradeoffs between these different

377
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,720
components and so what have we been

378
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,079
doing so far we've been trying to make a

379
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,240
sense of essentially what is a pile of

380
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:12,360
disperate

381
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,520
literature and so we've been doing a

382
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:17,679
meta analysis and a systematic review of

383
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:19,240
65 practices and 15 indicators and so

384
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,919
when I say practices we're not talking

385
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,720
about the aggregate level of Agro

386
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:24,760
forestry we're talking about things that

387
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,840
farmers actually Implement on the on the

388
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:30,760
ground leguminous intercrop AGR

389
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:32,559
Forestry deep placement of Ura things

390
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:34,480
that farmers would actually need that

391
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:37,120
you can analyze individually and then

392
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,559
also aggregate back up when I talk about

393
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:42,120
indicators these are indicators of food

394
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:43,480
security adaptive capacity or mitigation

395
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,880
uh for food security we're looking at

396
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:49,280
four main indicator categories of

397
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:51,240
ranging from income productivity and and

398
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,080
such in terms of adaptive capacity

399
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,559
obviously this is the hardest one we're

400
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:57,200
thinking about things like soil quality

401
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:59,000
we're thinking about gender

402
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,000
differentiated labor we're thinking

403
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,200
about nutrient use efficiency water use

404
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,400
efficiency and things like that

405
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,799
mitigation is a little bit more

406
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:08,280
straightforward carbon sequestration uh

407
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:11,039
greenhouse gas intensity and the like

408
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:13,919
and so what we've done is essentially we

409
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:16,120
we utilize discipline oriented keyword

410
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:19,320
searches in the web of science database

411
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:22,000
and we came up with 144,000 candidate

412
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:24,760
papers and with the help of a small team

413
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,919
in of of Master's level students

414
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:30,280
including Helena who's in the audience

415
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:34,080
here today uh we went through all

416
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:36,320
144,000 papers and tried to see how they

417
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,919
matched our inclusion criteria so here

418
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,880
we were interested in whether or not

419
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:43,240
there was they had information and data

420
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:44,760
on a CSA practice and a non-csa control

421
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,760
as well as whether or not they took

422
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:49,280
place in a tropical developing country

423
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,679
so from that 144,000 we narrow in

424
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,320
Reading those abstracts we narrowed it

425
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:56,480
down to about 16,000 papers and those

426
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,120
papers we then downloaded the full text

427
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,799
and further analyzed them to see if they

428
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:03,480
met our inclusion criteria that left us

429
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:05,440
with uh 6,000 papers in which we had to

430
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,760
actually extract data from that we

431
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,039
thought were relevant to answering our

432
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:11,400
main question which is uh climate smart

433
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:13,480
agriculture panace propaganda or in

434
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,600
other words what is the evidence based

435
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,799
behind climate smart agriculture so far

436
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,799
we've extracted data on about 20% of

437
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:21,159
that and so I'll be talking about that

438
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:23,480
based on the numbers that we've already

439
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:25,400
extracted we presume that in the end

440
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:28,480
this database which will be hopefully

441
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,760
ready by the MIAA conference if not a

442
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,159
little a little bit later on in the year

443
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:35,240
we'll have about 120,000 individual data

444
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:38,000
points in it

445
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:40,400
okay and so if we start and so if we

446
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,200
just start to map the where the studies

447
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,080
have taken place to see where and how

448
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,640
and what information is available these

449
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,320
are the studies that we have this is a

450
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,360
random sample from our 12200 studies

451
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,840
that we've already looked at um where

452
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,600
they where they are actually located on

453
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,520
the map and these Studies have they're

454
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,400
talking about at least one indicator

455
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,120
relevant for food security adaptive

456
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,280
Capac capacity or mitigation you see

457
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,919
that it's a pretty good global

458
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,360
distribution but if you look a little

459
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:06,760
closer you also see that there is some

460
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:09,559
Geographic clustering that you see that

461
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:12,640
in Western Kenya and maybe around Acra

462
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:14,799
and Ghana there's actually um quite a

463
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,159
number of studies that are in relatively

464
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,960
small location and what so what does

465
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,640
that mean for when we're trying to scale

466
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,679
climate smart agriculture well what it

467
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:24,360
means is or what it suggests at this

468
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:27,000
point is that we may have a biased data

469
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:30,000
set that our information base may be

470
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,360
inadequate to be able to say say uh that

471
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,159
this type of practice will have this

472
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:36,880
type of outcome in a in a new location

473
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,200
when we then go to uh studies that have

474
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,240
two

475
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:43,600
practices or two that address two

476
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:46,280
components of CSA like food security and

477
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,280
adaptation in the same study the um the

478
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:51,159
size of the data set reduces

479
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:53,880
dramatically you B we basically lose 60%

480
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:56,200
of the studies and so why is that

481
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,919
important that's important because what

482
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,760
we know from about 50 years of

483
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,760
agricultural research and agricultural

484
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,039
for de development research is that a

485
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,919
lot of time interventions are

486
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:07,520
place-based so we can't presume that the

487
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,159
types of interventions and the types of

488
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,240
outcomes that we might see in one

489
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:13,039
location are going to be able to be

490
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,679
extrapolated to another location quite

491
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:17,960
easily and so these synergies and

492
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:20,159
tradeoffs may not actually U be

493
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:23,120
transmissable and lastly if we look at

494
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:25,159
studies where we have all three

495
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,840
indicators May probably given this

496
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:28,880
projector you might not even see any up

497
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,919
there there's but there's a seven dots

498
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,640
so we we basically reduced it to less

499
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:36,120
than 1% of the studies have looked at

500
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:38,960
all three all three components of CSA in

501
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:41,320
the same study and this is this is

502
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,159
important simply because it greatly

503
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,919
reduces our ability to characterize what

504
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,480
is normally thought of within climate

505
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,039
smart agriculture which are these triple

506
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:52,240
winds these win-win

507
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:54,440
winds when we start to look at the data

508
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:58,640
and actually use uh common meta

509
00:21:54,440 --> 00:22:01,039
analytical techniques so this is uh they

510
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,760
food security response across multiple

511
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:06,000
indicators for six different practices

512
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,600
at different aggregated levels and

513
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,960
that's sounds a little complicated but

514
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:13,000
let me let me go into uh a little bit

515
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:15,039
more detail and so wrong button so this

516
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,320
is an effect size so an effect size

517
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:19,600
measures the relative effect of the

518
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,279
treatment to the control and so anything

519
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,000
to the right of that red line is a

520
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:24,919
positive effect anything to the left of

521
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,080
that line is going to be a negative

522
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:30,120
effect uh if it crosses that line it's

523
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,480
not significantly different than zero

524
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:35,279
and you can you may have positive or

525
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,600
negative control or negative effects and

526
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:39,880
so basically what you see here is that

527
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,480
there's not only a wide variability for

528
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:46,159
any given practice for instance in Agro

529
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:48,600
forestry or but there are some uh clear

530
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:51,960
winners the use of inorganic fertilizer

531
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:53,880
seems to be quite positive uh the use of

532
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,640
increasing protein and livestock feeds

533
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:58,600
as well the interesting part is is that

534
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,120
in most cases people are talking about

535
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,600
climate smart agriculture at a very

536
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:04,200
aggregate level they're talking about

537
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:08,000
agroforestry as climate smart well as

538
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:09,799
you can see in these top two two panels

539
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,240
uh if once you start disaggregating the

540
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:14,480
data from AGR forestry to actually

541
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,240
leguminous AGR forestry the actual

542
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,039
effect changes and so I I would argue

543
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,840
that you would need to actually begin to

544
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,679
think about it in this more disaggregate

545
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:25,080
level when you're identifying things as

546
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:25,080
climate

547
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:30,400
smart and lastly let's let's look quick

548
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:32,559
quick L at some synergies and some

549
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,799
tradeoffs and so this is just the

550
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:36,760
synergies and tradeoffs uh for the

551
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:40,360
adaptation and food security indicators

552
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:44,159
that are are in 130 random

553
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:45,760
samp random sample of 130 studies so as

554
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,679
you can see there are only 55

555
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:50,720
comparisons in that in that 130 study so

556
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:52,600
that's back to the about 60% decline

557
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,360
that I mentioned earlier and everything

558
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,200
in the red box in the lower leftand

559
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,720
corner is where you don't want to be

560
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:01,000
this is lose lose so about 6% of the

561
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,039
studies showed that there were lose lose

562
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,360
effects between adaptation and food

563
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:08,159
security uh in the opposite quarter in

564
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,320
catac cornia there's about 32% of them

565
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,039
showed that there were actually

566
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:13,080
synergies so this is what everybody is

567
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:16,400
saying is possible with climate smart

568
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:18,039
agriculture but equally important 60% of

569
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,080
the studies that we that we looked at

570
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:22,640
and granted it a small data set at this

571
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,559
point shows that there's equal or more

572
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,080
likely chance of actual trade-offs

573
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:30,360
between adaptation and food security

574
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,360
than there are synergies

575
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:35,120
and so so while today I just really

576
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:37,640
focused on a very small amount of our

577
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,559
initial data the merging Trends seem to

578
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,919
be clear somewhere clear that there's

579
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:43,679
Geographic uh clustering of the studies

580
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,799
which would suggest that we have

581
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,880
challenges in actually extrapolating the

582
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:50,760
data there's a likelihood that we will

583
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:52,720
see uh tradeoffs as much as we would see

584
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:56,279
synergies as well as that there's large

585
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:59,770
variability amongst and with and between

586
00:24:56,279 --> 00:25:06,000
and within individual practices than

587
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:08,919
[Applause]

588
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,440
thanks okay thank you so before we go to

589
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:14,760
some questions we'll have another uh

590
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:17,279
round of panelists giving their sort of

591
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:19,960
views on what they've just heard also

592
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:22,080
just making some statements in regard to

593
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:25,840
let's say the alliance here so let's

594
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:29,399
start off with Martin and then um Lami

595
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:31,960
and Austin in that order and um I'll ask

596
00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:34,039
you to be fairly brief so that we have

597
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:36,640
as much time as possible for questions

598
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:38,559
and answers where you can sort of uh

599
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,679
elaborate more on any issues you might

600
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:44,159
want to raise okay so Martin you want to

601
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,159
kick us off

602
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:59,159
please thank you very much okay yes

603
00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:02,720
thank you so much moderator Hy

604
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:05,120
yes I'm going to be very brief and thank

605
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:08,320
you so much to the two

606
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:11,840
presentations I think they do give us a

607
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:14,720
very good scope in terms of the

608
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,440
discussion now and I pick it up from the

609
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,679
messages key messages out of the two

610
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,640
presentations and I would

611
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:25,240
say is it possible looking at what we've

612
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,919
just heard in terms of what is clim SM

613
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:31,120
agriculture is it possible then or is it

614
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:35,120
correct to say that in

615
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:37,480
fact climate smart agriculture is just

616
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:40,520
any good agricultural

617
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:43,240
practices anything that is actually good

618
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:46,799
and underlying the word good is going to

619
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:48,640
give us productivity food security is

620
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:51,159
going to give us adaptation it's going

621
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:54,520
to give us mitigation

622
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:58,760
value uh and sometimes when you look

623
00:26:54,520 --> 00:27:01,600
back into uh what we have described and

624
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:03,840
what we've known as good agricultural

625
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,760
farming when we say climate smart

626
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:10,279
agriculture are we saying anything

627
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:12,080
different what is new in in this ER and

628
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:15,039
I start by

629
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,960
saying that yes in fact there there is

630
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:20,080
something new there is something

631
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,440
different uh one of the first important

632
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,679
issue is

633
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:27,760
that in dealing with and talking about

634
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:28,720
CLI smart agriculture we want to go

635
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:32,200
beyond

636
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:34,880
just the issue of securing productivity

637
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:37,159
so this is more than just productivity

638
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,720
issue there is something that is

639
00:27:37,159 --> 00:27:42,799
actually very very clear about the

640
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:45,880
threats that climate change or the

641
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:48,600
opportunities that climate change bring

642
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:51,880
on the whole spectrum and space on

643
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:54,640
productivity and on the Food Systems so

644
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:57,880
you looking at the everything that we're

645
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:00,679
doing in terms of farming practices or

646
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:03,559
what you call Agriculture and look at

647
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:07,240
how far is it going to

648
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:08,039
support enhancing ability to deal with

649
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:12,360
the

650
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:15,559
new emerging Trends and and threats

651
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:18,360
opportunities that are very specific to

652
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:21,399
the occurrence of climate change climate

653
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:23,440
variability and this again is about

654
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:26,440
understanding the actual risks which are

655
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,240
actually going are very localized is

656
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:30,840
appreciating the actual opportunity

657
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:33,919
unities that you attribute to to that

658
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:35,799
climate change uh the second point I

659
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,519
want to make is

660
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:40,200
the is that when you look at clim smart

661
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:42,559
agriculture in terms of what is

662
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:45,120
different and in terms of those

663
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:48,200
practices is actually that is something

664
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:52,080
that is compelling Beyond we talk about

665
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:54,000
holistic comprehensive approaches but in

666
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:59,159
climate smart agriculture we are seeing

667
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:02,200
a very practical compare to look at

668
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:05,880
agriculture to look at farming in a very

669
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:07,640
very integrated holistic and I like what

670
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:10,600
the the moderator was saying in the

671
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:13,760
beginning that is more than just climate

672
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:17,200
Smart Technologies but that we we look

673
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:20,559
at climate Smart Systems because it's

674
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:23,720
about practices it's about policies and

675
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:26,279
institutions as mentioned resources but

676
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:28,600
is also about managing the tradeoffs in

677
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:30,960
terms of different constituencies

678
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:34,919
but also the tradeoffs in in time and

679
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:37,320
space so what are we doing today Visa

680
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:41,320
what are the needs requirements of

681
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:44,880
future scenario and the last and third

682
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:47,640
point in terms of the practices of clim

683
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:51,840
smart agriculture is actually the value

684
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:54,200
and the one issue about clim smart

685
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:57,399
agriculture is actually how much it

686
00:29:54,200 --> 00:30:00,440
should bring back the value the benefits

687
00:29:57,399 --> 00:30:03,000
into the local circumstances both in

688
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:05,399
terms of environmental resilience social

689
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,480
resilience but today especially when you

690
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:10,919
look at Africa the issues how do we

691
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:13,799
support the communities to harness their

692
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:15,720
resources land and water in terms of

693
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:18,559
increasing access to economic or

694
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:21,279
expanding economic opportunities and and

695
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:26,360
actually enabling them to move in that

696
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:26,360
Spectrum towards Prosperity thank

697
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:35,760
you okay thank you you very much Martin

698
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:37,440
um we now have Fabiola um Muno Doo who

699
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,240
is the executive director of the

700
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,919
national forest and Wildlife service

701
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:44,440
surfor here as well

702
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:46,159
um it's a Pity she couldn't make it to

703
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:49,080
us a little earlier because she missed

704
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:50,640
the the presentations but I'll give her

705
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,240
the the chance of listening to the

706
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,039
respondents so then she can make

707
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:57,600
something out of that and uh we'll have

708
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:59,480
more chances to hear afterwards okay

709
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:03,039
well thank you very much for coming

710
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:07,039
anyway it's been it's great to have

711
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:08,120
you Lami please good afternoon ladies

712
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:12,240
and

713
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:14,760
gentlemen uh when I was being introduced

714
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,919
they said that I'm working for an

715
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:20,480
organization where working in a policy

716
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:23,399
space I would like to throw that into

717
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:26,159
the discourse of you know climate smart

718
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:27,960
agriculture uh I listen to the

719
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:32,440
presentations and I also listen to the

720
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:35,200
the presentations before this session a

721
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:39,360
yesterday what I'm seeing as a missing

722
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:43,639
link it's the enabling environment that

723
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:45,679
we all agree that it's part of what will

724
00:31:43,639 --> 00:31:48,240
make you know our efforts for climate

725
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:51,480
smart agriculture to be

726
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:54,080
successful I just want to share with you

727
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:56,320
uh the experience that just we had uh

728
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:59,519
with our organization where we did uh

729
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:02,519
some scoping studies in 15 countries in

730
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:04,679
Africa southern Africa and East Africa

731
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:06,960
to see how the countries are actually

732
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:09,440
responding in terms of you know the

733
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:12,039
climate smart agriculture debates and

734
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,039
also climate change what we are seeing

735
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:16,880
is that that the countries do recognize

736
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:19,159
that climate change is there they also

737
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:22,000
respond to the to the calls for climate

738
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:24,799
change and most of the discussions are

739
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,880
hosted by the ministries of of

740
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:29,360
environment what we have seen with the

741
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:33,320
ministries of agriculture culture is

742
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:35,080
that uh out of the 15 countries that we

743
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:37,960
we we we did the scoping study there

744
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:41,000
were about four five where they have

745
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:44,039
policies that speaks specifically to

746
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,880
climate smart agriculture so as we

747
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:49,480
discuss I would like us to to look at

748
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:52,360
how we can actually accelerate you know

749
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:54,679
really for the countries to have the

750
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:56,320
enabling environment that will

751
00:32:54,679 --> 00:32:58,000
complement what is happening on the

752
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,720
ground so we find you know the

753
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,440
disjuncture that you know on the ground

754
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:04,720
there a lot of experiences there a lot

755
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,679
of practices that is happening but

756
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,639
there's a gap between what is being

757
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:11,440
practiced and what the policies are

758
00:33:08,639 --> 00:33:15,360
saying so as we discussed we need to to

759
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:17,639
also accelerate on that front thank

760
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:20,000
you thank you very much Lami that's a

761
00:33:17,639 --> 00:33:22,240
very important point and Alexander

762
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,120
already mentioned it that we need not

763
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,880
only look at the Technologies that's

764
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:28,279
very

765
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:30,799
important uh Austin please just give us

766
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:30,799
your your

767
00:33:31,639 --> 00:33:38,480
thoughts oh thank you very much uh

768
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:42,639
moderator um from the

769
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,799
introduction I think I'm the most ta end

770
00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:48,480
panelist

771
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:53,240
here um I am from the extension side

772
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:57,000
of uh all these practices so I'll Focus

773
00:33:53,240 --> 00:34:00,360
my comment on what it takes to scale up

774
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,519
um climate smart agricultural

775
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:07,079
practices um I like the matrics that

776
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:09,560
toad presented I think it's four

777
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:13,599
dimensional but as we go out in the

778
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:17,440
field the matrics could become 100

779
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:19,200
dimensional um when we are working with

780
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,079
um the farming

781
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:24,839
communities uh the issues of

782
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:28,879
productivity yes they come in issues of

783
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:31,560
costs the issues of resource saving

784
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:34,960
environmental issues or

785
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:37,879
indicators and also the institutional uh

786
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:41,040
indicators that we have discussed in um

787
00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:46,720
the presentation from uh

788
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:50,200
FAO so uh when we are at that level we

789
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:52,520
must uh make sure that um all those

790
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:56,480
indicators are satisfied and that's the

791
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:58,520
main challenge uh that we Face uh in

792
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,400
climate smart agriculture

793
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:04,599
we have observed

794
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:07,359
that those practices uh they do respond

795
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:11,200
to as many of those

796
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:14,640
indicators and my suggestion to the

797
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:19,880
metod study that we are conducting under

798
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:23,119
aircraft is that we should um go on

799
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:25,800
beyond the three indicators to satisfy

800
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:29,079
what the farming communities need or

801
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:31,320
what they expect from this practice IES

802
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:35,359
and uh

803
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:39,760
finally uh I'd like to suggest that we

804
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:41,960
have quick policy briefs to our decision

805
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,920
making people the

806
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:48,839
politicians uh

807
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:50,240
that crisply presents what we expect or

808
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:53,800
what we

809
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:55,240
suggest uh uh the winning solutions to

810
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:58,160
the challenge that the farming

811
00:35:55,240 --> 00:36:00,200
communities are facing in the the

812
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,400
because of the effects of climate change

813
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,400
thank

814
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,520
you thank you Austin and that's very

815
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:09,359
important for us to talk about the

816
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:12,920
question of scaling up I think we should

817
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:15,520
hear uh more about that um it's one

818
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:17,680
thing to know the benefits in terms of

819
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,760
uh adaptation mitigation and food

820
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:22,839
security but then another question

821
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:25,280
altogether might be how can it how can

822
00:36:22,839 --> 00:36:28,400
we reach these millions of farmers that

823
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:30,119
uh Todd was already mentioning Fabiola

824
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,440
do you want to say a few words with

825
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:34,920
regard to climate smart Agriculture and

826
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:39,200
U potentially uh your own experience

827
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:39,200
here out of the country I don't know

828
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,160
e

829
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:00,480
El for

830
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:52,079
l

831
00:38:58,119 --> 00:39:01,119
in

832
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,920
min

833
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:30,680
min in

834
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:00,200
uh

835
00:41:01,319 --> 00:41:05,599
pardon okay

836
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:30,280
buo for

837
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:04,819
[Music]

838
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:10,210
[Music]

839
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,240
okay thank thank you

840
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:29,319
so I think you did added a very

841
00:42:27,319 --> 00:42:32,400
important element and gave some more

842
00:42:29,319 --> 00:42:34,839
sort of depth to the question of what

843
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,119
contributes to enabling environments

844
00:42:34,839 --> 00:42:38,920
from the political perspective and I

845
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:42,000
think that was very useful for our

846
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:46,200
audience here so we have quite a bit of

847
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:48,240
time for questions and then uh so I'd

848
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:50,839
like to take two or three questions at a

849
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:54,559
time and then uh we'll give a give our

850
00:42:50,839 --> 00:42:57,839
panel an opportunity to respond I have

851
00:42:54,559 --> 00:43:00,960
Jonathan here in the back um

852
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:03,640
yes sir number two and we'll take one

853
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:06,520
more

854
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:09,800
afterwards what go ahead Jonathan yeah

855
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:13,480
my name is Jonathan Cornelius um a

856
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:15,599
question actually for for Fabiola can

857
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:17,760
you introduce yourself please not the

858
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:19,680
institution okay sorry Henry this is

859
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:22,160
Jonathan Cornelius I'm regional

860
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,359
coordinator for World agrology Center

861
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:27,880
based here in

862
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:31,760
Lima okay um yeah a question for faola T

863
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:36,440
your interesting remarks about the need

864
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:38,480
to close the gap between research and

865
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:44,440
policy

866
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:48,520
yeah and coincidentally possibly um in

867
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:52,160
our institutions the CG we spend a lot

868
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:56,160
of time thinking about theories of

869
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:58,119
change and how our research can change

870
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:01,680
what happens

871
00:43:58,119 --> 00:44:06,559
uh to its intended or rather can

872
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:08,359
change uh what our intended uh users do

873
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:10,920
should we say in this case how our

874
00:44:08,359 --> 00:44:14,520
research can change policy what I'd like

875
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:17,000
to ask you as a as

876
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:19,319
a uh

877
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:24,119
implementer and

878
00:44:19,319 --> 00:44:29,079
former of policy is to what

879
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:31,599
degree um the El at end users of

880
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:33,599
research also have to

881
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:38,040
come back

882
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:42,960
down the the the chain of impact

883
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:46,200
themselves and somewhere uh meet the the

884
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:50,040
scientists as they try increasingly to

885
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:53,079
work forwards in in the chain of impact

886
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:55,680
yeah um hope I'm being clear what I'm

887
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:58,720
trying to say is that as researchers we

888
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:01,720
are being asked to be increasingly

889
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:04,200
accountable uh for our research being

890
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:05,800
implemented for example in changing

891
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:09,640
policies

892
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:14,400
so uh what is the role of policy makers

893
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:16,960
in also coming back maybe towards

894
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:21,200
researchers and for the two of us

895
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:23,440
together uh to construct um that impact

896
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:25,440
that we all

897
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:29,559
want thank

898
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,559
you okay please yes

899
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:36,720
sir and then the lady behind him um as

900
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:44,280
well thank you I'm Doug Boucher from the

901
00:45:41,319 --> 00:45:48,400
union of concerned scientists um my

902
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:51,319
question is for Todd um the graph you

903
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:54,440
showed had what to me was a striking and

904
00:45:51,319 --> 00:45:57,520
even paradoxical result which is that a

905
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:59,359
a very large uh quite impressive

906
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:02,119
metaanalysis from the world Agro

907
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:04,280
forestry Center showed that there was no

908
00:46:02,119 --> 00:46:06,960
significant effect of Agro

909
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:09,000
forestry um but you were only talking

910
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:12,480
about the effects on food

911
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:16,160
security what were the significant

912
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,160
variables that affected uh

913
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:22,240
mitigation okay

914
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:30,079

916
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:30,559
okay let's uh give the panel the

917
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:34,920
opportunity to respond and uh yes let's

918
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:38,520
start with Fabiola and uh then I'll pass

919
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:40,040
it on to to Todd and um anybody else who

920
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:41,800
wants to say something to any of the

921
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:44,800
other questions please feel free okay

um and I think you're totally right

935
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:25,400
about everything

936
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:27,240
uh see Todd why don't you just respond

937
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:30,400
to dog's question I think it's a

938
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:34,160
important question dou easy to follow up

939
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:36,960
great appreciate that um I I fail to see

940
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:38,880
the Parx uh mostly because I'm a

941
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:41,760
scientist and I just I report what the

942
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:43,119
data say and so this is the analysis

943
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,319
that that we've done so far in the

944
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:47,720
limited data set what you see and what

945
00:53:45,319 --> 00:53:49,720
you saw in that graph is largely driven

946
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:51,160
by the variability in aggro forestry

947
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:52,680
systems that are included there there's

948
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:55,000
border planting there's intercrop

949
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:56,599
there's there's legumes there's Timber

950
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,000
species and all of that which which is

951
00:53:56,599 --> 00:54:01,640
why you see such a wide such a wide

952
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,640
range in the effect and so I would I

953
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:05,359
would presume that before the end of the

954
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:08,720
analysis when you we've included more

955
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:11,000
data um that you we would we would see a

956
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:13,000
different effect how large that effect

957
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,640
positive or negative I'm not I can't

958
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:19,040
it's hard for me to predict right now

959
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:19,040
based on my reading of the 1200

960
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:24,640
papers oh the mitigation effects we

961
00:54:21,799 --> 00:54:25,960
haven't looked at those data yet okay

962
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,319
Martin do you want to say something

963
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:29,119
about

964
00:54:27,319 --> 00:54:31,680
the the question that Jonathan raised in

965
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:33,720
the context of Science and policy I

966
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:35,880
think you might be able to add a few

967
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:37,559
words from your perspective maybe put it

968
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:40,079
into the context of the climate smart

969
00:54:37,559 --> 00:54:40,079
agriculture

970
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:49,920
Alliance yes thank you uh indeed that is

971
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:51,640
an interesting issue and it does come up

972
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:54,119
all the time in fact in the in the

973
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:56,119
Africa Alliance one of the work stream

974
00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:59,119
we have identified where we saying we

975
00:54:56,119 --> 00:55:01,520
need need to make a difference is on is

976
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:03,599
on the on the policy we have one on the

977
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:06,720
policy stream and we have one which

978
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:09,240
we're calling technical support and this

979
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,760
is the appreciation of the fact that and

980
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:12,319
I think in Africa you can say the

981
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:16,559
politicians are

982
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:19,920
coming quite a long way in respecting

983
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:22,839
data respecting evidence and beginning

984
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:25,280
to talk about facts and figures and the

985
00:55:22,839 --> 00:55:29,400
problem is that this facts and figures

986
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:32,039
data is not existing in the form in the

987
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:34,839
manner that they can actually use it at

988
00:55:32,039 --> 00:55:37,280
the moment and that is the problem we

989
00:55:34,839 --> 00:55:40,880
have so the the issue in terms of

990
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:43,680
research is actually how we can move and

991
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:47,079
actually move very rapidly not just in

992
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:49,319
terms of Technology development but also

993
00:55:47,079 --> 00:55:51,960
support the politicians to answer the

994
00:55:49,319 --> 00:55:55,319
questions they need to answer in terms

995
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:56,760
of real with the evidence with the

996
00:55:55,319 --> 00:55:59,920
objectivity

997
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:02,480
that is desired and one of the things we

998
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:05,680
are looking at actually as a as a matter

999
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:07,440
of approach is that when you talk about

1000
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:11,119
climate smart

1001
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:14,319
Agriculture and and look looking at at

1002
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:16,960
science is a very open space there's a

1003
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:18,760
lot we need to know but is also clear

1004
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:20,799
that the climate smart agriculture we're

1005
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:23,880
talking about in fact as implied from

1006
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:26,680
the various discussions is not the same

1007
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:29,680
as manufacturing a kind Laboratory and

1008
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:31,599
then take it out on the road to be used

1009
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:34,079
the car the clim smart agriculture is

1010
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:36,520
going to be developed in situ is going

1011
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:39,240
to image within the road that you're

1012
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:41,559
using it so it's how we move actually in

1013
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:43,720
terms of research approaches in terms of

1014
00:56:41,559 --> 00:56:46,520
research Tools in terms of the

1015
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:49,280
accountability of what research delivers

1016
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:51,280
to actually bring them into the field

1017
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:53,960
working with the farmers working with

1018
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:55,440
politicians working with communities and

1019
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:57,640
and actually it's also because it's not

1020
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:00,039
just a technical issue is actually

1021
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:03,280
political economy and and those things

1022
00:57:00,039 --> 00:57:05,480
will be critical in making climate smart

1023
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:08,200
agriculture image the way we want to see

1024
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:10,960
it we've mentioned actually working with

1025
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:14,400
the Cs we're working with far and we're

1026
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:17,079
saying also that we need in fact just as

1027
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:19,480
much political economy research as we're

1028
00:57:17,079 --> 00:57:22,480
doing on the on the hardware on the on

1029
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:24,119
the on the actual agronomic and and

1030
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:27,760
technological

1031
00:57:24,119 --> 00:57:31,200
practices uh moderator if you allow me

1032
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:34,079
just one more point I wanted also to say

1033
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:36,400
that when you look at the sorry

1034
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:38,640
discussions on climate smart agriculture

1035
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:41,119
everywhere even in the this this two

1036
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:44,319
days of course it's being emphasized in

1037
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:47,880
terms of the the comprehensiveness the

1038
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:51,240
integrated nature of it the holistic

1039
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:54,160
aspects uh but it's also linking to

1040
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:56,520
research to understand that I think we

1041
00:57:54,160 --> 00:58:00,319
have to be careful that we don't end up

1042
00:57:56,520 --> 00:58:02,839
with a very perfect creation that is

1043
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:05,079
unimplementable and and actually the the

1044
00:58:02,839 --> 00:58:07,280
Excellency of the description of climate

1045
00:58:05,079 --> 00:58:08,880
smart agriculture is not going to come

1046
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:12,960
out of a laboratory it's going to come

1047
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:15,319
out of real practices in the field and I

1048
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:17,160
want to end by saying in fact in that

1049
00:58:15,319 --> 00:58:18,880
sense that's why we need to listen more

1050
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:21,359
from what the farmers are doing what

1051
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:23,160
communities are doing and actually

1052
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:26,440
understand that if it's not broken don't

1053
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:26,440
fix it

1054
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:32,760
brilliant okay I saw I had you sir then

1055
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:34,960
um I saw you first and I don't know if

1056
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:38,559
you were there so I have you three okay

1057
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:42,880
please introduce yourself

1058
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:45,559
please can we get a a microphone here

1059
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:50,480
see first no I saw this gentleman first

1060
00:58:45,559 --> 00:58:50,480
he was uh already raising his hand I'm

1061
00:58:54,559 --> 00:59:00,319
sorry thank you uh Doug brown with World

1062
00:58:57,319 --> 00:59:01,680
Vision International um my question's

1063
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:03,440
specifically to Todd but I think

1064
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:06,319
Alexandre might be able to help with it

1065
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:07,880
as well um your data surprised me a

1066
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:10,480
little bit in a way it was but I think

1067
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:13,079
it's partly because it's a ma m analysis

1068
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:15,839
and of course you're looking at studies

1069
00:59:13,079 --> 00:59:18,000
that were designed to measure food or

1070
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:20,359
productivity impacts or at resilience

1071
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,319
impacts but they may not have measured

1072
00:59:20,359 --> 00:59:25,280
the other ones and so they're dropped

1073
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:27,440
out when you sort of start comparing to

1074
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:30,280
um so there's a limitation there I guess

1075
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:31,640
but I was looking at the grid the quadr

1076
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:33,760
here where you have the win-wins the

1077
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:36,520
lose lose and then the mixed ones and

1078
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:38,640
I'm just trying to wonder I know when in

1079
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:40,319
the FAO Source book we know that there's

1080
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:42,920
a lot of practices listed there and

1081
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:45,039
they're not all equally climate smart

1082
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:47,520
some score better on two or three

1083
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:49,240
dimensions than others do so I'm

1084
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:51,160
wondering if you can characterize what's

1085
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:53,839
in the upper right quadrant versus

1086
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:55,200
what's in the lower the upper left

1087
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:56,680
versus the lower right and what

1088
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:58,599
practices are

1089
00:59:56,680 --> 01:00:01,119
dropping down to those things versus the

1090
00:59:58,599 --> 01:00:05,839
ones which are clear

1091
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:09,160
win-wins okay um and yes sir please now

1092
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:09,160
you'll have to go over again I'm

1093
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:18,640
sorry can I take about 2 minutes to

1094
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:21,599
share how we have achieved climate smart

1095
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:24,400
Agriculture and benefited in India yes

1096
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:27,039
so TR if you would try to be very

1097
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:29,240
concise and also to be I take two

1098
01:00:27,039 --> 01:00:32,559
minutes and and try to frame a question

1099
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:35,079
as well later on but first I would like

1100
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:37,880
to congratulate Todd for bringing out a

1101
01:00:35,079 --> 01:00:39,520
very precise analysis of what is

1102
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:42,280
happening and what benefits have

1103
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:44,799
occurred and if this taken further then

1104
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:47,520
the world Community will benefit now

1105
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:50,599
climate smart agriculture we started in

1106
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:53,640
Gujarat India about 10 years back and we

1107
01:00:50,599 --> 01:00:56,920
called it as a new extension approach it

1108
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:59,559
is prior to agriculture season it takes

1109
01:00:56,920 --> 01:01:02,880
place in all Villages together 18,000

1110
01:00:59,559 --> 01:01:05,440
Villages team is led by

1111
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:09,000
agriculture extension Administration

1112
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:12,400
agriculture scientist input dealer and

1113
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:14,520
Market people and they go and meet the

1114
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:17,440
farmers at their

1115
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:19,839
doorstep provide them information what

1116
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:22,280
crops they should grow in next season

1117
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:24,880
based on prevailing

1118
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:27,599
situation three inputs are provided to

1119
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:31,319
Farmer one is soil Health analysis which

1120
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:34,440
I mentioned in the last uh session that

1121
01:01:31,319 --> 01:01:37,400
what crops their soil will sustain based

1122
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:39,400
on the weather parameters second is what

1123
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:41,400
is market demand for the crops which

1124
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:44,960
crops they should select based on the

1125
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:47,400
market and where the quality inputs are

1126
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:49,480
available this is backed by water

1127
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:51,599
conservation measure at Village level

1128
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:54,119
which is funded by the government with

1129
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:57,839
Community participation so not a drop of

1130
01:01:54,119 --> 01:02:01,760
water goes out 70% % of our area is

1131
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:05,640
rainfed focus is on women farmers and

1132
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:10,039
Rural Youth and Rural youth are trained

1133
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:13,039
to identify what are microenterprises

1134
01:02:10,039 --> 01:02:16,200
possibilities based on local agriculture

1135
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:18,319
produce so it's a comprehensive approach

1136
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:20,880
takes place every year prior to

1137
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:23,960
agriculture season and what has happened

1138
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:26,319
in Gujarat India and which is now going

1139
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:28,440
on all over the country uh the all

1140
01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:31,520
health card approach and everything is

1141
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:34,640
that we had a minus 2% to plus 2% growth

1142
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:38,400
rate we have now reached 9% growth rate

1143
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:41,160
in 10 years at constant price so almost

1144
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:44,920
income of farmers have doubled and on

1145
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:47,480
par with nonfarm sector so if we follow

1146
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:49,680
this approach in a comprehensive manner

1147
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:52,160
there will be less social turmoils which

1148
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:55,240
are happening in many parts of world and

1149
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:56,799
people are trying to grab Justice by

1150
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:59,680
brutality thank

1151
01:02:56,799 --> 01:03:03,240
you okay uh thank you very much for this

1152
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:07,039
comment and I'm going to ask uh your

1153
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:07,039
your intervention first

1154
01:03:07,279 --> 01:03:13,160
please okay my name is talent tunzi and

1155
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:15,760
um I'm with fan my question is basically

1156
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:18,440
on on coordination taking into account

1157
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:21,760
that um CSA is at a global level and

1158
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:24,119
also we have got the CSA Alliance at at

1159
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:27,599
at the African level how are the

1160
01:03:24,119 --> 01:03:30,200
coordination modal modality is do we

1161
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:31,839
have an implementation framework or a

1162
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:34,279
monitoring and evaluation framework at a

1163
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:36,640
global level that resonates with other

1164
01:03:34,279 --> 01:03:38,119
regions and are we following a bottom up

1165
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:40,400
approach in terms of coming up with

1166
01:03:38,119 --> 01:03:42,240
those uh with those kinds of Frameworks

1167
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:45,359
and the other the other question is on

1168
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:49,079
the on the CSA Technologies do we have

1169
01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:51,119
context specific CSA toolkit or

1170
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:53,000
technologies that we have to really say

1171
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:55,119
this is what we call climate smart

1172
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:57,200
agriculture or it's just the three

1173
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:59,760
indicators that were showed here that

1174
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:02,559
indicate on food security adaptation and

1175
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:06,079
mitigation do we have practical context

1176
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:08,480
specific um toolkits that are talking to

1177
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:10,000
different eot types uh in in the

1178
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:12,319
different regions that we are operating

1179
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,119
in thank you thank you very much for

1180
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:17,599
this excellent question so what I would

1181
01:04:14,119 --> 01:04:20,880
suggest is that uh Alexandre and and

1182
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:23,720
Austin you could try to respond to the

1183
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:25,760
Indian gentleman's point which I think

1184
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:27,640
was very context specific and I think it

1185
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:29,920
makes sense to sort of look at the

1186
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:32,960
question from a larger perspective is it

1187
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:34,599
transferable can it be done elsewhere

1188
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:38,599
you know what are the constraints and

1189
01:04:34,599 --> 01:04:40,960
because we talk about systems that are

1190
01:04:38,599 --> 01:04:43,119
context specific we need to make sure

1191
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:45,720
that they actually fit somewhere else

1192
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:47,720
and then Todd if you answer uh Doug's

1193
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:49,880
question of course and Rami I don't know

1194
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:54,279
if you want to step in also looking at

1195
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:57,640
uh the questions of coordination

1196
01:04:54,279 --> 01:04:57,640
potentially so

1197
01:04:58,599 --> 01:05:03,960
Alexander

1198
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:06,599
um so the first thing is

1199
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:08,559
that which is why I was saying that

1200
01:05:06,599 --> 01:05:10,400
we're a bit une easy with this idea of

1201
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:12,079
climate Smart Technologies and climate

1202
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:16,039
smart practices because it is very

1203
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:18,119
context dependent it's ecosystem

1204
01:05:16,039 --> 01:05:20,160
dependent but it's also socially

1205
01:05:18,119 --> 01:05:23,079
dependent it depends how the communities

1206
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:25,039
are organized it it depends how the

1207
01:05:23,079 --> 01:05:26,920
policies are supporing it depends of the

1208
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:29,640
economics and

1209
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:34,240
so from our perspective what what we

1210
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:38,440
need is is having more examples of what

1211
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:40,920
has worked or what has not worked with

1212
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:43,480
the various impacts and why it has

1213
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:46,400
worked or why it has not work what what

1214
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:49,480
what is the context which is around the

1215
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:52,440
object the ultimate objective would be I

1216
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:55,880
don't know if it would be toolkits but

1217
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:58,559
information tools knowledge platforms

1218
01:05:55,880 --> 01:06:01,720
col it how you want it where

1219
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:05,760
practitioners or actors at whatever

1220
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:08,799
level from governments policy makers

1221
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:12,839
of development practitioners or or

1222
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:15,680
Farmers could go and have a look at

1223
01:06:12,839 --> 01:06:19,720
situations which are as comparable as

1224
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:21,920
possible to theirs or one aspect of the

1225
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:24,480
situation is comparable to there so

1226
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:27,400
that's the objective and you're right it

1227
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:31,039
needs a lot of coordination this is this

1228
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:33,400
event is part of it uh the huge work

1229
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:36,119
with done by Todd is an essential

1230
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:39,200
element of that uh but there is still a

1231
01:06:36,119 --> 01:06:41,160
lot to be done but probably one the

1232
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:43,319
biggest from my perspective the biggest

1233
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:46,160
mistake to avoid would be to say oh

1234
01:06:43,319 --> 01:06:49,319
that's a solution just implement it top

1235
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:51,359
down this does doesn't wouldn't work and

1236
01:06:49,319 --> 01:06:54,640
not only it wouldn't work but there is a

1237
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:56,640
risk of having wrong impacts in another

1238
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:58,720
Dimensions I think one of the important

1239
01:06:56,640 --> 01:07:00,920
thing with climate SM is that we say in

1240
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:04,559
the beginning you have to look at the

1241
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:07,240
three things you do not necessarily need

1242
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:10,799
to address them at the same level the

1243
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:12,520
win-win-win thing is a myth maybe but

1244
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:16,000
you need to look at the three and you

1245
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:17,960
need to know what damage you're doing in

1246
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,920
another dimension when you want to do

1247
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:22,640
something and that's probably true for

1248
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:26,319
all natural resources issues or or even

1249
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:30,079
development issued but and and uh uh

1250
01:07:26,319 --> 01:07:33,720
yeah maybe I'll and and this probably is

1251
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:37,039
part of why the quarter and and what so

1252
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:38,880
many trade up because it it's not the

1253
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:42,440
same everywhere but probably you you'll

1254
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:42,440
be more able to enter that

1255
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:53,720
way okay uh thank you very much I'll

1256
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:57,359
start uh from where Al

1257
01:07:53,720 --> 01:08:03,839
Alexander has stopped on the two kets

1258
01:07:57,359 --> 01:08:06,599
yes or no um in some areas we are trying

1259
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:10,000
uh to draft some to Kits

1260
01:08:06,599 --> 01:08:12,559
or some messages on climate smart

1261
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:15,960
agricultural practices I'll give an

1262
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:19,480
example of the Epic uh projects in

1263
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:22,640
Vietnam Zambia and Malawi where we have

1264
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:24,000
looked at the we have started looking at

1265
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:27,719
the trade

1266
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:30,480
tradeoffs uh in terms of medication all

1267
01:08:27,719 --> 01:08:33,120
those triple winds medication food

1268
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:36,960
security and adaptation and we have

1269
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:40,040
isolated some examples or some

1270
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:43,880
practices that are fitting well within

1271
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:47,400
those winwin win uh we are also doing

1272
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:51,239
some institutional mapping uh on how to

1273
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:52,000
move on or outscale these practices and

1274
01:08:51,239 --> 01:08:54,759
we

1275
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,239
have we are also doing some policy

1276
01:08:54,759 --> 01:08:58,960
harmonization

1277
01:08:56,239 --> 01:09:03,239
I think my colleague Shema indicated

1278
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:06,080
that in some areas or some

1279
01:09:03,239 --> 01:09:07,520
regions we have a gap between the

1280
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:10,960
environmental sector and the

1281
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:14,279
agricultural sector uh from policy and

1282
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:16,199
institutional setup on how to handle uh

1283
01:09:14,279 --> 01:09:19,600
the issue of

1284
01:09:16,199 --> 01:09:22,960
agricultural practices that are climate

1285
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:26,159
smart uh from my colleague from

1286
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:30,799
India uh that's a very good example that

1287
01:09:26,159 --> 01:09:35,239
he has indicated and he I'm happy that

1288
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:40,120
uh a few months ago I was in

1289
01:09:35,239 --> 01:09:43,199
martra and I I observed the same uh best

1290
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:44,839
practices on what they were calling the

1291
01:09:43,199 --> 01:09:48,279
advisory

1292
01:09:44,839 --> 01:09:50,159
Services uh within martra they were able

1293
01:09:48,279 --> 01:09:52,960
to combine the water

1294
01:09:50,159 --> 01:09:54,040
budgets uh the Hydromet Services the

1295
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:57,560
