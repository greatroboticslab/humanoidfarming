preparation planting care and harvesting

19
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,719
of carrots and how they are

20
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:49,320
revolutionizing the agriculture industry

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,280
in the past soil preparation planting

22
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,039
caring for and harvesting carrots

23
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,840
required a lot of manual labor workers

24
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:58,399
had to prepare the soil using basic

25
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,440
tools and tasks like planting seeds and

26
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,120
caring for the crops were mostly done

27
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,680
manually during harvesting Farmers had

28
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,560
to bend down pull each carrot out by

29
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,799
hand and place them into crates this

30
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,000
method was not only slow but also

31
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,880
physically demanding requiring many

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,600
workers to complete the tasks which

33
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,320
increased costs for Farmers but now with

34
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,640
the Advent of machines for soil

35
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:25,439
preparation planting care and harvesting

36
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,200
of carrots these technological marveles

37
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,360
have completely transformed carrot

38
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,920
farming these machines make carrot

39
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,520
cultivation far less time consuming

40
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,159
compared to traditional manual methods

41
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,000
let's take a closer look at how these

42
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,680
machines work and why they are so

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,600
effective carrot soil preparation and

44
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,600
sewing machines are specialized

45
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,159
agricultural equipment designed to

46
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:49,439
automate the steps from soil preparation

47
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:53,200
seed sewing to covering the seeds with

48
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,920
soil helps save time labor and cost

49
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,240
while increasing production efficiency

50
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,399
and crop yield with continuous and

51
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,759
precise operation these machines are

52
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,560
invaluable tools for Farmers especially

53
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,600
on large scale Farms nowadays Farmers

54
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,959
also use mechanization for fertilizing

55
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:12,040
and spraying pesticides to save labor

56
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,560
time and enhance productivity the carrot

57
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,760
harvesting machine is equipped with

58
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,599
Advanced digging blades that gently lift

59
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,640
the carrots from the soil without

60
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,840
damaging them the carrots are then

61
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,280
transferred onto a conveyor belt where

62
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,879
they are automatically cleaned and

63
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,040
sorted this process not only speeds up

64
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:30,599
harvesting but also ensures that carrots

65
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:33,800
are handled carefully minim iing damage

66
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:35,920
and waste with just one machine farmers

67
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,640
can Harvest several times more carrots

68
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,319
in the same amount of time compared to

69
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,760
manual methods this not only reduces the

70
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,200
need for labor but also significantly

71
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,640
shortens the harvesting time allowing

72
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,519
Farmers to bring their products to

73
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,640
Market faster and fresher increased

74
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,560
efficiency can lead to significant cost

75
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,120
savings and higher profits for Farmers

76
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,519
there are different types of carrot

stalks at the base then the corn plants

194
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,560
are transferred onto the conveyor here

195
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,440
the separator automatically separates

196
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,639
the kernels from the cobs and deposits

197
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,080
the kernels into the storage compartment

198
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,039
while the stalks and leaves are

199
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,440
discarded this process minimizes kernel

200
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:54,319
loss and ensures the harvested kernels

201
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,319
are clean and less damage one major

202
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,240
advantage of the Corn Harvester is its

203
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,960
ability to operate continuously and

204
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,879
efficiently over large areas saving

205
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,240
Farmers Time and Labor compared to

206
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,280
manual methods this is especially

207
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,400
crucial during harvest season when

208
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,159
timely harvesting can directly impact

209
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:14,400
the quality and market value of the crop

210
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:17,000
Additionally the corn Harvester reduces

211
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,919
the need for manual labor a significant

212
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,479
benefit given the current scarcity of

213
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:23,039
agricultural workers modern corn

214
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:24,759
Harvesters are also equipped with

215
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,680
Advanced Technologies like GPS

216
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:29,080
navigation systems which help the

217
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:32,159
machines operate more accurately reduce

218
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:34,200
waste and optimize productivity The

219
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,120
Continuous development of corn Harvester

220
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,640
technology plays a crucial role in

221
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:41,320
enhancing efficiency and sustainability

222
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,399
in agriculture helping Farmers improve

223
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,920
their profits and maintain stable yields

224
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:48,200
in the long term technological

225
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,760
advancements in corn Harvesters have

226
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,000
revolutionized agriculture bringing

227
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:57,320
substantial benefits to Farmers and the

228
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,320
agricultural economy as a whole
