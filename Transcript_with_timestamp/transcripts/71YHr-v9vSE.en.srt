1
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,960
right

2
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:43,760
so you got a shorter side and a longer

3
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:47,600
one yeah you're toing off at the handle

4
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:51,600
here so this knot that I'm doing is

5
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,840
um deemed to be 80 H sorry 70% the

6
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,440
strength of the

7
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,680
wire which isn't too

8
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:02,960
bad it doesn't

9
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,960
slip and you can use it on short

10
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,159
strains and it comes up pretty

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
neat that's how fast it is when you can

12
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,280
do it well well it's quicker than

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,640
putting in a Crump or anything you know

14
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,640
yeah and

15
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:29,439
um my wire strainers are Rusty because

16
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:34,479
nobody seems to be able to build good

17
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,479
wire is these days that don't

18
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:47,600
slip so yeah show it again uh

19
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,600
slower slower yeah

20
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,479
so what

21
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,880
you

22
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,399
yeah around the first and then the loop

23
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,399
and around the

24
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,760
second

25
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:39,840
each of these wires is uh tension to

26
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,840
around 150

27
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,800
kgs and I'm pretty confident that this

28
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,680
particular fence will stay that tight

29
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,000
for the next 30

30
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:55,120
years because

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,680
um we've used 2.7 M strainers all driven

32
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:01,480
all the foots are driven

33
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,560
yep and um

34
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,560
so here we're just at a corner it's

35
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,319
going from this is about halfway down

36
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:13,120
the line yeah

37
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:16,920
halfway about um from there

38
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,920
somewhere industry standard yep is for

39
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,840
these these lines to actually be tied

40
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:25,120
off on the strainer so that there's no

41
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:28,120
um knots on the line except for joining

42
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,720
knots of wire where your coil Runs Out M

43
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,439
but um that's good and and I do tie off

44
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:36,000
a lot of fences in that

45
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:38,519
manner but uh this works really well on

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,480
a long strain you need to get even

47
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:45,000
tension from both ends and like to say

48
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:47,840
the knot is um pretty strong and it

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,200
doesn't slip see this no sharp edges on

50
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:54,560
it or nothing like that yep and um it'll

51
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,560
be fine it'll stay here for

52
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,720
years

53
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:07,079
then you got to put some buttons on

54
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:10,280
everywhere three three for every panel

55
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:13,799
yeah so this is a 9 wire fence and it's

56
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:17,079
a pretty standard fence for New Zealand

57
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:20,320
conditions I really like it because

58
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:22,479
uh by the time you put three BTS on this

59
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,720
fence there Ain nothing going to put its

60
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:28,600
head through it and hassle it and it's

61
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:32,199
tight tight like a guitar you know and

62
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:36,800
um they ain't going to get through this

63
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:40,039
ever and then that means that I can

64
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:44,199
finish this job and look laying should

65
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:44,199
be as good as you like you know

66
00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:01,639
yeah those where the five first and the

67
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:03,800
last four in here yep yep I set the

68
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:05,800
strainers so that

69
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:09,919
um all the

70
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:13,120
knots fall in a row as good as you can

71
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:16,360
get but the reason for that is when

72
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,280
we come to batting this fence there's

73
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,680
going to be a bat in here and another

74
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:23,160
one here so all of those knots are going

75
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:27,319
to fall um down in the

76
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:30,240
middle and it's not hard to change the

77
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:33,400
um strainer to do that

78
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,160
oh yeah but you got to think in advance

79
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:40,440
where you put your nuts yeah because of

80
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:44,280
the buttons of course yeah yeah so I'm

81
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:48,560
just trimming off here what I need to

82
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:50,360
uh work with the rest is just Surplus so

83
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,759
this is about how much wire we've pulled

84
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,440
out of the strain the strainer fence

85
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:57,880
yeah so if you have a look along here

86
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:01,199
we've built around 200 M here between

87
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:05,319
the two

88
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:07,960
uh both ends nothing like this is the

89
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:11,800
the last of about 1.2 km that we've

90
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:13,520
built in this particular job M so it's a

91
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,000
relatively short

92
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:20,599
strain and

93
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,720
um the rest of them are around between 3

94
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:24,560
and 400 m which some people would

95
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,000
consider quite long for one strain but

96
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,160
I'm a real fan of um having a long

97
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,560
strain because

98
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,280
it takes advantage of the elasticity of

99
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,800
this wire it's just like a piece of

100
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:41,080
elastic really I mean we're dealing with

101
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:44,520
high tensile wire yep 2 and 1/2

102
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:48,000
mil and uh a little short piece like

103
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:50,680
this feels very hard but over a great

104
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,680
distance it becomes very

105
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:56,840
elastic and um you've got to take

106
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,479
advantage of that so that you do have

107
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:02,479
something move in your fence line for

108
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:04,440
example if a foot comes up um that wasse

109
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,919
not going to lose much

110
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,440
tension but of course you try to set it

111
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:12,360
up so you can't do

112
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:15,000
that we've had a trials on this job

113
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:18,360
there's been a lot of um angle post to

114
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,840
put in which is like this one here and

115
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,840
um three of them we had to

116
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
blast

117
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:55,919
and those three took a day's work each

118
00:07:52,840 --> 00:08:00,280
by the time we blew a hole into solid

119
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:04,759
POA and then blew out a big crater

120
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:06,639
and then got down 1.2 M deep stick the

121
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:08,400
post in foot and then you got to find

122
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,280
all the Rocks get them back in the hole

123
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,159
and by that time your M will pack the GE

124
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:16,360
up and call it a day yeah all all those

125
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:19,879
corners and uh and strainers they're uh

126
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:22,919
deeper in the ground than uh over the

127
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:24,720
ground longer under uh this one here is

128
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:27,440
the same length in the ground as it is

129
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:34,159
out yeah but all the ones at the end of

130
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:36,719
the line are um uh how far are they in

131
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,680
to uh

132
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,680
1500

133
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,680
right

134
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:48,440
1300 shouldn't move with

135
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:50,120
this you hope not but some of this [ __ ]

136
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,640
ground around here is letting us down a

137
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,080
bit we've got to make sure that we put

138
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,320
foots on them

139
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:58,880
and we're lucky that we're doing this

140
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:02,760
job in in the winter time well you know

141
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:04,720
wet season anyway so that it makes us

142
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,160
think really hard about putting foots on

143
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,920
that aren't going to move yeah because

144
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,600
you can get fooled In The Summertime by

145
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:13,600
coming around and thinking oh it's nice

146
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:16,200
and dry here we can

147
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,880
um just put a little foot on and away we

148
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,320
go come winter time and this ground gets

149
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,839
really wet and you've got a tight fence

150
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:26,959
it'll move which

151
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,839
is unfortunate but yeah we just saw

152
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:32,360
before we had to put a huge foot and

153
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:34,959
replace that's right

154
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:40,000
yeah and

155
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:40,000
um let's we get trapped trap for young

156
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:47,480
players I've had many years of doing

157
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,560
this and I've I can I

158
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:52,279
can proudly say I suppose proudly say

159
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,720
that everything I've learned I've

160
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:57,160
learned the hard

161
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:59,680
way because when something fails and

162
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,519
believe me I've had a few things fail

163
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,800
you go and have a look at that and ask

164
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:06,240
the question why and you do what you

165
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,600
know you learn from it next time you

166
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,000
think right ain't going to let that

167
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,200
happen so you

168
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,640
know I'm still trying to build the

169
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,880
perfect

170
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:20,560
fence have you done it

171
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,560
yet I'm working on the

172
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:28,040
right I'm too fussy for that I I I spend

173
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:31,040
too much time picking holes in my own

174
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
work

175
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,959
and

176
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,839
uh wire strainers can be a dog to deal

177
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,760
with and I've found for years that if

178
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:47,920
you just put them on a little safety pin

179
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:50,320
like that M you've got them

180
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,440
all and then you can drop them on the

181
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,959
ground or do whatever and carry them

182
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,680
over your

183
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:59,040
shoulder and you can you've got them see

184
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:01,120
you can drop them on the ground here and

185
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,839
you pick them all up by grabbing that

186
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,839
and not losing

187
