  "text": "right here ready to plant and we've got a beautiful machine here that we're hopefully going to figure out how to use now uh first thing I guess is the question why are we going to use machine transplanting we could also do manual planting so why are we doing this Lee well trying to act in as a contemporary way as possible and I think uh labor supplies in Asia are declining uh everywhere as as the whole continent develops and systems to use less Labor uh evolving as we speak and one way of using less labor is still to transplant because there's benefits in transplanting but to do it mechanically now this this sort of machine was invented in in Japan how long ago 40 years ago probably 20 30 years ago at least yeah it's been these kind of things have been in use in Japan Korea maybe China but what we're seeing in recent years is that it's now moving on to into other countries in India southeast Asia and it's mainly because of Labor shortage and it's actually a business opportunity not just for the company selling the machines but also for small farmers who then become uh small entrepreneurs to providing this as a service as a planting service to other farmers and even for seedling Growers you because you need to have uh seedlings grown in a in a precise manner you can see this here if you can zoom in I don't know if you guys can do this yeah so you need these nice uh ceiling mats here though you can see how uniform the ceilings are and it's of course it requires a special way of growing them so that you can pull them off in this muds and cut them into nice stps which you can then feed into this machine yeah and this is actually a new business yeah even for women we see this in some places in in Southern India I've seen it so women becoming seedling Growers selling the seedlings then to a machine operator or service provider so what we're basically trying to do this year here is a labor saving cost efficient precise crop establishment technology that is as close as it gets and maybe even better than manual transplanting right but but wait a minute last year we were talking about exactly the same things and off we went up to just over our knees in mud broadcasting so what's changed why why why this sudden change of heart well because I think uh we we will get u a more precise crop establishment with this as a safer technology to start was under our conditions here with that kind of heavy and soft so and we may still try something else the next Dr is more dry direct [Applause] to see if you're a hand seating would want G some f right that's right that's right should have been using a carabell drawn mechanical transplanter just give us some more give us some more grain to [Applause] eat yeah we're nearly finished and um by and large I would say it works but it is actually quite hard work uh to walk even behind this machine because anytime you hit a a deep uh muddy spot you have to make sure that the wheels don't spin off and we've had a number of uh patches there with standing water where basically it's so mdy that the ceedings because they're so small disappear you so but uh here is a place where uh looks quite okay so you can see pretty good spacing and ceilings uh that hopefully uh will recover and go quickly uh but uh it has taken us a while and the Machine is uh the engine died a couple of times on the way the planting mechanism got stuck once in a while so it requires some skill I would say of course um a trained operator a professional would have done this much faster and probably better than we did but uh well we got it planted now let's see how it goes so",
