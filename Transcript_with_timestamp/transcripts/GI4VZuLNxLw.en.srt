hi my name is michael robinson i'm a

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,879
research associate at the institute for

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,480
sustainable food systems at kpu

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,320
i'm here today to share a little bit

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,759
about our hog research project

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,679
specifically to take you through the

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,760
process of moving the hogs into a new

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:20,000
rotational grazing plot

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,840
so as you can see here we begin by

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,519
unhooking the fence from the back edge

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,920
of the previous grazing plot

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,680
and moving it up into its new position

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,320
this allows the hogs to move into their

14
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,679
new plot

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,519
they're pretty well trained by this

16
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,719
point and with little hesitation they

17
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:45,840
move into their stand to

18
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:45,840
field b's notes

19
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,840
feed

20
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,519
well not always necessary we like to

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:13,840
ensure the hogs stay in their new plot

22
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:13,840
with a little extra feed

23
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,640
next we move their shelter into the plot

24
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,240
these are a mobile shelter designed to

25
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,479
be moved by one or two people

26
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:41,840
and to comfortably house both hogs in

27
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:41,840
each plot

28
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,200
well the hogs are distracted with the

29
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,760
food we move the back fence up

30
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,920
and close them fully into the new plot

31
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,680
the last thing that needs done is moving

32
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:23,840
and setting back up the barrel water

33
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:23,840
system we use for these hogs

34
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,440
this move took us all of three minutes

35
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,000
we think that rotational grazing systems

36
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,680
like this

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,360
really represent a great option for

38
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,519
raising hog on pasture

39
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,680
it's low labor and the materials needed

40
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,000
are quite affordable

41
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,879
all right finally we wanted to say

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,879
thanks for watching

43
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,239
we hope something in the system people

44
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,239
find useful

45
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,680
stay tuned for more videos demonstrating

46
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:19,840
some of our infrastructure

47
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:19,840
day before move prep and more

48
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,400
you
