  "text": "in this video JC talks to us about house soil health and changing his crop rotations and introducing animals has actually made money for JC also talks about infiltration rates which he frequently measures on his pot the procedure JC uses is to take a six inch ring hammer it into the ground and then measure the time it takes for one inch of water to infiltrate and even if you break even on your small grain when you look at the the yield bump you get on your core and your soybean crop after that and and also if your grazing after your small grain your profitability goes up even though you broke even the one year you still make more than you would have in the two year rotation so basically here we're in a corn soybean oat rotation I used to do Rai but the profits kind of come out of Rai in the last few years now the reason that I pick oats is we raise it as a seed crop and then we we started a seed cleaning operation now to where we actually have an air screen and a gravity table and we clean it and sell it as a clean product and so oh it's works good for us we what I really like about the three-year rotation is that since we brought in this third crop our corn yields have gone corn soybean yields have gone up significantly within a three-year span my my soybean yields probably went up three to five bushel an acre across the fire may average and corn ten to twelve I would have to say that's maybe be and I mean that's right in there and that's pretty they've been pretty consistent our infiltration rates have increased and when you raise that oats it also gives you a chance to diversify your modes of action your herbicides so the idea is to try and kind of cut down sand-like waterhemp particularly what I really like about oats is now we have an opportunity to cover crop in it you know the Jim and I are putting up fences and this way we can bring livestock back into the system is just another factor which is gonna drive that soil health you know I know I had gone to some other workshops the past they talked about that our soil doesn't have enough microbes in it and then the best way to bring them back is to bring animals back on back into the rotation but it adds a level of profitability so here you're you're raising a third crop that helps increase all the yields on all three then you turn around put a cover crop in it drive soil health and you can graze animals on it then you know build a level of productivity back into that and it kind of works at all in those basically systems approach is what it is cover crops that I like best I guess for us is would be putting like a riot and a rapeseed mix in after the oh it's no tilling beans and a rye is just it's just you can't believe the difference between that and just going in this straight for itself [Music] you",
