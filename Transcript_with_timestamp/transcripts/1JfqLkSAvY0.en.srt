00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:23,710
watering your garden is one of the most

3
00:00:20,619 --> 00:00:25,599
basic tasks for a school gardener it can

4
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:30,189
also be one of the most complicated and

5
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:32,320
time-consuming tasks as well drip

6
00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:34,239
irrigation is a great watering system

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,790
because it is more water efficient and

8
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,589
time efficient than hand watering we

9
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:40,390
talked to Sean from the governor's

10
00:00:38,589 --> 00:00:41,829
Island teaching garden to learn more

11
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:48,820
about how to install a drip irrigation

12
00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:50,920
system all right so the drip irrigation

13
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:53,620
system is it's pretty simple it has

14
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:57,579
about five different parts to it and

15
00:00:53,620 --> 00:01:01,269
together what they'll do is allow you to

16
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:04,269
irrigate your garden without having n

17
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:06,369
water you'll save your time healthier

18
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:09,160
for your plants

19
00:01:06,369 --> 00:01:11,500
it'll make you the envy of the school

20
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,960
gardening community this kit that we

21
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:18,840
have here a very simple one and it just

22
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:23,229
has five parts to it there's a filter

23
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:28,479
there's a pressure regulator there's an

24
00:01:23,229 --> 00:01:32,410
adapter there's a mainline and then

25
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:34,720
there's the drip tape the first part of

26
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:37,840
your drip irrigation system is your

27
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:42,030
filter the filter either attaches to a

28
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:46,000
garden hose or it attaches to a spigot

29
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,709
the water coming out of your hose or out

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,899
of your spigot probably has a little bit

31
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:52,060
of sediment in it so what the filter

32
00:01:49,899 --> 00:01:55,770
does is it catches that fit that

33
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:58,930
sediment has a little filter in there

34
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:01,810
and it prevents it from going further

35
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:04,720
down the system if that sediment

36
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:07,930
continues into the drip irrigation it

37
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:10,360
could block the emitters the next part

38
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:16,050
of our drip irrigation kit is a pressure

39
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:19,330
regulator it attaches to the filter and

40
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,770
what the pressure regulator does is it

41
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:22,900
ensures that there's not too much

42
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:26,110
pressure in the rest of the drip

43
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:30,550
irrigation system the next part of our

44
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:34,390
system is the adapter it attaches to the

45
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:37,060
pressure regulator it allows the

46
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:39,640
pressure regulator in the filter to

47
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,980
attach to the mainline attaching the

48
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:45,819
adapter to the mainline it's pretty

49
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:49,409
simple you just unscrew it

50
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:49,409
press the main line and

51
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,969
[Music]

52
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:57,439
spirit back on what that does is make

53
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:59,650
sure it's on they really tell you the

54
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:02,209
next part of our system is the main line

55
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:04,040
the main line doesn't have any emitters

56
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:08,629
on it so the main line doesn't release

57
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:10,640
any water it brings it to the garden bed

58
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:13,760
that you want to water in a way you

59
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:18,049
could think of it as kind of a hose

60
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:21,049
the main line attaches to the drip tape

61
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:23,659
and the drip tape has emitters on it

62
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:27,349
this style of drip tape has emitters

63
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:29,750
every 12 inches but but you can buy drip

64
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:33,079
tape with emitters every six inches or

65
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:39,379
every 18 inches attaching the drip tape

66
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:40,970
to the mainline is very simple each kit

67
00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:44,090
has a different way of doing it but the

68
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:47,650
kit we're using today it involves two

69
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:50,480
steps first you want to punch a hole in

70
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:55,819
the main line so I have this funny

71
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:59,239
little tool what I do is I just press it

72
00:03:55,819 --> 00:04:00,799
into the main line make a hole you want

73
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,959
to be careful that you don't press so

74
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:07,010
hard that you punch a hole through the

75
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:11,590
other side all right then you take this

76
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:17,139
funny-looking connector piece

77
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:23,950
and you insert it into the hole alright

78
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:29,160
and then you take your drip tape and you

79
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:35,050
attach it into the funny connector piece

80
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:41,130
close it up that's on there tight

81
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:45,190
not going anywhere and what that does is

82
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:47,470
water will come through the mainline go

83
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:50,500
through this connector piece into the

84
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:53,110
drip tape and then the drip tape has

85
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:56,110
emitters every six or twelve or eighteen

86
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:58,479
inches and that water then will drip

87
00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:02,100
into your garden at the end of each

88
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:05,800
piece of drip line you're gonna want to

89
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:07,180
close off the end so different systems

90
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:11,020
have different ways of doing that some

91
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:13,720
systems will have you fold the end down

92
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:18,030
and put a rubber band over it the system

93
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:21,850
we're using today has you taken in piece

94
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:25,240
just fit it into the end there and then

95
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:27,479
you lock it shut you're also going to

96
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:31,780
want to close off the end of your

97
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:35,280
mainline so you take another a different

98
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:35,280
type of in piece with this kit

99
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:46,000
press it in you mock it and then this

100
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:53,370
kid actually has a cap that goes on the

101
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:56,500
end now your system is totally closed

102
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:58,960
it's easy to adapt this setup if you

103
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,970
need to have multiple main lines for

104
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,380
example if you have garden beds on

105
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:04,380
different sides of the spigot

106
00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:19,560
what you do is after the pressure

107
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:22,810
regulator you can add a splitter piece

108
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:25,800
the splitter piece screws in to the

109
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,800
pressure regulator

110
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:32,740
once your splitter is screwed in you can

111
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:35,500
then add two different mainline pieces

112
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:38,110
you attach the first and the second

113
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:45,610
mainline pieces with the adapters in the

114
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:48,129
kit you can direct your main lines

115
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:53,199
around your burden and build out your

116
00:06:48,129 --> 00:06:56,229
system from there you can use a tee

117
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:59,139
piece or an elbow piece to guide your

118
00:06:56,229 --> 00:07:02,800
mainline throughout your garden for

119
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:04,479
example if you have sharp corners or if

120
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:11,860
you want to irrigate multiple

121
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:16,839
consecutive garden beds drip tape can be

122
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:22,270
installed in rows or drilled in to the

123
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:25,029
side of your garden bed your drip tape

124
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:28,409
can be placed in a circle around the

125
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:28,409
plants in your garden bed

126
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:34,759
look online or at your nearest garden

127
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,970
supply store to research the best drip

128
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:49,160
irrigation kit for your garden
