  "text": "[Music] oh all right welcome back richie aldo are you there yes how are you i'm doing well how are you all right looking good in summary there he is with his chickens all right well um for those who've been attending thus far you don't need any introduction um we have you know laid out a series of presentations where you're going to start with the the deeper framing of you know colonization and indigenousness and work us through our own process and then towards cultural um engagement more deeply with those insights so um i think it's the stage is yours so we'll let you uh take it away welcome everyone we're gonna go through a high level continuation of the previous conversation on decolonization of science process methodology and management within the context of regenerative agriculture thinking and to be clear there is a lot in the previous two presentations that uh is is um critical in order to understand the the points that we're going to go through today now the there will be a lot of questions i am assuming because of when when we address these kinds of large-scale issues and conceptual uh frameworks there is a lot of detail that needs to be worked out so a lot of that detail has been also um addressed in previous presentations not all of it this you know business of systems change is quite extensive and complex uh so today we're going to focus on just thinking through the mindsets the processes that we use to in the methodology that defines how we manage our our presence as as organisms of the earth within the ecosystems that we inhabit and so on and so you will find that we will be addressing yeah you know specific issues as to property plant and equipment management when do we bring equipment um to what end uh when does nature needs us to do those things and how are we approaching this from a conquering colonizing extraction perspective or are we seeing it from a you know perspective where we are part of the system that we are working with instead so to that end there are certain key outcomes that we need to be familiar with and in this case when we look at you know um regenerative agriculture there are some some things that we assume uh to be regenerative when they are not they are neces they are not necessarily part of a regenerative framework they are just simply part of our colonized uh ways of being which is it comes natural in to us and it's also more of the mmo that we all are accustomed to and trained into and domesticated into so in this case when we look at the acceptances perpetration of extractive and exploitative practices i mean think of organic farming for example is not conventional completely but it's still conventional it's still about row crops about confining animals and so on it's still about extracting volume and exploiting uh the space and all of that i'm not saying it's good or bad simply i'm saying those are facts those are indicators that we are still using a colonizing uh process in when we design and engineer agronomical processes and economics and management and so on community social and economic independence is compromised when we operate as individual farms our whole community and social infrastructure and our interdependence with other species and also with other farms is compromised and there is a tremendous challenge in trying to work with farmers within collective systems most farmers are are really radically individualistic and so that is a colonized way of thinking as well is the result of a colonizing culture that we act that way the legitimization and legalization of violence against anything that is counted to the system so when we talk about ancestral traditions and knowledge and culture and food sovereignty and it's it's most of the time relegated to those who are suffering minorities and so on and so forth because they are the ones who are in trouble the rest is somehow okay well no it isn't we are not okay as a society uh so this legitimization of violence uh also somehow we use it to legitimize our attitudes when it comes down to talking about uh food sovereignty justice injustice and um and diversity and so on the legalization of abuse of government sponsored corporate takeovers and market manipulation this is this is like day-to-day stuff we're looking at government sponsoring corporations to take over whole countries food systems uh or whole regions or or industry sectors and then those corporations you know manipulate their way into into creating artificial markets but then make it infinitely impossible for real farmers to succeed so really important because that is at this core of colonizing structures that we have been building for a long time that also results in the concentration of ownership and control of whole systems i mean we are no longer looking at farms we're looking at the whole system from who owns the brands all the way through who owns the capital who owns the infrastructure that produces that capital and also the concentration of ownership and control on those elements of the system that make money versus the the offloading of all of the risky aspects of the system to unsuspecting farmers workers and so on that's a really important indicator of a colonized culture that is actually getting us to this brink of um you know global collapse the systematization of vibration of indigenous knowledge and science i mean we tend to always want to um verify so is it scientifically proven right so say we are doing poultry with with the foundational indigenous knowledge that we inherited and we're putting poultry back into their natural environment where they evolved over millions of years and yeah that's indigenous knowledge and that's in digital science and it is proven and tested to be more effective and to be superbly effective and efficient yet it has to be somehow tested and verified by the conventional community of science scientist community in order for for it to be real yet it's more real than the recent inventions of of colonizing science and management uh so we don't we don't require that say monsanto monsanto scientifically you know or bayer in this case scientifically demonstrates that their chemicals will not harm and instead enhance the ecosystems if used yet we demand and we don't accept indigenous knowledge which is proven and tested for hundreds of thousands of years to enhance the environment and to feed people so very important uh you know uh systems of repression that we have built into our narrative and then our management systems now at the end what this results in the uprooting of spiritually grounding traditions individually raising to the bottom consumerism climate disruption ecological collapse war conflict disease and social breakdown i mean if you are not seeing those indicators scream at us from everywhere in every corner of the earth right now um then we are in the wrong room now there are some also some key outcome indicators of a decolonized regenerative bipolar system and we'll look into a few things that uh hopefully shifts your paradigm in a second here but one of them is that natural resources are managed in perpetuity not expected for short-term gains and it also happens that managing ecosystems in perpetuity is at the end more conducive to regular to generating wealth than the extraction short-term uh gains that we can achieve through exploited colonizing systems now the difference is that when natural resources are managing probability a corporation can't just come and extract all the value from an ecosystem walk away and leave their locals to to pay in the communities at large to pay for the consequences of the extraction of that value now they may only be extracting five percent of what we could extract in perpetuity but they do it right away and they are very efficient at it and that somehow is validated more above the more wealth creation and the more well-being that we can generate if we manage resources in perpetuity under a decolonized process of management the social and economic independence is supported as a foundation of success if that is the truth then you know you are not in a completely colonized uh setting ancestral traditions knowledge wisdom are validated to ensure collective mental physical and spiritual well-being this is central to indigenous ways of farming and living community building governance ownership control governance organizing and production infrastructure reflect community needs a priority for collective wealth creation distribution it is not about someone making a profit it's about everyone being collectively wealthier and that at the end of the day generates a much better quality of life when resources are distributed on the basis of how they their governance infrastructure is built then the management of all of that wealth is also done differently and because of that more people benefit and there is more um you know less conflict less war less of volca these kinds of things that we have seen under the colonizing systems we did today now all supply chains from land to fork are collectively controlled in government you don't have a single company owning the whole supply chain and dumping all of the high risk assets onto farmers such as the uh as a land and property plant and equipment in this case um defending protecting enhancing collective interest is structured within the system level governance structures at all levels at this point we're talking about indigenous governance systems that have survived in the case of guatemala over 500 years of colonization and are still defending in protecting and enhancing the interests of the communities that are within those territories so that is because though we still have some of those incredibly structurally sound and also resilient uh governing structures from ancestral traditions uh the current governing systems have have paired up completely with the extractive system that is destroying the very foundation of what they are governing so when you focus on this um kind of outcomes you will recognize a regenerative system when you see it the verifiers are simple spiritual introductions are uplifted um i'm sorry that i i got this whole thing in a in the wrong order so just stick with me ownership control and governance are called a collective affair okay you don't have a board of directors of a nonprofit or a corporation that is actually or even a country's government that is actually in control of the whole system it is a collective affair if if you see that then the system is regenerative if not it isn't meeting basic food needs of communities and regions is the priority not the production of cocoa for export or coffee for export or corn and soybeans or it's not about the practices on the land i mean that is part of it of course but it's regenerative outcomes can be verified are verified from a whole different angle when you look at it from a decolonized perspective the environment is protected locally and globally but why because if you pollute the mississippi river out up all the way up north in the at thai scale itasca park for example that pollution is going to go down the mississippi all the way to new orleans all the way to the gulf of mexico and then from there spread across the globe so the whole issue of environmental management ecological management it isn't it it's a global priority it's a global management plan and then verified yes locally resilience non-profits and extraction is a central system level goal but why why not profit because we don't really need to make profits to hit the world they the communities have fed themselves for centuries thousands of years by exchanging the value of the different things that they they generate and yes exchanging value is the term so but not profits necessarily a profit is a term that is is completely connected to extracting something out of something else owned by someone else normally that's the case so social rule central and accountability interdependent and interdependency well this is where the accountability then moves it moves us into the um the um the objectives of the of the system so governance for example is the result of accountability who owns and controls that's a result of accountability and and and so on you know health focuses on well-being rather than the management of disease now think about the the whole thing we have right now with uh diet related diseases in the united states and i can remember we're like 10 years that i heard that it was over 400 billion dollars um cost to the society now why why would you really manage a disease that shouldn't exist in the first place right and again the the health of a community is not it's not measured by the absence of disease but but the ability of the organisms in that community to resist and bound back from disease that is called well-being and that is a foundational principle of health management not managing diseases which is where we focus the colonial the colonizing processes no wealth is built and shared not extracted delivering nutrition is not simply food or fill it's the top system priority so delivering nutrition is the top system priority notice it's not about food it's about nutrition this system simply is or isn't regenerative certifications or outside control schemes are unnecessary and they are also irrelevant for a system to be regenerative if it is then it's regenerating if it isn't it isn't regenerating it doesn't matter if anybody has certified it labeled it uh built a brand around it put all these claims on it that doesn't matter it's either we tell the court is not simple as that the focus is also on the system level indicators outcomes as products form a farm or fund practices are simply not regenerative on their own because only systems can regenerate that is a fundamental mistake we're making today on how we are approaching this aspect of regenerative thinking because we are still using colonizing practices management science and methodology to enter this space and instead of enhancing the ability and preparing ourselves in our own approaches to optimize the incredible magnificent uh benefits of regenerative ways we are instead colonizing this space appropriating it labeling it naming it and then building infrastructure to protect whatever it is that we think it is rather than just allowing it to be the generator so understanding decolonization you know this is really critical because i just what i just said results out of a mental process that we are indoctrinated into and domesticated into so the first step here is the discovery you know you heard this before right it's a new land there's new people there's a new concept there's a new story this new discovery then is named then after his name is legally appropriated and expropriated from those who have preserved it in this case the whole idea of how we regenerate ecosystems uh held together for all you know despite the incredible forces of colonization and depression killed by native communities who are still practicing indigenous ways across the world uh according to the u.n over 80 percent of the biodiversity on the planet is held under indigenous communities of native communities why because they have always operated on on mostly decolonized processes and so this legal exploitation is happening to that concept of regenerative thinking right now as well um the standardization and scale depression ownership and control systems think about what we are doing by what we did to organic by bringing it under a government institution now corporations can decide what organization is and then to a great extent and because of that we have still animals in confinement and and we still got corn and soybeans and row crops and tilling and you know you know release of co2 into the air and an organic matter into the water systems and excess fertilizers and inputs uh organic or not they they still destroy the balance of life on the ecosystem so this is important to understand as we think about what the difference is between you know conventional regenerative and organic and all this other uh terminology that is thrown around all over the place now build systems the the the process of pronunciation you know optimizes that the last piece which is the what i call the colonization of the mind where with the systems to repress indigenous thinking and attempts and indigenizing ways of living and intellect are actually consolidated with the purpose of invalidating you know in fact scientifically invalidating or co-opting indigenous knowledge the subsidization the subsidizing of pseudo solutions such as you know genetically engineered crops and things like that are the cost of real and permanent well-being and progress so to understand decolonization then you got to revert that process in your head you know we need to go back and rediscover aboriginal systems and and so on ideas concepts stories names of places in in start reversing that in in our heads but also in the day-to-day practices we need to rename these things we reclaim and we insecure so if we're going to name something a way of uh doing things uh such as legendary let's not define it but rather let's just rename it it's indigenous agriculture actually indigenous not from the perspective of people who are native to minnesota or or to my my native country in guatemala but rather are indigenous to the earth right this is a way of farming of thinking of managing our relationship as beings of the earth in you know as as beings of the earth that depend on all life on earth and so as we become more indigenous with our own nature then we can i absorb this concept and we can start you know uh either even naming it we may name it a hundred or a thousand different ways as long as the concept the idea the story the length all of those things the rituals and traditions are actually uh representative of a way of thinking that grounds us back with the original geo evolutionary processes of the earth and the magnificent design that we were delivered for the transformation of energy from non-edible into edible forms through biophysical and chemical processes that have existed forever and that are more than tested to deliver sufficient food for all of us so rebuild community governance and protection systems we're going to address this and the last uh of this series uh indigenizing governance we we have been you know bringing this back as a process of of um of um systematizing decolonization processes where governance and the re-indigenization of it the holistic governing systems and so on are our central standardizing processes to reclaim and return aboriginal systems to their original purpose the purpose of a system and food from an indigenous perspective is really to support the holistic thinking appreciation and enjoyment of life design and engineering to ensure the full expression of all living organisms is materialized now it just happens that all of that is already going on we don't have to be engineering a lot of the stuff that we are engineering all we need to is understand how it was already engineered and by nature itself and ensure that every organism you know expresses itself in the fullest potential that he was giving through the geo evolutionary processes and what it means is simply you know accepting that a corn plant may not produce 400 bushels of corn per acre if uh managed in a more holistic way and that is not a measure of inefficiency or it's not an indicator of inefficiency for efficiency in agriculture in the in in under a decolonized process is measured not on the output of product and pounds and stuff but rather the throughput and the transformation ranges of energy within a system and so this is um this is an area where we're going to have to expand a lot more in the you know and if we expand it a little bit more on the previous presentation and watch that that part of energy management and stewardship as a foundation of our relationship to food rather than producing things so expand and organize new systems so we need to scale up organizing across communities locally regionally and nationally we need to build aggregation of representation from local localized governing councils all the way across the board until we reach the national levels of building you know a rejected congress agriculture congress or something like that that is actually growing up from the the communities that are embracing degenerative ways so basically regenerative thinking is a radical um is a it's a radical perspective it's a nature-based foundation it is subversive uh it's it's it happens when we become intellectually insurgent so what we need is an intellectual insurgency so that we can flip the paradigms on which we operate and build the systems with the integrity and commitment when you think as an insurgent then that integrity and that commitment becomes the thing that drives you forward we need that level of passion but an insurgent is characterized by in order to actually achieve this decolonization goal the beauty of it is that this the regenerative is an evolutionary process because it ignites engagement at scale there is no better time in the history of human beings where we need disengagement at scale under structures and organizational processes that allows us permanence i'm not talking about a scale as in protesting and then going home but rather scale as in as in liberating the the consumer from conventional products the land from conventional practices asked from bank debt of the farm and on and on adults um evolutionary we can adapt we are agile we are resilient when you when you operate under a regenerative framework this characteristics are the uh part of the um what defines what you do this is how we arrive at this uncompromising destination called together so no longer think of regenerative agriculture as no-till or soil health or or rotational crops or those are practices that they are important they are critical in transitioning towards regenerative they are i mean they are all good they are not the destination though a regenerative destination is way way way beyond that now here's a quick view for one one process that we have followed in terms of how we approach poultry from this indigenously colonized way of seeing and working with these systems you know first of all we saw the the landscape uh from the perspective of the chicken a landscape the chicken wants shade it wants canopy he wants to be protected from the sun aerial predators it's wants to have a sheltered or a protected area to sleep on normally they will do it on trees blah blah blah it's a long story but that's the way we started the process of engineering rather than um thinking of from homo centric perspective what would we how can we grow and produce chickens rather than thinking it that way we said what would make the chicken express its maximum potential as an organism and that's how we ended up with our current design and our current design really goes back to the foundational currency of farming which is carbon the the process of managing that so that we can achieve efficiency efficiency not in necessarily the measured in productivity or or pounds of chicken per acre or for building but rather transformation of energy and so when we think of it that way we also achieve the outcomes we want the pounds and all that and exceed the expectations but when we focus on the pounds as a beginning point then we go quickly into heat conversion rates and we get locked into that five percent of possibilities for innovation and we ignore the other 95 percent that could come from a decolonized point of view they're naturally occurring energy transformation systems is really the foundational production engineering management sciences uh in regional economics uh think about agronomics in the political system we are deploying now uh you won't find a lot of that traditional you know linear recipe-like uh process rather what you have is a lot of indicators observations and knowledge and wisdom building formulas so that we can actually interpret what's going on so that we know whether that chicken is actually uh uh achieving that optimal state of performance as an organism and as a result you know we can have more margins lower cost less work and so on uh and then governance the integration of local regional national collective enterprises so that we can move the management systems into the structures that allows us to to govern um collectively but also achieve those scale level scale levels that gives us that competitive advantage in management and so on at that point we can use a lot of the colonized sciences because the science itself is not what's bad the the corporate structure is not necessarily what's bad it's the people and the objectives and to what end those systems and tools are used that's what is wrong today and fortunately for all of us it's a very small amount of corporate executives and folks around the world that actually dominate the colonizing system so to actually change it as long as all of us get together and start doing this they really don't mean very much they get all the money right now because we give it to them but it is just just that you as he was given can be taken away here is the process by which we structure a a multi-dimensional way of thinking about the chicken the three places where energy is transformed at a mass scale on the earth is one the photosynthetic processes of plants so that more photosynthesis for the synthetic surfaces in your farm the more effectively you are you are achieving that first level of transformation of free accessible freely accessible energy in the air and all around us four times and so on and then bringing them into that space that you are now overseeing from an energy transformation perspective the second place of transformation on mars at a mass scale is the the intestinal gut and the chewing mechanisms of animals so whether it's cows and sheep and pigs and so on so forth in this case chickens well they don't have teeth on their beaks but they do have uh gizzards which act as a chewing mechanism and so that process breaks down molecular structures that are molecularly more difficult for microbes and other organisms to break apart into it into dissolved into the the original foundational nutrients so that process in the intestinal gut and the animals chewing mechanism is the next place that on a global perspective the next level of energy transformation happens and so as that happens we get to harvest certain forms of energy such as eggs and fruits and nuts and all the things that we would take on the farm but it's not about production it's about energy expressions and so the next level of transformation happens in the soil where again microorganisms both the at the gut intestinal microflora and the organisms of the of the soil is the equivalent of the intestinal microflora in our in our our guts and so those three places is where most of the energy is transformed on planet earth in between these processes there is a magnificent assembly of millions of micro transformation processes that are that resulted from the adaptation of micro and large-scale ecosystems over geological time and governed by the laws of thermodynamics that define the biophysical and chemical processes that go into ensuring that this energy is endlessly transformed and endlessly being put into embark into feathers into eggs into vegetables into nuts and fruits and so on so forth that system never stops to the extent that that energy is freely allowed to flow and or is at least not interrupted as much as we are doing today and as long as each of the organisms in this whole system including ourselves are expressing the maximum earth given genetic potential we don't need much of the engineering that we have we have done today to colonize the world the engineering we have done is mostly for the purpose of profit and extraction of it not for the purpose of feeding the world that that if anybody doesn't have that clear yet um meditate on that um so anyway out of these processes we get to harvest energy in different expressions some of it is not immediately edible so it goes back into the process again and again and it becomes different expressions of energy you know like the manure from our chickens is taken out of the barns and then put into different agroforestry systems so we can generate grains and vegetables and there is no herbs and anything in the grocery store uh pretty much or on your table every day some of them energy comes back into the system and that is how we see energy transformation as a foundation of the efficiency in agriculture now it just happens that according to some scientific scientist partners that i work with that we estimate that no more than 30 to 40 percent of the energy that is uh um processed in this cycle needs to it's actually harvestable immediately which means that 60 to 70 percent of the energy that is captured in the cycles is put into the system for the next cycle which means we start energy rich so meaning wealthy if we understand that energy is the currency of agriculture basically what i'm saying is we don't operate on flat or linear uh equations flat surfaces or linear equations we think of the landscape as three-dimensional first starting from way down under the ground where the deepest roots can reach all the way to the top so that we can optimize the the every organism capacity to be the best it can be and to process the most energy possible if we do that right then we will add and we will automatically become connected to the fourth dimension to this space and organisms which is the spiritual aspect when we would connect on the spiritual level then we can achieve the three-dimensional view in the three-dimensional capacity to transform or support the process transformation of energy and as a result of that achieve what many are calling the triple bottom line for for the the the economic social and ecological outcomes are not in isolation they happen when we are able to see this three-dimensionality and as a result of that connect spiritually then we can achieve a triple bottom line and feed of animals the healthiest foods you could ever find so this next aspect is really about just um taking all of this from the land from the farms and building collective uh assemblies of all of these different expressions of ice so whether we are farming chickens or vegetables we are part of these affinity groups that can be layered or across the landscape to build a collective impact on the basis that those affinity groups have common goals and objectives and measuring the wealth creation um on the basis of indicators of collective well-being so in southeastern minnesota for example where we are working right now with 20 farms of which 11 are bipod community members we are measuring our collective wealth at just around 32 million dollars in property plant equipment and probably up to 20 million in intellectual uh property and uh brand value and all of that so we are right now collectively sitting on around 52 to 60 million dollars worth of collective uh wealth and what that means is that we are achieving a level of collective well-being for example when we feel depressed or when we don't have enough time to do the work on the farm such as last weekend when i needed to plant ten thousand nasal nuts there were over 15 of our partners in the region that came out and we were able to plant all of the 28 21 acres of hazelnuts in three days that's a collective well-being why because i'm not suffering mental depression or any of those other problems um individually while because i have a collective wealth that we can tap into from the uh have a little deficit like that that's a very different concept and it's very hard for traditional linear economists to understand what it means to actually operate in a circular economy thinking designing for and building at scale we're not compromising scale in any way in fact we can design systems that can deliver much larger scale than the current conventional uh system and we can change the numbers with you on that too but we don't compromise the small scale why because in this case for example these folks from uh urban community in our region came to the farm bought the chickens at eight dollars uh and then processed them because we have equipment that they can use we took all of the byproducts put it back into the layering composting systems that we use we are able to utilize 100 of the chicken but more importantly these families who have traditionally uh use the whole chicken they understand that the value of the chicken isn't in the breast it's actually in the thigh the dark meat and especially the medicinal value is in the giblets so the heart delivered the gizzard all of those parts that i discarded that's where most of the value for some of us is this way they were able to walk away with about 30 worth of value for each chicken they purchased at eight and which would have sold you know if they had buy that chicken in the market they would have gotten not only uh not only would they have had to pay about 22 22 for that chicken but they would have gotten about 30 to 35 percent less volume in terms of nutritional quality so this way we can actually deliver food that is so inexpensive keep in mind inexpensive naturally is the most most expensive food in terms of nutritional value delivered at the least expensive cash value at eight dollars in general terms this is cheaper um or less expensive to a family in the inner city than taizen chicken that is going to make them sick or that or other kinds of chicken that is actually loaded with antibiotics in in in pharmaceuticals of all kinds and also loaded with exploitation of people and pollution of the water systems and so on and so forth so whichever brand is coming out of conventional systems out there is never going to be able to deliver the kind of nutrition that we can deliver this way at the cost that we can deliver now this is a whole different aspect of food access thinking from a decolonized perspective and yes people have to do their part these families came to the farm if they're not willing to do that i don't know how an inner city family is ever going to expect that high quality nutritious food is going to be delivered to them at a um affordable price uh without having to go back and recreate systems of subsidies and all of that and remove the dignity that comes with regenerative being so the next layer beyond the farm is mobile movements we have one of these in in pinewood reservation in partnership with my coaching agricultural systems they can process up to two thousand chickens in a day on one of these units and the next step again layering the scalability of things uh we bought a processing facility in staceyville iowa collectively between all of us in the region last year and now is deployed to process up to one million chickens and then the next layer we partnered with the state of minnesota and the city of alderley to deploy a regionally branded regenerative agricultural development park where we can do up to 10 million chickens and at least 500 million eggs and about 14 other products that are um generated as part of the poultry system we've also built a brand it's called chilean chicken and now we are deploying two inch farms this is a collectively owned and managed company but this also integrates all everything from grain production grain processing grain sprouting poultry production multi-processing all the way to the distribution at the end what you really have is fully integrated systems rather than farms or products and it's at this level that this system becomes regenerative the product that comes out of this of the system then can be regenerative but a single product through a linear supply chain it simply doesn't does the knot up from a horizontal perspective so as you go think of this fundamental elements of decolonizing all of these processes management science and systems that we have put together if you're a farmer farm but be a producer no more be a steward of energy transformation engage money if you're in the financial sector that be an extractor of wealth no more be a partner and allied in building collective wealth if you work for justice and equality be a savior no more be an insurgent in your own colonized world and change from within buy food but be a consumer no more be a steward of your body your mind and your spirit and we all be better off because of it we have gone through 45 minutes and i don't even know if anybody's listening so let's check i've been listening with great attention i i continue to think you're brilliant um and um i i'm i'm i'm hoping people feel sufficiently um yeah there's a few comments coming into the chat yes people are expressing positive positive responses i was just trying to think about how to how to say this um the bar that you hold is is so high that um i think we all can hopefully see where we can do better um i think a lot of times when you hear presentations or or concepts and people want to feel like they're part of the in-group um there's this sort of okay now i'm good enough i'm one of these people i'm superior i've i've i've arrived but it's it's so it's so um it's so comprehensive and so and so um revolutionary um i just i really really appreciate your the the place it comes from and the um yeah the call the call the call to rise to that to that level um so yeah um i'm i'm happy to engage engage questions we i mean 45 minutes of conversation um is probably better if people are up for it so um i can start with a couple other things that have been posted here but um anybody who's would like to engage with questions please put them in the q a um so roger asked uh what are examples of success the maori in new zealand that was about 25 minutes ago i think you certainly expressed quite profoundly what you're doing with the you know chickens in the midwest it's really impressive um did you say how many pounds that eight dollar chicken was if you did no but it was all of our chickens weighed between 3.75 and 4.25 pounds and and in this case that specific picture was taken out of dress chickens that were four point closer to 4.5 because they included giblets and all of the actual edible parts rather than just the carcass so those are four and a half plus pound packages and they're certified organic or certifiably organic now we are certifying because a client is willing to pay the premium for certification but we have always been certifiable all of our protocols meet the certification we always make sure of that and then we certify when when consumers actually care about that but the point i want to make is that you are able to economically produce certified organic chicken at two dollars a pound i mean for any business for a while that's ridiculous not to be called somewhere in there i mean we're not we are because we have we internalize all of the costs we're not we're not dumping any cost on anyone so i couldn't give you this specific number because right now we are 30 percent higher higher grain values um so the the price just significantly changed this uh spring but yeah i mean if you talk about afford affordably affordably producing chicken that is free of confinement free of antibiotics free of everything we don't want and full of everything we want uh we are probably your most competitive chicken out anywhere the picture behind you is i mean exactly what i saw when i went to your house that's what it looks like they're not in houses they're not you know i mean they're not confined except by a fence that's something of an acre and a half it's it's really quite inspiring um and i i don't know if people have grocked that but i i i certainly as someone who's been raising chickens for i don't know 35 years or something um you really i feel like i have yeah and and think keep in mind that our our methodology and our management process is is is grounded on some very simple principles like for example when we design something we always ask everybody to think about it from a perspective of being allergic to work yeah so if you have to work find a way not to that's not the point we don't want to work now if we have to work on something then let's make sure that that work is done in the more in the easiest most most pleasant and more enjoyable possible way and that those are simple things that have incredibly transformed the way we actually operate our farms it's actually really enjoyable and it's not a putter because that's all you're doing because the system's in place and you're just doing a little bit here a little bit there and it's not hard we're not hauling chicken tractors across for a few chickens we our flocks are 1 500 broilers per flock and those chickens don't even like people because they have never had to be close to us they are as as naturally behaving as possible they got a canopy of trees that those hazelnuts produce between three and four times more hazelnuts over the chickens than on the where there is no chickens those basil nuts are also expressing their full capacity the ground i mean we had soil scientists geologists we had all these people come out and they're like kids in a candy store when they come out to evaluate the soil here so anyway that is beautiful there is no need for us to be stressed out about work or getting up at 5 a.m every day i mean i don't really like that i was i was a laborer i grew up in poverty i had to work from sun up to sundown every single day and go home still hungry and poor i don't like the idea of work so if i can avoid it believe me i'll avoid it and that probably is our greatest competitive advantage because it just happens that most of you capital on the farm goes in this case for poultry goes into feed and labor yeah um so i just going to go back to this question what are examples of success and roger asked about the maori in new zealand i don't know if in this presentation you have you've referred to it um and because i've talked to you in the past i i think i know what you're saying but i mean you in today you also talked about the the you know the culture in guatemala where you grew up and how that is still operating along these principles and you referenced i'm not sure who it was some international agency that said 80 of biodiversity on the planet is um on land where the people living there are still indigenous in their mindset so i mean there's examples of this globally but are there things you want to say specifically about your experience in guatemala or other things other models where people can see or understand where this sort of ultimate paradigm is is is dominant yeah i know for example we have um era and iota those two they're not girlfriends they're actually two hurricanes that hit guatemala honduras and el salvador last uh the end of last year in october now it happens that some of the communities we work with are so remote and there are so many rivers in between and all the bridges were taken out uh so those communities actually reported having having just they protected the chickens and they fed the chickens because that was their source of at least one egg a day for every person for a few months while the roads reopen and all that and it was something that they they they could feed them herbs they could harvest the forest they could do so many other things they had so many more options because of that that's a success story to us um we also just launched the regenta poultry cooperative in southeastern minnesota all led by minority mostly you know as hispanic latino um african-americans and asian uh farmers and then you know fully inclusive of a lot of the white farmers in our region of course but you know led by us only because we seem to be more connected to that indigenousness and these folks were were interested in that so they join and of course we're welcoming them too but that is another level of success why because we have succeeded not necessarily because we built a co-op and now we're gonna you know we are raising one and a million dollars and more people will have access to land and we've got more more cash flow that's not a measure of success the measure of success for us is the fact that we are able to liberate about in this case about 1 million chickens from confinement about i know calculate how much pharmaceuticals are no longer going to be part of that and we are liberating a very large network of people who would have been enslaved and meet packers in other places while having all this wealth of knowledge and capacity those are the success stories for us that's how we measure success now if we break even that's like fourth in the list it's important of course but breaking even for us is a whole different concept i i can't use a regular bep formula because it doesn't have enough lines to include all of the value we create and so as we think of success those are those are the the the indicators that we are succeeding is when people are liberated from from stationary exploitative inhuman conditions every person is a success story uh that comes out of a factory farm or a factory meat packer every farmer who instead of you know being limited and discriminated against now owns and operates a farm uh that they can market where they can regret grow driven chickens uh that's a success story every chicken that is now in the market that is not coming from a conventional system that's a success story so we have so many success stories that uh we will need a bonfire in some more time to tell you all of them but also we have built a super competitive uh system level scale solution that is also a success story but most of the time people start there that for us is the total outcome of the individual success stories that collectively aggregated uh signify a system level success you brilliant and i i would just say what is coming to my mind right now is the comment you made about you know if you're uh you know if you're a farmer don't you know harvest crops anymore be a steward of energy if you're a you know you work with money don't be a um extractor you know however you frame that i'm sorry i don't have it um integrated yet into my subconscious but i think i mean you made the point about um how we the people are actually giving our power to the corporate system you know by purchasing these products and and you know and we and we can we can give it and we can take it away i think you know from some foundational perspective the responsibility that each of us has in how we choose to engage the supply chain is the way the world has changed and you know it's it's great to have these philosophical conversations and sort of hopefully be inspired and and you know um you know insights are coming to you but but but walking the talk thereafter um you know for all of us is is uh you know i think we need to be grounding this so just to just uh just to make that point um not sure if you want to say anything about that before i go to the next question oh also how how actually easy it is now i came to this country in 1993 technically and immediately after i arrived i made contact with farmers i made contacts with grocery stores that sold organic products and all of that and i think since i lived here from since 1993 forward i have never given profits to conventional corporations in the food sector beyond basis and if they have a role maybe emergency basis and you're hungry for a rental car and i i am not malnourished i am not unhealthy i actually all i am well nourished and healthy and mentally healthy which took a long time to get to because of the consequences of the war and all that but yet i totally totally believe and i have i am proof that everything i laid out for you is not only possible it is better when you do that because you do achieve the full expression of yourself and who on this earth doesn't want to be the full expression of themselves yeah beautiful now if you don't want to that's fine dan uh don't be but i am trying to i'm just kidding your your passion and vitality is is infectious it's it's hard it's hard i'm going to proceed forward here with some questions chris says reggie i'm completely intrigued by your discussion of organizational models for creating collective value and collective impact at multiple scales where would you point us to learn more about the details of designing these types of organizations oh boy um there is actually anybody in the group is part of the food the farm forum for the future good form for the future um organized by this organization out of england because she actually just sent a whole list of resources answering that very question because i actually never cared to look around very much so i was going to maybe i should just send it to you um and then you can distribute to some of those people if you can find a link and post it in the chat then everybody i always uh it's a whole pile of them but let me um let me just um look for it while while we take all the questions okay um somebody already just put it on here shy originated farm just put to the panelists looks like oh okay so see if um if you can see the last update that the director out of england sent out uh was talking about the um the this resources uh on secular economy collective collective management and so on and they're not calling it what i call it but that doesn't matter the name doesn't matter it's the outcome all right um greg asked um well says you are going forward with tree range chickens how can we do the same in our own areas in this case southern california or can we join your collective yes no it's a very very methodically structured takeover plan literally so the way we operate is it's pretty simple you have to go to go to that link region poultry.com um get in touch with us what we'll do is instead of us taking our chicken to you we will work with you as an operating partner and then you build a system like the one we built in southeastern minnesota in your own region so those operating partners have a high level of business development and ecosystem management responsibility but we will transfer all of that to you and it will take a little bit it will be slower at the beginning it's not like just setting up chicken coops and and processors and all of that those are important but if you start from there then you just flip back into that colonizing mentality yeah so so it's critical that we that we um we talk about it offline we have a methodology a process and an organic way for building regional systems and then our goal is to build at least one regional system per state in the all of the 48 continental um um territory of the united states the 48 states so once we do that the goal is to reach at least five percent of the total eggs and burials that are consumed technically we consume about 20 chickens and 20 dozen eggs a year in this country we want us as an ecosystem as a national ecosystem of free-range farmers to capture one of the egg a dozen eggs and one of the chickens as a pivoting point to tip over and then from there actually scaled to more regenerative levels brilliant um okay dara asks uh when are prices going down for families with three four and six kids dozens of eggs a week at six dollars per dozen is out of reach premium pricing is a huge barrier that scares off support i think we talked about this with your pounds dollars per pound on the on the chicken itself but are you selling your eggs at six six dollars a dozen no that's what retailers sell them up so basically we also have a dysfunctional system that increases the cost of of the goods unnecessarily in some cases necessarily in others some farmers are are increasing the cost of their eggs and chickens because because honestly they are working too much and yeah i don't want them not to be paid for their for the work they're doing but for the most part we have found that we can we can raise a flock for example on down to 80 hours per flock when you know some of the farmers are using up to 300 hours to flock and that's not we shouldn't burden the consumer with that artificial cost that we are incurring because we are not being intelligent about how we manage our own you know labor so that's one way it's a criticism but also an encouragement to think deeper second um when you know we can produce a dozen eggs for about a dollar ninety uh organic certified in up to 2025 when it is actually very uh expensive to raise them whether it's because it's dry or because the feed went up uh or so and or we had an incident we lost chickens whatever the case may be so but at that price the egg is very affordable still now i know not everybody can access direct to from the from the farmers but because we are building these farms across the landscape the idea is that eventually people will have access directly to the farms uh so that this eggs don't have to go through their supply chain and become triple their value their their cost so that's one way to solve this the other way is to really operate collectively at such a scale that we can move that product without artificially increasing the cost out of inefficiencies in the supply chain i mean the conventional system raises the price because they want more profit so you know those those organic confinement eggs they don't have to sell at four and six dollars they're just making a killing on it now in our ecosystem collectively governed and managed you know we can be partners all the way from consumers to the farmers and we can all do better and including consumers paying only half of what they would normally be paying and still farmers having a decent living and not in an honorable way of retiring and so on so yes that that's the way to organize this but but it will take some significant intellectual insurgencies and more regional uh regional capacity like the one we're building in the bordering region of minnesota i will end wisconsin and to be consumers no more as you said to not just see yourself as someone who goes to the store but actually take responsibility for reintegrating i mean into the process and that's that's part of it is as long as you're colonized in that in that framework that's probably what's going to be your experience so that's i mean i've i got my rant about occupying the land and not everybody has to be a farmer i understand but you know i think a lot of these solutions only occur as we deepen our relationship with the environment and nature and community um we can't we shouldn't expect them to sort of come sort of magically it only comes through engagement uh bill and jay asked are the hazelnuts for chickens to roost human food or feed the chickens don't roost on the hazelnuts um we have made sure of that um by trimming the bottom branches if they start doing that they destroy the plant and the hazelnut is very happy to have the chickens under but not on top uh they do better uh the the other thing is hazelnuts are a precious product so we if we don't have to feed it to the chickens we don't uh we harvest them out of the trees and it's a product that needs to be roasted and processed so it can be food grade uh even if it's coming from the chicken paradise now the um as we scale up uh hazelnuts yes we are thinking of it as animal feed but not for the chickens see the chickens um technically they don't truly appreciate this kind of gourmet food so and we can feed them many other things on the on instead what we are doing is developing another line as we increase the production of hazelnuts and we're going to be producing a hazelnut and acorn finish finished three-range pork nice and they also provide shade i think is one of the key and protection from airborne predators right yes now the the hazelnut has evolved over millions of years probably um in its own ecosystem right so they for example the hazelnut can harvest up to 300 pounds of nitrogen per acre the root system sprawl up to 15 feet in in you know from the you know was seven and a half feet in in um radius from the trunk of the tree uh harvests about eighty percent of his of its energy within the first eight to twelve inches of soil and so it literally is an inverted umbrella to capture especially baltimore and so it's it's uh phenotypical characteristics also evolved to attract birds to their trunks so that they can attract the manure and so just similar to aronia attracting the buffalo and the deer to the wallows in the in the great plains so that they could thrive same thing the hazelnut did the same thing and he became extremely smart at doing this and so the chicken naturally recognizes this the hazelnut recognizes it and then they come become a community there and they become you know so they feed on each other so the hazelnut produces a very thick canopy no hawk can see through that and also it sprawls over you know in an umbrella like because that's what the chicken needs in order to conglomerate in there and then guess what i'm scared chicken because a hawk is going on over is what they do right after they run over and stop they poop so this is not coincidental this is all magnificently designed and so all we are doing is reading it learning from it developing our our indigenous intellect by using this innate intelligence we were given at birth and as a result of that we see all of that 95 percent of innovations that we can bring about because we are not here to colonize the space when you colonize you operate on five percent of your capacity when you decolonize you access the other 95 percent not only of the landscape capacity but of your own capacity in your brain capacity your physical capacity it's just magnificent that is the story of the aston martin and the chicken wonderful and i just want to bring up i mean as when i walked around your farm and saw what was going on it wasn't just hazelnuts you had you know comfrey and other things that were also critical ingredients in the in the paddock so i mean i'm not sure if you want to share any of those specific details for people but one of the other things that was also interesting to me was you said certain plants don't like chickens underneath them like apples and peaches that was nothing i'd never known before i you know growing up we had the chickens in chicken tractors in the orchard or in paddocks in the orchard underneath fruit trees and you said that's really is counterproductive so any any moment of insight on that topic which i don't know think of it this way every organism has a blueprint that is seeking to accomplish so whether it's or a nutritional blueprint or in the case of northern climate for example deciduous trees drop their leaves that's a blueprint they are embedded with and they need certain conditions in the environment to achieve those those steps in their process of living so apples for example the the that whole family or the whole species or what you call genus requires an amount of cold hours the plant has to accumulate a certain number of cold hours in the root system especially in order to set fruit to hold it to develop it and to reproduce and so what happens is with the broilers the broilers conglomerate under the trees because that's where the shade is and that's what they get protection from the predators right now the other thing that happens as a result of that is that they lay on the ground and because they don't sweat uh they the way they cool off is by sprawling and releasing the heat to the cool ground under the shade which is around 70 72 74 degrees on an oval basis now if their temperature out there is say 90 degrees and the temperature of the um the chicken body is 98 degrees the temperature of the soil is 70 or 72 within the next two three days and then forward from there the ground level temperature below the chicken breast when they're laying there is going to rise upwards of 86 degrees and that's beyond what the apple in this case needs in order to cold on and accumulate it it's called ours and so i mean i learned about cold hours in agriculture school and so when somebody told me in guatemala right when somebody told me here that it was the chicken minor that was causing the problem i said i don't think so because there isn't enough defecation in there to actually affect the tree in any case it would benefit it oh no because it heats up well i took the temperature readings and no it was not heating it up but it did heat up when the chickens were laying under so once we isolated that factor that's when we learned yeah certain trees uh certain fruit trees that we cut those requirements they will not do well so knowing the phenotypical and the genotypical characteristics and the environmental requirements of a species is central so that you can reconcile the behavior of animals and this is the black applicable not just to the broilers but also to sheep and cows and and all kinds of other livestock it's called indigenous intellect for a reason and so the next step for us was to test egg layers because egg layers don't sit around and so the apple trees took off again that is the story of the chicken the broiler and the apple tree and that applies to a pear tree and a cherry tree and a peach tree possibly i didn't try them on the pears but i know that if they require the same which i think they do yeah then yes okay yes and even even wild plums had the same exact response yeah i think that's very interesting and it's not the kind of thing you would think about but i'm sure it's part of the the deeper training that you provide people so um for whatever it's worth i you know i was totally like five times now impressed going to see your operation um all right we've got about 15 minutes left and eight nine let me see if i can move through a few of them um have you looked at black soldier fly feed to cut some of your grain costs to recycle some food waste no but we hope somebody in our ecosystem does that um bottom line i don't want to do that work um honestly but i understand the value i basically you know listen to one of those innovators at a big forum in san francisco and i thought well that would be an amazing opportunity for for an entrepreneur to come into one of these ecosystems and set up a black soldier fly operation so that we can do exactly that but the way we see these solutions is not i am it's not on a farm level i don't want to do that on a farm level when we implement something it's because it works for the whole the whole collective and if something doesn't benefit the collective uh then we don't do it so that's why grain is the same thing until we knew that we had enough throughput we didn't get into that now this year we incorporated a grain elevator because now we can incorporate the farmers too so same thing with these other options we want an entrepreneur to emerge that entrepreneur then goes and figures out how to do this part and then the ecosystem comes in to ensure that we embrace that entrepreneur and then solder flies become part of our ecosystem but that is that the colonized management process right there for you well i mean i think the the idea is if there's food waste and it can be used to produce blood shoulder fly larvae that would potentially be a a food source for the chickens which could easily be applied across the ecosystem um oh yeah from uh from a purely you know biological and you know purely scientific perspective i think it's an awesome option um we just need to be able to organize it properly from an entrepreneurial and management perspective cool all right cal asks how do you operate in the winter layers or broilers taking a winter break with rollers we take a winter break um with um and that's why we are setting up new uh regional collectives so we just started the collective out of omaha and we hope we can find an operating partner down in in oklahoma so we can set the southern collective and that way we can produce uh broilers year round without ever having to produce in the north uh because we will have partners everywhere the egg layers however is different we we keep them in the winter so the design of the coops the processes everything is it's almost like yeah it is completely different animals between egg layers and broilers so just to give you an idea the egg layer has a solarium system the solarium is passive solar the passive solar allows us to we focus on heating the ground as we heat the ground then we can sprout grains in the winter we can then sprout grains in artificial settings and then freeze that grain and use that frozen grain as a way to absorb extra nutrition from nutraceuticals like elderberry syrup and and garlic and onion mixtures with comfrey extracts and all kinds of things like that to germinate them to germinate so sprout the grain before we freeze it outside and bring it back into the solariums but then it defrosts and as it defrosts then it rehydrates the whole system of the chicken and those those agronomics and managerial practices allows us to eliminate all of the artificial manipulation of light and everything else and keep the efficiency at about 85 during the winter months and the chickens happy even though we can't let them out into the open fields yeah i hope people understood what you just said that was it's very impressive um uh jarrah asks again or she was we had talked about the six dollar a dozen eggs she said the sustainable farmer that delivers charges six dollars a dozen for eggs and 15 a pound for kosher chicken so that's obviously hopefully they're making good money there um it's a pretty high price yeah yeah if they are not um they're just giving it away to someone else that's that's the way i see it and i don't think there is necessarily something wrong about it i mean if they are paying an immigrant worker a much higher salary because of the fact that they are selling that egg at a much higher price well then let's all celebrate that but if they are wasting it and buying um you know machines and diesel and gasoline and something that extracts the value from that supply chain well then this be it's been smarter about it the basic point is it doesn't need to be that much right there's there's ways of doing it much more economically but yeah oh yeah direct sells i mean we can do well at about 350 to 4 a dozen egg um you know and that's the wholesale value we are charging um for actually for i i take that back the pound of chicken um so yeah three times um well yeah about 15 bucks 16 bucks per chicken yeah um okay um dear asks again john kemp mentioned that general mills is transitioning farmland to sustainable practices how do you feel about that corporations changing well if they are doing that and it is sustainable let's celebrate that too um corporations have an important role to play in regenerating the planet um but also remember that like i said before the most corporations are ran by people who don't give much of a value to feeding us into community well-being and health and all of that fortunately for us it's a very small minority so if general mills is one that is doesn't want to belong in that space of exploitation and extraction and destruction of the planet that's one more on our side of the fence and that is always good now whether they're actually doing it or not that's what we got to verify which now the trust issue is there is a real issue here i think i've read something about another there was a was it 15 000 acres or 5 000 acres or something i'm not sure where it was in um south dakota that they had taken over and yeah i think it was two million acres whatever yeah yeah yeah i mean you can't you really i didn't yeah it is laughable because because that ecology doesn't support what they are doing there so by definition just growing oats directly buying them directly from farmers that has nothing to do with sustainability or resiliency or regeneration that those are just different management practices that allows a company to claim another space and to you know build up a little bit more of that karma with consumers so that they can push more products down the line i mean that's what i see most of the time but hey i don't know the specific story here somebody can tell it and say no this got integrity then let's celebrate that but no integrity no celebration greg says do you think the healthiest most nutrient-dense foods can should also be the least expensive in theory and to that point if you're going to be doing monocultures on 5000 acres um you know only producing one crop functionally increases the the cost of production of that crop right it's only when you've got these multi-factor systems where you're you know cycling cycling energy and pulling a little bit out here that that the the actual cost of production goes down um yeah that is correct that's the secularity of the of natural economics and and it is extremely efficient at producing value uh value that we can harvest and so yes now the um the um uh nutritional density and the cost and all of that without any fuss right now we produce nutrients and we deliver nutrition to consumers at about half the price of a conventional product now here's the qualifier dollars per nutrient yeah exactly yeah we are not selling pounds of food we are selling pounds of nutrition and from that perspective it takes up to seven or eight carrots to deliver the value of one of our carrots now the carrot itself one of our carrots may be two times more expensive than one of the carrots from the conventional system but the nutrition in it is about half the cost of the nutrition that of the that you will need to spend in buying enough nutrition because you need about eight of those cheaper carrots to get the same nutrition so on the nutritional value we are half as expensive yeah brilliant um matt asks um best guess please how much energy can be saved when your model of regen farming is compared to an organic system and a conventional system from fork to plate we really don't know we haven't done a complete footprint with imprint mostly because the methodology being used actually is is not compatible with the systems we are deploying so the tools are not there to actually get a full imprint um i can't tell you that but what i can tell you is that just in general conversations with folks who do this day to day like david johnson and folks like that and even you then what we have figured out is that we are not harvesting more than 40 of the total energy that we are harnessing in that space and that by definition means we end up it's like if you earn a dollar and then you only needed to spend 30 to 40 cents to actually live a really comfortable life and every day you put 70 cents into your next day's pool that's exactly what we're doing so i'm happy with that equation um i mean yeah it will come the point when we need to figure out the tools that would allow us to completely measure the all of the verifiers of the system but the problem is we don't have those tools right now uh i think um bio neutral good association is working on some of those tools the instruments are certainly of the you know the the sort of the colonized western science you know framework but some of those values that you talked about at the beginning are the happiness of the people and the security and you know stability of the culture which you know i don't know if they can be monetized or captured in any of those kinds of ways but yeah that's a whole different conversation and that's why i'm saying we don't have the tools yeah because we we have never built um i mean the tools we have capture about the same amount of what we use of the of the potential of the landscape is about five percent so the tools have been developed to measure that five percent but what about the other ninety-five percent we don't know how to measure that yet now we know it's there because we can feel it and it actually shows and it's real it's tangible it's enjoyable and all of those things and so yeah that's all i need to verify that this is good the rest of it yeah leave it to the scientists that validated the very system that is wrecking the planet i don't think they have the moral authority to come and validate the incredible benefits that we are already generating there's a yeah there's various paradigms of engagement uh just in the last couple of minutes lenoir asked i'm with you but given the factors of the way land is owned by a wealthy few laws perpetuate degeneration and colonization and poverty levels i would like to see a practical step-by-step insurgency process slash blueprint of how to transform this local global entrenched economic and political system to a humane regenerative system come to your next presentation right yes we we do have not a complete step-by-step blueprint but believe me we probably have as close as it gets to building a global intellectual insurgency and to and it goes right down to the farmer to the consumer and the steps we need to take to take back the ownership control and governance that is the secret and if we can do that um here's the thing it is so doable and it is so easy to do uh once you are convinced that that's what you want once you become an insurgent then it's easy the problem is getting people from where they are right now in their position of privilege and comfort and being willing to be uncomfortable for a while and living really in real life so that they can experience the real solutions and then become enchanted with the resolutions to the point that they will never go back that's the transition but we're gonna have the most problems but those folks like and i hear this person is probably already on this other side uh there is enough of us right now that a global insurgency now is totally doable within the food and agriculture system and if we can just network ourselves under the mycelial structures and methodology of the earth itself we will replicate the most powerful organism on earth which is the mycelia and that is our blueprint for the future is the mycelial blueprint replicated in our brain replicated in the order of the universe replicated in the way we have built and connected cities and centers now replicating it to take over the food system again we have done it so many times we just don't know we already done it yeah beautiful um okay a couple last little questions uh shire um asks uh what are the first three ingredients ingredients of your non-live chicken feed okay so we have um first of all high protein um non-live i'm guessing i'm guessing what's meant is like grains versus sprouts but i'm not i'm not actually sure right so let's put it non-ground okay so basically when you grind grain you are killing it so you have deprived it from its ability to live and now it becomes mass biomass and so literally there is no ability for that organism anymore to interact because it's dead so what we do is in the non-ground up dead is where we we focus on high protein low fiber uh forages and so within that the king of all of them is country 26 protein only about 10 to 11 fiber and succulent which means the chickens can roam forever because they don't have to go back for water more than like you know maybe five twenty five percent of the time than they if they were eating dry grain for example one two um we look for weeds uh that are got the same characteristics so mallow for example lamb quarters porcelain all of those are actually succulent but also high protein low in fiber we avoid grasses all together unless it's just sprouted so we bring grass seeds in the form of wheat barley oats and then we sprout them and we have the chickens roaming in there within the first two to three up to four days after this the grain sprouts but we don't want it to grow because the second that that grain starts to grow a stem it completely flips the equation and it goes high in fiber low in protein and at that point it rubs the chicken of its nutritional needs instead it will it works the opposite and when it takes energy away right they sprout what you do is you take the whole grains you broadcast them out in the paddock you cover them with a little bit of hay and then if it's dry out you water them so you're not sprouting them in trays inside and bringing them out to the chickens you're just broadcasting them out into the paddock is what i experienced right it's a whole different way of doing things oh yeah yeah and part of the part of the reason we can do this at a scale is one because you can just put these grain mixes right into your tractor spreader and take 600 pounds and just spread them down the alleys uh one two it sprays him horizontally which means it goes under the trees as you can see in the in the picture now three th the the the the cover crops in the ground they shade from the trees and the amount of organic matter in that soil means a high level of humidity in that soil even during droughts there is a lot of humidity that condenses there that means easy way to sprout and if you're smart before you get those units established you can put an irrigation system which is what i'm doing now in the new farms not for the purpose of extracting water out of a system you could take drain water put it into a big pool and then pump it and you only have to do a little tiny bit of that because you already have an environment that will preserve and conserve the water anyway and bam you got a massive sprouting system and now i know i'll just tell you this confidently to all of you uh two years ago we raised a flock of broilers and we were able to remove the ground up feed 100 of it for four weeks and they still mature just five days delay than the rest of the chickens that were on that regular diet so i'm telling you that they the the level of innovation and the ability of us to compete collectively if we can do this at a scale it's so massive uh it's it's a real a real hack of a system yeah beautiful well that's probably a good way to end we're over time but are there any final insights or comments you'd like to share with us before we say thank you to everyone well it looks like greg is fired up and wants to do the whole thing so yeah give him my email i don't know if i have access to his looks like you gave him you gave me your website so he can find you but yeah okay i'm gonna give you my email directly greg okay well thank you reggie i really appreciate you having gone through now three sessions with us and looking forward to the to the uh the the climax presentation next time people think this has been good wait till wait till he actually lets it all hang out but yeah thank you very much feed the chickens free the people all right great thank you all you",
