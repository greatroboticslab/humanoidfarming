  "text": "[Music] howdy friends welcome back to the building of our homestead for the chicken coop I think I've decided it's probably gonna be a chicken palace build today we'll focus on putting up the wire mesh on the windows and the tops and I think if we work hard enough we could probably get the siding up let's get started come on [Music] so on this coop as you may have noticed it's gonna be kind of an open design a lot of little research I've done says that the open coops are kind of work a little bit better especially because we live in a very warm climate rarely do we get freezing and if we do have you know some freezing weather coming up we can just put some tarps over the front but we are going to do wire mesh along the top and the sides up in there the research that I've been doing says that ventilation is key vanillite vanillite ventilate and the more ventilation you have the drier it's gonna be and the healthier your chickens will be I guess a moist damp chicken area is not really very good we are going to put siding here just to keep any critters or anything that might want to try and get in there give them a harder time and then also the wall that we built extends a little bit past the entry and that's going to be to kind of help the wind from whipping in and around just wanted to give you an overview on why we're doing more of an open style instead of just a sealed in tight type but yeah let's uh let's cut some wire and get that up [Music] [Music] [Music] you got to be careful when you're cutting the wire at an angle see if it'll focus those points are razor sharp needle sharp it got me already all right finally we get to the sighting portion of the chicken coop I went with concrete sighting 4x8 sheet of hardy board is what it's called around here grooved it's cheaper that way for some reason the advantages of running concrete sighting is it's not going to rot like wood siding one disadvantage though it doesn't have much shear value to it so it's brittle so it's not going to it if the building moves too much it does have the chance of breaking so when we move it which it's going to be moved I'm gonna have to take a couple precautions to make sure it doesn't break too easily but like I said it's not gonna rot especially up against the elements that it's gonna have here with the chickens and their business and stuff inside there but it's comparable to a wood siding in cost but you got your advantages either way so that's what I'm gonna do it first prep the wall for it to make it a little bit easier it is extremely heavy so yeah so I want to have this sighting hanging down below the floor so I made a mark below the flooring an inch and a half and I'm putting in this ledger board and it'll hold the side I'm doing this alone and that's really the easiest way to do it by yourself even if you're using wood or or other things like that so I'll just put this on put a screw on one side and then level that across I guess another thing I should mention is it's really dusty [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] so got the siding on the sides and then the back before I finish up the back upper part I wanted to show you what I got going on here what I did is I had an old above-ground pool that was holy and wasn't really doing much pooling and I cut cut a section off of it and put it over the nesting boxes here and then once I get the siding on I'm also gonna do the siting here we'll put a piece of plywood over this and then with some hinges but this should keep this area dried off and looking fresh pretty much all I did was just put some roofing nails in right there basically that's all it's doing and then overlap my siding looks about three inches and I'm not putting any nails down here because I want to keep the unholy yeah all right so yeah also on the side we'll put siding on that little section right there and hopefully get some trim going down and it'll cover up that gap there yeah that's what's going on in the back time to get back and putting siding on [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] what does chicken say what does the chicken say you like the chicken house [Music] you know",
