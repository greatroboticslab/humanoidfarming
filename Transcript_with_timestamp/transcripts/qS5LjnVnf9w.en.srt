00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:11,940
well good morning everyone welcome to

2
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:14,580
the grain storage webinar on hygiene and

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,170
structural cleaners my name's Chris

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,630
Warwick I'm a consultant based in

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:21,779
Horsham Victoria and I manage the Jerry

6
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,970
Caesar own storage extension project now

7
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:26,519
my role in this project has developed

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,140
over the past 10 years and since the

9
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:30,390
very save loss of Peter brought up last

10
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,309
year and their service the GAC is

11
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,600
southern region we've grown storing

12
00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:38,149
workshops and information such as this

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:42,030
as I mentioned the quick housekeeping

14
00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:47,760
the Q&A window allows you guys to ask

15
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:50,039
questions already just click on the Q&A

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,489
to open a window type your question in

17
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:56,489
the box and then click send if you'd

18
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:58,170
like to send an anonymous question you

19
00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:00,960
can select send anonymously if you don't

20
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,140
want to be identified and please feel

21
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,670
free to ask questions as we go

22
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:07,260
you might have already come with a few

23
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,659
questions so feel free to put those in

24
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,490
straightaway or as you think of them the

25
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:11,939
way that adds them as we go or at the

26
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:16,710
end

27
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:18,080
by all means top those questions I'd

28
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:22,100
like to think the base AJ for

29
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,100
facilitating this session for us today

30
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,259
appreciate their support and providing

31
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:30,600
these workshops for us if you have any

32
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:32,820
trouble hearing me or can't see the

33
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:38,820
PowerPoint presentation please let me

34
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:39,680
know and by that question box well let's

35
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,119
get into it

36
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,570
on-farm storage hygiene and structural

37
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:44,570
treatments

38
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:56,930
you know just as an overview to help us

39
00:01:54,619 --> 00:01:58,970
figure out where hydrogen and structural

40
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:02,659
treatments fits into the bigger picture

41
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:06,950
of manging on-farm storage it's really

42
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:07,610
the first step so if we look at in the

43
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,739
whole system

44
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:12,530
we're really about trying to prevent

45
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:15,950
pests prevent the infestation of pests

46
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:18,590
prevent the damage but they're great if

47
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:20,030
we don't get that right and we still

48
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:22,430
have to do a pest control then we're

49
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:25,610
looking at phosphine or on-farm pest

50
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:27,860
control or a commercial fumigated and

51
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:30,170
then lastly we also want to consider

52
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,610
grain quality so imagine moisture

53
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:32,980
temperature but in the pest prevention

54
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,750
side of things

55
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:38,090
hygiene is structural treatments along

56
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:40,220
with aeration cooling protectants and

57
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:41,569
monitoring there about pest prevention

58
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:44,000
so that's what we're going to talk about

59
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:49,100
today best prevention trying to start

60
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:53,890
clean and start with a good fresh

61
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:53,890
storage with no pest contamination to

62
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:59,989
the research to kick things off with

63
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:03,799
this is some research done by the

64
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:07,120
post-harvest research team up in

65
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:09,950
Queensland through the department okay

66
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:13,850
this is to give you a bit of an idea of

67
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:16,340
how quickly growing straight pest can

68
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:23,989
breed up so we've got months along the

69
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:26,180
bottom so you can see my mouse so you

70
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:29,810
can see after three months this is in a

71
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:31,720
one-ton bulk bag after three months that

72
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:36,709
boggle they've just left in the shed

73
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:39,290
we've reached nearly 5,000 beetles after

74
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:46,400
six months the numbers really spiked up

75
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:48,319
- so you can see that those few maybe

76
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,370
half bag for all bits are growing that's

77
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:54,170
long around throughout the year often

78
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,400
left there for longer than six months we

79
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:57,049
get it you know really good

80
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,889
understanding of how quickly they become

81
00:03:57,049 --> 00:04:00,019
a breeding ground

82
00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:03,750
so that's part of Hygiene is to use to

83
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:07,040
be able to - the other Queen those

84
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:09,540
bits of growing up as well not just in

85
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:15,770
in the solos themselves but around the

86
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:15,770
sheds and very decline around the place

87
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:27,389
something else that some who have

88
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:31,050
recently found again for a bit more

89
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:33,539
research some aside note actually to

90
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:35,250
some research was someone asked the

91
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:36,629
question will for every adult insect

92
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,250
because that's what we're seeing that's

93
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:39,979
what we're monitoring you is the adult

94
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:45,240
stage of the life cycle

95
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:48,000
how many adolescent insects if you like

96
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,520
how many egg larvae pupae can we

97
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,400
actually expect for every one adult and

98
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:57,240
the research found that for every adult

99
00:04:52,400 --> 00:05:04,020
you can find in Grain expect eighty to

100
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:07,699
ninety egg larvae pupae so it's easy to

101
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,699
see how numbers build up quite quickly

102
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:12,330
so that's what look at prevention is

103
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,439
better than cure up we really don't want

104
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:15,449
to get to the point where we find

105
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:22,770
insects because as we've just seen

106
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:25,710
they'll breed up really quickly and I

107
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:27,569
came to me and to what the research

108
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:29,610
shows is really about preventing an

109
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:32,159
unwelcome environment for pests and what

110
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:34,710
we know is that they like primarily they

111
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:37,800
really like shelter they like to be

112
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:40,259
sheltered from the extreme conditions of

113
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,180
the enemy so they don't like getting

114
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:44,159
really cold or that like you really hot

115
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:47,279
so somewhere they can shelter from the

116
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:49,770
heat and from the cool and then secondly

117
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:52,080
they need a bit of food so anywhere that

118
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:54,750
you can think of solos are the obvious

119
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,000
spot nice and sheltered a little bit of

120
00:05:54,750 --> 00:06:00,029
food left in there other things around

121
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,750
the brand the farms like your seed silos

122
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:05,099
or the choc feed or machinery that's in

123
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,469
the shed that might have a little bit of

124
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:09,180
grain residue left in it all those

125
00:06:07,469 --> 00:06:13,469
places that are really good harvest for

126
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:15,360
insects even consider hoppers and things

127
00:06:13,469 --> 00:06:17,400
left around the silos that might be

128
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,500
overturned so they don't fill up with

129
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,389
water but actually create a nice little

130
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,830
shelter and if there's a bit of grain

131
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:25,319
left on the ground that they're covering

132
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:27,689
up then there's shelter and food all the

133
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:31,139
sudden so consider those places as

134
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:32,909
insects happens as well even hay and

135
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:35,889
grass around the side that can provide a

136
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:37,860
bit of shelter see the team

137
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:43,629
that sort of stuff lying around silos

138
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:46,749
can provide a finish every one but

139
00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:48,520
that's the hygiene a lot of things the

140
00:06:46,749 --> 00:06:49,930
second one we've done hi Jen we've won a

141
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,090
look at structural treatments so that's

142
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:54,419
about killing any insects that may be

143
00:06:52,090 --> 00:07:08,199
left after we've done the cleanup

144
00:06:54,419 --> 00:07:10,840
let's of the fire Jane first so as I

145
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:13,419
said hygiene is not just limited in in

146
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:15,849
the solos but if we look at the picture

147
00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:17,469
on the top left here we've got a bit of

148
00:07:15,849 --> 00:07:20,469
grain left you know in a hopper

149
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:23,169
underneath Asolo really quite a nice

150
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:25,449
training ground there for insects to to

151
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:29,379
start bringing away and quickly infested

152
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:30,729
me into silos the bottom left there

153
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:33,009
we've got in the back of the truck

154
00:07:30,729 --> 00:07:34,689
and remember equipment anything you

155
00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:38,020
clean up make sure all the trucks chaser

156
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:40,599
bins other bins trailers and all those

157
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:43,930
sorts of things that the grain go

158
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:47,199
through I really cleaned up well we're

159
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:49,419
looking at silos even consider the

160
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,659
design of the silo and they've had that

161
00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:56,759
the solar sits on the scene silos on a

162
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:59,139
concrete ring rather than a concrete pad

163
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:01,509
it really it makes them a bit hard to

164
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:03,399
clean if we use a nice smooth concrete

165
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:07,419
pad it that really does make hide them a

166
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:08,620
lot easier to sweep that growing up when

167
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:13,569
we're looking at spill crane around

168
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:16,330
silos people often get it quite panicky

169
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:19,330
about spilled grain around silos to be

170
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:21,520
honest grain that's the spill thinly

171
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:23,649
across the ground sort of one grain thin

172
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,860
doesn't provide enough shelter for

173
00:08:23,649 --> 00:08:28,990
insects to live that well grain piled up

174
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:31,449
if you've left a pile of grain this

175
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:33,610
other side that provide enough shelter

176
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:36,610
for insects to live so just consider

177
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:38,919
that when you're doing your claim again

178
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:42,399
headers are really common spot on

179
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:45,880
insects in the top right and picture

180
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:48,430
there we've got some trench aeration in

181
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,780
a big flat one silo something that we

182
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:52,960
often see

183
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:57,000
is particularly input of silos now come

184
00:08:52,960 --> 00:09:02,560
in with the full floor aeration systems

185
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:05,410
false wall perforated floor aeration the

186
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,810
issue with those sorts of setups we find

187
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:11,020
is that they're they're impossible to

188
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:12,400
clean under so after a few years will be

189
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:14,200
a bit of dust residue be the grain

190
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,930
residue fall through that floor and

191
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:19,330
again create a perfect Arbor for insects

192
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:22,570
to breed under that floor come along and

193
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:23,860
put hub fresh harvest grain in and in as

194
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:27,160
soon as you put it in the insects are

195
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:29,140
investing so that trench aeration for

196
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:33,400
aeration cooling trench aeration is is

197
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:35,050
quite adequate and in the real advantage

198
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:39,310
is that it's easy to lift up and clean

199
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:41,140
out so again when you're looking at new

200
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:43,770
silos whether it be flat bottom or cone

201
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:47,370
bottom look how easy they are to clean

202
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:49,600
any spots that grain can get stuck with

203
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:51,790
we're looking at types of cleaning

204
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,980
obviously the broom and compressed air

205
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:57,460
and water for the comb bottom silos is a

206
00:09:53,980 --> 00:10:00,580
good idea to dispose of that waste grain

207
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:04,300
so not leaving it in a bucket or really

208
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:05,920
been beside the the silos or in a pile

209
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:09,820
we actually want to get rid of that

210
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:12,700
grain so come on various benefits and

211
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:15,550
the livestock many peopre live at some

212
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:22,620
here even spread it out thinly across

213
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:25,180
the ground south of germany machinery

214
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:29,589
similar research just to try and

215
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:31,660
highlight it goes up in Queensland again

216
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:34,330
did some research for us and and asked

217
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:36,520
how was contractor who considered that

218
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:38,650
he'd clean he's had a fairly well at the

219
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:41,140
end of the season they said can we catch

220
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:42,310
the first 40 litres of grain that goes

221
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,860
through the header at the start of the

222
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:46,480
next season we said wait so they went

223
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:48,339
along with the bucket and collected the

224
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,470
first 40 litres of grain that went

225
00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:52,330
through the header and actually stopped

226
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:54,630
counting when they found a thousand less

227
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:57,339
of grain bore in that first 40 ratings

228
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:59,440
so that's a head that was thought to be

229
00:10:57,339 --> 00:11:01,270
reasonably clean but they hadn't used

230
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,310
dry side you know haven't used a

231
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:05,890
diatomaceous earth product so

232
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:09,010
again encourage you what you think might

233
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:12,450
be clean is still an insect harbor if we

234
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:12,450
don't use a structural treatment or look

235
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:20,350
what Tommy you shall be clean up again

236
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:25,120
we look to research to tell us these

237
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:27,760
answers we rely very heavily on research

238
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,940
finds and what it finds is that insects

239
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:33,430
will breed and travel when when the

240
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:35,410
temperatures warm up so you can see in

241
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:38,680
june/july there where the temperature is

242
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:41,620
cold insect reproduction is slowed right

243
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:44,770
down insects don't tend to move around

244
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:48,250
as much so that's the best time to do

245
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:51,040
our grains drug hygiene so even this

246
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:53,110
time we were in August now before the

247
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,360
temperatures really start to warm up in

248
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:57,160
the spring good time to do our hygiene

249
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,900
clean them up get rid of them before I

250
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,080
start breathing and moving around the

251
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,080
Flies

252
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:07,210
so that's how a gene structural

253
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:10,060
treatments where we're trying to do is

254
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:12,370
structural treatments the main one that

255
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:15,520
we would suggest people look at is a

256
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:16,960
diatomaceous earth so that's a naturally

257
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,990
occurring product at the mine product

258
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:23,640
not chemical based it's actually if you

259
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:27,220
put it under a microscope it's actually

260
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:29,260
it's very abrasive shaped and it

261
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:31,540
actually scratches the waxy cuticle on

262
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:34,900
the insect and they end up dehydrating

263
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:36,820
so it's a physical mode of action so the

264
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:39,160
insects can't develop resistance to it

265
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,750
that's why we like the product and

266
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:44,470
therefore is effective on all the main

267
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:46,540
grain storage pests so that's what we're

268
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:48,970
trying to do is clean the storage app

269
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:50,470
create an unwelcome environment and then

270
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:53,650
we're really trying to kill any insects

271
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:56,410
that may be left there often get asked

272
00:12:53,650 --> 00:13:00,160
about other products people think look

273
00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:01,660
similar like lime again the testing

274
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,750
that's being done shows that lime was

275
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:07,900
really not effective we did we need a

276
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:14,050
diagnosis earth product something like a

277
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:17,080
dry side we're looking at how much we

278
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:19,120
actually need it's really not much take

279
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:23,920
example of a hundred and twelve tons

280
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:27,070
silo we only need about 420 grams I'm

281
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:29,080
not talking about feed volumes here for

282
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:31,690
something like a harvester we might need

283
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:35,230
a couple of kilos through the harvester

284
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:37,990
in the front not not large volumes we're

285
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:40,150
not performing a heap of the people just

286
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:42,330
happening just enough to really light

287
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:45,160
dusty

288
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:48,370
shall we do it I'll reply de

289
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:52,000
diatomaceous earth for solids comb

290
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:55,120
bottom solos a little blowback gun you

291
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,310
can see here so we opened the top lid of

292
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,190
the solo open the bottom lid we measure

293
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:02,230
out now our quantity of diatomaceous

294
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:04,570
earth in the bucket or something similar

295
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:07,540
and then using the air compressor and

296
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:08,890
the venturi gun the blowback gun we blow

297
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,420
it up through the solo and you'll

298
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:13,320
quickly hear the clatter - see you like

299
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:16,360
in the right hand picture once you've

300
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,130
measured quantity in step back have a

301
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,200
look and the dust and start floating at

302
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:22,630
the top of the solo when you see that

303
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:28,540
start to happen shut they'll be closed

304
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:31,300
the bottom manhole other people I've

305
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:34,420
seen and heard used leaf blowers and

306
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:36,610
most sorts of things and to get the dry

307
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:39,100
side or diatomaceous earth dust in the

308
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:41,050
silo anything like that would be

309
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,760
effective while we're trying to do

310
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:49,750
within an even coating around the solid

311
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:51,340
walls the roof even in face it can be

312
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:55,390
applied as a slurry which is

313
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:57,940
particularly good for sheds concrete up

314
00:14:55,390 --> 00:15:00,790
the walls and ceilings in the shed next

315
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:03,340
work it is pretty hard on pumps so be

316
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:04,930
aware of that if you want more

317
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:11,670
information I'm Adam I'm certain

318
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:14,650
definitely hopefully they do consider

319
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:17,890
personal protective equipment I'd asked

320
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:22,090
mask and some gloves and certain goals

321
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:26,380
as I say bracing so it's a nasty in the

322
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:29,620
eyes make sure we do there goes the

323
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:30,940
other warning on put out there as I said

324
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:34,150
it's not chemical based

325
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:36,790
they product to use I would hate for

326
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:39,610
people to run into trouble though store

327
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:43,140
impulses or oil seeds if they happen to

328
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:46,750
get a bit of this diatomaceous earth

329
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:48,670
settling in the cone of the silo and

330
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:51,850
then you've got a bit of discoloring on

331
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:54,310
possible seed I hate that two different

332
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:58,570
great to buy the grain so my suggestion

333
00:15:54,310 --> 00:16:00,160
there is to to you to do the hygiene do

334
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:03,880
the structural treatment do automations

335
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,230
birth and then just before harvest if

336
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,570
you cannot store part of the royal

337
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:12,160
scenes just give that's all I couldn't

338
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:13,750
sell just to make sure there's no no no

339
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,430
quantities of do that it compiled

340
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:21,100
somewhere that that might be in your

341
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:24,990
sample few key points on on diatomaceous

342
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:28,840
earth takes about five to 10 days to

343
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:31,090
ticular insects but to thank you for the

344
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:32,530
in the six to twelve month range so

345
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:34,680
again that's why we suggest can be

346
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:37,840
applied in the abstinence

347
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:39,790
yes as near as 10 days before harvest

348
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:42,220
but really the better is that he's

349
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:45,610
became message there can we apply

350
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:47,350
there's a dust or a slurry it's most

351
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:49,890
effective in the dry environment so

352
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:52,390
under 65 don't know what it means so

353
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:54,640
think about inside your solos is

354
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:57,100
relatively dry inside your equipment

355
00:16:54,640 --> 00:17:01,960
machine the shedding begin is relatively

356
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:05,340
dry it's not chemical based no pest

357
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,340
resistance which is a really good thing

358
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:13,540
main structural treatment as I just said

359
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:15,490
I crack them into green silos just

360
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:18,910
before storing all sated parcels for

361
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:20,680
that added extra security to make sure

362
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:24,310
we don't get downgraded on those those

363
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:28,150
high value commodities and again make

364
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:31,740
sure we wear gloves dust masks in and

365
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:31,740
actually gold so I need to add to that

366
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:40,030
just a warning it is registered product

367
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:44,590
it can be added to grind it 7-eleven

368
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:46,659
actually edit to grind that used to be

369
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:48,640
thing these days we see more and more

370
00:17:46,659 --> 00:17:50,860
grain buyers actually prefer that it's

371
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,740
not used in that way it really does

372
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:55,090
change the flow of the grain we're

373
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:58,840
talking about cereals only here of

374
00:17:55,090 --> 00:18:00,490
course so we actually don't recommend it

375
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,559
the other two remain there's other

376
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:04,090
suggestions I hear people say what if

377
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,830
you add a little bit to the first bit of

378
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:07,299
grain that goes in the silo and add a

379
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,980
bit to the last bit of grain that goes

380
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:12,659
in the solid form bit of a cap or a

381
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:16,210
barrier in theory yes good theory

382
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:18,100
happens in practices we can expect will

383
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:20,620
be some insects in that grain box

384
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:22,630
somewhere and if we've got a barrier on

385
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:25,659
the top and the bottom we're not only

386
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:28,210
trying to stop Intex from coming into

387
00:18:25,659 --> 00:18:30,640
that grain but all stops also stopping

388
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:32,080
is a giving me out so we might go and

389
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,640
have a look at the grain in storage at

390
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,580
any point and say long walks clean or

391
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:38,500
counseling so a teeny insects even seem

392
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:40,240
a bit of grain from the top but what

393
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,370
could be happening is insect bringing

394
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,169
down in the middle of that grain stack

395
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:46,720
they're just not coming to the surface

396
00:18:44,169 --> 00:18:49,539
because of the DA so actually wouldn't

397
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,860
recommend that of the practice or the

398
00:18:49,539 --> 00:18:52,659
risk that they could be insect activity

399
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:55,120
in the middle of the grain stack in the

400
00:18:52,659 --> 00:18:56,710
middle of a silo and we can't see it at

401
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:04,230
the top of the bottom because of the DEA

402
00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:06,340
effect key points to run through again

403
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:09,210
clean up during the cooler months so

404
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:11,140
this time of year is well worth doing

405
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:14,289
actually including machinery in the

406
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:16,990
cleanup dispose of that waste ground and

407
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:19,149
then follow up with an application of

408
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:24,669
structural treatment to the Plains

409
00:19:19,149 --> 00:19:27,909
Georgia so that's that's why doing those

410
00:19:24,669 --> 00:19:29,470
structural treatments it's really quite

411
00:19:27,909 --> 00:19:31,809
quick and simple if there's nothing too

412
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:34,659
complex to it which I really like

413
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:37,450
anything that's simple and also

414
00:19:34,659 --> 00:19:39,039
cost-effective I think is a good thing

415
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:41,529
so it doesn't have to be complicated

416
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:43,179
common sense but really does make a big

417
00:19:41,529 --> 00:19:45,120
difference

418
00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:47,679
starting with our grain storage Queen

419
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:51,159
gives us our best chance for a group as

420
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:54,570
well so I'll ask a minute in a minute

421
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:57,490
for you guys to certainly use that

422
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:58,360
question and answer window type your

423
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:00,430
questions in

424
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:02,320
now and I'm sure there'll be some

425
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:04,230
questions if you've got to come with or

426
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,610
a bit amorous part

427
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:08,140
what are you doing that I'll just

428
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:10,360
reiterate if the people would like more

429
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:13,300
information stored grain comm that are

430
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:15,160
you the website you can go to you can

431
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:18,250
contact us we're going strong extension

432
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:21,520
team on info at store grain con blame

433
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:23,890
you or you can call the hotline at any

434
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,110
stage 1-800 level and that will put you

435
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:29,100
in contact with your closest grain

436
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:29,100
storage specialist

437
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:35,800
well you're typing the questions another

438
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:38,470
amount of that the next webinar will be

439
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:40,390
on the 10th of September same time 10:00

440
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:46,320
a.m. and we're going to have a look at

441
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:50,350
upgrades to existing storage that one

442
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:52,500
also keep an eye out for an email that

443
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:55,750
will be sent to you shortly

444
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:58,120
we just put a a second survey in there

445
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:59,800
to get some feedback on this webinar and

446
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,390
check if you guys have been very aware

447
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:08,590
of them and what we can do to improve

448
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:10,930
them so we've got any questions any

449
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:13,930
question that would like to ask happy to

450
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:18,090
take those now if you want to type them

451
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:18,090
in the question and it's a window

452
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:49,310
just while you're thinking of your

453
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:51,230
questions there one of the ones I often

454
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:53,600
get asked at workshops is can we use a

455
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:57,190
product like diatomaceous earth around

456
00:21:53,600 --> 00:22:01,820
the silos so around the base of the silo

457
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:04,220
what we can as we said in the previous

458
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:08,990
couple slides there it works best in

459
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:11,180
here is the dry under 65% meaning so for

460
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:12,620
those areas around the silos we were

461
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:15,200
actually bit off to use a spray on

462
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:17,870
product something like a for nitrile

463
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:21,320
thorn as a structural treatment is good

464
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:23,480
for the grass and gravel or concrete

465
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:25,670
areas around the silos we can actually

466
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:29,450
use very sort of products as a

467
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:31,640
structural treatment purpose in K the

468
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:34,750
diatomaceous earth the inside the store

469
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,750
these needs are dimension

470
00:22:49,789 --> 00:22:54,159
can say any questions coming here I

471
00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:03,169
think those questions you guys if we ask

472
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:04,639
them by all means if you if you do think

473
00:23:03,169 --> 00:23:05,960
of something later

474
00:23:04,639 --> 00:23:08,059
please refer that call that hotline

475
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:10,039
1-800 weeble and that will come straight

476
00:23:08,059 --> 00:23:12,350
through your huge grain storage

477
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:14,720
specialist certainly consult with store

478
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:16,370
grain calmly new website there is a fact

479
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,610
sheet on there on hygiene and structural

480
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:22,600
treatments which includes most of the

481
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:22,600
content that we've just been through

482
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:28,070
there's no further questions thank you

483
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:30,889

of September for a webinar on upgrading

487
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:41,350
existing storage thanks again
