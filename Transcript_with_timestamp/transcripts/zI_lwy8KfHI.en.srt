00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,000
Have you ever wondered where farmers get

3
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,560
the seeds they plant to produce the

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,320
foods that we eat? Sometimes farmers

5
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,880
continue planting seeds saved from the

6
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,960
previous crop. However, for some of our

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,440
most common crops, including corn,

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,840
onion, spinach, and broccoli, farmers

9
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,160
purchase seeds each year. To understand

10
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,199
why, let's explore plant genetics using

11
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,119
corn as an example. Different genes

12
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,039
dictate the sweetness of the kernel,

13
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,380
plant height, ear size, and other

14
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,960
traits.

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,440
Different varieties of corn have the

17
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,360
same genes. However, they have different

18
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,520
versions of those genes which lead to

19
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,239
unique characteristics like color and

20
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,000
resistance to pests.

21
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,719
Consider the produce in your grocery

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,480
store. Farmers produce uniform crops so

23
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,960
that they can be easily cared for,

24
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,559
harvested, and sold to consumers. If all

25
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,239
the corn in the field grew at different

26
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,640
rates, the plants would vary in their

27
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,480
needs for water and nutrients. For this

28
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,399
reason, an extraordinary amount of

29
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,800
breeding is used to produce uniform

30
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,799
varieties that are useful to farmers.

31
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,400
These inbredad crops take years to

32
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,080
produce and are often bred and

33
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,880
maintained by seed companies or

34
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,680
university researchers. To understand

35
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,680
inbredads, let's use an analogy.

36
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,920
You can think of genes as playing cards

37
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:22,360
and other suits of the same card as

38
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,360
different versions of the same gene.

39
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,840
In many plants, as in humans, each

40
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,880
individual has two versions of every

41
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,600
gene. In imbreds, all genes can be

42
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,400
represented by the same suit. For

43
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,040
example, one plant might have all hearts

44
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,439
and another all spades.

45
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,680
Then, if you cross two different inbred

46
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:47,040
plants, the result is a hybrid that is

47
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,960
exactly half hearts and half spades.

48
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,200
Nearly a hundred years ago, breeders

49
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,280
observed that making a hybrid of two

50
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,360
inbred varieties results in a new

51
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,079
variety that has better characteristics

52
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,560
than either parent. These hybrids make

53
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,640
great crops for two reasons. They are

54
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,600
genetically identical to each other like

55
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,360
twins and are therefore uniform. And

56
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,440
unlike their parents, they have two

57
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,319
different versions of every gene, giving

58
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,560
them hybrid vigor. This results in

59
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,800
favorable characteristics such as

60
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,080
resistance to pests

61
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,640
and higher yields. Now farmers can grow

62
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,480
their hybrid crop, harvest, collect

63
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,280
seeds, and plant them next season.

64
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,440
Right? Let's look at what would happen.

65
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,160
Each hybrid has one heart version and

66
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,000
one spade version of each gene. To

67
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,040
produce the next generation, each

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,879
hybrid's parent randomly passes down one

69
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,840
version of each gene. The next

70
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:44,080
generation will not be uniform. Some

71
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,280
plants will have two heart varieties of

72
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,680
a given gene. Some will have two spades

73
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,599
and some will have one of each. This

74
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,480
means that the farmer's field will have

75
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:57,120
an assortment of plants, some tall, some

76
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,840
short, some resistant to pests, some

77
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,840
not. This makes for a crop that is

78
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,920
difficult for farmers to care for and

79
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,040
harvest. So, what have we learned about

80
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,040
hybrids? Let's recap. Characteristics

81
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,879
are controlled by genes which come in

82
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,840
different versions like different suits

83
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:16,080
of the same playing card. Many crops are

84
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,159
inbred until each plant has the same

85
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,239
version of each gene so that they are

86
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,720
genetically identical and can be

87
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,040
uniformly cared for and harvested. When

88
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,120
these inbred lines are crossed, the

89
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,720
resulting hybrid has even better

90
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,480
characteristics than either of the

91
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,640
parents. This is called hybrid vigor.

92
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,640
Farmers often greatly prefer hybrid

93
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,120
plants, but don't save the seeds that

94
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,280
they produce. This is because seeds

95
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,519
produced by hybrid crops grow into

96
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,760
plants that are not uniform and lack

97
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,159
characteristics favored by farmers and

98
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,720
consumers. And now you know one reason

99
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,720
why farmers choose to buy new seeds each

100
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,720
year.
