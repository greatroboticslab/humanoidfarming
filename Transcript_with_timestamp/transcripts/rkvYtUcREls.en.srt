00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,640
hi folks ron agronomist with pioneer in

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,160
central texas

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,839
you can see i'm in a field of corn

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,240
that's taking some pretty severe heat

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,080
skull due to drought conditions you can

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,960
look at these plants and see that the

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,440
top material is completely scalded very

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,920
little green left plants are starting to

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,840
shut down question i would have this

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,320
about this is what kind of yield can i

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,480
expect out of these particular plants

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,240
and will there even be any here's an air

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,080
on down the road let's go on down here

14
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,920
and see what it looks as we get across

15
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,079
here

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,239
notice as you go through here

17
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,320
a lot of these leaves are scorched very

18
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,520
little photosynthesis happening these

19
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,360
are still alive but severely rolled up

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,719
and of course the husks are starting to

21
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,640
turn turn by

22
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,640
so as we look right here

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,399
it starts to improve as we get on down

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,600
there so we've got an ear that i pulled

25
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,600
back there

26
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,399
let's investigate this a little bit and

27
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,399
see what it looks like

28
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,760
well number one you can tell right off

29
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,000
the bat

30
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,920
a little bit of incomplete pollination

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,240
probably due to drought and that piece

32
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,960
of soil is very very shallow back there

33
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,520
a lot of rock this is an air i pulled on

34
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,280
down the way

35
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,040
it's a little better shape but one of

36
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,920
the things you'll notice is some missing

37
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,640
kernels my expectation here is probably

38
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,119
that was a late roundup application we

39
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,680
had such severe dry weather early in the

40
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,920
season we didn't have weeds to spray at

41
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,159
the correct time you know v8 or 30

42
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,520
inches whichever comes first when you

43
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,439
have a drought a lot of times you

44
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,280
shorten the internodes you'll have

45
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,479
plants at a farther growth stage than

46
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,280
you ever imagined

47
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,960
so you could see looking here these uh

48
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,840
these ears are not going to yield that

49
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,000
well

50
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,159
but if you look down here at this board

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,200
where we've gathered two hybrids two

52
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:57,119
different ones new 1122 the new 095 at

53
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,040
differing populations they look pretty

54
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,079
decent well that's a different part of

55
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,560
the field

56
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:06,000
a little bit better soil and notice our

57
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,640
populations 25 22 18.

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,959
so 25 on this piece of land is probably

59
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,360
a little bit rich 22 is probably about

60
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,319
right and 18's on the low side

61
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,640
so

62
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,200
a question i would get is okay ron

63
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,879
what's gonna happen to these ears if

64
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,800
these plants die

65
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,120
well we're at the dent stage for the

66
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,440
most part or early dent you're not going

67
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,280
to abort kernels on the tip any longer

68
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,160
because you're at that advanced growth

69
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,239
stage what you will see though is you

70
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,800
will see these kernels shrivel they will

71
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,120
be very small like that

72
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,360
be very hard to get in the combine and

73
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,720
they will have very limited test weight

74
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,400
so can you still lose yield absolutely

75
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,280
kernel depth and test weight are going

76
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,720
to be the two culprits in this situation

77
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,560
again

78
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,400
little better soils

79
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,920
a lot better results

80
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,159
a lot of fields will be that way this

81
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,319
year i hope this helps you all have a

82
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,879
great harvest season

83
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,560
