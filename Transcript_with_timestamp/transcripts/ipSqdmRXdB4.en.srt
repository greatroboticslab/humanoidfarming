what may have been their best ground

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,359
only a few decades ago the sine

00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,680
land of its productivity draining

10
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:36,559
Farmers pocketbooks leaving many to feel

11
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,960
helpless in the face of this tidal wave

12
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:42,920
of rising Waters and Sals two brothers

13
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:46,000
in Beetle County South Dakota decided

14
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:48,680
that business as usual was not an option

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,120
in the face of this

16
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:55,079
threat hi I'm Bose Clute and I'm a

17
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:57,879
scientist but this is not my story to

18
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:01,920
really understand the Hamilton's Journey

19
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:01,920
we have to begin here

20
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,880
about mid 80s our land at Arlington we

21
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,439
used to drive a two wheel drive 165

22
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,799
horsepower tractor over there to farm

23
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,680
and the one year we had a lot of rain

24
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:18,920
and we're driving driving down a County

25
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,000
Road and we're driving through a couple

26
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,479
inches of water and I thought like

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,640
everybody else well you know what it was

28
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:27,520
a wet year next year the weather pattern

29
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:31,159
will change and that water will go away

30
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:34,799
well 5 years went by 10 years went by

31
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:37,119
and that road didn't come back above

32
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,079
water that road that I used to drive the

33
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:43,000
two wheel drive tractor down has 25 plus

34
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:46,640
feet of water over the top of

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,799
it I'm Scott Hamilton I'm Jeff Hamilton

36
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,960
I'm Scott's brother we have a mixed

37
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:54,439
cropping mixed livestock operation we

38
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:57,840
grow corn soybeans elf

39
00:01:54,439 --> 00:02:00,479
ala we're integrating Rye we've messed

40
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,039
around some cover crops uh also using

41
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,479
some Japanese Millet uh as a way to try

42
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:07,399
to clean up some Fields without

43
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:09,039
chemistry we're actually in five

44
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:11,800
different counties and we try and

45
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:14,599
incorporate our cow herd and cattle back

46
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:18,200
through all our cropping

47
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:21,000
Acres when I was in school I remember my

48
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,480
dad saying you always grow some wheat

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,680
some small grain cuz you never know if

50
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:29,640
you're going to get enough rain for

51
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,519
corn and when soybeans started coming in

52
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,680
out here that would have been early '

53
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:38,120
80s early 80s um and then that's sort of

54
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,840
when these West these potholes in the

55
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:44,560
state started filling with water

56
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:46,239
yeah so yeah it it it was after probably

57
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,540
in the 90s for the most part was the

58
00:02:46,239 --> 00:03:00,059
biggest change you know

59
00:02:49,540 --> 00:03:00,059
[Music]

60
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:07,920
so we have a cropping field that it's

61
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:11,120
been corn soy beans maybe back in time

62
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:14,640
it had some wheat of course with our

63
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,599
weather change over the years it had the

64
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,760
last I don't know probably last what 15

65
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:21,480
years we haven't raised anything there

66
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:24,519
in fact it was getting so bad well the

67
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,879
kosher weed we didn't grow is pure

68
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:30,560
saline it it would typically be wet in

69
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:33,319
the spring you'd try to if you try to

70
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,640
work it disc it or chisel it and after

71
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:36,560
we got out of that after we started

72
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,920
noing you'd swing the boom out there and

73
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,599
kill it and

74
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,599
so if you tried to disc it you would

75
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:44,040
plant it and you'd grow nothing so you

76
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:46,080
had to hope you didn't get stuck and

77
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,319
then you go in there and you disc it and

78
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,080
then you'd prevent PL it collect your

79
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,640
government crop insurance check and it's

80
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:58,519
like we can't just keep doing this yeah

81
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:59,740
I economically I make make sense but the

82
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:02,830
land was going backwards

83
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,830
[Music]

84
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:11,040
for me it started with the sing areas I

85
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:13,079
got tired of growing nothing and it

86
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,400
might L with the crop insurance CU

87
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:16,320
you'll be able to collect your prevent

88
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,959
plant for the first few years but once

89
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,759
you're so far into it then you're

90
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:22,720
getting zero production you know it's

91
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:25,560
it's a it's a short-term gain is what it

92
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,639
is shortterm short-term gain but if

93
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,440
we're truly if we're truly stewards of

94
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:32,000
the land we can't do things from a

95
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,919
short-term gain

96
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,520
standpoint well I took and went and

97
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:39,440
bought some saline seed mix or it was

98
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,880
mostly blend the wheed

99
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:45,960
grasses um made sure it was pretty weed

100
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,440
clean cuz uh barley foxtail would be the

101
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:51,080
first thing it would start so we sprayed

102
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:54,479
it with Roundup got it clean I think we

103
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:56,440
SE it in June and by that fall I had I

104
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,800
could Row the grass which I could not

105
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,639
believe because it had not grown

106
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,010
anything for

107
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:06,130
15

108
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,130
[Music]

109
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,800
years we

110
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:13,600
were was experimenting with just seeding

111
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,400
a

112
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,039
single blend of grass and that didn't

113
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,080
really seem to work so we started

114
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:23,440
working with a blend that would we could

115
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,280
get into the saline sodic

116
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:30,440
spots and just sort of experimented back

117
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:34,400
and forth and we came up with this blend

118
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:38,919
that uh this Seed Company calls the

119
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:42,560
Hamilton the blend is uh has some wheat

120
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:46,520
grasses in it it has a Garrison creeping

121
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,600
fox tail um it has a little bit of I

122
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,840
think they're putting a little bit of

123
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:54,080
fescue in it and then we also have some

124
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:58,080
slendy Max or a saline Al Alpha that can

125
00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:00,759
stand with sand saline areas

126
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,319
[Music]

127
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:06,360
well when we first was working with that

128
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:09,039
seed blend I wanted to put a mix in

129
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:11,840
there so a lot of times it's difficult

130
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:15,240
to get in to seed those due to being too

131
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:18,039
wet or so forth or so on and I had

132
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,759
seeded monocultures and if I had the

133
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:22,319
wrong weather event I would end up

134
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:25,360
losing everything so I what by putting

135
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,639
multiple species in there if it was too

136
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,400
saline uh then the wheat grasses would

137
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:33,759
take over if it was too sodic The

138
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,360
Garrison creep and fox tail and and

139
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:40,479
maybe the Fescue and Reeds would take

140
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:42,240
over and and with the the alala in there

141
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,080
what'll happen is is the wheat grasses

142
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:49,319
will go in those saline areas then that

143
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:51,479
here comes the great the the slendy Max

144
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:53,680
or the saline elf Alpha will start

145
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:55,479
fallowing that in and they complement

146
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,280
each other so if you have alphalpha

147
00:06:55,479 --> 00:07:00,479
there plus the grass you have a legume

148
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:03,639
growing some nitrogen and enhances your

149
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:06,240
forage production um if you cut it three

150
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:08,720
times your first cutting will be half

151
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,280
cool season half half Alpha then your

152
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,280
second cutting will be mostly all

153
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:15,080
alphaalpha if you cut it the third time

154
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:17,599
it'll sort of be half and half but by

155
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:21,280
having that together uh you're covering

156
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:24,479
all your bases and the soil

157
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:26,420
types uh determine which species Grows

158
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:29,680
Where

159
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:31,919
[Music]

160
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,759
we started doing business with a a guy

161
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:37,639
that is very good at delineating soil

162
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:39,599
types uh because we are extremely

163
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:42,879
variable and when I say extremely

164
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:45,599
variable uh we can go from Z to 150

165
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:48,159
bushel yield difference in corn and we

166
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:50,319
do that in 150 ft and we do that

167
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:54,280
multiple times across a half mile path

168
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:56,159
of our field as we've changed our and

169
00:07:54,280 --> 00:08:00,680
new technologies that are available to

170
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:02,680
us uh I started VAR aberrating my seed I

171
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,319
we kept Vari brating my

172
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,639
fertilizer um kept looking at these

173
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:10,639
areas and we started planting these

174
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:13,919
saling areas back to the Hamilton blend

175
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:17,000
3 four five acres at a time and since

176
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:20,759
2016 uh probably two years ago we'd

177
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:24,520
probably done 150 acres at that time uh

178
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:24,520
we've done more since

179
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,040
[Music]

180
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:37,000
the first step in recovering and is

181
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,399
first of all you have to make a change

182
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,320
and to the change that was the easiest

183
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:44,839
to make for us is to stop spraying those

184
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,440
areas well yeah you have to change your

185
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:48,399
attitude you have to change your mindset

186
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,240
you got to I do all the spraying so you

187
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:55,000
have to make sure you save those

188
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:57,000
spaces or don't spray them and and you

189
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,240
know be cognizant of your wind and so

190
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:04,399
forth and and care and try you

191
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:06,160
know in some Fields we've we've had

192
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:10,200
we're in the third year of not spraying

193
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,920
the sloos the Rye is a good way to amend

194
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,320
that

195
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:17,000
soil uh and it helps with your weed

196
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,880
control Japanese Millet will grow into

197
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:24,079
the sine salinity areas further than the

198
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:29,079
Rye will um both of those plants have a

199
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:29,079
phenomenal root system on them

200
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:36,160
uh going back to that kosha plant you

201
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,440
know the areas that didn't grow kosha

202
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,399
the next step when you stop spraying it

203
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,839
is we'll we'll have a stunted kosher

204
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,519
plant it'll be a grayish color and it

205
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:47,920
gets about this tall and never really

206
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:49,920
changes well next year you'll turn that

207
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,880
that kosha plant some of those areas

208
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,320
will turn into a dark green koser well

209
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,959
part of that is is you got to have those

210
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:01,000
plant species there that are putting

211
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:04,000
rots down that are putting EX down which

212
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,200
create your biology in your soil or your

213
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,760
Livestock in your soil then you can

214
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:11,399
start doing things if we just get out of

215
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,079
Mother Nature's Way She will fix herself

216
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:15,120
I'm convinced of that we're in the

217
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:17,410
process of trying to trying to actually

218
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,000
prove

219
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:22,440
[Music]

220
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,079
that if we can get kosha growing we can

221
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:28,200
use utilize livestock to harvest kosher

222
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:29,920
actually cattle really at a vegetative

223
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:33,360
state really like kosher

224
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,519
and kosha is your first step of maybe

225
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,839
barley fox tail livestock don't like

226
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,839
that so much but barley fox tail might

227
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:44,000
provide a a cover for seeding inter

228
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:48,079
seeding your grass seed into you know as

229
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:51,720
as a livestock and crop Farmers hay is a

230
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:56,120
crop and a lot of people strictly crop

231
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:59,519
farming don't consider hay a crop and so

232
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:01,680
you have to sort of change your mental

233
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:05,519
capacity and we're always looking for

234
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:08,399
forage and those areas well we're where

235
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:11,800
we've had the Hamilton we're doing 3 to

236
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:15,320
3 and 1/2 ton an acre on Acres that

237
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,320
weren't producing

238
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:19,120
[Music]

239
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,800
anything but the other thing is is when

240
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,279
we're seating This Grass blend is we

241
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,120
make the mistake of just going to the

242
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:29,680
edge of the salt actually we need you

243
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:34,279
make need to make three runs into the up

244
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:36,639
plan by doing that that so saine place

245
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:38,079
will fill in faster than just

246
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,639
concentrating on it so if you can take

247
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:44,120
your good land and sacrifice three

248
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:46,000
passes with a drill that'll enhance your

249
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:49,240
recovery a lot

250
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,800
more so if we can get uh if we can get

251
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:54,160
these plant species established in the

252
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:57,519
Upland and they're more mature they'll

253
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:00,480
handle the higher salt levels and saline

254
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:04,440
levels and then that way Our Roots will

255
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,440
just start leading the others in

256
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:19,839
there from a wildlife species

257
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,959
standpoint and it takes all the pressure

258
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,839
out of it because if he's spraying it

259
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:26,079
where where are our trouble wheat

260
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:28,560
they're growing in the areas

261
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,600
where where we can't grow a crop well

262
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,680
and even the going back to the hunting

263
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:35,959
or Wildlife you know it's really it's

264
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,920
tough hunting in a standing corn field

265
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:40,360
especially in 30in rows what's really

266
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,480
great is if you can push them out of the

267
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,720
cornfield into the saline spots that

268
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,360
we've got this perennial grass and you

269
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,560
have a great deer hunt or a great

270
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:51,279
pheasant hunt you know or Grouse or

271
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:54,880
whatever um you know that's another

272
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:58,560
thing is those saline areas that are put

273
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,959
to a plant species sort to become our

274
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,360
pollinator

275
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:05,920
you know so they have bugs which

276
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:10,519
pheasants like or other game um you know

277
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:13,320
there's another species of of animals or

278
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:16,279
insects that complement our whole

279
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:18,560
biology you

280
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:20,240
know you know you can have the best of

281
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,360
both worlds you can have something that

282
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:26,279
you can uh the cattle will like and and

283
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,160
for me the pheasant hunting and the hay

284
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:32,399
is important but really for me it became

285
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:34,279
a joy of watching a piece of soil that

286
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,279
did not grow anything it would not grow

287
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:39,600
a corn plant it would not grow a soybean

288
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:41,480
plant when go crocher we and and yes and

289
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,720
and now we're

290
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:47,560
growing very desirable plants we did

291
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,120
this without external fertilizer being

292
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,399
used and we did it without uh chemical

293
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,959
because there isn't a chemical We can

294
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:56,399
spray on you manage it by haying it you

295
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:59,120
can manage it by grazing it there's

296
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,010
better ways to do it than hey my planet

297
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,380
is this big and I want a square

298
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:04,380
[Music]

299
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,759
field I hope the Hamilton story has

300
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:13,279
helped you view salinity differently the

301
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:15,600
good news is that South Dakota has the

302
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,160
expertise to turn these Acres around

303
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,800
using natural

304
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:22,160
systems but this will take some thought

305
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:25,399
some time and some

306
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:28,639
planning visit this video description

307
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:31,399
below for more information and remember

308
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:34,560
like planting a tree the best time to

309
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:38,279
address salinity was 20 years ago the

310
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:44,399
second best time is today from growing

311
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:44,399
resilience I'm bz Clute so long
