1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,560
the one thing you don't want to do is

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,920
leave a whole bunch of them in one of

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:08,559
these little tiny cells to try and fight

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,160
for nutrition and fight for space if you

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,639
have too many in there their Roots you

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,360
know they're just going to become weak

7
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:15,920
and end up being spindly little

8
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,800
seedlings that probably won't transplant

9
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,400
very good so you want to make sure that

10
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:23,920
you keep up on that thinning process

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,920
throughout the next few weeks
