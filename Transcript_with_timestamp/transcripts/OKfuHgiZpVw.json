  "text": "[Music] hello this is my fully automatic fully expandable and customizable create crop Farm which uses the Gantry Carriage system so first I'm going to explain how the machine works and we're going to build it if you've seen my tree farm Design This is essentially the same machine but without the flipping saw so let's get into it this is essentially our main machine we have Harvesters connected to a Gantry Carriage which goes along our Gantry shaft here we have two Redstone contacts on each end of the Gantry shaft to detect when the Harvester has arrived on either end of the machine each of the Redstone contact is connected to a redstone link when our Harvester arrives at either end of the farm our Redstone contact will send a redstone signal through this link which will then be received by this Redstone receiver this Redstone receiver will then send a signal to toggle or toggle LEDs which will then power or on power our gearshift this gear shift if powered will then reverse the rotation of our Gantry shaft moving the machine back and forth a ganty cage will move along the ganty shaft depending on its rotation if we reverse the rotation the ganty cage will come towards us and if we don't the gany cage will move away from us so this is mainly how we're moving our Harvesters here now this you know how the farm Works let's build it first set up your Gantry shaft this can be as long or short as you need then Place The ganty Carriage on one end and linear chassis on top of it now this can be as long or short as you need as well then you want to put your Harvesters on both sides of the chassis once that's done you want to put the Redstone contacts on both ends of the Gantry carriage and then you want to put the connections to those Redstone contacts from the other end skip one block and put it here then you want to connect Redstone links to your Redstone contacts then you want to give your machine some storage and a portable storage interface for the output and then you can finally glue them all together um quick note on either end of your gante shaft skip one block before you start planting your crops if you start planting your crops here or here um your crops will be uprooted because this is where your machine is going to rest every time it's going to change directions so just from this one end skip one block and then this is where you start planting same on this side as well this is the end of the ganed cage skip one block this is where you're going to start planting your crops when that's all done you want to connect your gante shaft to two normal shafts and then here you can connect your gear shift if you connect your gear shift here um these Redstone contacts will power your gear shift and it will break your machine so just skip two uh leave these two alone and then put your gear shift here then you want to connect your gear shift to a toggled power lch if you don't want an off switch you can just put put the rest link directly next to the toggle power ledge but if you want an off switch place a block next to the toggle power ledge skip one block place your link here a normal repeater facing into the block a sticky piston facing to the block and a lever to toggle the off switch this is on this is off now very important you need to set up a unique frequency for your Redstone link so it doesn't mess up with other Redstone l in your world this example we're going to use a sticky piston here and also to make a redstone link into a receiver you can either shift right click or you can use a wrench as you can see it's now getting powered because it's on the same frequency so to turn the machine on just flip the lever and there you go the machine is on another quick note rotation speed doesn't really matter if your rotation speed is faster that means your Harvester will go faster um but it does generally affect the performance of the farm so yeah you can put just one water wheel or however much you need right now for just take of example we're using a 32 RPM uh water wheel but yeah you can make this into an 8 RPM or like a 16 RPM it doesn't matter it's all good so now the last thing to do is to set up your output your storage output so what you want to do is to find your ganty cage skip one block so it's here and then you want to find the level at which your storage output is on the machine itself you want to put it here nope want to put it here facing towards the machine you want to set up a funnel and two chests and you have a choot above it you can either use hoppers or shoots whatever you need so there basically the machine set up now as you can see this will unload the crops into our shoot and into the chest that is it for the fully automatic fully customizable and expandable crop Farm using the create mode I hope you enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next one bye-bye",
