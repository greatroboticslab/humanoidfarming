  "text": "[Music] while farming anyway as a way of life it's not a job it's a way of life you're gonna be a bottom entity that's how you have to look at it and organics definitely is you have to open from my personal point of view is you have to work with nature of course within organic farming is a whole spectrum you're getting some organic farmers who just see that not using chemicals as they is the answer but they're still using the industrial model of inputs and outputs in their in their head and then you get fertility that you have to start seeing the farm as a whole and has to be a balance there and that is one of the main principles of a biodynamic farm that behind this concept you have that it it has to be not bringing in inputs from outside that you see that the whole farm is a kind of whole which has to be in balance but you have to be able to be use all the feed for your animals of that farm that they in turn will if you have the right balance of animals will produce enough manure so different sorts to maintain and increase the fertility on the farm the important for in biodynamic is to have the farmers in organism so the farm is able to produce all its own manure and it put a label to produce its own fertility what people do here which is much more efficient of course is then to use the clover to feed it to your ruminants to your cattle to your sheep you know to your cows and they in return give you when you are it's very important that we all try and go as organic as possible for the health of everyone and I think to try and reduce the amount of chemicals that we're using because firstly if the food is not organic you're eating a lot of chemicals anyway and then there's lots of chemicals used to grow that food so if you can go organic then it would reduce the damage to the environment and then on top of that in biodynamic farming there is the concept of the preparations which are I think enhancing the manure to a way that the manure is able to really support the plant life for it to support the animals and the people that live on the farm and feed of the farm so again in creating this cycle of health and sustainability by having the cows eating grass that is suitable for them that is healthy and then this money also goes into the vegetable garden this money also goes into producing grain in cereals which then is fed the people through through the farm shop with organic food it's a very whole environment that you grow up in so everything is affecting that food and I think that makes you very aware of your environment and what you're bringing in and what you're putting out so I think to learn to grow organically is vital for how you treat the tree and I think if you experience the goodness that the organics brings in to your food into your environment then you start to see what else needs to be done around you cows biodynamically which means that all of their food comes from our own farm and it's all grown organically and we use biodynamic preparations the cows have their horns which we feel is very important for the digestive systems which is also reflected in the milk and the milk is more nutritious and they get to be outside all through year of the year and in the summer months spring summer autumn that they're out on grass eating grass which is most natural way for a cow and you can really taste in the milk that it is sort of fresher more nutritious and a lot of milk which is you know blended for many different farms in which is an organic I think the future is definitely for people to see not just organic or production but a small-scale small-scale production which is much more manageable for people and is able to employ more people and empower more people as to where their food come from and to have healthy food and have a stronger connection with their food because with industrial farming we have lost connection with the source of our food and the quality of our food one person can go to sue and buy pepper doesn't matter what time of the year we are able to import fruit and vegetables from all over the world and we don't think about where food comes from and how much effort goes into it but in this farm it's a small farm 200 acre farm the people who are fed from this farm that people are in touch with this farm it's much more in touch with the food I eat mainly vegetarian some fish and I tend to buy from local farmers markets only I hardly ever enter a supermarket anymore and eat mainly organic food mainly vegetarian I was vegetarian completely for it was only two years but I will eat the meat from this farm or from our sister farm table house because it's biodynamic I know the people looking after the animals and I know what food they're eating and they're their environment that they've grown up in so as long as I know that I'm happy to eat the meat I became vegetarian when I was six so I haven't eaten meat in a long time and I think probably if I wasn't already vegetarian then I would probably eat organic and biodynamic meat but I don't really have any need for meat now so I stay vegetarian I was vegetarian as a child the whole family was vegetarian but I own eat organic meat really oh by dynamically vegetarian methods which are available which can show that we're not just talking about minerals and pure substance but there are forces in our food and working in nature and one of those methods was developed by Pfeiffer when he developed the chromatography and I'm dr. Callisto as well with the crystallization method and by using that method you can see other than just the chemical constituents of something but it actually shows completely different picture depending on how alive or dead it is if there are forces in that or not and and these pictures are quite objective and it's absolutely clear you can take a dead soil and take a sample from that and one which has been enlivened of that same soil with compost and by dynamic methods and it creates a completely different picture each farm is a small community of friend colleagues for being interested in organic agriculture and what the farm does here is to do with the fact that you can involve the community in it and also when you work with biodynamic agriculture organic agriculture they're actually producing food that people can trust so after I became more interested in organic food and growing my own food and cooking my own food I got also interested in what isn't organic or the conventional and and the use of GMOs and me personally I'm completely against using GMOs when you're cooking or or eating or anywhere because they unfortunately are everywhere plant is genetically modified it's missing a vital part of the life of the plant and when you consume that you're also missing that vital part of life yeah I personally don't believe or believe in GMOs because of the health benefits of wealth for people and for the for the planet as a whole I don't think there that's gene-splicing is an advantage I haven't seen proof of it getting better yields the only potential downsides I think and which is why I avoid it is that it'll have an effect on us do you know food I think is a limiting food source and limit your diet it limits the variety you can eat and it makes you very dependent on the seed companies that produce this GMO seed you can't save the seed you can't grow next year from the same seed so for me that raises questions about how good it is for you if it yes it's not fertile enough to produce its own seed that is viable then to eat foods like that I don't know how good that is for your body the Terminator gene in it which means that the plant is not able to produce seeds for the next generation how does that affect also honor on a material level on a nutrient level maybe there is nothing there it's the same as organic or biodynamic soya but for me from a quality point of view ask the question how does it affect my own fertility if I'm eating food that is not able to carry its offspring is not able to produce the next generation is God is that not just only not able to is got a gene that that is a terminator that kills it the the risk of cross contamination not only from one plant or the other but from one plant to bacteria to other organisms and so on and so on it's a you don't know what you are unleashing you have no idea but what one thing is absolutely sure whatever you do it's completely irreversible you will never be able to stop it again once it's out there it will be out there if it's working out in a bad way there's no way to reverse this process I'm very suspicious of GMOs I have to say I always try to buy from local farms when I don't get my food from my own farm and then I know I can trust the food I know that I can talk to the farmers and see how it was made and you know understand the attitude of the people who made it so that's really important to me GMOs have clearly you know they've historically they've been associated with using pesticides they've been associated with you know infertility of seeds and things like that and exploitation of farmers so personally they're clear with them as much as I can but also in the UK as well as in a lot of countries sometimes unless you are buying organic it's impossible to know because they don't label that something has got GMOs in it so that makes it very hard to always be certain and the last thing is that it you know now a time and time again it proves that GMO doesn't work again it's the question of sustainability the fact that I saw maybe a field of of GMO corn and it's grown a good crop one year it doesn't mean that it will go food every year a lot of GMO crops have proved to fail they don't have higher yields but and they still need to have pesticides herbicides and fungicides and the result of it is then you get resistant strains like the super weeds like and and this just becomes a it just becomes an accelerating process so if you get super weeds then you need to use more poisons and more poisons and then you need the weeds get stronger and stronger and you're not really solving the problem the problem is not really solved well if you create a balanced ecological system and acknowledge the fact that there will be weeds that they will be pests and there will be diseases but to keep it in in a balanced way I think it's much more healthier slightest interest in going back to growing your own food or buying from local growers you should try and do it because to me that is the future basically when you live in a city and you live just with technology all around you where life is so very so fast-paced you actually gradually completely lose your identity and you completely lose a sense of what life really is about so for me the journey of returning back to nature and to working with the soil and with plants every day has just been an amazing journey like I have had so many moments in the last year year and a half where I felt so content and so connected and where I've really been able to feel joy just being with color with yeah sounds of nature there's so much more than just nutrition that you get so if you have a chance and I would say try and leave that bubble where you're completely blinded and numbed by technology and just try and go back to nature wherever you can find it really it I think it states the only way for its small scale growing a lot of small farms aren't able to grow and specialize in certain things and but grow also a wide variety of food in vegetables it's also fun you know it is I wouldn't choose it if it wasn't I like it's very seasonal it's very rhythmic you always have the most amazing food right at your fingertips so I would definitely recommend everyone get into farming but it is really hard work and obviously if you're doing farming and do organic farming because if you are a young person living in a city and you have a desire to find out what it's all about you just need to go onto websites like the woof websites or help X or there are so many resources on the internet now that can allow you to go and stay on organic farms in your own country even you don't have to travel around the world but that you can go and stay at places like that and get an experience volunteering for a few months or even for a few weeks that would be a great thing to do or alternatively try and find in your own City if there are a lot months available community projects community allotments like here in the UK we have quite a lot of those projects and even while I was still working in an office I used to go and volunteer on Sunday afternoons try and find some of these projects and help thee allow these projects to help you spark something we need to change your lifestyle I really understand organics is about just five you [Music] [Music] you hi this is Bart from the no plot no pod or today we're here at rounder organic farms with out of silverstein Meyer and at was going to take us on a tour of this organic farm and teach us some of the tricks that he uses crops without pesticides or fertilizers now most people when they keep chickens they may not even have a single - you can build a roosting pet and you kept all the manure it's very cool see all the manure that's accumulating great fertilizer so basically if you look around in this room that is the only spot the chickens have to sit even awhile other than the nesting boxes but if you look like above the nesting boxes how we did that slope over there that's so they can't sit up there I see they really spend all their time when they're in here sitting over there okay that's why all the manure accumulates over there and then there's a trap door something is a trap door on the outside of the building you lift up and you can shovel that manure out okay how long does it take to collect that much I mean that's like a year that's a year okay depends on how many chickens you have and but supposedly they're like 70 to 80% or more of their manure is being dropped right there okay and that manure is pretty concentrated very concentrated hot fertilizer you probably want to let it sit okay and I see compost to that for a year how much coverage would you get out of that much fertilizer well I mean usually when I'm spreading and I'm just spreading like a quarter inch you know on surface and soil are 500 pounds per acre okay you don't really eat you this whole body let's go around back here okay door that they can get in and out of here huh over the fence out here okay and they took over the edge okay so okay your tractor over with the bucket yeah the remnants of the veggies you know yep and leaving their fertilizer for us very nice so that's part of it [Applause] and then I'm kind of a big believer and just for taking care of your soil and then if you have healthy soils that most for the most part most soils have a lot of the nutrients that the plants need and a lot of times when you have poor growth that's because plants can't get at the nutrients that they need okay so a lot of times just by working your soils by tilling them by irrigating them well in our case irrigation spreading some manure you'll you'll start to improve the soil over the years of just just the factor of aerating them you know just telling them growing some kind of a crop even if you're just growing a cover crop like a crop that's just to improve the soil okay clover or alfalfa and then later in the season just mow that down or till that back into the soil okay and that process kind of helps rejuvenate the soils and so part of what I'm doing is I've got you know 15 acres but I may be growing veggies on five acres and and the other acreage each year is is either fallow it's unused or it's been some kind of a cover crop that's growing so and I sort of have this slow approach I'm not real big on fertilizers I kind of feel like the chemical fertilizers time to pump things up they increase the amount of water that the plans I've taken crop gets bigger but I don't think it necessarily makes it taste better and I don't think that if you're not in a hurry then you get the same kind of yields without the chemical fertilizers it just takes a look maybe a little bit longer for the plants to reach maturity but I think they're healthier I think sometimes if your plants are growing too fast they're weak so I kind of had this idea that plants like people have an immune system and that that they have a resistance to things like pests but if they're weak the pests will have at them and you see that we I see that in the field because often the ends of my badge the far ends are the part where the pests do the most damage and a part of that is the pressure coming from outside the field but part of is that the the ones the plants that are growing at the ends of the beds are always the weakest because they get trampled as you walk you know cut the corners with the tractor or they don't get weeded as well or they don't get watered as well because they're at the edge of the irrigation set so those plants are weaker to begin with and then that weakness translates into them having more pressure from pests huh that's interesting I got that from one of my teachers who was really into the whole immune system and immunities when they're weak and you definitely see that as plants start to decline the pests kind of will move in the other thing big thing that we're doing out here for pests really is not mono cropping you know I do have some crops like corn maybe we'll have a quarter acre of it but for the most part you know what you see little patches yes the row of that field that are that are mostly just grown for the birds that like them I grow there's a couple of crops that I grow like dill and cilantro that I will let go to flower and those flowers will attract beneficial insects okay but the big thing about having the diversity is just that you're you're reducing the habitat for the for the bad insects for your past so if you have a you know 10 acres of corn and then you have a pests it likes corn they're just going to flourish in there and go crazy in your corn but if you just have a little passion then you have something else to have something else that there's different pests that like each different crop so you're sort of giving them less territory to move in and at least in our climate a lot of the pests actually they they emigrate and each year they don't overwinter here so each year they have to come find you and if you've just got a little bit of this and a little bit of that it's harder for them to find you very loose yeah and then of course you're also you're putting yourself at less risk in terms of failure if you have one crop that fails out of 25 crops that you're growing it's not as much a problem as if you're just going to crops and you lose one of them so that's another way that diversity helps so it sounds like diversity is a big part of your strategy all the way around it is and also for nutrients per pass for diseases soil diseases so diversity also plays into rotation where you're not growing the same crop in the same land over and over again cauliflower and there's the Crucifier CA which is like the or Brassica brassicas they're called broccoli cauliflower kale cabbage all those are in that same family let's see what other vegetable crops are there there's the alliums which is like the onions the garlic shallots leeks all those other smelling I look I've got a book that's a little more of a guy that would give us like all the information but but the idea is that each you know there really aren't that many different plant families that we have I think in justify vegetables and they each one of those plant families as you get to know them as a farmer they really are this is very similar you know broccoli grows very similar to cauliflower they like the same conditions they use the same so really that plays into a very nice the other thing we do for passes we use these this reamain material that's gonna be hard to come by in order stuff through the mail but that is a like a fabric it's probably something they could make very similar but like we have problems with a certain pass that gets on our soft leafed like the taut soy's and the BOK Choy's of stuff it's the flea beetle will just eat those up so we cover those crops with this very thin kind of fabric it's an agricultural fabric rimae and it allows the air and the water and the sunlight you have some of that around crawl around the breakers but it's just much much less okay so that's what it sounds like is that you're never going to eliminate your pass on an organic farm but doing everything you can to interrupt their lifecycle yep yep and you know people some people are you know we we have the benefit of growing in a desert climate so we don't really have the kinds of best measures that some people have but like our organic fruit tree growers and they're spraying some kind of an oil that has some kind of a plant extract in it that's sick to those bugs you know okay and it's organic because it's made with organic source materials that still sort of be very intensive it requires a lot of intervention yeah mostly what I'm doing is doesn't require a lot of intervention I'm mostly succeeding by the diversity like I mentioned and volume and also choosing it to grow here where there's not a lot of pests various yeah do you bring in beneficial insects you know I have before but for the most part I've kind of stopped doing that it's really most effective when you when you're in like a greenhouse and you can keep them from flying away you know and they do sell like you can get these bags of ladybugs and you go and you spread them and they're ravenous when they come and and then you just watch them go to work but later they're kind of gone okay move on unless there's something most of what I try to do is just again create that habitat for them so when I grow these breaks of dill and cilantro and the ladybugs are drawn to that and then they'll they'll go out and find other food okay so dill and cilantro or your big favorites for a favorites there there in Umbra philaret family I was one family we didn't talk about the character in that family what else is in that family I'm bull philaret it's and and they make they all make a similar kind of flower that's it's like an umbrella okay I'm bull comes from and and those flower heads that's dill okay that's the classic humble family so there's quite a few plants that have that same shaped sometimes they're white sometimes a yellow but they always have that kind of open up you know okay and do you plant the dill in with other crops directly no but what happens is it goes to seed every year okay every year it's kind of just comes up wherever it and if I don't weed it out then it's it's there okay in this case I specifically left this I mowed over the tops and most of this potatoes to knock the weeds down but I didn't know this people would want deal for their pickling projects I say that worked out what do we have grown over here that kind of diversity is more just about people enjoying the different colors we see these sections that's one other thing that happens that works against okay so I'll clump together these breasts because even though ideally maybe they would be more separated you know these are all to get water Dalton and that's probably [Music] okay rocks in our soil [Music] [Music] [Music] have things come up in onedrive now over over like several years of farming you'll start to see different types of weeds that you didn't have before just because they're your soil okay and what types of things can you deal with where I can get the tractor set up and and tear through there with blades behind my wheels and and get a lot of the weeds that way but for most of the crops use in this pulling motion towards you the biggest thing that I found about weeding is that the timing is really critical you have to leave before the weeds get too big or you wind up doing a lot more work and so getting to the weeds at just the right point is really important in terms of being efficient also the moisture level of the soil is really important when you're weeding so in our climate where it's dry and we can control the moisture level you know I try to make sure that the soil that we're we're cultivating hoeing is not soaking wet because it'll just the mud will just clog up your tool you also don't want it to be super super dry because the soil just gets hard when it's dry but it's got to be kind of somewhere in between a little bit of moisture and then right after we cultivate we want the weeds that have been cut up to just bake in the Sun so we don't want to irrigate for another day or two after we wheat okay then we can start to irrigate again you know where you're where you're in a climate where you're relying on rain you have to really like be on top of okay like today's the day we've got a weed today because the conditions are right so the weeding is most effective limit conditions are the weeds are at the right height the moisture levels right so to me being really successful about weeding is just keeping at it all season kind of starting early I start when the weeds are just like tiny tiny weeds and you can barely see them and we just start and it's very quick like you just weed a whole pad in almost no time because there's not much but still it makes a difference so I just kind of try to start early and stay on top of it how often do you weave well you know it's it's kind of like a part of our season like early in the season we're doing green house work and field prep work then were to get into planting big time and usually by the middle of May we're almost done with our planting and we're really getting into weeding and then we have a period of about like a month and a half where that's like all we do and I hire a crew I bring people in to help us with weeding because it's a big labor need but we suddenly have and then it kind of goes on you know it kind of trickles in and it gets really big and then it kind of goes on for almost the rest of the season it kind of slows down towards the end because we stop leading certain crops and other crops we have to weed again or maybe you know a second or third time okay what do we have here and they don't Trump on the crops too bad and how many turkeys do you have out here are there any artichokes oh yeah here a couple on the plant you can see the ladybugs all over really cool you got the ladybugs that are eating the aphids and the other thing you get is so much right now that you get ants that farm the aphids the ants there's an ant they bring the aphid eggs up and they put them on the plant and then they come back and they harvest the little baby aphids to eat okay and then the the ladybugs kind of key in on it and there's a lot of wasps that come in too and I mean these plants right now I think it's just kind of cooled down so it's slowed down but in the middle of the summer I was just like crazy to barely walk in here insects everywhere and so ladybugs are pretty much your primary beneficial around here it seems like they're a big beneficial for sure' to get really tough so what I'm trying to do here is Hill it up I'm trying to use the tracker to bury these things with dirt and then that'll sort of blanch them and make them turn white and tender hopefully nice I can almost smell the peanut butter and raisins that's good so this whole section here is all being irrigated with this drip tape and this is like the most efficient way to irrigate the waters just pushed down into the tube and there's little holes that are kind of pre-drilled into this seam it allows the water to dribble out and so for the whole run there's like a little bit of water dribbling out every 12 inches and the lines stay on for a long time like five or six hours until it's saturated it's very efficient you're not watering you know in between the bed so they don't so anyway that's drip tape and so you've got some main pipes and then you keep branching down branching down and the drip tapes obviously at the end of the whole chain yeah we have a really big berry that comes up in Judy's risers every 40 feet and then on these risers I can either go with a sprinkler line PPC pipe and then go into the drip tapes okay so it goes to PVC up at the other end there okay do you have one of the drip tapes starting off from the PVC somewhere yeah okay it looks like well and all I really do is I wasn't working it's a very simple system I I drill a hole in the PVC it's slightly smaller than the outside diameter is - okay Mike ran the tube in there drip tape and Fram that you've been there and then you just pinch off both ends of the drip tape yeah I decided I'm not okay they do make special fittings for all this stuff you know they make a special fitting for this bar they make a special fitting for this kind of cheap way of doing it if it works that's what the line first fill it up we go down make sure it's not and I know that most types of sweet corn for modern farming have been bred so that there's only one year per block of corn that's probably true is is that how this corn is or no no this okay and what variety of corn assist oh yeah sunflowers sunflowers are really trend pull it okay look what some of them are bigger it's the type do you have different varieties in here yeah a lot of different varieties so this man my little label say what the boys are Atlas Danvers and Nan tez those are the three varieties in this bed okay the water there you go yeah yeah look at that that's a healthy-looking carrot mmm lots carrot still he picked some basil and scallions okay there's the rest of the beans those were highly productive and we had to just stop picking them cuz we just kind of ran out of labor so these are onions you were showing us one of the onions you this picture from I plant them from little onion transplant so someone else grows them from seed they probably start them in the fall they overwinter them and then I when I buy them in the spring for transplanting they're just tiny little onion shoes this this was like mm okay and what is this maybe an eighth of an acre or something no not even now it would be well about about 24 beds per acre and it was just okay here we've got a bunch of lettuce is there anything tricky about the lettuce tender I plant it over and over and over again okay that's the big secret it's just always having a fresh crop so I have a lot of land here so I fill up a new section and plant a new section of salad about every week in December okay maybe two weeks go by okay and so your greenhouse is mainly for starting stuff melons do not really ripen up very well okay at the end and open on the sides it will retain a huge amount plus of course it's much hotter in there during the day you you okay so you basically just have two tractors and these are set up to weed the three rows that we throw in our beds so these blades work the soil the the wheel and this back are kind of rolling along floating along okay these brackets allow the plates to go to move up and down I see and then this is this is cutting into the soil so the idea is this is just below the surface of the soil this area here is being left untouched in between those two blades but but this is being cultivated this is being cultivated and so there's three lines that are left three parallel lines and those are the where the crops are this marker so when we're when we're planting I will mark the fields with these and that will give us three furrows and then we'll drop our transplants that we've grown like our broccoli transplants or our lettuce transplants into those three furrows okay then we can come back with front part and weed it without hitting you know if you if you're not hitting one row you're not hitting the other two rows right because they're parallel and then also with the big tractor the other thing that I do that we didn't talk about is I do some direct seeding of that so I've got three Cedars that I put on the on the bar on the bat and I can fill those up with carrot seeds like I was there are corn or beets or there's a whole bunch of different crops that I direct so these beans all those things I'll dump those seats in the cedar and then drive down and then that's putting the seed right below the surface of the soil again the spacing on those three rows would match the spacing of these and this may see my cultivators okay I'm able to go back and do the cultivating Louis we still cultivate everything by hand but this allows us to come through very quickly I can you know in a couple hours go cultivate a whole acre and you know it's not a hundred percent thorough but it's a eighty ninety percent kind of thing and then come back by hand to finish this job off well it seems like a neat little tractor let's go see your double digger okay series of eight lays mine does it come in different widths and what happens is the blades make a motion kind of like this they shop straight down and then they they kind of loop back they're making a circular motion and what happens is they're they're chopping up the soil as you move forward very very slowly with the tractor they're slicing off like maybe a half inch or an inch of a trench that you're working and they go down for ten or twelve inches maybe even more and then as they make their backward motion they catch the top half of that tilling depth maybe five or six inches and they they fling it backwards pulverized and just like you get with a rototiller now if it's too dry it'll be you know it won't rise once your content really is very critical on this implement okay but if the conditions are right what you wind up with is you know you wind up with soil but you can stick your arm down to your elbow it's loose down that far the bottom half of that tilling death has been loosened the top half has been actually blended they don't get mixed together okay whereas a roto tiller would just mix them part of what you're doing with the whole thing I was talking about like the life of the soil and trying to keep your soils healthy you know most of the life of your soil is just in those top couple of inches that's where all the biological activity where the oxygen is permeating the worms are doing their cycling up and down so when you when you wrote a tilling or tilling down 8 or 10 inches and you're sort of blending it all up it's not that you're killing it but you're losing sort of your concentration of your life you know so if you can try to avoid that it's better [Music] sometimes the old technology works better and then to something I guess okay on the bottom of the bed there that all moves and as the chain runs there's like a beater arm somewhere that pushes yeah pushes this big wheel around okay just like one notch at a time and that turns the chain that is this all driven from the tires from the tires and you have control over various aspects of it with these levers okay but supposedly one of them what control like how much was letting out and control how fast it was moving I see neat piece of equipment how old would you guess that is [Laughter] like blog today so really appreciate it I'll be ready next time great thanks for coming out yep thank you",
