1
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:12,050
so now I'm saying and I'll doing three

2
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:13,880
roosting poll one at ten I think that

3
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:16,430
should keep you far enough away from

4
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:21,110
heritage of the pooping that poop can go

5
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:22,520
down here and off the bottom I don't

6
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:24,520
think they're gonna don't want to go

7
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:28,460
right on the ground

8
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:30,979
so it's kind of thing if I went 10 25

9
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:35,619
they're given 15 inches apart from each

10
00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:39,710
other and then if I went 40 down here

11
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:41,660
that giving 15 inches from these roots

12
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:44,530
from each other and it would keep them

13
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:46,759
16 inches off the ground

14
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:48,289
kind of curious what you think about

15
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:49,970
that it's right after the roost holes

16
00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:51,710
for now I'd like to hear your

17
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:53,869
suggestions in the comments below I can

18
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:55,100
always move the rooster poles around so

19
00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:57,590
you think that's a good number

20
00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:10,450
let me know you don't let me know why

21
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:10,450
and what Heights you'd put it at pole

22
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,150
got it

23
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:55,150
all right now that we got our three

24
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:57,989
poles it's gonna go ahead take care of

25
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,989
for the research

26
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:29,500
good job look that put that one up on

27
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:32,580
this Marx one go ahead put your end up

28
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,580
of pre-drilling

29
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:42,520
down like that

30
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:08,490
all right now we're gonna do the water

31
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,120
set up with make an automatic water

32
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:12,030
again

33
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:15,090
I have the ball automatic bowl of water

34
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:18,060
right here to my old chicken coop step

35
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:20,310
well then use that 55-gallon drum I'll

36
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:23,100
show you that in a second we're just

37
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:25,080
gonna set this up a little dirty clean a

38
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,610
lot runs it out but they sent us up low

39
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,830
girls will always have fresh water right

40
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:31,110
in the bowl one I'm sure the Ducks are

41
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:33,680
gonna love this we just got this

42
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:35,880
55-gallon drum that we had set up for

43
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,510
collecting rainwater that was gonna here

44
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:42,120
you got to stick it's one up high and

45
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:43,980
one down low the one up high we use the

46
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,920
one that's filled up we hook up a hose

47
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:48,870
around another 55-gallon drum just had

48
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,570
him continuously in line collecting

49
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:56,480
rainwater but for this purpose we're

50
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:56,480
going to use it for automatic water

51
00:05:00,739 --> 00:05:05,209
the reason why I left the stakes high

52
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:19,549
god no she slipped flipped on we just

53
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,549
clamp it in place

54
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:57,510
so now the 55-gallon drums all filled up

55
00:05:55,170 --> 00:06:00,390
actually overfilled it this was all

56
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:02,010
filled up you're just gonna be a little

57
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:05,340
patient and adjust your float you don't

58
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:06,960
want to overflow you might have to keep

59
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,700
an eye on it see if the chickens mess

60
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,340
but let us see if it gets disturbed at

61
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:14,220
all just keep an eye on that and our old

62
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:15,810
chicken coop we had this set up with the

63
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,660
55-gallon drum and set up with a

64
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:20,730
rainwater catchment so the chickens

65
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:22,290
always in the summertime spring all the

66
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:24,870
chickens always spring summer and fall

67
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:26,790
had fresh water in that we know how to

68
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:29,700
fill it up with a hose it's just being a

69
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:31,680
metal roof over the chicken coop pull

70
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:33,390
the gutter set right into the 55-gallon

71
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,230
drum they always had a constant supply

72
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:36,230
of clean fresh water

73
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:23,880
now we're just about ready for the

74
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:26,630
heavens put some hay in there we'll let

75
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,630

76
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:41,570
I'm just gonna leave this other deal is

77
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:43,430

92
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,360
few minutes but they're gonna have

93

they're gonna have a blast with it

94
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,260
