  "text": "[Music] It's getting to that time of year where many of us start thinking about planting our gardens. A main stay in most Wyoming gardens would be the tomato plant. The tomato plant is a great plant. When selecting the tomato plant, we want to look for certain things. We want to pick a plant with overall health. We want to look for any broken branches. We especially want to look for plants that are growing straight and uh and don't have any discoloration on the leaves, any signs of disease or any insects on them. When we select the plant, most of the tags will tell us how many days it is to maturity. We want to certainly select a plant that will work in our where we live and in in our zone. When we transplant the tomato plant, we can gently take the tomato plant out, remembering that we can pluck the bottom branches off and actually plant the plant deeper than than where it is in the pot. Many people like to select plants with uh blossoms on them and maybe even some tomatoes. Uh remember, with tomato plants, size doesn't necessarily matter. The more blossoms and the more tomatoes there are on the plant, the more transplanting stress the plant's going to go through. A big red tomato is a great addition to any kitchen table and I hope many of you have lots this year. This is Hudson Hill, University of Arming Extension and you're watching From the Ground Up.
