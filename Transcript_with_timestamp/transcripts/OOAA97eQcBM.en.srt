00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:15,599
behind farm shed doors across australia

3
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:19,760
sits machinery worth hundreds of

4
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,760
thousands even millions of dollars

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,359
machinery purchases are big ticket items

6
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,599
for australian grain growers who are

7
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,840
often presented with differing opinions

8
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,800
around investment options

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,680
that's why grdc initiated a two-year

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,760
project to develop a comprehensive guide

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,920
for growers in australia's cropping

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,840
regions to support informed

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,960
decision-making around machinery

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,280
purchases farm machinery investment

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,200
questions are often labored over

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,079
and making sure that you've got

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,680
i guess

18
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,640
an investment that's adequate to do the

19
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,760
job

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,840
efficiently and effectively

21
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,800
is important first and foremost but also

22
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,079
making sure that you're not over

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,559
capitalised

24
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,119
the guide contains data relevant across

25
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,240
grdc's northern and southern cropping

26
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,360
regions

27
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,320
it features 30 case studies gleaned from

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:15,520
information provided by more than 450

29
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,520
growers including darren's andrew todd

30
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,000
who shared their machinery purchase and

31
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,320
ownership experiences compared to

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,800
industry averages for similar farm

33
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,640
operations

34
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,799
[Music]

35
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,759
andrew's machine investments are matched

36
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:35,119
to meet darren's low rainfall and sandy

37
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:37,840
soils constraints he says depreciation

38
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:40,320
which the guide examines is a big issue

39
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,799
in a market where new machinery values

40
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,040
are rising rapidly we picked this one up

41
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,079
second hand in february this year the

42
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,680
new ones

43
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,000
we priced up were

44
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,079
fairly ecsty and not available in time

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,799
for this year's program so pick this one

46
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,439
up used fair enough the guide's tools

47
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,439
include a new benchmarking formula for

48
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,520
growers to calculate their machinery

49
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,600
investment levels relative to their

50
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,600
overall farm profit

51
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,759
calculating the ratio against the

52
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,120
average is based on the value of a

53
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:13,840
growers farm plant adding labor costs

54
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,520
maintenance and contracting and then

55
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,200
pitching that against gross farm income

56
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,520
once they've done that that ratio of

57
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,920
those costs versus gross farm income

58
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,599
should be about 0.34 if you're on the

59
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,520
lower side of that you're more efficient

60
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,040
with your farm machinery investment than

61
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,480
perhaps other peers

62
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,760
if you're on the higher side you might

63
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,080
be a little bit over capitalised when it

64
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,239
comes to farm machinery the traditional

65
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,280
measure has been machinery investment

66
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,239
per

67
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:43,040
cropable hectare or perhaps per tonne of

68
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:45,200
grain produced where this guide or this

69
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,080
ratio if you like is

70
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:51,280
taking into consideration maintenance

71
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,879
labor and also the use of contracting

72
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,360
which is

73
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,200
very relevant and something that the

74
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,440
previous measures probably haven't taken

75
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,440
consideration of

76
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,440
the guide also encourages growers to

77
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,239
maintain an up-to-date machinery value

78
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,319
inventory especially with rising costs

79
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,519
and tighter access across machinery

80
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,200
supply

81
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,360
and the guide will be continually

82
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,480
updated to match changing industry

83
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,959
pressures

84
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,480
the ratio that has been developed there

85
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,920
will continue to evolve i think there

86
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,000
might be things that might get added to

87
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,840
that in time as farming businesses

88
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,760
change uh and of course you know we've

89
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,840
got challenges with uh

90
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,680
seasonal staff etc

91
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,200
and potentially you know the rise of

92
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,799
autonomy within a farm business might

93
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,240
see some of those numbers change a

94
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:41,279
little bit absolutely

95
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:41,279
