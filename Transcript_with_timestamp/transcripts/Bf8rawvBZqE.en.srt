1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:04,980
okay look at this nice and neat

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:06,000
organized Farm you guys isn't this

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,560
awesome

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,230
I love it

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,950
fantastic

6
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:16,100
[Music]

7
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:16,100
[Applause]

8
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:21,000
well come back everybody to Farming

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,699
Simulator 22 I'm an old guy gaming and

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,980
we are coming back starting this episode

11
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:28,740
with an end of the month update for July

12
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,580
uh this has been an incredibly busy

13
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,880
month

14
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,440
um with working contracts and um we've

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,120
made quite a bit of money

16
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,620
but we also had to borrow some more

17
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,660
money to get everything done so we're

18
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,180
gonna have to get that squared away I

19
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,620
just finished turning in the rest of the

20
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,180
silage Bales to finish up the hay

21
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,239
contract so everything that's on my

22
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,700
trailer and that you see in the field is

23
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:54,059
what's left over for the silage

24
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:57,300
uh we did a bunch of harvesting

25
00:00:54,059 --> 00:01:00,239
contracts uh we did some canola and a

26
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:03,180
bunch of Wheat and oats and as a result

27
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,100
of that I got about a hundred straw

28
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,119
bales so we got a massive amount of

29
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:10,200
straw bales

30
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:12,360
uh doing all that and um we got a total

31
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,760
of about six hay bales of the large hay

32
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,100
bales from the hay contracts that wanted

33
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,140
hay instead of silich

34
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,080
and let's see what else we did a bunch

35
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,580
of cultivating contracts so made quite a

36
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,619
bit of money on that with our new

37
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,080
cultivator which is great

38
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:29,820
and

39
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,640
trying to think if there's anything else

40
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,799
in particular

41
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,619
to talk about

42
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,100
as far as you know the contracts go

43
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:42,540
so I I did have that same weird issue

44
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,720
where

45
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,280
if um I I you know I worked I did this

46
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,200
for many hours yesterday in real life

47
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,460
and I finally had to quit and I had to

48
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,920
go eat dinner and go to bed because it

49
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:56,159
was getting so late and so but I hadn't

50
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,320
fully picked up the straw off of the

51
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,259
wheat fields that I had harvested so

52
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,780
when I logged back in the next day

53
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:06,360
um the game had

54
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,819
well what would happen is it would it

55
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,679
would switch the swap the fields over to

56
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:13,739
cultivate it and not give me credit for

57
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:16,500
the quest so I had to log back in

58
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:18,660
three separate times and then quickly go

59
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,819
into the quests and and then turn them

60
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,920
in you know to get paid for them which I

61
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:24,720
eventually was able to do

62
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,700
but then it also made a bunch of the

63
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,500
straw disappear that I had already you

64
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,879
know was in the process of bailing so I

65
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,660
estimated

66
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:35,760
how many bales that I you know would

67
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,040
have otherwise gotten and and just gave

68
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,720
those to myself with the admin tool

69
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,480
um so yeah it came out to around 100

70
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,819
bales of straw which is huge I mean our

71
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,540
our part is it's not completely full but

72
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:47,340
it's

73
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,140
it's in good shape man we'll put it that

74
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,060
way good shape so

75
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,560
and let's see I don't think I did any

76
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,940
other types of contracts there weren't

77
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,220
any fertilizing or sewing or anything

78
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,680
like that in July

79
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:01,080
and yeah that's my that's pretty much it

80
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,480
I didn't bother saving the grain you

81
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,700
just don't get that much of it

82
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,319
it's more useful you know for saving for

83
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,180
your chickens but we have so much barley

84
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:10,920
now that I just went ahead and sold it

85
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,319
even though this is the worst time of

86
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,360
year to sell just about anything July is

87
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:17,099
a terrible month for selling but

88
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,200
otherwise you know we would have had to

89
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:20,879
take the small amount that we got and

90
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,760
start in the train station and pay

91
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,200
rental on that just to make like two

92
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,060
thousand dollars when the price is good

93
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,519
kind of thing it just wasn't worth it to

94
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,019
me to do that I I would have kept it

95
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,640
more for like I said the purposes of

96
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:34,140
feeding the chickens but we don't we're

97
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,360
in such good shape right now with that

98
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:39,900
that I just didn't want to mess with it

99
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,700
okay so anyway I think all of the

100
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,799
Silence from our fields are probably

101
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,780
yeah those are ready too so I'm gonna

102
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:46,980
have to get those loaded up I'll do that

103
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,900
off camera though it's going to take a

104
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,879
long time

105
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,860
um so let's throw these Bales in and

106
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,099
then we'll go back to field 71 pick up

107
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:58,980
the remaining Bales and then turn that

108
00:03:55,099 --> 00:04:01,459
contract in and see where we end up with

109
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,459
our money

110
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,080
this is gonna you know we're probably

111
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,299
Gonna Fill This silage

112
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,680
storage thing back up again almost

113
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:12,180
completely full by the end of the year

114
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,260
and boy are we gonna make some cash man

115
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,260
off of that

116
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,040
I mean we we got sick full stacks off of

117
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,979
our hey

118
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:26,820
our own Fields that's just amazing

119
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:29,340
um you know plus I'm getting about

120
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:32,120
one and a half

121
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,120
to two

122
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,919
um ish for

123
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:39,479
each computer farmer hay cutting you

124
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,160
know too it depends

125
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:43,800
uh we don't get quite as much on the

126
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,139
first hay cutting but we tend it tends

127
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,100
to get better get better in terms of the

128
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:49,380
yield

129
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:51,000
as the year you know grows later I

130
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:54,199
haven't actually confirmed that for sure

131
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,199
but it kind of seems that way anyway

132
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,139
okay yeah so let's go get the rest of

133
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,520
these Bales oh where am I going I need

134
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:00,960
to go this way

135
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,639
totally

136
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,720
here yapping it you guys and not paying

137
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,220
attention to where I'm going yeah we

138
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:09,060
need to go this way

139
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:11,100
oh I I found a couple more um

140
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,720
Collectibles too

141
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,580
I actually found one of them a long time

142
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,900
ago and I keep forgetting to show you

143
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,060
guys where it's at let's grab that real

144
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,560
quick while I'm thinking about it if you

145
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,300
don't want to know where these are then

146
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,139
yeah don't watch

147
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:28,979
the next five minutes or so of the video

148
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:31,680
uh but anyway one of them

149
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:35,039
I think was somewhere around in here and

150
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,360
I I literally found this a long time ago

151
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,100
and I just

152
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:41,100
keep forgetting

153
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:44,479
to show you guys where it's at

154
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,479
I think it's somewhere over here anyway

155
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:52,220
uh maybe it's further down than this

156
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,220
actually

157
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,220
or it could be

158
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,400
over here

159
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:12,560
where am I getting all turned around

160
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:12,560
here

161
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:18,020
hmm

162
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,800
was it further down this way it's been

163
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,840
such a long time like I said I didn't

164
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,419
remember exactly oh here we go yeah

165
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:31,280
right here okay

166
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:31,280
so let's get whoops

167
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,470
all right

168
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:40,220
I'm having trouble getting to it here

169
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:42,479
[Music]

170
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:44,880
all right you found a cedar there are

171
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,860
four or more Cedars to be found awesome

172
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,780
okay and then I'll show you where the

173
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:51,120
other one is so

174
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,800
if any of you are averting your eyes

175
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,160
keep averting them for just a little bit

176
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,160
longer

177
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:03,479
some people like to know where these

178
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,160
things are and some don't you know

179
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:08,280
if I was

180
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,600
if I was watching me do this and I

181
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,860
didn't know where they were I wouldn't

182
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,419
want to know where they were I'd want to

183
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:16,020
find them myself so I would be averting

184
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:20,580
my eyes right now if it was me

185
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:22,020
uh anyway okay so let's go

186
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:24,840
towards

187
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:27,800
well here I'm not going to say anything

188
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,800
just follow me

189
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,680
we're gonna go this way and then we're

190
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:33,419
gonna go that way and then we're gonna

191
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,800
go up the hill and down the hill and

192
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:36,960
around the corner and under the bridge

193
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,160
and over the bridge and

194
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,160
yeah right

195
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:47,240
okay here is the other one that I just

196
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:47,240
found this one like yesterday

197
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,400
you found a water trailer there are four

198
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:56,520
more water trailers to be found nice

199
00:07:53,400 --> 00:08:00,560
okay so that's two more collectibles

200
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,560
that we can add to our

201
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,099
our statistics

202
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:10,440
I'm I haven't actively looked for these

203
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:12,240
since that one episode that we did a

204
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,400
long long time ago where I was actively

205
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,780
looking for them I just you know I

206
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,780
stumble across them and

207
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,720
every once in a while and I figured oh

208
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:24,360
there they are I'll wait and show show

209
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:30,840
everybody on camera that wants to see it

210
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:30,840
okay so we are back now at field 71.

211
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,719
and we're going to pick up the rest of

212
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,719
these bales

213
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:45,120
so yeah we're not we're actually going

214
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:47,519
to get a trailer load and maybe a fourth

215
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,440
this time

216
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,660
but still I mean this is essentially

217
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,519
free silage

218
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:55,740
and we store it and wait till the price

219
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,700
is at its Max and then make a whole crap

220
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,700
ton of money off of it

221
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,580
okay so that takes care of the contract

222
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:08,580
Bales like I said I will pick up these

223
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,839
six stacks of Bales off camera and get

224
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,860
them in the storage before the next

225
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,060
episode

226
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,060
I'll do that later though

227
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,880
um so let's go back to the yard and

228
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:24,180
I did

229
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,640
go ahead and purchase

230
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,920
that lizard rake that that little front

231
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,360
rake and man I'll tell you what it is so

232
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:34,100
nice

233
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,100
it just makes bailing a breeze

234
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:39,540
um

235
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,220
really really enjoy enjoy that rake so

236
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,420
and I got the bigger one too rather than

237
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,459
the smaller one

238
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:47,540
and it seems to work a little bit better

239
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,540
than the smaller one too

240
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,580
it's just uh well here we might as well

241
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,580
Park this trailer

242
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:59,700
and then we'll take a look at our money

243
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:02,360
oh wait I gotta get I gotta get that

244
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,360
stupid uh

245
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,040
what you might call it Tedder in there

246
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:06,899
first

247
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,320
it's not a stupid Tedder it's a nice

248
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:09,320
Tedder

249
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:13,980
okay you could definitely move something

250
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,680
like this

251
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:19,200
by hand in real life maybe not pick it

252
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,220
up but you could easily push it or pull

253
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,040
it

254
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:26,279
so I'm just gonna

255
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:30,540
do that right now okay I think that's

256
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:32,640
in place whoops just

257
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:35,459
barreled right into my trailer there

258
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,500
knocked a couple teeth out

259
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:39,180
okay

260
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,580
that's good enough I know it's not all

261
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:45,680
the way back in there but

262
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,680
I'll have to do it'll have to do man

263
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:54,899
okay so let's see where we are

264
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,040
there's the rake right there that I

265
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:58,620
bought

266
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:01,140
I think it was like 25

267
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,640
000 or something like that

268
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:05,480
let's look at that

269
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,480
windrowers

270
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,160
oh thirty two thousand thirty two five

271
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:15,680
in fact okay yep so we purchased that

272
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,680
um all right now let's look at our money

273
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:19,040
turn this off

274
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,839
and see what we're doing here so if we

275
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:27,300
go oh yeah we need to turn this guy into

276
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:28,940
there's another 25 000 right there I'm

277
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:32,880
not gonna do these harvesting contracts

278
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:34,620
and as you can see there's uh oh

279
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,760
we just had a couple cultivating come

280
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,500
back up

281
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,720
you know I'll probably do those I mean

282
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,459
they're so easy to do

283
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,680
and I have you know I have my own

284
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:45,779
equipment for it so yeah I'll do this

285
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,980
I'll do them later just just know that

286
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:48,600
we're gonna add another eighteen hundred

287
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:50,880
dollars or so onto the top of everything

288
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,040
else that's happening okay so let's look

289
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:56,820
at the finances

290
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:59,579
um so that 32.5 of course is from buying

291
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:01,740
the The Rake uh we spent eighteen

292
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:04,140
thousand dollars in repairs because

293
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,860
we're just using our stuff so much

294
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,560
um

295
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:09,839
I didn't borrow any of the farmers

296
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,700
equipment for the hay I really should do

297
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,740
that for the biggest Fields it's it's

298
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,240
worth doing

299
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,100
um because

300
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,200
you know they don't they don't deduct

301
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:22,620
too much money off of that and I spend

302
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,060
more money repairing my own equipment

303
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,800
um if I use it so I really need to do

304
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,720
that but sometimes I just forget to or

305
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,700
whatever uh mysterious forty five

306
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,779
dollars for production costs there

307
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,519
um well actually you know what we're not

308
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:35,459
actually at the end of July are we this

309
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:37,519
is still July 1. oh right

310
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:37,519
um

311
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,880
okay well let's just let's just see

312
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,579
where we're at so

313
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:47,120
I sold just a small bit of bales from

314
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:50,339
the contracts we spent that much in fuel

315
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,200
ninety dollars

316
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:55,740
um we made

317
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:57,720
14 718 from Harvest income from just the

318
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:01,980
Grain in canola that we sold

319
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:05,160
and we made 164 000 431

320
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:06,600
or 341 uh from contract income which is

321
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,279
really good that's what we grossed of

322
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:12,779
course paid workers fifteen thousand

323
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:12,779
this miscellaneous is

324
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,980
what is that miscellaneous I don't know

325
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:23,300
what that's from I can't

326
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:23,300
I can't remember what this is for

327
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,880
um and then I had to like I said I had

328
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,680
to borrow a little bit more money early

329
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,420
on because I was like flat broke and I

330
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,680
needed to pay the workers so so first

331
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,180
thing we got to do is pay the bank off

332
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,320
so we owe the bank seventy thousand

333
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,180
dollars

334
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,740
um so let's do that now

335
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:39,120
and I want to pay them off right now so

336
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,740
I'm not paying interest for the next two

337
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,800
days okay so that leaves us with a

338
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:44,820
balance now of 53

339
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,360
798 dollars

340
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:49,800
okay so let's take a look at

341
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,079
and remember

342
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,720
um you know we purchased

343
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:56,820
we really if you think about it

344
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,079
we purchased that huge cultivator and

345
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,839
that rake

346
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:04,620
so if we had not have done that we would

347
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:06,420
have another 70 or 80 000 on top of this

348
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:08,399
um so that's really kind of the money

349
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:10,440
that we actually

350
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:14,100
you know have

351
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:16,860
um okay so anyway let's go let's go to

352
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:19,040
animals chickens are good cows are fine

353
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:22,920
for now

354
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:27,000
and let's look at the greenhouses

355
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:28,920
so this one is now we we now have to

356
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,660
switch this over oh no I guess I already

357
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,980
did switch it over to manure okay so

358
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:34,560
everything is switched over to manure

359
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:36,300
all the greenhouses are almost

360
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,540
completely chocked full with manure

361
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:42,240
we're no longer using solid fertilizer

362
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:44,339
and life is good uh we are gonna I am

363
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,160
gonna have to replenish the seeds in

364
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:49,079
here but we could probably get away with

365
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,120
waiting until

366
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:52,860
um August to do that so I'm gonna I'm

367
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,139
gonna wait till August to do that

368
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,820
all right let's see here

369
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:58,800
um

370
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:00,540
what else do we want to look at um yeah

371
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,079
let's look at the what we currently have

372
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,079
in storage

373
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:07,260
so 16

374
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:09,240
000

375
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:11,699
um eggs

376
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:14,339
13 000 almost butter five thousand

377
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:18,839
almost cheese

378
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:21,720
160 almost 170 000 lettuce we'll say 40

379
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:24,000
000 tomatoes and 77 5

380
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,339
000. uh on the strawberries so looking

381
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,940
good there plus all the hay that we have

382
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:32,399
in storage in fact

383
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:34,019
um this should show us that so yeah we

384
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,339
have now that remember this doesn't

385
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:38,399
count what's sitting on the ground that

386
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:40,260
I haven't put in the uh you know the the

387
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:44,519
barn or the storage thing yet so in

388
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:48,600
storage we have 590 000 liters of silage

389
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:51,779
uh we have 471 000 and change liters of

390
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:55,440
hay and 1.2 million

391
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:57,120
straw that's amazing uh what else this

392
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,320
is yeah this is the manure and the

393
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,079
slurring stuff so forth that we're

394
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:04,079
building up all right you guys now

395
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:05,160
I gotta show you something I I gotta

396
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,680
show you something

397
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:10,019
I'm tempted again I am seriously

398
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,639
seriously tempted again luck it at

399
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:16,380
what's for sale

400
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:19,380
a T9 New Holland what's this over here

401
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:22,860
oh that's just a forestry a forwarder

402
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:25,380
um a T9 New Holland

403
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:28,260
articulating axel

404
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:33,959
if it was maxed out

405
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:33,959
it would have almost 700 horsepower 692.

406
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,740
um but

407
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:40,620
in order for me to buy this now I would

408
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:42,980
have to take a significant loan out to

409
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,980
get it

410
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:49,980
it's just a beautiful beautiful tractor

411
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,899
but again I can't really justify this at

412
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:54,420
this point in time and here's why

413
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:56,880
because I have the man man truck and the

414
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:59,160
man truck can pretty much do all of the

415
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:02,279
heavy work uh which is is essentially

416
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:04,919
pulling that ginormous cultivator

417
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:06,540
and so it's I just I can't justify

418
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:08,040
getting this right now

419
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,839
um even though I really really would

420
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:12,179
like to do so look at that beautiful

421
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:14,640
tractor man it's just amazing

422
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:17,160
um but yeah I I can't I can't justify it

423
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,939
can I afford it yeah I can in the long

424
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:23,819
run but I just I don't know I would

425
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:26,520
really like to but it's more of a want

426
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:28,140
and not a need at this point I think I

427
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,520
mean we will eventually we are

428
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,620
eventually going to get a third tractor

429
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,540
and preferably

430
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:35,400
a big one

431
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,620
um because you know the more attractors

432
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:41,520
we have the more work that we can can

433
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:42,960
get done but again you know this is

434
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,179
really

435
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,400
for almost almost all intents and

436
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:48,720
purposes a third tractor and a 500 horse

437
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,179
one at that which we've already talked

438
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:54,000
about so I'm gonna let that one go as

439
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:56,580
much as as much as it sucks I think it's

440
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,960
the right move for us right here now I

441
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:59,580
mean I was tempted I really was thinking

442
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,620
I was thinking man

443
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,820
how can I justify getting that tractor

444
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,740
and I couldn't

445
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:07,020
this couldn't justify getting it so

446
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:08,580
anyway uh but the good news is we are

447
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:12,240
out of debt now

448
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:14,100
um and we have 53 000 on top of that

449
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,340
and um so

450
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:19,020
we really need to get a shed going over

451
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:21,840
here and I think that's what exactly

452
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:24,660
what we're going to do

453
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,640
um so let's um

454
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:28,799
yeah why don't we why don't we get why

455
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:32,419
don't we do that and then

456
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,419
we'll get everything situated

457
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,480
there's no reason not to do it right now

458
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:37,860
that I can think of okay so I need to

459
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,960
get all this stuff moved out of the way

460
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:41,700
first so let me get that done then I'll

461
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,740
bring you back we'll put a new shed in

462
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,660
and then start you know put our stuff

463
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:48,120
away and get our farm a little a little

464
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:50,880
more organized than what it currently is

465
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:52,740
okay I'll see you guys in a bit

466
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,960
all right guys we are back and I have

467
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:56,280
all the stuff moved out of the way spent

468
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,380
a little bit of time trying to decide

469
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,760
exactly what I wanted to do

470
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:02,760
for storage

471
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,520
and I think I have figured out figured

472
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:07,500
that out so uh what we're going to do is

473
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,020
we're going to go into

474
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:14,039
the build menu

475
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:15,900
and we're gonna put up two of these easy

476
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:19,320
sheds here I kind of wanted to do this

477
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:21,059
one but it's so doggone big

478
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:24,120
um there there's just no room for it

479
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:25,380
over in this yard here I wanted to I was

480
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:28,320
thinking about putting this one here but

481
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:30,240
it's it isn't gonna work

482
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,460
um the only place I really could put

483
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,559
this if I did put it anywhere it was is

484
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,000
maybe right over here

485
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,980
I don't want to put it over here because

486
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,940
I have plans you know future plans for

487
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,940
Productions in that area

488
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:46,500
um so I could put it here

489
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:48,960
maybe like right about in this General

490
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,160
vicinity

491
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,820
because

492
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,919
um

493
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:54,900
you know we have this room here and I

494
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:57,539
want to eventually kind of get up start

495
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:59,280
getting away from the weird irregular

496
00:19:57,539 --> 00:20:00,240
Fields because it's just a pain in the

497
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,580
butt

498
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,500
to um you know to harvest that sort of

499
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:06,539
thing and have you know all of our

500
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,160
Fields nice rectangles and squares and

501
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:10,020
that sort of thing and so that that

502
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,400
would open up this area here for us to

503
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,600
put more buildings and stuff in the

504
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,400
future

505
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:17,580
and that's what we're gonna do over here

506
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:20,580
too so but I don't

507
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:23,700
I don't like the idea of the shed being

508
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:25,200
not in you know the main yard here first

509
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,660
of all

510
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:31,260
and secondly

511
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:33,900
uh I don't know if now is the right time

512
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:35,880
to to remove

513
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,860
this hay because this is making us money

514
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,880
right now so so I don't think we're

515
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,919
gonna do that I think what we're gonna

516
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,600
do is we're gonna take this easy shed

517
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:45,480
here

518
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:48,960
and we're gonna flip it around this way

519
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:51,960
put it in this spot here so what I want

520
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,539
to do is basically I just want to bump

521
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:57,900
it right up against the existing shed

522
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:59,760
then pull it out so it's not colliding

523
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:02,100
and go as far that way as we can go with

524
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,980
it so I think right about there is what

525
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:06,840
we want to do now let me turn

526
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:09,299
this way

527
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:12,120
I don't want it sticking out past this

528
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:14,160
shed here either so

529
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,660
we're basically looking at about right

530
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,220
there I think

531
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:19,580
because we can't go back any further

532
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,580
this way

533
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,220
so yeah let's do it

534
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:25,320
okay it's done

535
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:28,640
now the other thing I'd like to well

536
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,640
actually hold on before we do that

537
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:36,120
and we could hold it out a little bit

538
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:38,340
here let's sell it real quick while we

539
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:40,200
get the full money back

540
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:42,200
okay let's try that again

541
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,200
um

542
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:45,980
but I actually went right about there

543
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,260
now we're gonna we're gonna build

544
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:57,539
another one of these and the other one I

545
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:59,220
want over by the cow barn

546
00:21:57,539 --> 00:22:02,460
and we're going to store

547
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:05,039
our equipment that we use to take care

548
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:06,840
of our animals in here

549
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:10,520
all right and the spot we're going to

550
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,520
put this is going to be right here

551
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:14,340
um I have

552
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:16,740
well

553
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:20,400
hmm

554
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:24,200
the other thing we could do is we could

555
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,200
we could instead put this over here

556
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:33,559
that would line it up with the cow barn

557
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,559
I think it would look better over here

558
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:42,500
okay hold on I gotta I have to think

559
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,500
about something here for a second

560
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:48,059
all right guys I'm back um it's like

561
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:49,320
really getting dark too

562
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:53,720
um but I think I figured out what I want

563
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:53,720
to do so I'm gonna go ahead and put

564
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:59,220
um this shed here and the reason the

565
00:22:57,299 --> 00:23:02,340
thing that I was trying to figure out

566
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:06,080
uh just as an FYI was I'm planning on

567
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:06,080
moving the chicken coop

568
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,620
um this chicken coop over here and put

569
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:13,679
it and potentially put a second chicken

570
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:15,059
coop in later on down the road

571
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,559
um and I wanted to make sure there was

572
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:17,880
and I was planning on putting them in

573
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,100
this area so I just wanted to make sure

574
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,480
I was going to have room to do that and

575
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:24,900
I think I will

576
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:27,500
so uh what we're gonna do is

577
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:30,600
we're going to put this one here

578
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,919
and I'm gonna actually okay we can't go

579
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,390
any further to the right there because

580
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,799
the manure thingy

581
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:36,360
[Music]

582
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:40,700
um

583
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:40,700
and I can push it back this way

584
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,280
but I wonder if that's going to cause a

585
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,020
problem with the chickens so I think I'm

586
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,520
going to pull it back out this way a

587
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:52,440
little bit

588
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,580
and let's put it right there

589
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:56,240
okay

590
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,240
it's a done deal

591
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:00,539
we're gonna have to do a little bit of

592
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:02,460
landscaping action here

593
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:04,679
um but my goodness you know what let's

594
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:07,380
sleep and come back in the morning

595
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:09,659
and finish this out because yeah it's

596
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:11,960
just too dark so I will see you tomorrow

597
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:11,960
morning

598
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,280
okay so we have a nice bright sunny July

599
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,140
second morning

600
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:26,900
and um

601
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:26,900
I want to do something about this here

602
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:31,620
but I have to be careful of you know our

603
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:33,419
money

604
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:36,000
whoops

605
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:38,400
and uh yeah so basically yeah all this

606
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,200
left is to do some Landscaping to to

607
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,640
kind of fix things up a little bit I

608
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,100
just hope it doesn't cost us an arm and

609
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:47,460
a leg to do it so first of all

610
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:52,260
let's see if we can raise this up now

611
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:54,419
the idea here with the Crick is culverts

612
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:57,000
I have to assume we're putting culverts

613
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:58,740
in as we you know cover up the the Crick

614
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,940
running through here

615
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:04,500
um

616
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:07,080
so I don't know I there are some

617
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:08,460
there there's some mods that allow you

618
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,980
to do Bridges but I don't think there's

619
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:12,840
any bridges in the in the base game as

620
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:14,700
far as I know

621
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:18,000
uh but what we're going to want to do

622
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:19,620
here is we're going to want to raise up

623
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,360
the ground

624
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,440
and again I just have to watch my money

625
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:26,700
because it's going to get really

626
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:30,419
expensive so let's increase the size of

627
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:33,140
our our thingy here

628
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:33,140
and

629
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:37,220
raise this up

630
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:50,100
and like I said we'll just assume that

631
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:53,600
we have a culvert running underneath the

632
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,600
there for the water to flow

633
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,960
then what I think we want to do is we

634
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:04,940
want to level

635
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,940
now with here

636
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:21,600
and we kind of

637
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:24,900
messed up the road a little bit there

638
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,400
but not they're not too bad actually

639
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,600
okay that doesn't look too bad right

640
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,740
there let's

641
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:33,020
um

642
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:33,020
let's reduce the size of this

643
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:39,080
and um I think I want to go to softening

644
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:39,080
here

645
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:48,080
and we're gonna need to I'm gonna fix

646
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:48,080
this so let's go down another size

647
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:53,000
that seam right there because it's not

648
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,000
very realistic

649
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:59,159
that's going to be a bit of a bump

650
00:26:57,419 --> 00:27:02,000
but I think we could live with it why

651
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:02,000
don't we do this

652
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:07,020
raise up a little more back this way too

653
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:10,100
and then we'll smooth

654
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:10,100
that down a little bit

655
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:25,880
that's not too bad I mean yeah there's

656
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,880
still a little tiny bit of a seam there

657
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:31,740
yeah

658
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:33,720
okay yeah that works for here

659
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:36,480
that should work for here okay and then

660
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:39,200
let's go over to

661
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,200
this area

662
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:46,220
we'll do here is

663
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:52,440
[Music]

664
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:54,480
I'm going to raise this up a little more

665
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:58,220
here

666
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,220
so it's a little more fragile

667
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:05,840
oh crap I just messed up my crops

668
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:12,000
um all right next time we do some

669
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:16,039
plowing I'll have to fix that uh let's

670
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,039
switch this over to the square

671
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:21,980
make it a little small oh I guess that's

672
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:21,980
all the smaller it's going to go

673
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:28,820
I think we want to go smoothie now

674
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,820
anyway

675
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,700
foreign

676
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:45,179
an angle getting up into there but

677
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,360
that's okay I don't think that's a

678
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:47,360
problem

679
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:57,659
kind of you know I I drive up here too

680
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:00,720
so let's smooth this

681
00:28:57,659 --> 00:29:03,559
down a little more too so it's not quite

682
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,559
so intense

683
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,659
oops

684
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:25,039
um all right I think that'll probably be

685
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,039
okay

686
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:32,779
and yeah we're gonna store our animal

687
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,779
care equipment

688
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,960
in here

689
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:45,620
foreign

690
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:51,539
yeah I think that's fine uh you know

691
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:53,460
what we could do here is we could at

692
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:56,700
least add some

693
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:59,539
metal grass back until I can

694
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,539
fix it later

695
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:10,640
all right that's good enough

696
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:10,640
so there's something there

697
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:14,880
okay yeah I think that's good I think

698
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:17,520
that's uh

699
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,679
a good setup now again I would have held

700
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:22,740
this back further but we need to make

701
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:26,279
leave enough room for chickens

702
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:29,279
for two chicken coops potentially

703
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:31,500
um that will go this direction so we

704
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:33,899
would put the first one probably right

705
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:35,940
about here

706
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:37,799
and then the second one would go right

707
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:39,299
about here ish

708
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:41,520
and there's still you know enough room

709
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:44,779
to do that I guess I could have helped

710
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,779
that back a little further High

711
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:49,980
but I don't know

712
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,799
if I did have enough money to put this

713
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:55,200
in I don't know you know where it starts

714
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:56,940
to consider it overlapping

715
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,740
you know what we could do

716
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:01,440
just as an ex whoops I didn't mean to do

717
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:04,799
that well yeah just as an experiment

718
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,960
so we have 26 377 dollars I'm just gonna

719
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,880
add

720
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,220
um

721
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:14,600
a million dollars temporarily we're not

722
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:14,600
going to actually spend this money

723
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,380
okay

724
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:21,539
and then let's go

725
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:23,700
back over here for a second where are we

726
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:26,240
at

727
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,240
here

728
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:33,380
now if we go to animals and chickens

729
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,679
um

730
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:47,760
so I would probably start it right there

731
00:31:44,539 --> 00:31:51,080
CES it says it's over oh nope okay I

732
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,080
think it's overlapping with this one

733
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:59,120
okay yeah that'll work all right let's

734
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,120
quickly sell these

735
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,779
good okay

736
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:10,860
that'll work

737
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:12,960
just what the doctor ordered

738
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:15,620
very cool okay now let's go back to here

739
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,620
and

740
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:19,460
and remove a million dollars

741
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:27,360
it's back to 25 788 what didn't we have

742
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:30,600
26 something I don't know whatever

743
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:33,179
positive and experiments okay so I think

744
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:35,760
we are in good shape so we got this all

745
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:37,320
leveled out over here

746
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,820
we still have a bit of a bump here but

747
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,440
it's actually not as bad as it was

748
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:43,140
before

749
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:45,720
we actually you know we could

750
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:47,700
here I'll tell you what I want to do

751
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,820
this let's go back into here for a

752
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,820
second

753
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:57,480
and back to landscaping and sculpting

754
00:32:55,740 --> 00:33:01,940
I want to raise this up just a little

755
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:01,940
bit more more because it's such a

756
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:06,559
an abrupt

757
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,559
angle

758
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:12,140
make it a little more gradual coming

759
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:12,140
into here

760
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,980
softer than that

761
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,919
let's look at it

762
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:33,600
yeah that's okay

763
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:36,899
that's okay

764
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:40,679
all right cool so now we have

765
00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:42,000
some more sheds to store stuff

766
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:45,919
so I think the first thing we're gonna

767
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,919
do is let's hop into here

768
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:53,480
and

769
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,480
I want to kind of do this based upon

770
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:59,580
frequency of use so we we generally only

771
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,600
use the curtain cider one one time a

772
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,700
year

773
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:05,100
when we're selling all of our stuff this

774
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:07,559
isn't a frequently used

775
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,760
Implement so that means I want to kind

776
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:13,879
of put this

777
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:13,879
way over off to the side here

778
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:22,919
all right that's some

779
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,440
it's pretty straight actually

780
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:28,200
I think

781
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:31,520
it's all the way

782
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,520
almost all the way back

783
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,740
now I put

784
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:44,399
put my header trailer over here

785
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:47,580
I don't I

786
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:50,960
don't really use this actually

787
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:50,960
I bought it you know because

788
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,379
Secrets underneath here

789
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,879
are collectibles

790
00:34:55,379 --> 00:34:59,099
uh we've been living here forever and

791
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:02,940
I've never even looked uh anyway

792
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:05,220
um I bought this for our header but

793
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:07,200
I could generally just you know make my

794
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:08,400
way to wherever I need to go with it so

795
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,540
I'm almost wondering if we could just

796
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,339
sell the thing

797
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:13,700
uh how much would we get for it if we

798
00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:13,700
sold it

799
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,560
um

800
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,560
I go here

801
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,339
that's what's in the sales

802
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:28,320
header trailer

803
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:31,800
uh I'm not that much money really

804
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:34,680
okay well what I'm gonna do then is

805
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:37,560
um you could definitely

806
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:39,599
grab this in real life and pull it

807
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,440
to where you needed it to go

808
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:43,920
um so

809
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:45,780
I'm gonna do that ish

810
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,680
it's such a pain in the butt to try and

811
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:48,839
drive

812
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:50,820
oh well okay I don't know if that would

813
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:52,740
happen in real life

814
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:56,540
and I'm gonna put this on the other side

815
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:56,540
of the curtain curtain side

816
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:05,280
this is where this will live

817
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:06,660
unless I decide to sell it at some point

818
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,980
I mean we're not gonna get that much

819
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,060
money I might as well just keep it

820
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:12,619
because you never know

821
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:12,619
I actually want it at some point

822
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,420
let's move the tongue over to the side

823
00:36:17,579 --> 00:36:23,160
so that takes care of those things now

824
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:26,339
what we

825
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:29,640
frequently use is the water tank

826
00:36:26,339 --> 00:36:32,119
and even the flatbed trailer we use that

827
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,119
quite a bit

828
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:38,839
so what I'm gonna do with those is I'm

829
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,839
going to put them

830
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:44,700
on the other end the the near ends

831
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:46,320
because they're going to be

832
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,520
where they're a lot more accessible for

833
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,099
us

834
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:52,200
yeah I really like this trailer

835
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:53,780
is a nice

836
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:56,160
piece of equipment

837
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:59,040
in fact it looks like it's probably

838
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:01,160
going to be too long for this shed

839
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,160
um

840
00:37:02,339 --> 00:37:06,320
maybe what we'll do is this then

841
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:11,839
oh yep we're in the back

842
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:19,020
okay

843
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:21,540
yeah it does

844
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:24,800
it doesn't stick out a lot doesn't it

845
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:24,800
it's just really long

846
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,099
yeah let's just we're just gonna have to

847
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:31,020
go with that for now

848
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:33,780
that's you know partly why I wanted that

849
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:36,000
longer shed but

850
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:37,740
it's all right is what it is

851
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,300
at least the majority of it's undercover

852
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:42,000
now

853
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:44,460
and you know as some of you are maybe

854
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,740
all of you probably know you don't

855
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:48,119
actually have to put these things

856
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:49,020
undercover like you would in real life

857
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:51,300
but

858
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:52,920
you know it's just seems like the right

859
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:56,000
thing to do you know what I mean

860
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,000
so that's why we do it

861
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,220
okay

862
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:16,280
uh let's see what's next

863
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:16,280
uh we have the

864
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:22,200
we have the brantner and we have well

865
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:25,619
we're gonna take

866
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:27,960
we're definitely taking the silage

867
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:28,980
extractor over to the other Barn because

868
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,619
that's

869
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:33,800
for animal care so let's move that right

870
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:33,800
now

871
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,700
uh here's what actually here's what

872
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:56,160
we're gonna do with the truck so we're

873
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:57,720
going to hook up to the

874
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,280
cultivator

875
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:02,960
since we need the truck to run the

876
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,960
cultivator or operate it

877
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:09,599
and

878
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:11,280
hopefully we can park both of these in

879
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,480
the shed together and have enough room

880
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,640
to

881
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,980
to get the truck all the way in

882
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:19,760
it's going to be I don't know it's going

883
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,760
to be close we'll see

884
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:26,040
and we can put that right on the edge so

885
00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:29,540
it's easily accessible

886
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,540
oh yeah we're good man

887
00:39:29,579 --> 00:39:33,980
good

888
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,980
Okay so

889
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:40,200
this is where we'll park the truck and

890
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:42,599
the cultivator

891
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:46,680
a whole lot of room left there huh

892
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:49,220
it's for the most part Undercover

893
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,220
okay

894
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:04,560
that's looking good

895
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:06,359
okay and now what we're gonna do is

896
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:08,940
let's

897
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:10,200
let's move the combine over

898
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:13,800
we don't

899
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:15,000
uh use the combine real often but we do

900
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:17,090
usually

901
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,189
usually times a year

902
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:20,189
[Music]

903
00:40:22,859 --> 00:40:26,280
a second

904
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:27,660
in the super camera it's actually

905
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,099
getting the

906
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:32,300
header it's not really getting the

907
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:32,300
header undercover though

908
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:37,500
you know honestly I like the idea of

909
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:39,660
moving the reefer over to this Bay let's

910
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:43,160
do it

911
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:43,160
a combine all the way on the end

912
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,060
now that actually leaves us

913
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:06,180
narrow spot there what could we

914
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:10,020
potentially put in there

915
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:12,119
something that we don't use very often

916
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:13,980
I don't really use the windrower in fact

917
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:15,420
we might never ever use the windrower

918
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:17,700
again

919
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:20,780
now that we have you know that fancy

920
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:20,780
schmancy new rake

921
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:28,440
so why don't we do this we do use the

922
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:31,320
the Tedder on occasion

923
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:34,020
but this was just

924
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:36,359
really need it

925
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:37,740
in fact I wonder if we should well I

926
00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:41,220
don't want to sell it I want to have one

927
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:42,900
just in case and again there's no way

928
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:44,640
you could lift this in real life but you

929
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:48,320
could probably pick it up and and drag

930
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,320
it so we're just gonna do it this way

931
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:53,599
there we go okay

932
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:00,300
Pull It Forward just a little bit too

933
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:02,820
because like I said we do have to get to

934
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:03,960
it every once in a while okay good I

935
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:06,420
like that

936
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:09,359
that's pretty good setup there

937
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:11,400
now we should be able to put the combine

938
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:14,240
why am I wasting fuel

939
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,240
doesn't matter with me

940
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:20,060
okay we should be able to put the

941
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,060
combine in there now

942
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:30,859
it's about as far back as we can go

943
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:30,859
without hitting anything

944
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:37,579
that doesn't count

945
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:42,020
there we go all right I like it

946
00:42:37,579 --> 00:42:42,020
I like it I like it a lot

947
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:54,960
looking good man looking good okay so

948
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:57,900
um let's see

949
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:00,180
this I haven't decided what to do with

950
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:01,980
this Russell mosh cultivator

951
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:03,900
the reason I'm hanging onto it is

952
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:05,819
because I could put a second tractor on

953
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:08,780
this to work if you know if we take a

954
00:43:05,819 --> 00:43:13,980
whole bunch of cultivator contracts

955
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:16,500
what I might do though is I might pull

956
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:19,460
this Baler out of here and put it next

957
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:19,460
to the other baler

958
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:25,980
if it'll

959
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,660
fit though it's a that thing's pretty

960
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:31,160
big it's a pretty wide Baler I don't

961
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:31,160
yeah I could probably make them fit

962
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,960
Russell mosh

963
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,760
these we only use on occasion these we

964
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:51,260
only use on occasion and yes you could

965
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,260
very easily pull that in real life

966
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:55,500
um

967
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:57,359
why don't we do this

968
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:59,540
let's break that back this way a little

969
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:59,540
bit

970
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:04,700
put

971
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:12,260
and put all these in the back like so

972
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,060
okay

973
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:28,500
you'd have to have a pretty

974
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:31,140
pretty doggone strong back I think to

975
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:34,079
pull that thing in real life

976
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:36,240
I mean you could but yeah

977
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:39,300
let's use the tractor on that one

978
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:41,099
we got to be somewhat realistic here

979
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:42,780
okay so like I said I use these rollers

980
00:44:41,099 --> 00:44:44,640
all the time every time we Harvest our

981
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:46,200
own hay we use them plus you know we use

982
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:48,900
them too when we

983
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:51,920
create new Fields so we want them to be

984
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:51,920
easily accessible

985
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:56,220
and so what we're going to do is I'm

986
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:58,520
going to put both of them in this Bay

987
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:58,520
here

988
00:45:02,579 --> 00:45:06,740
okay that should be good for this

989
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:11,180
let's go grab the other one and put it

990
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:11,180
right next to it

991
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,500
I think we'll just store the brantner

992
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:18,780
out at the other Barn

993
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:19,980
well we might have to

994
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:22,819
we're gonna have to start a rake out

995
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:22,819
there too I don't know we'll see

996
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,800
and now this little Bay here like I said

997
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:37,220
will be the new parking spot for the

998
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,220
McCormick

999
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:49,740
we might be able to actually put the hay

1000
00:45:47,819 --> 00:45:54,740
rake

1001
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:54,740
uh next to the field repair unit

1002
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:13,560
here we go

1003
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:15,480
yeah let's uh let's do that let's put

1004
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:18,720
the hay rake

1005
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:20,460
I think it'll fit it's kind of high

1006
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,900
all right yeah so this will be the new

1007
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:24,060
home for

1008
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:26,400
The Rake

1009
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:28,800
we actually

1010
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,540
we could put even something in behind

1011
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:33,540
there

1012
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:36,060
I I've got the I don't really ever use

1013
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:38,339
the front loader anymore

1014
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:40,740
uh or these in fact we can sell those

1015
00:46:38,339 --> 00:46:43,859
long Forks I've never I used those once

1016
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:46,740
and they made everything really unstable

1017
00:46:43,859 --> 00:46:48,839
it's this yeah we don't need this let's

1018
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:51,300
sell it it's a nice idea but it makes

1019
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:53,339
the palettes way too unstable

1020
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:55,260
so the front loader attachment and the

1021
00:46:53,339 --> 00:46:57,060
forks we do want to keep that but I

1022
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:58,560
don't think we can

1023
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:01,220
I don't think we can fit that stuff

1024
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,220
under here

1025
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:03,500
um

1026
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:09,060
we can we could fit the weights under

1027
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:11,040
there

1028
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:12,119
well actually can we put that under

1029
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:15,560
there

1030
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:15,560
let's just try and see what happens

1031
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:31,560
yeah that works

1032
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:32,760
oh very nice okay

1033
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:35,760
perfect

1034
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,760
two

1035
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,819
honestly I'm not really too worried

1036
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:41,359
about those weights I'm just gonna leave

1037
00:47:38,819 --> 00:47:41,359
them where they are

1038
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,940
they're painted so

1039
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:47,579
they get a little wet once in a while

1040
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:49,980
not a big deal

1041
00:47:47,579 --> 00:47:53,780
all right let's see so I think we're

1042
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:53,780
gonna move the telehandler

1043
00:47:54,599 --> 00:47:57,720
um over to the other barn and we still

1044
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:59,339
have a lot of room at that other Barn

1045
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:00,480
too and we're gonna also put the Brant

1046
00:47:59,339 --> 00:48:03,440
over there so let's let's take the

1047
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,440
Brandon over there first

1048
00:48:04,619 --> 00:48:09,480
I'm also going to take the mixer and and

1049
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:12,680
the straw Chopper out of the barn

1050
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:12,680
and store them in here

1051
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:20,880
foreign

1052
00:48:23,819 --> 00:48:30,140
put that there let's go get the chopper

1053
00:48:26,819 --> 00:48:30,140
in the mixer wagon bring that over

1054
00:48:53,819 --> 00:48:56,420
foreign

1055
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:02,940
okay so

1056
00:49:01,319 --> 00:49:05,280
um

1057
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:08,579
we want to bring in the telehandler over

1058
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:11,700
here and

1059
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:14,460
I might like I said I might move the

1060
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:16,920
Baler into the

1061
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:19,260
next to the other one and then we can

1062
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:20,700
put the forklift back in the barn in its

1063
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:23,300
original place where we used to park it

1064
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:23,300
a long time ago

1065
00:49:23,339 --> 00:49:27,420
I don't really use the forklift very

1066
00:49:25,619 --> 00:49:29,520
much anymore either but I don't want to

1067
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:34,040
get rid of it because it's

1068
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:34,040
a pretty useful Implement to have

1069
00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:47,819
okay I'm just going to drop this off

1070
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:49,079
here for the moment because we have to

1071
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:51,920
go pick up the other attachments and

1072
00:49:49,079 --> 00:49:51,920
bring them over here too

1073
00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:29,040
all right there's the telehandler's new

1074
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:33,180
home

1075
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:37,079
it's looking good man coming together

1076
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:39,060
uh let's see okay so the last two things

1077
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:42,060
I think

1078
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:43,680
that we want to do is I'm gonna I'll

1079
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:44,819
just leave that open we might close it

1080
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:46,619
in the winter

1081
00:50:44,819 --> 00:50:47,400
keep the cows warm

1082
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:48,359
um

1083
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:51,200
figure out where we're gonna put the

1084
00:50:48,359 --> 00:50:51,200
forklift and

1085
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:54,020
um

1086
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:59,940
what was the second thing I can't

1087
00:50:57,660 --> 00:51:02,359
remember now there was two more things I

1088
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:02,359
wanted to do

1089
00:51:02,819 --> 00:51:07,140
hey excuse me oh ah move the Baler over

1090
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:09,300
to the other one

1091
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:11,960
this one's a little bit easier to get

1092
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,960
get to

1093
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:19,460
and you know we certainly could

1094
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,460
look down here

1095
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:29,640
especially since we

1096
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:31,440
almost never used it anymore

1097
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:34,040
since in fact we could even put this

1098
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,040
down there too

1099
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:44,700
yeah I think we'll leave the Russell

1100
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:47,480
mosh just where right where it is that

1101
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:47,480
that works

1102
00:51:48,119 --> 00:51:53,460
let's get this guy

1103
00:51:50,579 --> 00:51:55,800
I do know we have we have the flatbed

1104
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:57,540
trailer there too but that thing I can't

1105
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:59,220
use the tongue lock thing in the Middle

1106
00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:01,440
with it it's such a pain in the butt to

1107
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:03,000
back up

1108
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,859
that

1109
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,660
is going to

1110
00:52:04,859 --> 00:52:09,740
keep that outside

1111
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:09,740
don't worry too much about it

1112
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:16,140
okay

1113
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:19,380
that is now the new home for the

1114
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:22,760
forklift if I could get out

1115
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:22,760
it's a pretty good spot for it I think

1116
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:31,800
and now we're gonna put the baler

1117
00:52:29,339 --> 00:52:33,359
over next to the other bather

1118
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:35,579
I mean this isn't a bad spot for the

1119
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:36,660
Baylor the problem though is that I have

1120
00:52:35,579 --> 00:52:38,579
a hard time

1121
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:41,099
getting

1122
00:52:38,579 --> 00:52:43,140
off the tractor to hook it up with the

1123
00:52:41,099 --> 00:52:46,980
you know with the doors in the way like

1124
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:48,660
here here it's not too bad but

1125
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:51,859
if I get it a little further in there

1126
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:51,859
then it can be a pain in the neck

1127
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:56,520
and we use both of our balers very

1128
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:58,020
frequently so it just kind of makes

1129
00:52:56,520 --> 00:53:02,480
sense to put them in

1130
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:02,480
really easily accessible spot

1131
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:13,460
that's tight but it works

1132
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:17,059
nice

1133
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:23,339
I could move the pottinger over just a

1134
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:26,040
smidge too

1135
00:53:23,339 --> 00:53:28,500
but it's good the way it is

1136
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:31,380
all right guys I think that's it I think

1137
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:33,960
we have done a fantastic job if you

1138
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:36,240
don't mind my saying so

1139
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:39,119
um organizing our farm

1140
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:42,240
looks much better now

1141
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:46,020
much much much better

1142
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:50,520
trailer can stay right where it is

1143
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:52,619
I suppose what we could do is

1144
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:57,000
we could pull the farm Tech in forward

1145
00:53:52,619 --> 00:53:59,640
and then back this one in afterwards

1146
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:03,140
we wanted to

1147
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:03,140
yeah what the heck let's do it

1148
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:11,819
I was looking

1149
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:14,819
I could have I could have sworn

1150
00:54:11,819 --> 00:54:15,960
that um

1151
00:54:14,819 --> 00:54:17,280
well you know what we're gonna do too

1152
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:20,040
we're gonna back this in from the other

1153
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:22,440
end because it's going to be easier

1154
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:25,020
at some point I was looking on mod Hub

1155
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:26,880
and I found this Elm Street barn but

1156
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:28,559
with the working silo

1157
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:31,440
but I couldn't find it again I was

1158
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:32,700
looking all over for it and I couldn't

1159
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:35,900
find it so I don't know if I was

1160
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:35,900
imagining things or

1161
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:40,280
did we not hook up our lines

1162
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:48,420
okay

1163
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:50,220
but I couldn't find it so yeah I'm not

1164
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:53,280
sure

1165
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:55,260
either I imagined it which is possible

1166
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:57,119
or

1167
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:59,880
the modern author took it off the mod

1168
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:02,579
hub for some reason

1169
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:04,559
because I was I was planning on

1170
00:55:02,579 --> 00:55:07,339
replacing this barn with that barn on

1171
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:07,339
the working silo

1172
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,980
but

1173
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,020
work then I have I have another Silo

1174
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:17,940
plan I want to eventually get my own

1175
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:19,559
side load I mean you just you know we're

1176
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:21,720
a farmer we gotta have our own saddle

1177
00:55:19,559 --> 00:55:23,520
right but the train starts the train

1178
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:25,740
station works so well and it's so cheap

1179
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:27,119
that it's just you know kind of made

1180
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:30,619
sense oh you know what I have to kind of

1181
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:30,619
lift this up to get it to

1182
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:39,540
now there is this Silo that we're

1183
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,400
looking at that doesn't actually work

1184
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:43,859
there is an actual working version of it

1185
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:45,240
but the problem is if I put it in I'd

1186
00:55:43,859 --> 00:55:46,859
have to put it next to that and then

1187
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:49,500
we're blocking our

1188
00:55:46,859 --> 00:55:50,760
our roadway there so I don't think we'll

1189
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:53,940
do that

1190
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:57,140
I have two Poss other possibilities when

1191
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:57,140
Silo time comes

1192
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:01,440
um

1193
00:55:58,619 --> 00:56:03,920
but yeah we'll just we'll just wait on

1194
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,920
that for now

1195
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:09,180
we don't have a lot of grain and stuff

1196
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:11,579
that we're storing at this point in time

1197
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:15,619
so it still just makes sense for us to

1198
00:56:11,579 --> 00:56:15,619
stick with the train station for now

1199
00:56:19,619 --> 00:56:24,920
ideally we want to get the

1200
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:24,920
tongue and everything inside

1201
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:31,619
or at least as close as possible

1202
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:33,780
how much space do we have

1203
00:56:31,619 --> 00:56:36,480
like none

1204
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:37,440
okay that was like the absolute limit

1205
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,880
that I could put it in there without

1206
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:41,099
bumping into the other one but that

1207
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:42,780
works I like it

1208
00:56:41,099 --> 00:56:44,940
that works

1209
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:47,040
okay look at this nice and neat

1210
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:48,240
organized Farm you guys isn't this

1211
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,680
awesome

1212
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:52,440
I love it

1213
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:55,859
fantastic

1214
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:58,280
uh all right so let's uh let's park the

1215
00:56:55,859 --> 00:56:58,280
New Holland

1216
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:05,240
and we are finished with July

1217
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:13,160
turn that off

1218
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:17,640
let's go to July 3rd before I let you go

1219
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:19,940
just so we can actually get to the end

1220
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,940
of the month

1221
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:27,800
okay welcome to July 3rd let's look and

1222
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:27,800
see what the sales have

1223
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:37,440
this is basically the same thing that we

1224
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:39,319
have now except for it has its own

1225
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:42,359
built-in

1226
00:57:39,319 --> 00:57:46,200
uh Bale thingama doodle

1227
00:57:42,359 --> 00:57:47,819
but it isn't any more capacity and

1228
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,660
at this point that would just be a

1229
00:57:47,819 --> 00:57:51,359
luxury

1230
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:54,000
that we don't really need

1231
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:58,500
that would be a very nice

1232
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:01,260
uh Implement to have though but yeah

1233
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:04,260
for the price

1234
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:06,839
definitely can't afford that right now

1235
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:09,180
but it's tempting it is indeed tempting

1236
00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:11,160
okay so let's look at

1237
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:13,079
um our Ledger again oh you know what

1238
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:15,559
there I do have to do a couple more

1239
00:58:13,079 --> 00:58:15,559
things

1240
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:21,540
wait a minute did I just take

1241
00:58:19,559 --> 00:58:22,859
oh I finished those off camera but I

1242
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:24,720
never turn them in Okay cool so it gives

1243
00:58:22,859 --> 00:58:27,420
us a little bit more money

1244
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:30,960
um we need to pay our worker for moving

1245
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:33,920
pallets and also because I don't have a

1246
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:36,180
square bale pickup I I use the auto load

1247
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:39,480
feature on the flatbed trailer to pick

1248
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:41,220
up the straw bales and the hay bales and

1249
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:43,440
I'm not doing that for free so I'm

1250
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:45,299
basically paying

1251
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:46,740
uh workers to help me with that even

1252
00:58:45,299 --> 00:58:48,420
though in reality there's no way they

1253
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:50,460
could lift up those Bales but we're just

1254
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:52,440
gonna not get too serious about that so

1255
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:54,599
we're gonna give them an additional 500

1256
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:56,579
bucks 250 a piece

1257
00:58:54,599 --> 00:59:01,740
uh for helping us with that so that

1258
00:58:56,579 --> 00:59:03,720
means we need to take 3 700 out

1259
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:06,660
to pay the workers

1260
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:09,180
very good okay so now

1261
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:10,980
this is our money at the end of July

1262
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:13,440
we've already actually looked at this

1263
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:14,339
earlier in this episode

1264
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:16,859
um

1265
00:59:14,339 --> 00:59:19,140
sold buildings

1266
00:59:16,859 --> 00:59:20,819
oh did I put

1267
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:21,960
I must have put a couple of things down

1268
00:59:20,819 --> 00:59:24,059
and then picked them back up really

1269
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:25,920
quick and I may have done some of that

1270
00:59:24,059 --> 00:59:27,660
on camera some off camera because I was

1271
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:30,059
messing with some stuff oh yeah it was

1272
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:32,460
it was the chicken was it

1273
00:59:30,059 --> 00:59:34,079
I don't remember anyway I think that's

1274
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:35,520
what that's from

1275
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:38,760
um we've looked at most of this stuff

1276
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:40,500
already so yeah that's um pause the

1277
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:41,880
screen if you wanted it if you want to

1278
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:43,859
study it but we've pretty much already

1279
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:47,220
gone through this uh it's just that

1280
00:59:43,859 --> 00:59:49,440
we're two more days uh past so we are

1281
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:52,980
now sitting on thirty thousand dollars

1282
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:56,460
of Cold Hard Cash 237

1283
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:58,440
um we have no uh debt

1284
00:59:56,460 --> 01:00:00,660
so yeah we don't own the bank anything

1285
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:03,540
for now until until I take out another

1286
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:06,000
load and we're in pretty good shape we

1287
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:07,380
are in really good shape greenhouses are

1288
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,819
good we are gonna need to get some seed

1289
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:13,339
in the greenhouses I will probably do

1290
01:00:08,819 --> 01:00:13,339
that in August and also

1291
01:00:14,119 --> 01:00:18,960
uh I don't we yeah we won't Harvest our

1292
01:00:16,859 --> 01:00:21,359
our own hay until September and then

1293
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:23,760
we'll do the farmer uh the computer

1294
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:26,640
farmers in October their third day

1295
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:27,780
