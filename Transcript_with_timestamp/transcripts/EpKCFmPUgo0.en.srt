1
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:14,009
hi everyone and good morning I'm gonna

2
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:18,240
be showing you two immune boosting

3
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:21,090
garlic ferments today so Patrick and I

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:26,730
were talking just before we started

5
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:29,369
rolling about all different kinds of

6
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:32,120
things that we do for immune boosting

7
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:36,300
purposes and we started to write a list

8
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:38,550
but the list was like this big so rather

9
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,230
than just I tell you all the things we

10
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,170
do I thought that I would just start by

11
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:46,200
telling you what we've done today what

12
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:48,660
was what we've done so far um first

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,059
thing we did well it started last night

14
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:54,059
but then I could go on and on but I'll

15
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:56,059
just stop it last night we went to bed

16
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:59,160
as early as we could after we'd had

17
00:00:56,059 --> 00:01:03,719
dinner we went to put the goats to bed

18
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:07,500
he went for a walk and back to stop

19
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:11,189
hunting skills and then read stories and

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:13,490
then set the fire the mornings so we

21
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:16,619
tried to go to bed as early as we could

22
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:18,659
we tried to wake up with the Sun which

23
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:20,479
we did so we woke up just before dawn so

24
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:24,659
that's part of it just sort of being in

25
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:30,060
in the circadian rhythm to align that

26
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:31,860
with the Sun we set we lit the fire so

27
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,659
that was we chopped the wood we were

28
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,390
thankful for the wood so we started with

29
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:39,509
some gratefulness we hopped on that

30
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:42,270
Patrick and I hopped on our bikes we

31
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:44,579
don't have a car so being on our bikes

32
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,759
and being Hardy to the cold which it is

33
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:49,610
now here in central Victoria it started

34
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:54,180
to get very cold with these autumnal

35
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:56,969
mornings and nights and days to vote on

36
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:59,520
our bikes down to the local lake we

37
00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:02,540
stripped off and to be naked first thing

38
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:06,090
out in the world he's a beautiful thing

39
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:10,050
we went swimming for five to ten minutes

40
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:12,620
or so and then what freezing and it was

41
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:15,739
glorious and then we

42
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:17,959
danced on the deck on the jetty and then

43
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:21,560
put our clothes back on and then rode

44
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:26,450
home sat by the fire had tea fed the

45
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:32,780
chickens for breakfast we had fermented

46
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:37,700
pancakes with it some way and some from

47
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:40,940
our cheese making some raw way some and

48
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:45,140
eggs from our chickens I'm saying I'm a

49
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:50,180
lot it's early still some a cornmeal

50
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:53,299
some spelt flour and some buckwheat

51
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:56,180
flour and then we had it with our honey

52
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:59,629
and some gifted blackberry jam and some

53
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:02,989
yogurt and now we're ready to talk about

54
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:05,000
our some of our ferments that we you're

55
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:07,819
gonna mention the argument oh yeah we

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,890
had an argument which is also part of

57
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:12,170
immune boosting especially when we wake

58
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:15,980
up and we're filled with oxytocin and

59
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:18,380
all the good stuff but also having our

60
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:21,230
voices heard and being able to express

61
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:25,190
that in a safe environment is part of

62
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:27,769
yes feeling confident and feeling loved

63
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:32,150
and valued even in the more challenging

64
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:34,250
moments so I love you passionately so we

65
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:37,639
try to eat something fermented with

66
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:39,980
every meal and especially this time of

67
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:41,120
year we really focus on other building

68
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:43,849
up our medicine chests

69
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,699
what can we grow what can we gather what

70
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:48,919
can we ferment what can we preserve what

71
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:53,079
can we prepare that is going to see us

72
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:55,849
out through the cold and flu season so

73
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:57,199
my go to my person will go to Patrick

74
00:03:55,849 --> 00:03:59,299
has other ones and I'll talk about that

75
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:05,049
in a minute but my person will go to is

76
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:08,599
garlic I really like it's like antiviral

77
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:10,549
antibiotic properties and I always feel

78
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:12,230
much better after I've got a tickle I

79
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:15,290
feeling a little bit vulnerable then I

80
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:19,729
like to go for garlic but I do find if I

81
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:23,060
have it in its raw form then I do get a

82
00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:25,639
bit of an upset tummy so I'd like to

83
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:28,759
ferment it which helps break down

84
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:30,800
the sugars in it and make it much more

85
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:34,759
as predigested when it's cemented to

86
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:40,550
make it much more palatable and easy to

87
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:42,410
digest and easy to ingest so when we're

88
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:45,020
sitting by the fire before our argument

89
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:51,020
we had some are we certain we've peel

90
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:52,190
some of our homegrown Dalek so ferments

91
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,710
I'm going to show you this morning one

92
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:58,759
is a sweet one one is a savory one and

93
00:04:54,710 --> 00:05:01,430
they both take about six months to

94
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:04,490
ferment so we do have some from previous

95
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:08,419
years so we have very long cold winter

96
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:11,000
seasons here so even if what we ferment

97
00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:14,630
today is going to last us well into the

98
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,650
cold season so the first one I'm going

99
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:21,620
to show you is a honey garlic ferment so

100
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:26,870
just have a regular-sized wrap and some

101
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:30,440
peels clothes and just going to put some

102
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:33,940
in a jar like this and maybe a few less

103
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:39,259
cuz I need a few more for the next one

104
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:44,300
I'm simply going to you've got some of

105
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:50,780
our honey from our bees here so I'm

106
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:55,039
simply going to cover the cloves with

107
00:05:50,780 --> 00:06:02,780
honey and you can put as much as you

108
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:05,770
want in as long as all of the clothes

109
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,770
are covered with the honey

110
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:20,140
so we eat try to eat a lot of fermented

111
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:22,570
foods for a number of reasons the first

112
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:25,240
one is because they taste really good

113
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:30,340
the second one is because it preserves

114
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:37,900
and increases the longevity of the food

115
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:39,550
that we grow we do it because of the the

116
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,410
now what indigenous people have known

117
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:43,660
you know in every culture what they've

118
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:47,350
known for thousands and thousands of

119
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:49,180
years is that fermented foods are good

120
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:53,050
for our well-being you know what we know

121
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:55,330
about the gut brain access and how great

122
00:06:53,050 --> 00:07:00,310
it is to eat fermented foods that it's

123
00:06:55,330 --> 00:07:01,960
good for our gut microbiome but it's

124
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:04,600
also yeah it's just good for whole body

125
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:07,150
health so people who eat a lot of

126
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:09,970
fermented foods I think can attest to

127
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:11,290
the benefits so I might give this to my

128
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:17,350
assistant woody would you like to take

129
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:21,580
the spoon thank you and the gut

130
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:26,590
regulates the immune system so that's a

131
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:30,970
big one so as I said in our doing lots

132
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:34,840
of things with apples video that the

133
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:39,850
aliens so leek and garlic and onions and

134
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:44,620
chives are full of prebiotics which is

135
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:46,870
what the probiotics in our guts ate so

136
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:49,810
to have this this is the garlic is the

137
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:52,450
prebiotic and it'll turn into a

138
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:54,850
probiotic once that starts once the

139
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:57,100
honey will draw the liquid out of the

140
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:59,620
garlic and it will become quite runny so

141
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:03,160
at the moment you can see there that's

142
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:06,040
gonna take a long time this is raw honey

143
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:08,280
and yeah just to note about a couple of

144
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:12,820
things a few step backs a few steps back

145
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:15,340
that in terms of sterilizing I just use

146
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:16,780
very hot soapy water I don't need to

147
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:18,940
sterilize this job because we're

148
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:22,930
courting life and so if I was preserving

149
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:24,100
for a long time I sat out or fruit stood

150
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:26,740
fruit then I were

151
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:28,690
to sterilize my jars but here I don't

152
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,710
need to sew just hot soapy water when

153
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:33,220
it's dry then you can put your

154
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:35,380
ingredients in and in terms of honey

155
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:38,530
we're very fortunate that we have our

156
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:40,210
own bees that we harvest honey from but

157
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:42,280
if you don't have that then if you can

158
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:44,229
just try to get local honey is really

159
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:46,960
good because it's got all the properties

160
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:52,390
that you need for your local bio region

161
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:55,200
and also the cold extracted is good not

162
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:57,850
heat extracted okay so we have our

163
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:01,030
garlic and honey so what I'm gonna do

164
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:02,470
when I finish up with you guys here is

165
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:04,210
that I'm gonna make sure the lid is on

166
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:06,520
really tired I'm gonna stick it in a

167
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:10,960
cupboard and I'm gonna just turn it on

168
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:12,490
its lid like this and then tomorrow I'm

169
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,890
going to turn it back this way in the

170
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:17,410
cupboard and then keep doing this until

171
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:20,290
the garlic the honey starts to get

172
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:21,730
really runny and then when it does it's

173
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:23,290
then you know that it's starting to

174
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,910
ferment and so I'm going to keep doing

175
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:26,530
that for the next two weeks just keep

176
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:29,140
turning it because the garlic is going

177
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:30,700
it's got the it's got oxygen in it and

178
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:33,700
it's going to want to pop to the top of

179
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:37,000
the honey and as it starts to ferment

180
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:39,310
everyday I'm going to so in a couple of

181
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,660
days I'll start doing this so I'm going

182
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:42,550
to just make sure all the honey is

183
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:45,280
tripped down and I'm just going to open

184
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:46,570
the lid like that in fermenting language

185
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,550
that's called burping where you release

186
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:50,200
the carbon dioxide make sure the lids on

187
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:52,150
really tight and then stick it back in

188
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,950
the cupboard like that the next day like

189
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:56,650
that open it up release carbon dioxide

190
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:58,180
lid back on until it's really really

191
00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:01,000
runny and then I'm just going to keep it

192
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:03,670
in the cupboard for six months and then

193
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,850
in six month time I've got a couple here

194
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:10,240
this is from 2018 so two years ago eight

195
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:11,770
for 2018 and you can see how runny geez

196
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,540
that's not going to take very long for

197
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:15,850
this honey that we've just made today

198
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:18,100
to get that runny and also you can see

199
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:20,140
that it's gone dark and so this was the

200
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,850
same color honey to begin with and you

201
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:25,390
can see the change in color and

202
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:27,370
consistency and so now what happens

203
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:29,830
through the magic of fermentation is

204
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:31,690
that the honey and the garlic swap

205
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:35,190
properties so the garlic becomes honey

206
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:37,620
the honey becomes garlic garlicky

207
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:39,690
and so now whenever I've got a tickle or

208
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,970
feeling a bit rundown then I will take a

209
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:44,670
clove and just munch on it and it

210
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:47,759
doesn't have that sting of a raw clove

211
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:50,069
of garlic and all the honey that's left

212
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:51,600
over so this is what I give to woody to

213
00:10:50,069 --> 00:10:53,279
have so he just has that on a tea spoon

214
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,120
if he doesn't want the garlic or I'll

215
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:59,490
use some of the the honey to braise meat

216
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,069
or what I usually do is just use it in a

217
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:06,000
salad dressing and here's one that I've

218
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:08,129
got from last year for 2019 and you can

219
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,829
see that these cloves are a little bit

220
00:11:08,129 --> 00:11:13,470
bigger because they haven't been all of

221
00:11:10,829 --> 00:11:15,300
the the liquid in the garlic hasn't been

222
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:17,879
drawn out yet

223
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:20,490
so the reason that we put it in the

224
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:23,279
cupboard is because it doesn't want

225
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:25,740
doesn't like to be in the light it's

226
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,639
just a ferment that likes to it's a

227
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:31,279
private ferment

228
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:34,019
let's just put it that way like this

229
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:37,500
lays that what are they called there's

230
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:42,600
light a lava lamp

231
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:43,980
a garlic lava lamp okay and when I

232
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,350
finished you I'm also gonna put a label

233
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:49,230
on it just so I can I know what what

234
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:53,850
year it is so in two years time you can

235
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:55,680
say I know remember that day right so

236
00:11:53,850 --> 00:12:00,329
the next cement I'm going to show you is

237
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:04,620
a fermented garlic paste so I think I'll

238
00:12:00,329 --> 00:12:07,199
show you the end product first so this

239
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:12,180
is what you can see I've had my fingers

240
00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:14,220
in there so this is a garlic kraut which

241
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:17,610
is just like a garlic paste so it's two

242
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:19,319
ingredients garlic and salt and through

243
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:21,180
the magic of fermentation you can see

244
00:12:19,319 --> 00:12:23,610
the colour has gone from this to this

245
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:27,360
dark color so I'll just show you how to

246
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:28,649
make that this is amazing and anything

247
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,209
that you're cooking and you think Oh

248
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:32,790
what does it kind of need it means

249
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:35,309
necessary little something garlic rat

250
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:38,990
these are always your answer definitely

251
00:12:35,309 --> 00:12:42,000
my go-to and I can't make enough of it

252
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:44,220
put my garlic cloves into my food

253
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,809
processor and I haven't actually tried

254
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,740
to do these with a mortar and pestle

255
00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:49,800
if you give it a go and it

256
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:54,630
works or doesn't work please let me know

257
00:12:49,800 --> 00:13:01,480
so I'm just gonna guess with the salt a

258
00:12:54,630 --> 00:13:04,240
couple of sprinkles I'd say and when

259
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:07,960
I've taught this in the past people have

260
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:15,660
wondered about botulism I've never had

261
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:15,660
an issue with it so I can't talk to that

262
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:22,620
I'm going to grind it up make it into a

263
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:22,620
paste skis nose

264
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:27,190
[Music]

265
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:45,970
scoop it into a jar so I recommend using

266
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:49,180
non-iodized salt for safe implementation

267
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:52,150
that's best we get our salt from the

268
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:54,010
pink leg up Needham baller and this was

269
00:13:52,150 --> 00:14:01,120
brought back by our neighbor Bob so

270
00:13:54,010 --> 00:14:16,090
thanks Bob okay so scoop that into my

271
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:18,790
jar so if you'd like to know a little

272
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:20,830
bit more about fermentation Patrick

273
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:23,470
wrote a book a couple of years ago

274
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:26,400
called reefer minting culture if you'd

275
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:30,540
like a copy of that as a PDF then just

276
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:34,630
message us and we'll send you a copy

277
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:37,390
just looking at the history and as well

278
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:40,540
as the health benefits of fermentation

279
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:43,210
in the context of terrain theory which

280
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:45,400
is really how we live our lives so

281
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:49,110
making sure we not making sure but just

282
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:53,860
being open and not fearful to handling

283
00:14:49,110 --> 00:15:07,030
moss and rocks and wood and honey and

284
00:14:53,860 --> 00:15:08,740
soil and just be part of life so again

285
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:10,710
this will need to be burped I'm just

286
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:13,090
gonna set this on my fermenting table

287
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:16,990
you can have the lid screwed on you can

288
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:19,870
have it not screwed on this is really an

289
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:22,920
amazing ferment to make and to have your

290
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:26,350
kids watch you watch part of the process

291
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:29,590
because it changes colors so profoundly

292
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:32,290
and so miraculously I've had these um

293
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:34,720
I've done these ferments before and it's

294
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:36,910
gone bright blue I've had it go green

295
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:41,980
the last time I made it with this one

296
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:42,760
here I filled the jar up so that was a

297
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:46,790
lot

298
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:48,800
garlic clove peeling and it lifted the

299
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:51,440
lid was just sitting there and it lifted

300
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,150
the lid up like this and it went a kind

301
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,580
of green and this was just sitting on it

302
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:58,610
and then the next day it went back down

303
00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:00,470
again and then slowly over time it went

304
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:03,920
from this beautiful greeny blue color to

305
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:06,770
this now brown color it was really

306
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,900
amazing so yeah so this is about a year

307
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:12,760
old but after six months it was ready

308
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:17,330
and it takes on this kind of caramely

309
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:20,450
lemony garlicky salty flavor and the

310
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:23,360
thing that I use this for most often is

311
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:25,430
for rubbing on meat that we have on

312
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,050
roast but you can also just have it on

313
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:31,400
toast having them toast with a bit of

314
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:32,720
honey is also really delicious yeah okay

315
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,490
I'm just going to show you some other

316
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,160
ferments that I do exactly the same way

317
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:41,300
as this garlic cement so I've got here's

318
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:43,190
some grated ginger so you can see how

319
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:45,560
liquidy this is and at first it took a

320
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:48,110
long time like the garlic did to turn

321
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,560
over and so yeah this is really

322
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,810
delicious

323
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,030
just to have a teaspoon of it and in

324
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:54,920
Chinese medicine they call ginger the

325
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:56,750
messenger because it's so good for our

326
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,210
circulation and it helps all the

327
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:00,650
different foods and all the different

328
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:02,960
parts of our blood to get to where it

329
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:06,020
need the components of our blood to get

330
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:08,780
to where it needs to go in the body here

331
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:11,480
I've got a the last little remnants of a

332
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:14,240
tumeric ginger ferment also just grated

333
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:16,069
turmeric and then cover with honey the

334
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,540
turmeric one I love ginger that the

335
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:19,040
turmeric one is probably my favorite

336
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:22,100
which is where there's not much of a

337
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:25,670
left at this here is some bloodlines and

338
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:27,770
that a food co-op cut in and to eat them

339
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:29,570
by themselves is really like candy

340
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:32,300
they're really delicious and also

341
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:34,100
sometimes cut little pieces of it up and

342
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:35,300
stick it in our fruit loaf or you can

343
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:39,410
just sort of eat it by yourself it's

344
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:42,640
just magical this one here is orange

345
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:47,800
peel chili and black peppercorns and

346
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:50,690
again highly medicinal and delicious

347
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:52,490
I've got here that our friend Rosie made

348
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:57,250
thanks Rosie with our hops it's just the

349
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:57,250
last little bit of our hops in

350
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:03,460
last one here this is ginger tumeric

351
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:07,030
lemon orange peel and peppercorns and

352
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:09,220
again medicinal and the peel just goes

353
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:12,220
candied and it was just fresh peel that

354
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:14,500
we chopped up and put in the honey so

355
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:16,780
these are just a couple of the natural

356
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:19,000
flu shot ferments that we make every

357
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:22,090
year if you have any questions please

358
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,890
send us a message or leave it in the

359
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:26,590
comments we have been overwhelmed by

360
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:28,660
people sending us questions and messages

361
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:33,900
so we will get back to all of you might
