  "text": "[Music] in Wyoming we tend to have soils that are lacking in organic matter and one of the best things you can do before you begin to prep a garden site is to have a soil test done and that will tell you the amount of organic matter you have in your soil as well as the nutrients you do have and things that you might need to add to that soil so some of the different organic matters that you might use are composted kitchen scraps and yard waste from your own garden and yard um compost that you can get from the garden centers composted manure that you can buy in packages Pete Moss straw anything that was plant-based before it became a product that you'd use for a soil amendment in the garden that will help with drainage for heavy clay soils um and holding on to water in sandier soils so that you get the benefit of the nutrient that you add to the soil rather than having it drain away when you put on organic matter um we would recommend that you put on about 2 in and then rake it into your soil and then roota till it in as deeply as you can if you're lacking in nutrients you can get a variety of different fertilizers to add to your soil and then your garden is really prepared and ready to use for your gardening season this will benefit your garden from the ground up this has been Donna Quinn for the University of Wyoming extension [Music]",
