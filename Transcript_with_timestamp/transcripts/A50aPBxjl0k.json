  "text": "what do you think is the most essential ingredient for plant survival think about it yes it's water water is essential without water plants wouldn't be able to bloom protect fruits or grow seeds they even need to absorb nutrients and minerals through their Roots do you know that 90% of plant's body is made of water yes and water helps seeds sprout dissolve nutrients to move them around and it even protects the crop from extreme temperatures and how do we ensure plants get all this water through irrigation now you may ask what is irrigation simply put irrigation is a process of watering crops just watering crops then why do we need such a fancy name like irrigation for just watering crops well it's not just watering crops it's about watering them at the right time and in the right amount to help them grow and stay productive naturally the next question is what determines this right time and right amount yes what determines the right time and the right amount depends on few important factors like the type of crop different plants need different amounts of water for example Patty needs way more water than wheat soil type or the type of soil matters a lot sandy soil for instance dries out quickly and needs more free beon watering while clay soils hold water for longer then season hot summer days means plants lose more water due to evaporation and transpiration so they need extra Care on the other hand during monsoon nature does most of the watering for us so the need of irrigation is much less during monsoon so watering crops at the right time in the right amount based on factors like type of crop soil and season is what we call irrigation and without proper irrigation plant can W and let's be honest none of us want our fields and plants to look like this the next big question is where does irrigation water come from or in other words what are the sources of water for irrigation irrigation water can come from a variety of sources it can be extracted from groundw which is drawn from Wells tube Wells or water spring or it can come from surface water uh like rivers lakes and canals there are also some pretty Innovative sources such as non-conventional sources which includes rainwater harvested or treated drainage water which is reused for watering crops now how exactly is water extracted from these different sources and diverted to the Farmland well Farmers usually rely on two main methods the traditional method and the modern technique back in the day irrigation involved all some pretty basic yet clever techniques these methods were simple often relying on human or animal effort let's take a quick look at some of them the first and probably the most common one is a police system you might have seen this in action before it is where water is lifted using a pulley and now exactly what is a pulley a pulley is a mechanical device as you can see here which is designed to reduce the effort needed to pull something heavy like a bucket of water from a well as you see here it's a very smart technique right yes it is next up we have a rotating chain pump system this system uses a rotating chain to bring water to the surface as you can imagine or as you see in this diagram the chain rotates and as it does it Scoops up water perhaps from a well or even a river and bring it to the top where it's needed from there it is diverted to the farmland and how is this rotated usually this is again rotated by using a human effort or maybe an animal effort is being used in rotating These Chains then there is liver system think of it as like a long lver used to scoop water it works just like a seesaw balancing the weight of the water on one side and the effort either Again by human or animal on the other it is very simple and effective technique and finally we have Furrow irrigation which you might have seen many times where water flows through these trenes dug in the field these trenes guide the water directly to the crops making sure they stay hydrated while these traditional methods were cheap and easy to set up they weren't the most efficient at saving water or covering large areas but hey they got the job done for centuries you got to admire simple clever methods they laid the foundation for modern irrigation system we use today fast forward to today an irrigation has gone high-tech modern system focuses on saving water while still getting the job done let explore two of the methods here the first is a sprinkler irrigation or a sprinkler system in this method pipes with nozzles spray water like rain over a large area it works well with uneven surfaces ensuring that every corner gets just the right amount of water now where does the water come from for the sprinkler system water is pumped from River well or other sources using a motorized pump next up is drip irrigation and in this method water is directly delivered to the root drop by drop there is no wastage here it's super precise this method is a lifesaver in water scarce areas as it ensures that every drop counts just like with the sprinkler irrigation the water is pumped from a river or a well using a motorized pump so in modern irrigation techniques human or animal effort has been replaced by machines like motorized pump these advancements not only save time and energy but makes irrigation far more efficient and sustainable so let's quickly summarize so what is irrigation it's just watering crops at the right time and in the right amount simple right factors like type of crop soil and season decide how much water is needed and what are the sources of water in for irrigation irrigation water comes from groundwater like Well Spring tube Wells Etc surface water like rivers lakes and canals and then you have some non-conventional sources like rain water or even tree heed drainage water now to distribute this water farmers use traditional and mod modern methods traditional methods rely on human or animal effort and the first one is the most common type that is a pulley system which lifts water using a pulley to reduce effort the second method is a chain pump method where rotating chain scoop water to the surface and the third one is a liver system works like a sea sort of scoop water water fourth traditional method is fur irrigation where trenches guide water to the crops traditional methods are cheap and simple but they are not so efficient now the mo modern methods are machine driven and saves a lot of water first one being sprinkler irrigation where pipes spray water like rain perfect for uneven land then you have drip irrigation where which delivers water drop by drop to the plant roots ideal for water scarse areas both the modern methods use motorized pump replacing human or animal effort with these techniques farming is faster smarter and way more sustainable",
