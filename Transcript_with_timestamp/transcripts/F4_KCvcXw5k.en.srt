1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,040
all right everybody this is ross so

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,560
in today's video i thought i would take

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,639
you guys around the yard

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,639
and show you guys different trees

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,240
different fruiting plants

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,880
that i have whether that's the grape

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,480
vines some of the bushes that might be

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,680
growing some of these fruit trees like

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,760
these are cherries

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,279
and apples and pears and persimmons all

11
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,960
the different things that

12
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,599
i grow here on this property i thought i

13
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,840
would touch on pruning

14
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,279
each individual one we're not going to

15
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,240
get to all of them but what i want to

16
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,280
really go over

17
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,680
is things like form what the trees look

18
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,760
like kind of things you shouldn't do

19
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,160
this is all going to be about winter

20
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,440
pruning by the way

21
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,040
and there's really two different types

22
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,160
of pruning i guess you could really

23
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,039
narrow it down

24
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,320
to winter pruning and summer pruning and

25
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,559
i would actually argue

26
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,360
for the majority of the species that you

27
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,360
guys can grow

28
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,199
in a more temperate climate like my own

29
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,719
in the philadelphia area

30
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,000
i would say you're probably your best

31
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,719
bet is actually to do some summer

32
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,039
pruning

33
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,040
and to really stay on top of that that's

34
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,960
going to really help with a lot of us

35
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,880
throughout the country that have disease

36
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,479
pressure maybe you guys have a lot of

37
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,479
pest pressure

38
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,320
it's going to really keep these trees in

39
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,720
a state of

40
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,759
uh size control for us that are backyard

41
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,400
growers

42
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,759
and it's also gonna really help with uh

43
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,479
getting ourselves a

44
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,479
good fruit set every year when we do a

45
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,240
lot of winter pruning

46
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,640
and you know it's not technically i

47
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,320
guess really the winter right now

48
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,720
or we're approaching the spring very

49
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,840
quickly there are some trees on my

50
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:41,119
property that have broken bud

51
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,960
and yeah you could argue that i guess

52
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,640
it's not really the wintertime at that

53
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,720
point anymore but

54
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,799
certainly if you're doing pruning when

55
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,079
the tree is still semi-dormant or

56
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:54,479
dormant you're gonna then contribute

57
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,000
towards the following season or during

58
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,280
the growing season

59
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,759
having a lot of growth that's kind of

60
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,600
the tree's natural response we change

61
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,360
the hormones within the tree actually

62
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,000
when we do our pruning

63
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,759
we are directly impacting the hormones

64
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,560
in these trees and in these fruiting

65
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,800
plants

66
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,879
so that's really what you need i think

67
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,920
to take that perspective going into all

68
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,000
of this

69
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,840
is what exactly is it that we're doing

70
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,080
we're really just changing the hormones

71
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,840
and by doing this in the winter

72
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,840
we're changing the hormones in a way

73
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,520
that is promoting growth

74
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,200
promoting vigor for the next season

75
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,599
and for a lot of us that might not be

76
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,000
something we really want

77
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,879
in the summer instead on a lot of these

78
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,680
fruiting plants

79
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,560
we actually are going to be promoting

80
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,920
flour

81
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:47,680
and producing budwood or

82
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:51,120
spurs or wood that actually has

83
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,640
flowers or fruit buds on it so

84
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,120
that's really key there i think that

85
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,800
little distinction there in terms of

86
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,959
the difference now these are cherries

87
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,000
these are on semi dwarf

88
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,680
stock and what i really don't like about

89
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,280
these trees after i've

90
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,440
been pruning them for a number of years

91
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,680
you know i didn't know all the things i

92
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,120
i know today when i first started as i

93
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,640
learned

94
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,959
i got more knowledge and i've learned

95
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,680
from my mistakes and i'll tell you that

96
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,319
these cherry trees have a pretty good

97
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,840
form

98
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:24,879
but only in this area of the tree

99
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,680
ideally this area here should be a

100
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,159
couple feet

101
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,799
lower and that you can see all this

102
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,680
really good branching up in here

103
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,159
it's really forming a nice dense canopy

104
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,159
after

105
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,760
years of finally pruning them back a bit

106
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,440
harder than i um

107
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,519
would have really anticipated from the

108
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,200
beginning

109
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,879
in the winter time they then start to

110
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,879
put out all these different shoots

111
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,599
all these different growth points that

112
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,440
then form really the canopy i've wanted

113
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,280
and a big recommendation for anyone in

114
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,959
the in a backyard

115
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,360
environment is that we want to prune

116
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,879
them when you first get them as a whiff

117
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,640
right you're just starting out maybe you

118
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,959
guys are not at this point yet

119
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,400
is you want to prune them at your knee

120
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,599
and that's going to create the branching

121
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,760
down below but

122
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,360
sometimes you don't get exactly all the

123
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,560
branching that you want it doesn't

124
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,200
branch out

125
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,200
as much as you need like this tree here

126
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,799
i did exactly that

127
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,440
and it only put out two different

128
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,880
branches maybe three different branches

129
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,560
and for me that's just not enough

130
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,840
because we really want this

131
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,680
big dense canopy a lot lower and you can

132
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,000
see as i get higher up on the tree

133
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,360
there's

134
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,720
one two three four maybe even five

135
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:38,080
you know main scaffolds to this tree

136
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:42,080
i'm gonna zoom in bring you guys

137
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,919
closer these main scaffolds that i'm i'm

138
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,919
looking at here are really what are

139
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,479
going to produce the main

140
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,880
fruit from you know going forward so if

141
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,800
i have more of these scaffolds

142
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,280
and i have them in a higher quantity but

143
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,120
i have them at a lower point

144
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,720
we're gonna be better off with size

145
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,280
control i mean that's a really big point

146
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,880
i think

147
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,880
you know you've got the trunk down here

148
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,800
and then it forks off and you could say

149
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,320
that oh well these are scaffolds

150
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,320
but really technically as we go up

151
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,320
higher you could even make an argument

152
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,120
that these four branches here

153
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,039
are really the main scaffolds and then

154
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,400
from there of course we get this

155
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:21,120
diverse dense canopy here with all the

156
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,880
fruit buds on it and you can see

157
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,720
you know this is kind of a great time to

158
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,320
do the pruning because you can very

159
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,240
clearly see what's a fruit bud and

160
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,639
what's a knot and you know

161
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,039
what's it not but you know this is

162
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,639
obviously a fruit bud if you can see

163
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,440
all those different buds there in a

164
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,440
cluster now these are cherries and every

165
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,880
fruiting plant unfortunately you're

166
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,960
going to have to learn

167
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,000
how exactly they behave what they look

168
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,520
like but

169
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,160
one of the most surefire ways to know

170
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:53,199
what is a flower cluster what will be

171
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,720
actually a fruit is just to wait until

172
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,520
they start to break bud

173
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,880
now that tree obviously hasn't just yet

174
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:03,440
i'm really quite surprised even though

175
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,560
technically i would say around early to

176
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,520
mid march we do

177
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,520
start to see bud break here i'm actually

178
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,319
quite surprised to see it as early as we

179
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,680
have this year

180
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:16,160
simply just because of the the very cold

181
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,440
um weather we've been having and it just

182
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,199
turned warm

183
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,720
and all it really took was that warm

184
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,600
snap of weather

185
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,280
to really get these trees breaking bud

186
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,479
now i'll show you

187
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,240
this was one area here that i really

188
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:33,280
like to talk about is actually the

189
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,360
espalier for a home gardener

190
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,960
the asparagus just can't be beat in my

191
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,440
opinion i think it's beautiful

192
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,360
it functions in so many different ways

193
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,039
and it also produces a ton of fruit now

194
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,319
these peach trees have been here i think

195
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,400
for six or seven

196
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,919
this might be their seventh year i'm not

197
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,680
i don't remember exactly how many years

198
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,000
it's been

199
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,280
but the point is is that they really

200
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,080
have a beautiful

201
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,280
uh form to them and that they have the

202
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,280
arms going out and

203
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,720
it's not perfect you know there's some

204
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,240
gaps in here and actually

205
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,479
i had to cut out a couple scaffolds

206
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,000
not a couple scaffolds a couple arms on

207
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,360
the cordons here it's supposed to be

208
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,120
three tiers right

209
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,319
there's a tier down here there's a tear

210
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,599
in the middle and there's a tier at the

211
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,520
top

212
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,960
unfortunately if you don't do this

213
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,240
really uh

214
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,000
the best way and the right way from the

215
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,360
beginning and you kind of make a few

216
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,199
maybe you make a few mistakes and you

217
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,960
don't go back and correct it

218
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,479
you could actually have a situation like

219
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,440
myself where

220
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:33,199
you actually had to cut out some of the

221
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,240
arms and i cut them out because the wood

222
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,840
was dead

223
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,919
and the reason why the wood was dead is

224
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,840
because this growth up here

225
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,759
or maybe even this growth down here is

226
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,440
then shading

227
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,199
out that growth and anything that gets

228
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,720
shaded in let's say the center or the

229
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,720
bottom of the tree

230
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,400
is going to just die it's just the tree

231
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,160
is not going to want to put the energy

232
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,720
in to support that anymore

233
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,879
so it's going to be gone and really the

234
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,199
main pruning i've done

235
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,560
not just on these but the trees we can

236
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,000
you know we just looked at those cherry

237
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,400
trees i really just came in here and

238
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,680
really

239
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,440
thinned out some of that density i don't

240
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,759
want a lot of this dense wood we came in

241
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,080
here

242
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,160
obviously we looked at here actually is

243
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,560
some branching that i missed

244
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,160
that's dead or diseased or damaged in

245
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,680
some way that's obviously going to come

246
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,240
out

247
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,160
but really i think at this point once

248
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,879
you get your tree somewhat established

249
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,120
after we

250
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,120
you know we cut it back at the knee we

251
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,960
get the form that we want let's say

252
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,240
maybe it's in this style here well we're

253
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,599
not going to cut it back

254
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,279
at the knee and we're going to let the

255
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,719
single stem whip grow all the way to the

256
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,240
top of the wire

257
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,000
and then we're going to cut it and then

258
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,279
we're going to let it branch out

259
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,640
and tie those main branches down to that

260
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,040
wire

261
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,279
but regardless of how you're doing this

262
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,800
um once you have this really set up

263
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,800
i think the winter pruning is really

264
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,519
just for opening up the center a bit

265
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,800
more

266
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,800
if you have a lot of branching

267
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,800
especially up here towards the top

268
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,560
that's really dense and thick

269
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,920
we got to remove some of that i took out

270
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,560
some really big cuts

271
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,480
and that was mostly it i got my saw and

272
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,320
i made bigger cuts

273
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,160
that makes a bigger difference than just

274
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,360
coming in here and doing some very

275
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,560
fine detail pruning you can't

276
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,480
necessarily go

277
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,160
too hard with this because there's so

278
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,959
much fruit wood here

279
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,240
i mean all of this down here pretty much

280
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,120
at my head level

281
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,680
down has got fruit on it and it's uh

282
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,839
it's in huge abundance

283
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,880
so i wouldn't necessarily worry i know

284
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,320
some people

285
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,519
come into the winter pruning or the

286
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,399
pruning at this time of the year and

287
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,760
they think oh

288
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,680
i don't want to go too hard with my

289
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,080
pruning because i'm going to lose all my

290
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,600
fruit

291
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,720
well when your tree is established

292
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,920
you're going to have more fruit than you

293
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,240
know what to do with

294
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,160
so i wouldn't think about it like that i

295
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,640
would really think about it in terms of

296
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,560
well when i make this cut how is the

297
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,720
tree going to respond

298
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,640
in terms of growth and if you have a lot

299
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,800
of growth let's say at the top

300
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,120
and you're just doing some thinning it's

301
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,720
not going to be a big deal because

302
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,480
well you've already got branches that

303
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,360
have that dominance

304
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,279
right the highest branches on the trees

305
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,079
have that apical dominance that's that

306
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,320
hormone

307
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:10,399
that i'm talking about if you make those

308
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,200
cuts you change those hormones

309
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,000
then now the tree then struggles to find

310
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,399
a difference

311
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,519
in dominance or maybe there's competing

312
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,440
branches

313
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,120
so for me that's all it really was i

314
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,160
came in here at the top i made a couple

315
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,839
cuts

316
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,600
took out some of the dead wood i'm still

317
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,800
seeing some dead wood

318
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,959
um you know i came over here at the top

319
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,040
took out some of those branches we even

320
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,880
just trimmed this back a little bit so

321
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,320
that this isn't encroaching too far

322
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,320
outwards away from the fence and uh

323
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,279
and that was mostly it i mean it's uh

324
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:47,360
it's really that simple what i should do

325
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:49,120
for the future and i could i guess

326
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,399
if i really wanted to is cut out

327
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,600
everything up here

328
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,279
and make just a cut right up in here

329
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,959
and i could really pay attention to in

330
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,720
the future is in the summer

331
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,560
keep doing my summer pruning if i don't

332
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,240
want to make these trees so tall

333
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,240
now these are almost 20 feet tall

334
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,399
you know it's certainly at least 15 so

335
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,839
if they're 15 feet tall and i'm saying

336
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,079
to myself i can't reach

337
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,240
some of the fruit up here i need a

338
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,399
ladder well

339
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,240
you know it is what it is i have to

340
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,800
either change my strategy or just deal

341
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,640
with it

342
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,160
so if you're somebody who doesn't want

343
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,600
to get on a ladder doesn't want to have

344
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,279
to deal with this

345
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,640
there's a lot of fruit up here maybe i

346
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,760
could leave it for the birds maybe i

347
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,000
could leave it for the animals or

348
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,600
whatnot but

349
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
you know in my experience it's probably

350
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,200
better and i wish i knew this from the

351
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,640
past as i probably

352
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,760
could have just made a cut all the way

353
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:42,079
across the top and just keep everything

354
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,680
nice and pruned as the summer progresses

355
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,079
don't let anything get away from you

356
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,160
and that controls the size and also

357
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,399
produces budwood for next year

358
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,000
it's not like i should say fruiting wood

359
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,240
for next year it's not like i'm gonna

360
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,480
lose out i mean all this stuff

361
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,720
down here on these lower tiers is bent

362
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,639
over got the nice angle to it it's

363
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,440
filled with fruits

364
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,800
filled with flowers i should say and

365
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,079
i'll be fine i don't really have to

366
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,200
worry too much

367
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:12,320
now we go over here to the grapes

368
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,160
it's a pretty different story i mean of

369
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,399
course we have our level of permanence

370
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,959
right we've got ourselves a trunk

371
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,560
we then put out some scaffolds we we

372
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,680
have that permanence that we can always

373
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,880
come back to

374
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:27,120
or build off of the grapevine's

375
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,480
quite similar and it really does depend

376
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,200
on how you want to do it but

377
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,279
i got myself my main trunk i have myself

378
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,279
my two arms along the wire

379
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,560
and then along the wire i have myself

380
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,160
the spurs

381
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,000
and along these spurs i just keep

382
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,399
cutting them back

383
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,720
to maybe one or two buds and every year

384
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:48,959
this the spurs get a little bit longer

385
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:51,120
a little bit taller and uh and that's it

386
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,160
with grapes you really do have to worry

387
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,880
about pruning them

388
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,920
too early simply because a lot of the

389
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,200
wood can

390
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:01,440
dry out and desiccate in the wintertime

391
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:05,040
so it's definitely advised

392
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:08,160
to wait until about now

393
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,079
kind of right before bud break so um my

394
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,480
apples are kind of a similar

395
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,320
story i mean this is a little bit

396
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,959
different though in in terms of

397
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,200
their dwarf they're very dwarf they're

398
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:21,360
not like the semi dwarves we looked at

399
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,360
with those cherries in the beginning you

400
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,279
know those cherries will get to maybe 15

401
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,880
feet

402
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,120
you know these peaches here will get to

403
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,720
about 30. these are standard sized trees

404
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,000
but these apples

405
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,920
you know some of them are on different

406
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,320
rootstock you can tell this guy over

407
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,800
here

408
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,560
is approaching a much taller height than

409
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,240
the rest of them

410
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,279
but for the most part in this high

411
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,880
density that i have them planted in

412
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,959
you really just want to be careful about

413
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,680
thinning them out not letting them get

414
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,079
too tall

415
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,000
keeping them a bit shorter i really do

416
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,920
believe that

417
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,519
the same principles can be said for

418
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,839
those cherries

419
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,360
and i made the same mistakes on these

420
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,920
apples where

421
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,079
we just didn't prune them hard enough in

422
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,120
the earlier years we really didn't bring

423
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,120
them back

424
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,399
to get the branching that we wanted at a

425
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,480
lower height

426
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,040
and they're a bit lanky because of it

427
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,680
and there's a few reasons for that

428
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,199
a lack of knowledge the location that

429
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,240
they're in but

430
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,639
some of these more lanky uh branches

431
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,680
here

432
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,519
the same thing could be said

433
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,120
in the summer and in the winter times

434
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,320
that we do a lot of pruning now we're

435
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,279
gonna get a lot of growth

436
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,680
next year however if i you know really

437
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:35,440
stay on top of my summer pruning

438
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,959
it's not out of the question where i can

439
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,680
keep these guys

440
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,519
to a very reasonable height very compact

441
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,880
and exactly what we want

442
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:48,480
now here's actually some

443
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:50,079
some younger espalier trees

444
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,320
that we have against the fence these are

445
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:55,440
plums

446
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:58,399
and we did also we did a really good job

447
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,360
this time around getting my plums to the

448
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,639
right

449
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,399
shape getting them bent down here along

450
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,639
the wire

451
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,480
they all have the right thing going on

452
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,760
here you can see we've got

453
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,279
the arms perfectly laid out

454
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,120
this guy here is going to probably

455
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,399
struggle a little bit to get some growth

456
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,000
this year

457
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,480
but for the most part i would say this

458
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,680
is the only only the weakest

459
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,519
arm of the trees these two trees here

460
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,199
we got it to the appropriate height and

461
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,240
then we chopped it off at that height as

462
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,639
soon as that whip

463
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,079
gets to the height that you want it then

464
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,800
starts to send out shoots

465
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,120
and of course we got one shoot on the

466
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,880
right

467
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,480
one shoot on the left we tie them down

468
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,839
to the wire

469
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:45,440
and then you have a very beautiful start

470
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:48,399
to uh an asparage

471
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,279
and i didn't prune these guys yet what's

472
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:53,040
nice about pruning plums

473
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,040
right now is that they just broke bud

474
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:58,079
and i can very clearly see

475
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,600
where the fruits are going to be i also

476
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,959
don't want to have too much

477
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,480
fruit on these trees they're very young

478
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,079
however i'm not going to be at this

479
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,519
location forever

480
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,519
and i probably will be taking these

481
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,440
standard plums with me

482
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,040
so um i'm going to let them fruit

483
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,920
probably as much as i can get out of

484
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,360
them

485
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,040
and then i'm going to take them dig them

486
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,759
up take them with me

487
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,639
and kind of worry about the overall

488
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,839
progression of the tree it's some later

489
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,240
year

490
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,320
but certainly i think these longer

491
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,399
shoots particularly the ones that don't

492
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,959
have a ton of fruit on them

493
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,240
um like this guy here and this guy here

494
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,600
usually the the more

495
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:39,040
lanky taller shoots don't have a ton of

496
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,639
fruit on them that's actually how the

497
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,720
hormones work

498
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,880
is that when we have branches that are

499
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,639
more straight up in the air

500
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,120
they're more inclined to grow and less

501
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:51,040
inclined to actually produce fruit

502
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,279
so a big rule of thumb i think with

503
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:56,079
pruning fruit trees in general is that

504
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,440
take out the really vigorous lanky

505
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,959
shoots

506
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,800
they usually don't have a ton of fruit

507
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,000
on them anyway so what's the point of

508
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,199
having them

509
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,199
unless you don't have enough

510
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:07,919
photosynthesis which

511
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,199
is pretty rare so um i'm going to come

512
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,919
in here believe it or not i'm going to

513
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,240
take out

514
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,039
probably all of these turn them back to

515
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,839
maybe

516
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:18,160
a couple nodes and try to keep all these

517
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:21,280
branches here

518
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,760
at about the same height same thing over

519
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,439
here

520
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,360
is that way when they're all at the same

521
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,720
height they all have a similar

522
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,600
distinct advantage at achieving

523
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,679
dominance

524
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,320
right we can form a better canopy that

525
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,360
way rather than having one chute that's

526
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,240
just

527
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,160
way above the rest suppressing the

528
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:45,280
others

529
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:46,880
preventing a mess in some way

530
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,640
all right let's keep going um i want to

531
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,640
show you guys more of the stone fruits

532
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,480
really quickly i mean if anything i

533
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,799
think

534
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,240
you guys could really use you know a

535
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,240
lesson from this

536
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,720
this video is kind of what not to do you

537
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,799
know some of my trees

538
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,919
knowing this knowing what i know now in

539
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:09,039
the future they're gonna look

540
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:11,200
so much better and so much uh different

541
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,640
but

542
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,559
you know these are great examples i

543
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,960
guess of kind of what not to do and i if

544
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,720
i really want if i had a tree like this

545
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,320
this is a pretty good one here actually

546
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,160
this apricot

547
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,520
it's called tomcot it's really one of my

548
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,640
favorites it's so

549
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,360
good but uh it's not exactly pruned here

550
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,039
at my knee

551
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,120
as you can see this is a bit taller

552
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:34,640
maybe at my

553
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:36,559
my hip or the top of my thigh but it has

554
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,039
really good branching here at a lower

555
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,919
height

556
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:41,840
you can see there's one two three four

557
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,840
we got four scaffolds and actually it's

558
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,799
pretty it's forming a nice

559
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:49,039
vase shape to it um it's got that

560
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:51,440
umbrella look to it

561
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:53,120
now there is some more vigorous slanky

562
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,240
shoots over here we can obviously get

563
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,160
rid of

564
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,000
and especially now that i see look

565
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,200
there's all those fruit buds

566
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:04,080
so wherever the fruit is pretty much can

567
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,240
take all that out

568
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:09,120
um and it's it's kind of interesting how

569
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,799
these apricots are fruiting

570
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,360
is that they're kind of just fruiting on

571
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:16,320
the ends and i really had never

572
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,320
uh known that

573
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,679
so it seems like on the tips of the

574
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,039
branches that apricot is really fruiting

575
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,799
and again that's why you don't want to

576
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,760
get too carried away maybe without

577
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,679
seeing

578
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,200
the fruit it seems like these plums are

579
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,160
fruiting here on

580
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,480
spurs and also on the new growth from

581
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,960
last year

582
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,120
it's important to know what the habit of

583
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,720
fruiting is that these trees may have

584
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,080
right like your peaches your nectarines

585
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,960
they're going to fruit on last year's

586
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,720
growth

587
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,799
the cherries are going to fruit let's

588
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,880
say on two or three year old wood

589
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:53,360
so you really got to be patient and form

590
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,840
a particular

591
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,480
you know situation and some of this

592
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:01,200
really tall lanky stuff

593
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,880
has just got to go you can see how lanky

594
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,200
all this is even with some summer

595
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,960
pruning

596
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,320
it really wasn't enough i really need to

597
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,880
come in here

598
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,840
and get rid of these very very lanky

599
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,400
shoots

600
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,919
bring them back keep them under control

601
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,240
for the future but

602
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,280
at this point i think if there's fruit

603
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,960
on my trees

604
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:25,440
considering i'm moving soon

605
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,440
that just is what it is i'll just try to

606
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,919
get as much out of them as i can

607
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,919
and correct the form later but that's

608
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:34,000
kind of my little lesson here guys

609
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:37,039
on the uh the pruning of these trees you

610
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,039
know we made a cut

611
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,480
the prior winter right here and then

612
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,039
here's all these new shoots that came up

613
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,559
out of that

614
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:47,120
and that's because when we do the winter

615
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:49,200
pruning this is all very vigorous

616
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,400
and it likes to grow and grow and grow

617
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,520
and of course it did

618
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,440
grow and grow and grow and therefore

619
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,799
i really don't even see any fruit on

620
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,520
this tree i'm going to be honest with

621
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,200
you

622
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,159
there's very little fruit because a lot

623
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:05,039
of this growth is so vigorous

624
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:07,280
um they're almost like water shoots and

625
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:10,320
it really didn't serve any purpose

626
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,960
if i would actually had come in here and

627
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,840
let's say

628
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,000
i made my cut here and i did my summer

629
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,320
pruning at about here

630
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,640
all the way across then maybe i would

631
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,919
have actually stopped this tree

632
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,360
from being so vigorous even branching

633
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:28,480
out a bit more and maybe i would

634
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:31,280
actually have some more fruit on it

635
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,440
so i know this this takes some time

636
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:36,000
obviously these are younger trees but

637
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,799
you know um those are some really good

638
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,760
tips guys

639
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,480
i hope that everybody out there is

640
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,159
planting

641
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,240
this is the time as well you're getting

642
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:47,440
everything together

643
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:50,480
and uh everybody's staying happy

644
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:53,039
safe safe and healthy alright so

645
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,480
get out there guys this is the time

646
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,960
we'll see everybody soon alright

647
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,960
take care
