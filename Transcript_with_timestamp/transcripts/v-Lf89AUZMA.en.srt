1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,110
it's the end of summer and as crazy as

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,420
it might seem now is actually the

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:13,620
perfect time to start planning next

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:15,599
year's magical garden hey they're

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,850
saplings welcome back to esoteric

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,520
moments I have been spending so much

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,920
time this year focused on magical

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,109
gardens and gardens in general getting

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,000
the land plan for our farm kind of

10
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:28,920
figure it out and I wanted to share some

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,019
of the resources that I found really

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,440
compelling for this project the first

13
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:37,280
book is cultivating sacred space by

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:40,350
Elizabeth Murray this is mostly a

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,020
personal kind of memoir book of the

16
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,149
author's garden finding her husband

17
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,000
losing her husband and that whole

18
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:50,280
process there are different gardens that

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,870
the author describes and shows which

20
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,500
might give you some ideas for your own

21
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:57,300
garden there are some general like

22
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:01,440
correspondences listed in general it's a

23
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:04,320
nice book but maybe less design or plant

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:08,490
focus the pictures even are like kind of

25
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:10,619
small and not as inspiring as some

26
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,920
garden both solid lots of good stuff in

27
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:13,200
here

28
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,140
but definitely more for someone who's

29
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,610
looking for a book with gardens but kind

30
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,100
of about other things spiritual

31
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,930
gardening by Pegg Streep was really

32
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,960
great it's kind of what I hoped the

33
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:28,020
other one would be like this one has

34
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:29,759
massive pictures giant ones on almost

35
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:32,100
every page and they're beautiful a

36
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,290
really wonderful inspiration book for

37
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,780
the winter month this one talks about

38
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,369
the different ways to approach spiritual

39
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,130
gardening and has about ten or twelve

40
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:43,460
like example gardens that are really

41
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,899
well described you can tell the author

42
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:48,360
enjoys gardening knows what she's

43
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:50,610
talking about and is keen on sharing the

44
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,259
spiritual aspects of gardening with

45
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,810
others one of my favorite example

46
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,549
gardens in here is the Gaia garden which

47
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:59,579
happens to be in Wisconsin but it's a

48
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:02,040
good combination of food and plants and

49
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,899
community and spirits it just works

50
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,119
really well and I definitely took

51
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:08,610
inspiration from that garden on some of

52
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:12,810
our own plans here magical gardens by

53
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,770
Patricia monoghan was a great read and

54
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:17,010
clear

55
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:19,560
written for the pagan druid or witch in

56
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:22,080
mind this book spends a lot of time

57
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,750
talking about spellcraft ritual how to

58
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,360
utilize your gardens for your pagan

59
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,910
practice if you're like I'm not really a

60
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,370
gardener but I want a magical garden

61
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:34,860
this might be a good place to start

62
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:37,350
because it's really coming at this whole

63
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:40,020
idea from a magical perspective there

64
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:42,330
are also some garden designs in here

65
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,160
which have like a diagram and a plant

66
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:46,680
list and then they describe the

67
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,810
intention and use of that garden gives

68
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,910
you some really concrete ideas for your

69
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:53,550
own magical space I have the 15th

70
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,590
anniversary edition and what I really

71
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,900
wish would have happened is to have some

72
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:00,420
pictures of how these garden plans had

73
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:03,540
adapted and grown in real life it would

74
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:05,430
have been beautiful to like see how the

75
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,980
person living and working and practicing

76
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:10,230
in that spiritual space how that had

77
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,910
translated over the years and what had

78
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:14,160
changed but that's the only downside

79
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:17,280
really is that there wasn't that year

80
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:19,680
long or actual photographic evidence of

81
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,560
those gardens garden awakening by Mary

82
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,150
Reynolds was probably like this is

83
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,340
almost number one I couldn't decide

84
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:28,500
really such a great book I found Mary

85
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:31,560
Reynolds on Pinterest of all places and

86
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,360
had no idea about her work with Wilde

87
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,930
Gardens winning the Chelsea Flower Show

88
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,930
all of that was very foreign to me here

89
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:43,530
in the US her book is just packed with

90
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:46,290
land spirits and wildness and real

91
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:48,930
concrete understanding of how to work

92
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:51,570
with a landscape to create sacred space

93
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:54,150
there is hardcore plant lists and

94
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:57,000
gardening ideas and garden diagrams that

95
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,650
are very in-depth but still this feeling

96
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,380
of like you are working with the land

97
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:03,390
this is how you communicate and do that

98
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:05,130
I think it's a great read for anyone who

99
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:07,260
likes to like walk the land and connect

100
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:09,810
with the land or just enjoy garden it's

101
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,910
very fascinating read there's also a bit

102
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:13,620
of permaculture in this book forest

103
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:15,540
gardening describes kind of the

104
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,609
different ways that that might work not

105
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,859
in depth permaculture by any means but

106
00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:22,140
definitely a nice tidbit and you can't

107
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:24,540
beat the garden diagrams in this book

108
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:26,460
she does like an earthworks version and

109
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,330
then this version where you see all the

110
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,599
plant and kind of

111
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:33,030
above typical garden plan and like plant

112
00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:35,280
lists it's really detailed it would be

113
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:38,580
hard I think for the average gardener to

114
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:42,000
recreate this type of plan does give you

115
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:44,250
like go bold go big do what you want for

116
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,129
your magical and spiritual space finally

117
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:49,919
number one creating sanctuary by Jessie

118
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:52,080
bloom this one wins out mostly because I

119
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:55,259
think it's the most approachable for

120
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:58,229
many people it talks about permaculture

121
00:04:55,259 --> 00:05:00,840
and design ethos it talks about how to

122
00:04:58,229 --> 00:05:03,449
utilize all those elements in daily

123
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:05,580
practice as food as medicine it's not

124
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:07,979
just about design it's not just about

125
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:10,259
magic or spirit it's also about like

126
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:12,719
what you do with it afterwards which is

127
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:14,580
perfect and beautiful a friend of mine

128
00:05:12,719 --> 00:05:16,710
had this on their coffee table a book

129
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:19,199
club and I just like fell in love with

130
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:22,289
it on that day when I purchased a copy I

131
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:25,229
sat on my garden bench and devoured it

132
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:27,509
in like a whole evening it was just such

133
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:30,569
a fun read so inspiring and just like

134
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:32,340
good for the soul kind of reading it has

135
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:34,500
enough pictures too that you get a real

136
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,659
understanding of like what the author is

137
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,240
doing in their garden and how you might

138
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:41,550
recreate it in yours but still very

139
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,800
approachable very down-to-earth all
