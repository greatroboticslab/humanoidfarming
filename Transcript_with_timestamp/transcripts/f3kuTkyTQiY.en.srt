1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,279
well I wasn't planning on doing a video

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:06,240
today but yet here we are down at the

3
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:08,800
bottom of the garden of the greenhouse

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,599
and it is a lovely lovely day I don't

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,240
know if you can quite see there but the

6
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:14,639
the automatic windows wide open which

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,720
shows you just how warm it is in here it

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,760
is beautiful I was out playing golf on

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,039
Thursday and it was horrible it was wet

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,320
it was windy it was a bit wild it was

11
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:27,760
awful but today is wonderful so I've got

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,000
two jobs I need to do today first job I

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,720
need to putt on the tomatoes remember

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,120
couple of weeks ago I was a little bit

15
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,840
late getting them started but they're

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,160
coming along they're looking okay

17
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,120
they've been under the grow light I've

18
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,559
had a bit of a dodgy setup sort of going

19
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,920
on inside so they need to go in the

20
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:42,840
proper groer but thing we've got

21
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,200
upstairs in their own little individual

22
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,480
cell trades because they'll come on

23
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,320
Leaps and Bounds from there and I'll

24
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,960
keep potting them up and moving them on

25
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,399
and get them going because it's only

26
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,680
going to be about I don't know 4 to 6

27
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,960
weeks before it's time for putting them

28
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,520
outside in the poly tunel so it's not

29
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,559
long to go for that next job I've got to

30
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,480
do and it's honestly it might seem a bit

31
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:04,320
Bor but it's one of the most satisfying

32
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,560
jobs you can see done you might remember

33
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,560
again a couple of weeks ago we just

34
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,600
started transforming this bottom area of

35
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,880
the garden here tidying it up getting

36
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,280
some new beds in stuff like that but

37
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,400
what I did at the time was I sprayed

38
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,159
down this patio cleaner stuff that's

39
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,159
meant to take effect over time and it

40
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,880
has and I'll show you in a bit will take

41
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,360
effect but it needs jet washing so I'm

42
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,360
going to give it a bit of a jet washing

43
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,079
this afternoon and there's nothing more

44
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,680
satisfying I don't think quite sad

45
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:30,280
saying that but you know when you see

46
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,960
the P you're getting jet washed it's all

47
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,399
dirty then it gets clean and clean and

48
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,200
clean and it looks beautiful at the end

49
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:36,560
of it so we'll get on we've just got a

50
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,720
small section to do it's not going to

51
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,079
take ages but we'll get on with that in

52
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,000
a bit but without further Ado let's have

53
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,439
a look in here in the greenhouse

54
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,799
cauliflowers is looking good we started

55
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:47,680
off a lot of seeds I don't think I

56
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:49,719
filmed this I had a bit of a a seed

57
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,360
sewing frenzy but it's going okay let's

58
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:54,119
just pick this one here this one is some

59
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,360
Canter lettuce and you can see there

60
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:58,039
some good good germination we'll keep

61
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,600
the the little Lids on now I've got the

62
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:01,039
holes open on the top so there's some

63
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,439
egg getting in and out of there but

64
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:05,280
they're coming on nicely we've got some

65
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,360
brussels sprouts here as well two

66
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,759
different varieties looking good come

67
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,120
and gone all right there as well I'll

68
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:15,040
try not to trap them in the lid and I've

69
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,560
got one on that side as well but

70
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,959
everything is looking okay the beetro

71
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,599
over here is looking good the the

72
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,160
cauliflowers are coming along nicely

73
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:24,239
these are the the onions yeah I

74
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,760
mentioned these before the rinberg

75
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,200
onions and they're little they're we

76
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,800
they've not done much they're still

77
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,200
small I mean that they're okay they're

78
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,560
firm they're decent they're not floppy

79
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,040
they're not dying nothing like that

80
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,400
they're just not not grown very much and

81
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,319
I did I did mention in my last video I

82
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,760
wonder if it's maybe it's a something to

83
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,400
do with the compost so I gave them a bit

84
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,200
of a liquid feed earlier in the week so

85
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,159
we'll see we'll see if the pick up we'll

86
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,840
see if they go but I I don't know if it

87
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:51,840
is the compost cuz it's the compost I've

88
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,480
used for everything and the the Red

89
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,640
Barons that I put out are looking all

90
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,319
right here's the the squash that's just

91
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,560
germinated you can see it's absolutely

92
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:02,879
flying and everything else is coming

93
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,959
along go right the the other onions here

94
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,360
which ones are these again the bedf

95
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,519
Champions these were sewn a lot later

96
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,920
but you can see the size of them

97
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,200
compared to the rbur ones but it's the

98
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,560
same compost it's the same watering cuz

99
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,080
I water everything at the same time when

100
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,200
I come down they've had the same feed

101
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,920
and whatnot but who knows but anyway the

102
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,280
tomatoes are getting ped on today

103
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,720
speaking of the tomatoes they're all

104
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,920
back here on the Super 7 I brought them

105
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,959
along on the Super 7 we've had some some

106
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,799
great germination they come along nice a

107
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:34,120
little bit dry so they'll all need a

108
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:36,159
good water and afterwards as well I'm

109
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,840
going to do two different sorts of pot

110
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,200
on um I'll not take it through all of

111
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,920
them there's too many to do all of them

112
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,080
we'll do two different types show you

113
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,280
what I'm doing but we'll get swapped

114
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,480
around here with the other cameras and

115
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,959
stuff and we'll get some filming done

116
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,879
right so we're going with the old dual

117
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:51,480
camera set of again today hopefully it's

118
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:52,599
going to work well it seems to go down

119
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,480
all right when we do this in the

120
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,799
greenhouse and I'm going to S it see I'm

121
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,760
going to S the SM was in two different

122
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:59,400
ways you can see I've already done a

123
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,200
roll here why have I already done a roll

124
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,799
here because I've already filmed this

125
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,599
but I don't think the audio was working

126
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,959
properly so we're filming it again so

127
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:09,000
we've only got one row in the cell tray

128
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,120
so what you need to imagine now is me

129
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,879
filling the cell tray with all this

130
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,439
lovely compost down here now speaking of

131
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,440
the compost this is the melat silver

132
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,880
grow it's the one I use all the time for

133
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,799
all the sort of seedlings and things a

134
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,440
day all the sort of plants in and around

135
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:25,639
the house anything I grow from seed

136
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,880
anything I bring on any little plants I

137
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:29,680
don't use it generally as a Ru of thumb

138
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,320
at the alotment it's a bit expens

139
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,680
expensive you want to top of beds and

140
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,600
stuff like that M coat silver goats are

141
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,440
we bit expensive for doing that sort of

142
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,039
thing so maybe you think about a a

143
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,199
different type of compost for that but

144
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:43,520
we'll sew these on in in two different

145
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,000
ways and we'll we'll do these ones first

146
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,720
so we've got the black strawberry ones

147
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,440
and I say they're looking just a a touch

148
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:54,479
leggy I've not had the the grow light

149
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:57,240
set in the the perfect sort of

150
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:59,240
conditions cuz I've just been a bit just

151
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,680
a bit rushing and and and all over the

152
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,800
place and do and stuff but I'm going to

153
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:07,080
try and get these set quite deep inside

154
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,800
the cell tray and I'm trying to get them

155
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,560
deep set inside the cells for a reason

156
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,520
and if I just pick up this one here in

157
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,280
particular and let me show you this up

158
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,759
here if you can see that on the camera

159
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:21,720
there's lots of little hairs all the way

160
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:24,680
down the stem now what I want to do is

161
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:28,520
try and get as many of those little

162
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:31,440
hairs on the stem as deep as we can in

163
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,919
the cell tray so it to be quite near

164
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,039
this first set of leaves here so the

165
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:36,400
little sort of flat leaves here you can

166
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,319
see the ones that don't have much shape

167
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,720
to them they're the seed leaves and all

168
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:41,800
the little jaggy ones that you can sort

169
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,759
of see above that's the true leaves that

170
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:48,000
are coming on so if we get that stem

171
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:50,639
plant a knife nice and deep in theory

172
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,199
all those little hairs that are on the

173
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:58,560
stem will make beautiful beautiful roots

174
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,560
for it to make nice strong plants and

175
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,759
these ones um doing here are the black

176
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,280
strawberry and for those of you who saw

177
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:08,919
me sewing the tomatoes you will remember

178
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:11,520
that I made a bit of a bit of a mistake

179
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:14,840
with the black strawberry when I sold

180
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:17,360
two lots of Brad's Atomic grape and only

181
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:20,160
zero lots of black strawberry and I had

182
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,599
to go and fix it but once again thank

183
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,759
you to everybody who spotted that or

184
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:27,280
right about now and we be putting on

185
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:29,000
Brad's Atomic gripe thinking they are

186
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,960
black strawberry so thank you for that

187
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,160
so you can see there we've got these in

188
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,759
the Cel Tre now just by sheer chance

189
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,440
sheer look would have it on the Super 7

190
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,160
we've got seven of these little quarter

191
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:43,000
size sea trays with seven varieties of

192
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,919
tomatoes and the cell tray we've got has

193
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,680
seven rows of four so I'm going to take

194
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,080
four of each of these plants for me to

195
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,759
take on for myself but I need to plant

196
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,680
on some others and I'll come to that in

197
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:57,520
just a second there let me pop that down

198
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,800
and we've got these we've got some

199
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,000
yogurt cartons but what I need to do

200
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:06,400
first of all have I got my little My

201
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:10,039
Little Snips here is we just need to put

202
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:13,199
holes in the bottom now the reason I'm

203
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:15,000
doing yogurt cartons instead of my

204
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,240
normal plant pots or cell trays or

205
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,560
whatever is because the rest of these

206
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,840
plants aren't going to be for me and

207
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,800
I've me I've mentioned this just sort of

208
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,680
briefly once or twice before there you

209
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,000
go look you can see the the holes in the

210
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,199
bottom there so the the water can drain

211
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,160
through I've mentioned this briefly

212
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:37,039
before for that I'm part of a group here

213
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:39,759
in lintho called lintho family which is

214
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,720
part of the lintho Community Development

215
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,720
trust and it's all but help it's all

216
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,680
aimed at helping people grow their own

217
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,199
things at home learning how to do it

218
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,000
help them out loads of tips and stuff

219
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:52,400
like that we've got a fabulous Facebook

220
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
group that people can come along and ask

221
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,800
questions and learn how to do stuff but

222
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,080
twice a year we have events and the

223
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,319
first event we've already had which was

224
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:06,960
was it last month Cy seems like ages ago

225
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:09,800
now and that was a seed Swap and the

226
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,000
local allotment Association comes along

227
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,800
and they do some um seed potatoes as

228
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,080
well so they sell seed potatoes and we

229
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,840
do a seed swap both at the same time

230
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,000
fabulous event and we always follow this

231
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,440
up in May so it's around about the

232
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,039
second or third week in May we'll be on

233
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:27,479
L go High Street doing a Seedling

234
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,000
giveaway or or seed or plant giveaway I

235
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:31,159
should say some of them get quite big by

236
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,760
then so all these little extra plants

237
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:35,120
that I'm doing then I'm going to put in

238
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,440
the yogurt pots and I've got my my stack

239
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,599
of yogurt pots here I like to have a

240
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,880
yogurt with my lunch every day so if the

241
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:44,039
stock stocky yogurt pots cuz I'm not

242
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,240
wanting to give away my good plant pots

243
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:47,959
all my my plant pots that I've got over

244
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,240
here my plant labels and stuff in and

245
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:51,440
whatnot I mean I I will put a label in

246
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,480
these so we'll know what they are so I'm

247
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,839
not giving away random plants mystery

248
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,800
plants come and get mystery plants so

249
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,399
we'll not we'll not we'll not do that we

250
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,200
will label them but the yogurt pots are

251
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,160
brilliant because it's recycled it's

252
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,480
reused and hopefully the person who

253
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,680
brings on this this little plant can

254
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,640
stain here for ages then the person who

255
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,440
gets this can use it hopefully use the

256
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:14,920
OT to plant something else in once the

257
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,560
little tomato plants out of it well that

258
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:19,800
is job number one and kind of job number

259
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:22,440
one and a half done let me show you what

260
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:25,079
we've got we have got lots of tiny

261
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,240
little potted up tomato seedlings there

262
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:29,560
they all look a bit sad they always look

263
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,480
a bit sad when you put them up every

264
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,360
looks a bit sad they do need a good

265
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,000
drink they're going to go into a to a

266
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,480
gravel train we'll water them all from

267
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,240
the bottom the compass going to soak up

268
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,320
all that water give them a day to a good

269
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,720
a good watering Under The Lights a bit

270
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:46,200
of warmth and they look absolutely magic

271
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,800
I don't expect them to be in this cell

272
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,200
tray too long let me get nice and close

273
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,480
just so you can see the size of it there

274
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,959
the size of the cells that we're using

275
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,200
you know be lucky if they're in here for

276
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,160
2 weeks before moving them on again into

277
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,000
the next size up but it's the right way

278
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,920
to do it cuz if you give them too much

279
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,760
compost to get too much compost The

280
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,160
Roots don't grow very strong cuz the

281
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,160
roots don't have to go off looking for

282
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,680
nutrition at least when they're small

283
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,880
they've got to find where the nutrition

284
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:13,040
is then move them on move them on those

285
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:15,839
roots just keep on growing at the right

286
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,160
size plus you know behind shedule this

287
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,920
year but you can kind of slow down

288
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,279
growth if you keep them in the small

289
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,880
cells the small pots a little bit longer

290
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:25,959
than you need to you can slow down the

291
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,760
growth a little bit but I need to speed

292
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:30,880
things up at this time of year because

293
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,519
it's it's getting be beautiful outside

294
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,480
and we've got our little ones here for

295
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:35,839
the the seedling giveaway I know I was

296
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,480
just saying there about having too much

297
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,000
compost but these are these are going to

298
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:42,320
be freebies for people but they're all

299
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,120
the little yogurt pots and again sheer

300
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,880
coincidence there's two of each so

301
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:49,360
there's enough two yogurt pots for each

302
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,680
variety of tomato so we've got 14 little

303
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,440
tomato plants I'm going to do other

304
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,079
stuff I've got some Jiffy pellets over

305
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,440
there watch out for that coming first

306
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,200
time trying them trying something

307
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,000
different for the seed seedling giveaway

308
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,519
that we're going to be doing next month

309
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,800
going to grow stuff in the Jiffy pellet

310
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,240
so again I'm not giving away plant pots

311
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,560
using different things and different

312
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,880
ways of doing things anyway next job on

313
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,920
the list and the one I'm looking forward

314
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:14,240
to going to get outside let's go on

315
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,079
let's get some jet washing done so that

316
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,639
took a little bit longer than expected

317
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,920
it get so the horse pipe the big the

318
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:22,000
good horse pipe is blocked or something

319
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,440
it's not working so I've got my backup

320
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,480
horse pipe on the go but let me just

321
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,360
show you here this is the bit we're

322
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,320
going to do you might remember say last

323
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,760
weekend weekend before whenever it was

324
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,440
we sprayed all the cleaner down on it

325
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,880
and it's it's come up pretty good you

326
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,880
can see it's killed off all the Moss and

327
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,600
things that were on here but this is the

328
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,760
pressure washer look we've got the

329
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,079
double powerful nozzle thing on it it's

330
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,320
the first time using it as well I got it

331
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,160
I got it last year we not had a chance

332
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,639
to use it yet but I would love to show

333
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:49,040
you all but it's it's over there oh it's

334
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:50,880
hiding over there cuz the hose pipe

335
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,440
we're using is a bit shorter but what

336
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,320
I'll do is I'll pop a link Down Below in

337
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,320
the description and you can go and have

338
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,639
a look and see what it's like it came

339
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,240
from screw fix um I've had the cart show

340
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:00,680
on before I had a cart show one before

341
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,120
you know the yellow ones that you say

342
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:05,519
with not impressed didn't last very long

343
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,440
did an okay job didn't last very long so

344
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,959
I'm a little bit skeptical about the C

345
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,600
ones so we went for a different one of

346
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,480
screx one like I say I'll pop a link in

347
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,320
the description down below go and have a

348
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,839
look see what it's like but the most

349
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,880
important thing is does it work is it

350
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:22,199
any good well there's only one way to

351
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,199
find out

352
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:30,919
[Music]

353
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:39,279
job done let's have a look see how it

354
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,279
looks and it looks pretty wet it's

355
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:45,639
nowhere near dry but there is loads and

356
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:46,959
loads and loads of mud and dirt and

357
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:49,320
