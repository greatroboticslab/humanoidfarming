  "text": "this is day one of the great challenge so now first job today is to level the field now lee why is leveling the field so important and how do we do this for wet seated rice you're dealing with a with a seedling that is two days old young and very fragile and there's the two most important criteria you've got to meet early are water control and weed control and in some ways they're one in the same so by leveling you can ensure that each each seedling has a consistent amount of water or a consistent lack of water depending on what you're trying to achieve at the time so we really think leveling the field is the very first and most important step probably to get the good crop established particularly if it's wet seeded rice as we want to do in our agronomy challenge this year yes we're targeting a high yield and for a high yield we need a good establishment density we need a good number of plants in the field so we need a good survival of and growing of the the seeds that we we will put out with the drum seeder in two days time and leveling is definitely the foundation upon which a good high yield is built and how does that laser leveling thing work here we have a big tractor we have a attachment back there well what does it actually do right well there's two implement electronic implements talking to each other the first implement is transmitting transmitting a signal over there at the other side of the field it's sending a laser beam and a completely level grade the second device is picking up that beam and ensuring that the the implement the rotavator is traveling along the field at a consistent height so if it's traveling a consistent height it's leaving the soil at a consistent height so it's it's achieving that final final leveling we're looking to looking at yeah lee i don't know what you think but i think you've done a great job this looks pretty level to me i think it's satisfactory now my leveling coach at the other end of the field he assures me that this leveling task is complete the leveling is satisfactory so we are ready to drum seed in two days time to seed the field fantastic see you back in two days thank you you",
