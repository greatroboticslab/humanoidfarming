00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,919
have you ever wondered what makes Amish

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,640
life so unique today I'll take you

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,040
inside their world in a time when

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,480
technology dominates agriculture the

5
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:13,080
Amish Stand Out by embracing Simplicity

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,120
community and Faith their rejection of

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,240
electricity is not merely a stubborn

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,800
choice but a deliberate effort to uphold

9
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:22,080
values like humility and self-reliance

10
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,000
for the Amish farming is about far more

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,199
than efficiency it te is about living in

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,160
harmony with nature instead of modern

13
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:31,199
machinery the Amish depend on hand tools

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,200
animal power and The rhythms of the

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,079
seasons their connection to the land

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,040
runs deep they view it as a partner to

17
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,039
work with not an object to control this

18
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,120
difference in approach enables them to

19
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,840
thrive sustainably while preserving

20
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,600
their Heritage through methods honed

21
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,440
over Generations at first glance the

Amish field spread across Scenic

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,520
Countryside may seem unassuming but

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,039
beneath this modest exterior is a

25
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,800
complex and highly refined system one

26
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,640
that has been perfected over centuries

27
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,600
to work with nature rather than against

28
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,400
I unlike modern Farms which are noisy

29
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,960
with machines and crisscross by

30
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,880
irrigation systems Amish farms offer a

31
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,159
peaceful Stillness the lack of

32
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,680
technology is not a disadvantage but a

33
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,840
carefully considered decision to

34
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,360
maintain a balance with the environment

35
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,680
this philosophy rooted in generations of

36
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,000
experience is passed down along with a

37
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,040
treasure Trove of practical knowledge

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,479
the Amish farming methods have evolved

39
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,079
from centuries of observations Hands-On

40
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:31,040
trials and patience instead of depending

41
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:33,600
on artificial inputs like synthetic

42
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,680
fertilizers or pesticides they Place

43
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,159
their trust in natural processes and the

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,200
land's ability to regenerate itself this

45
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,960
creates a sustainable system resilient

rhythmic sound of hoof beats the creek

50
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:56,759
of wooden harnesses and the low steady

00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,119
voices of farmers guiding their animals

52
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,840
where Modern Farmers rely on automated

53
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,280
systems the Amish Embrace manual labor

54
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,600
and animal power creating a unique

00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:40,039
environmental sustainability by

147
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,520
utilizing Natural Forces like wind and

148
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:45,120
gravity and carefully conserving water

149
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:47,160
resources Amish farmers can cultivate

150
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,800
their field without straining local

151
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:52,319
ecosystems compared to Modern Farms that

152
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:55,440
heavily rely on irrigation and overuse

153
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:58,199

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,880
model of conservation and efficiency

155
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:01,639
these traditional methods show how

156
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,520
working with nature rather than against

157
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:05,680

rotation a time honored method that

169
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,840
improves soil quality and promotes a

170
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:32,800
resilient ecosystem system instead of

171
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,520
planting the same crop in the same spot

172
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,759

176
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,240
nutrient needs and impact the soil in

177
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:48,800
varied ways for example legumes like

178
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,120
beans and pead nitrogen to the soil

179
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,440
enriching it for future crops by

180
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,120
alternating such nutrient boosting crops

181
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,440
with those that demand more from the

182
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,800
soil Amish farmers maintain fertile

183
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,599
Fields year after year this approach

184
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,639
creates a balanced ecosystem where

185
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:06,280
growth and Decay work together to keep

186
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:09,039
the soil healthy in addition to rotating

187
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:11,080
crops the yish use natural fertilizers

188
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,919
like livestock manure and compost to

189
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,840
further enrich their land manure

190
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:16,960
collected from barns is spread across

191
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,599
fields to deliver vital nutrients for

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,840
materials and plant residues adds

194
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
beneficial microorganisms to the soil

195
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,639
improving its structure and fertility

196
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,400
over time these natural methods Ensure

197
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:33,960
that the soil remains a rich and

198
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,960
productive foundation for future crops

199
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,960
one of the most impressive aspects of

200
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,960
Amish farming is their commitment to

201
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,720
avoiding synthetic pesticides and

202
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:44,879
herbicides instead they use companion

203
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,520
planting and biodiversity to manage

204
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:50,080
pests Naturally by planting crops like

205
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,440
maragold next to vegetables they create

206
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,000
natural barriers that repel harmful

207
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,960
insects this approach not only protects

208
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,919
crops but also supports a healthier

209
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,639
ecosystem by attracting beneficial

210
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:03,680
insects and Wildlife the Amish show that

211
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:05,360
farming in harmony with nature can be

212
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,919
just as effective and often more

213
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,199
sustainable than modern chemical

214
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:11,440
dependence Amish farms excel in

215
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,280
promoting healthy ecosystems by avoiding

216
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,240
chemical pesticides and fertilizers this

217
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,440
lack of chemical intervention benefits

218
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,120
not only the soil and plants but also

219
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,720
the well-being of farmers and their

220
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,879
families the resulting food is often

221
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,280
richer in flavor and nutrition free from

222
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:30,960
the residues and additives commonly

223
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:33,000
found in conventional agriculture by

224
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,919
creating an environment where nature can

225
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,680
flourish the Amish cultivate a

226
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:38,440
self-sustaining system that both

227
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,640
preserves the land and produces

228
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:43,000
delicious wholesome crops within the

229

236
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,320
that have adapted to local conditions

237
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,920
over time seed saving isn't simply about

238
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,000
preservation it is a skilled practice

239
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,279
Amish farmers carefully select the

240
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,200

that only the healthiest and most

245
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,160
adaptable seeds are carried forward

246
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,560
enabling crops to thrive despite

247
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,680

00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,639
the design is simple but effective

307
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,480
relying solely on Natural Energy a key

308
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,839
feature of these green houses is the use

309
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,079
of thermal Mass water barrels placed

310
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:46,040
inside absorb heat during the day and

311
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:48,160
slowly release it at night regulating

312
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:50,240
temperatures this method provides a

313
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,279
stable environment for seedlings and

314
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,399
young plants without relying on costly
