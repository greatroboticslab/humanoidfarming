2
00:00:01,939 --> 00:00:06,319
okay so we're here in the high tunnel

3
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:08,809
now we're going to plant some of these

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:11,000
Atlantic dill giant pumpkin seeds and

5
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:13,440
first thing we do is get you a container

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,340
this is a four by four it's good enough

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,960
that'll work

8
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,900
we're just gonna fill it with some

9
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,119
potting soil here nothing special about

10
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,850
it this nice moist right out of the bag

11
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,720
and then what we're gonna do is just

12
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,430
want to poke a little hole on your

13
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,869
finger just like it planting any plant

14
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,390
just put a little hole in it they're not

15
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:33,030
very deep just enough to cover the seed

16
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,829
with soil is all we want to do and these

17
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,110
seeds are nice size seed they're real

18
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:38,790
fat and they're real heavy seeds they

19
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,320
have kind of a rounded end and they also

20
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,780
have a pointy end here the pointy end

21
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,520
goes down kind of important to note

22
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,010
these seeds have been soaked in water

23
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,090
for about four hours prior to this to

24
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,950
give them a good drink of water

25
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,719
just put them in a glass of warm water

26
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,250
about a hundred degree water just let

27
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,230
them sit there for a while and they'll

28
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,430
draw in a bunch of moisture so those

29
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,079
have come out of the glass of water

30
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,059
they're nice and wet and they're gonna

31
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,469
go right down in here in the soil I'm

32
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:04,949
just gonna put them in their pointy end

33
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:07,860
down and just deep enough that the soil

34
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:10,200
covers them that's all they're all we're

35
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,890
gonna do and we don't want to Pat it

36
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,330
down real tight

37
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,369
and then we're gonna give it a little

38
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,930
bit of a drink of water get the soil

39
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:18,270
nice and moist we're not gonna water

40
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,400
that again until the plant emerges

41
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,689
that's all it gets right there with what

42
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,400
it soaked up from being soaked in the

43
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:24,930
water and then a little bit that's

44
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,729
stored in the soil that's all its gonna

45
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,670
get from here it's gonna go into the

46
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:31,470
germination station over here we'll put

47
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,750
it on the heat mat and under the cover

48
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:36,450
and then we'll wait it stays about

49
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:39,240
depends how cold the room is but it it

50
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:42,540
stays around 78 to 80 degrees in there

51
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,670
it's just a 17 watt map it's warm to the

52
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,229
touch but it doesn't not like it's

53
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,110
really warm you're gonna burn anything

54
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:51,869
it might be in the 80 degree range at

55
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:54,270
all and these seeds have been taken

56
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:56,670
about a week they've come to the topsoil

57
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:59,130
they've emerged and they're ready to go

58
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,990
oh as soon as they come through the soil

59
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,899
we want to turn the grill light on so

60
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:06,030
they've got as much light as possible

61
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:08,039
otherwise we get a real long leggy stem

62
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,849
and we can run into all kinds of stem

63
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:12,409
problems like that one

64
00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:14,780
if they don't get enough light as soon

65
00:02:12,409 --> 00:02:16,730
as they emerge so for the first 48 hours

66
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:19,790
after they come to the SOI I like to

67
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:22,340
leave the light on 24 hours a day to get

68
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:23,959
that that third leaf that first true

69
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,549
leaf to where it's starting to emerge so

70
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:29,840
we don't get a real long stem on it

71
00:02:25,549 --> 00:02:32,450
plant like this it emerged about a week

72
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,010
or so ago and what we're gonna do with

73
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:36,170
it is we'll let him stay in here for

74
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:38,000
maybe another week someplace around two

75
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:39,560
weeks as soon as we've got this first

76
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,959
true leaf established and we know where

77
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,359
it's going to go if the weather permits

78
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:45,739
it's time to go outside and let's get

79
00:02:44,359 --> 00:02:48,200
them out there and get them transplanted

80
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:49,159
as soon as possible is less shock to

81
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,689
them when they're a lot smaller like

82
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:52,250
this and they seem to recover a lot

83
00:02:50,689 --> 00:02:55,189
better than trying to transplant the big

84
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:56,719
plants they they grow fast in here but

85
00:02:55,189 --> 00:02:58,069
it's really hard to transplant them when

86
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:59,359
they get big they're better to do it

87
00:02:58,069 --> 00:03:00,820
when they're small and let them take a

88
00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:13,670
hold out in the patch

89
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:17,579
[Music]

90
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:20,099
this here these first two leaves are the

91
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:22,650
emerging leaves and this next one coming

92
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:24,659
up that has the little ruffles on it

93
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,700
this is called its first true leaf and

94
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:29,340
we can tell which way the vine is going

95
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:32,849
to want to grow based on where this

96
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:36,870
first true leaf comes out the the vine

97
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:38,909
will want to go 180 degrees from here so

98
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:41,519
the line is going to want to come that

99
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:43,379
way from here this this leaf will lay

100
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,969
back and the vine will come out in this

101
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:46,950
direction and that will give you a

102
00:03:44,969 --> 00:03:48,959
little bit of an idea when you put it in

103
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:51,239
the ground you can train the vine to go

104
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,760
wherever you want but it makes it a lot

105
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:55,019
easier and a lot less stress on the vine

106
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,819
if you get it pointed in the general

107
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:58,200
direction that you want it to go and

108
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:00,299
it's telling you where it's going to go

109
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,250
by where this first true leaf comes out

110
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:09,100
at
