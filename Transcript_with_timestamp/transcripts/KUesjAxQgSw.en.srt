1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,160
this is the university of kentucky's

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:07,919
horticulture research farm where the

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,559
students planted their cover crop

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,880
mixture about six weeks ago

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,920
this was a day to collect samples and

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,759
data

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,439
each student planted a different

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:22,560
combination of cover crops

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:25,599
victor halmos a uk graduate student

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,960
studying entomology planted a mixture of

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:31,760
sorghum sudan grass oil seed radish and

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,360
hairy vetch one of the first things i

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,800
that i noticed was

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,559
my third cover crop the hairy vetch was

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,320
out competed by the tillage radish

16
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:44,000
probably because of shade shade

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,079
competition uk senior suzanne deeb had a

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,960
similar discovery with her cover crop

19
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,160
combination of hairy vetch bastard and

20
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,280
buckwheat

21
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,600
and it was really interesting to see

22
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,360
how it actually like comes out in real

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,520
life and see the reality of like hey

24
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,039
these plants like compete with each

25
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,120
other for resources and maybe don't

26
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,320
combine them

27
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,960
deeb and halmos and their uk classmates

28
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:12,000
were part of nearly 80 college students

29
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:15,280
from seven u.s universities in a class

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,240
co-taught by uk weed scientist aaron

31
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,360
harimoto and instructors from the other

32
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,920
schools

33
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,840
the hybrid class includes in-person

34
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,840
exercises and virtual discussions over

35
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,479
zoom the students study cover crops in a

36
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,360
variety of agricultural systems to

37
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,280
maximize their benefits and minimize

38
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,600
their negative aspects so there are some

39
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,600
very real challenges to using them that

40
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,920
kind of limit their adoption in addition

41
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,920
to the fact that they cost money a lot

42
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,439
of the benefits they provide accumulate

43
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,600
over longer term

44
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,680
and

45
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,720
so there's often not a real economic

46
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,759
incentive to use them in the short term

47
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:59,280
a lot of farmers do use cover crops and

48
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:01,920
kentucky is in the top 20 of percentage

49
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,079
of acreage in cover crops

50
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,360
nationwide there's been an increase in

51
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,119
cover crops but remains pretty small

52
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,440
one of the exercises the students

53
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:14,239
participated in the class was a way to

54
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,879
measure soil health through microbial

55
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:20,080
activity it's called soil your undies

56
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,680
and so you they have this this activity

57
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,480
where you can go bury

58
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,239
a very specific brand of underwear in

59
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,440
different parts of your fields or fields

60
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,560
that are under different management

61
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,760
practices

62
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,280
and then the

63
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,200
you leave it in there for a set period

64
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,599
of time the more the underwear is

65
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,120
degraded or decomposed the more

66
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,319
biological activity there is in your

67
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,720
soil

68
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,360
once a week the uk students meet with

69
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,400
their counterparts over zoom and are

70
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,879
divided into small groups to discuss

71
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,879
what they have discovered in exercises

72
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,040
that week from the university of

73
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:57,640
kentucky college of agriculture food and

74
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,640
