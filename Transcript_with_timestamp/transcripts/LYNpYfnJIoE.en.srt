1
00:00:02,541 --> 00:00:06,625
Farmers need to provide nutrients

2
00:00:06,625 --> 00:00:10,041
like nitrogen for their crops to grow. 

3
00:00:10,041 --> 00:00:13,083
However, farmers often struggle to determine

4
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:16,166
the right amount of nitrogen for optimal plant growth. 

5
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:21,416
And too much nitrogen may have unwanted side-effects

6
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:24,083
How can they be avoided? 

7
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:26,791
Generally, nitrogen provided to plants

8
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:29,208
falls into two broad categories:

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,333
Organic and inorganic. 

10
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:36,583
Inorganic nitrogen, also called mineral nitrogen, consists of small molecules,

11
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:41,375
whereas organic nitrogen is made up of larger and more complex molecules

12
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:47,083
found in things like compost, plant residues, or the soil itself.

13
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:51,333
When you supply inorganic nitrogen to soil,

14
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:56,791
it is easily available to plants - so the plants can use them fast. 

15
00:00:56,791 --> 00:01:00,000
Organic nitrogen, however, needs time

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,583
to break down into forms that plants can use. 

17
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:08,750
Not all inorganic nitrogen gets used by plants immediately.

18
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,708
Since it is very mobile,

19
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:15,541
inorganic nitrogen that was not taken up can leave the soil

20
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:18,708
...and cause problems.

21
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:20,916
For example, too much nitrogen

22
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:24,416
can cause excessive algae growth, which can harm fish.

23
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:27,083
It can also lead to release of powerful ​greenhouse gases

24
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:30,000
called nitrous oxide or amonia.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,041
Monitoring excessive nitrogen can prevent over-fertilization,

26
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:35,958
help farmers use fertilizers more effectively

27
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:39,750
and reduce pollution while still ensuring high yield.
