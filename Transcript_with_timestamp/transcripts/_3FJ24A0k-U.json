marketing practices she also conducted research on chickpea flax intercropping salt tolerant alfalfa varieties and the new perennial small grain kerns up in july of 2021 claire joined the ndsu department of plant sciences in fargo as an assistant professor of small grain and corn agronomy so welcome all three of our speakers this morning okay thanks so i'm gonna kind of kick things off here and um really before we get into the the meats of the chickpea flax i'm gonna go over a little bit of uh an overview uh just to of what we're saying when we're talking about intercropping and then just some of the basic concepts uh behind it so for instance here we're talking about chickpea flax this here's a picture i took right off the combine so you can see i think this is a combination that actually threshes out really well when they're combined together they've got a few green foxtail in this particular sample but overall other than that really nice clean samples so what we're talking about uh when we say inner cropping meaning we're gonna plants and harvest two crops or more at the same time so we're not talking about making extra passes across the field during the growing season but we are usually talking about separating the harvested grain out after harvest in almost all cases okay so one extra step usually after harvest but hopefully no extra steps during the growing season compared to growing a single crop right and so uh this is generally something that can be used um to as a way to increase space efficiency uh so um i think particularly if somebody has a limited number of acres uh this might be particularly appealing because you can make better use of of each acre and just a few things to note that some a lot of times you might have a lower cost of production simply because there aren't as many options as you have with one prop uh because when you start talking about pest management programs uh oftentimes you don't have that many options and so on a necessity even even if you plan on doing things uh cheaper because of some synergies you might see you might actually be forced into lower cost of production as well and then when we're doing this we do really need to also try to pair our maturities of our crops to make the best use of the reducing number of operations in the field okay so here's a few pictures from the carrington research center of this particular combination of the chickpea flax we don't have the ability to alternate rows on the equipment we have so there's a lot of debates right off the bat on whether it's best to alternate rows or go same rural on everything right and i think there's some advantages disadvantages to either but uh first and foremost uh what we need to determine is what our equipment capabilities are right and so our equipment is not capable of alternating rows so we put everything in the same pearl uh and it's worked pretty well for us uh we have our uh black salon our chickpeas alone and then here you can see we have a pretty nice flat stand and if you look down the rows you'll be able to see all these little chickpea plants growing underneath very healthily the one thing that um i i really noticed in particular in 2020 when we were doing this trial so if you look down the rows looking at trying to find all the chickpeas down here in the plaques uh we also saw all right what's the one big weakness on on flax weed management or at least for us uh so you can use sulfentrazone ahead of plaques which is excellent but the one big weakness of sulfentrazone is pigweeds right and so we almost always have pigweeds in our flax crop all right that's not too bad right here we use sulfentrazone in this combination uh you can see a few uh pigweeds popping up here of where the chickpeas are okay but the thing i really noticed is when we had the chickpeas and the flax growing together we actually saw a very noticeable reduction in the in the size and stature of the pigweeds that we're growing in here as well so uh definitely wanted to point that out as even though we do have maybe reduced options for herbicides when we're doing mixed combinations we actually can see an added benefit of biological weed suppression right all right so a few other notes here so i just want to point out that normally i do these presentations in a standard agronomy meeting people aren't really necessarily looking to do something new and so i really try to pair people's expectations down because i think there's a lot of potential but with inner cropping but there are definitely some things we need to think about before i really encourage people to go down this route so number one this trade-off here i can over-yielding by having two crops growing together uh make up for the cost of separating grain and the cost of potentially two different seed lots okay so that's one of the first things we need to consider very likely we will be needing to desiccate more so than if we had each crop alone that's not always the case but i would say there's an increased chance that we're going to have to either desiccate or swap okay we have less pest management options okay and then some of the ones that are labeled for multiple crops in our systems are usually not quite as effective as the best ones you can use for either crop alone but as i mentioned sometimes the as long as you can keep it clean in the beginning uh usually the late season weed control is better by by the biological weed suppression right uh and then it also takes time to perfect a new system i definitely do not tell people to go in and plant a hundred acres your first year uh this is something where we'd say uh maybe try five or ten acres see what you think see how it works for you right because this is not simplifying anything right by doing this we're trying to get more production but we're making it more complicated and we need to figure some things out it's going to look different from farm to farm right and then also there's other basic management things we need to figure out too such as uh you know do we have to add fertilizer if we have a legume partner in our mix all right so uh there's a lot of things that we're still trying to figure out uh and a lot of things that you need to figure out doing this on a farm as well okay um i think this one might have been outdoors but okay so just to give you an example uh one of the basic concepts i think in in intercropping it's not the only thing right but one of the major things that we probably will all talk about at some point today is this concept of over yielding all right and for those that need to calculate this on the farm this is the basic concept so let's say on a normal year you grow a pop crop and your your yield is 50 bushels an acre all right you have a canola crop and your yield is 2 000 pounds an acre okay now you do an inner crop and just in this example here let's say you plant two thirds of your normal field piece eating rate two-thirds of your normal canola rates and you might get 38 bushels instead of 50 and 1400 pounds instead of 2 000 okay so in this example this is 100 of a normal pea crop 100 of a normal canola crop and down here we've got 76 of a normal pea crop and 70 of a normal canola crop so you add those together and in this example you would have a 46 increase in yield um over either crop alone now that's pretty hot this is i'm just trying to use some easier numbers to work with here we don't normally see almost a 50 percent yield increase but 30 is uh what i would consider an achievable target all right and you don't always get there either but i think that's something to shoot for okay and another way to say this is uh this is what we would call our ler or land equivalency ratio and this example this 50 increase uh we would write that out as like a 1.46 46 more yield than either crop on its own okay all right so uh i just wanted to bring an example of this here as we go so what does this mean so this this is an actual data set that we had so we have um this listed as our canola seeding rate first and then our field piece seating rate second so i didn't list the yields here quite yet but so we have 100 field pea yield 100 canola yield and this is what it looked like when we combined them so when we added canola we got a pretty big reduction in our field pea production okay but the field peas did not affect our canola we saw a maximum of around 25 percent reduction in our canola yields okay so you add those two together and we saw anywhere from a 10 to 23 increase in total yield now now for the downfall of the ler it is not everything right profits is what's going to be the most attractive thing in the system right so what happens when we actually plug in the yield so uh the average canola yield this year was actually 3 400 pounds fantastic canola our field peas we're only like 35 bushels a maker all right so we have our ler combined values here 17 16 23 over yielding you say well those look pretty close but when you actually puts the the gross return on not net return yet when you compute your gross return we actually see a very big discrepancy so um up here on the on the upper right this uh column labeled field p this would be like if you were growing a field pea crop what would happen when you add canola to it all right and so because the canola yield was really good if we are a field pea grower adding canola we're almost always coming out substantially ahead because our field pea was only okay and our canola was fantastic that all right this column will be if you're a canola grower and you wanted to add field pizza that mixture right from that perspective in this case uh you're sometimes better off growing just canola economically all right there are a few times here this particular mixture we came out 100 ahead by adding field piece to our canola because our canola yield was almost identical uh to what our monocrop canola yield was but here this 20 reduction in canola yield resulted in a big swing economically here because the field peas did not make up that difference based on the price of each crop okay so ler is interesting it gives us a good indicator what our system is doing but economically it might tell a little bit different story so i just wanted to bring that up okay so back to chickpea flax uh why why are we considering chickpea flex and um you know you notice the program uh we really have two things we're talking about field peak canola chickpea flax right so why all right for chickpea flax how we have two very different plant types right we have chickpeas and flex and completely different plant families uh so very different architectures very different ways they use nutrients water different ways that they grow different architectures they're using sunlight differently and when you start talking about system efficiencies your cropping system that's a very very big plus in the way that it's going to be able to utilize resources okay doesn't always mean it's going to turn out in your favor just at least theoretically this is a really good thing all right we've seen some increases in weed control i think in some cases we're getting more yield per acre and um we're going to talk quite a little bit about um ask a kite of light coming up because we've seen some uh really nice things from that perspective so we're just kind of pausing mid talk to briefly give an introduction to ask okay to play if you're not you're a chickpea producer you're familiar with it but if chickpea is new to you you're not so we just wanted to make sure everyone was on the same page regarding this pathogen if you're if you've not grown chickpea i think it can be a little bit of a boogeyman you've heard about it it know it's aggressive it's kind of scary um but hopefully by the end of my slides you'll kind of have an idea if you have an integrated disease management plan it's not so bad well it's bad but you need to you can manage it all right so it's a fungal pathogen um you're probably familiar with ascochyte of light on lentils or acidopyths just know that this is a different pathogen it's specific to chickpea so if you're adding chickpea into a pea lentil rotation it's not going to increase your foliar ascochyta problems and lethal repeat it does affect all plant parts so you can see lesions here on the pods the stem and the leaf it forms these kind of really diagnostic bullseye pattern on the on the plant and that bullseye those are little fungal structures and i'll talk a little bit about that later it can develop really quickly but you need kind of wet cool conditions a year like this year where it was really hot and really dry does really reduce the amount of disease that you get um this is an example this is a fungicide trial that i had under irrigation without this is no no fungicides um and i'm inoculating it with chickpea residue that has been overwintered somewhere so i'm doing everything i can to get a lot of disease because that's my job um and and so if you're not controlling it it can be quite quite aggressive and you can end up with complete yield loss but with this pathogen you know enter we want to talk about using inner cropping and just know that's going to be one part of your management strategy if if that's what you want to do so let's talk about where this pathogen comes from how it overwinters and how it spreads within the crop because that's where the concept of intercropping is going to come in so the red circle here that's what's happening in season you've got these lesions on your leaf and we'll talk about how they got there to begin with but all these little dots within that lesion these are called magnetium and they're full of spores called canadian and what's important here is that this is this is a cycle so these these are going to germinate and release spores under wet humid conditions and then rain and wind are going to spread them around so the more rain you have the more spread you get and this can happen over and over and over and over again within the growing season so the more lesions you have the more canadian you have and the more spread you have so it's just important to keep that initial number of lesions low and get ahead of it [Music] all right so so this is what it's going to be doing in season across seasons so you end up with these stem lesions right you're cutting it pretty low um so you're going to be removing some of the pathogen but it's going out the back of the combine too so that's going to be your inoculum source along with the pathogen born on the seed so if you have contaminated seed as that seed germinates it can affect seed germination you're going to end up with some lesions probably earlier in the season than you would have otherwise and again then you start your cycles earlier which you don't want and then if that residue is there that's going to be really the main provider of inoculum so all of our management strategies always have to do with the pathogen biology and that's why i want you to understand how this pathogen works within and across seasons so our management strategies uh i talk about ipm a lot just know that's integrated pest management it just means throwing everything you can at the pathogen so we'll start with our prevention right seed testing seed treatment and crop rotation and then spacing out where you're planting your chickpea fields right if your neighbor had chickpea last year don't plant chickpea right next to your neighbor's chicken that will provide an inoculum source and same thing within your own land uh there is there's documented literature that increased row spacing will prevent the spread of that pathogen in your crop so potentially that's where the inner cropping comes in you're increasing your plant spacing but then you don't have a bunch of bare dirt where you're not getting any yield variety selection i'll talk a little bit about that you need to be on top of the pathogen out there scouting for it this is not like peas or lentils right the fungicides are going to start when you see the pathogen right away you really do have to get ahead of it and we'll talk about the final sites as well so this is a stacked approach and intercropping can definitely be a part of your approach all right so if you're new to chickpea just know that you can get your seed tested if you're running bin run seed please test your seed um 0.3 is your threshold of whether you want to plant that or not so don't don't plan chickpea without testing your seed if you're buying chickpea seed you should know what your ascochyta bite levels are you can send it to the state seed lab in north dakota or you can send it to the regional pulse crops diagnostic lab at montana state um just know it's got there's going to be a little bit of time to turn around seven to ten days and no we can't shorten that because that's how long it takes for the pathogen to grow and then um in terms of seed treatment just make sure you're checking the label or checking our uh field field disease management guide and making sure it says ascochyto blight and also pithium pythium is also an important packaging so just make sure when you're getting your fungicides you know those actives include control of these two pathogens and it should say all right so let's talk about variety of resistance i've color coded these these are two variety trials i've done over the past two years obviously yield has not been optimal in either of those years and this year disease levels were really low but even so we're able to distinguish the very susceptible chickpea varieties from the moderately susceptible chickpea varieties and you definitely want to go with the latter so here we have we're comparing cdc cedar city leader cdc orion sawyer royal and sierra there are some different seed sizes in there so make sure you know what seed seed side class you're in andy crown i don't have on this slide it is in our annual report this year for the williston rec but it kind of fell in with the leaders in the frontiers so this is percent severity of ascochyta blight the lines in blue kind of cluster together and the lines in red cluster together that's just based on statistical analysis you see disease severity is higher in the royal and the sierra and that results in a significant yield loss even in a in a year where we have less disease so making sure you're not growing a variety that is highly susceptible but know that you know in the case of chickpea production in australia they did have their disease resistance which was quite strong in their their chickpea varieties there overcome it took about 10 years but their variety resistance was overcome and that's just because the pathogen wasn't being controlled in other ways as well so that's why i keep harping on stacking your disease management approach because there's cases where we don't have that approach anymore in other countries and i don't want that to be where we end up all right so fungicides there's a lot of old literature out there that talks about using strabile urines for the control of ascochyta blight resistance was detected kind of in the mid 2008-2007 in canada it's been documented here in north dakota so know that you cannot use cervilians for control of ascopido blight and shifty they are not effective the pathogen is resistant so products where you've got that in the tank mixed to just know you're not getting anything from that um so we're using the factory and the frac seven a lot of the products are combo products where they have both of those groups just if you're applying more than one application in the season make sure you're rotating those and then michael bunch and i have been working on tank mixes with chlorothalonil take maxine chlorothalin with proline results in really really excellent disease control right now and the bonus of that chlorothalinoid is that it's a multi-site mode of action and we're helping again control the pathogen overcoming these products so that we can have them available to us for a longer period of time you know so far we don't have resistance to these but it's really important that we take care of these products we're rotating and we're stacking these other approaches like intercropping so we don't get a highly aggressive pathogen that we can't control so first timing is going to vary based on your growing season when do you see that disease occur in the field just keep an eye on it you know if you don't see it up until flowering your earliest application could be at early flowering and then the window is 10 to 14 days usually in my research trials i'll do the end of that window the 14 days and we have a pretty short growing season some years i've combined chickpeas mid-august some years but october other years so it can vary um but you know if you're on a mid-august harvest time frame you know you might end up in a really bad year two to three applications here in the williston area but usually um i do around two on my disease trials i've done up to four but again that the number of applications you're gonna make is dependent on the level of disease in your field what the weather looks like you know if you've got a big thunderstorm coming and you're at the end of your 14 day window spray ahead of it right but if weather's hot and dry maybe you can stretch it out a little bit just keep an eye on it so it's just going to be really weather dependent and again depending on the level of disease in your field which you've hopefully minimized through checking your seed growing a resistant variety good crop rotation and inner cropping all right so mike's going to start us off with some of the data they've collected on the computer yeah thanks all right so um here's some examples of um what we've been able to work with with um that chickpea flax so carrington just a preface it's not a chickpea growing region uh it's never something i would tell somebody to go yeah you should be growing chickpeas out here we do not have an environment for that we do have a chickpea variety trial but sometimes i don't know of five fungicide applications would be enough to optimally manage chickpea alone okay so just throwing that out there so we do test chickpeas but nobody really grows them okay in our region now here we did a trial um over a couple years um and williston did a similar one here with justin jacobs um we're looking at different chickpea and flax seeding rates uh and whether we applied fungicide or no fungicide now when we applied fungicide here uh we were this would be um two times so two fungicide applications uh versus none at all all right so there's some things here uh again different seating rates uh so um here we have the chickpea seating rate on the left and then the flex seating rate on the right and as we go across our our table maybe we'll just start with the ascochyta information the second column in the yellow here so with no fungicide and chickpeas alone uh we had around uh fifty percent incidence in um ascochyta this was measured mid mid season um uh actually two columns so measure twice in the middle of this season okay why don't we go to the green one the green one i think is a little bit more interesting yet so in this case we had 60 incidents uh a little bit later here in early august okay and so now our chickpea alone with two fungicide applications we're able to cut that ascochyta incidence down by about half so about half the amount of masculine in our plots all right now no fungicide but with different rates of plaques mixed in with our chickpeas look at these different incidences of ascochyta and you look at those numbers compared to chickpea alone with fungicide so chickpea flax no fungicide at the bottom chickpea alone at the top with fungicide the numbers are very comparable right very comparable all right now we look at the top fungicide with inner cropping so essentially just what uh audrey was talking about layering so we have two mechanisms of aspect kind of control and we reduce our ascochyta substantially more all right so fungicide in this case fungicide and intercropping provided similar amounts of control you do both we had an even further reduction than either than either control method alone so uh very fantastic news there now uh we haven't been able to replicate quite that same level of efficiency since then so this isn't something you should count on but it's something that may be possible in some cases okay so again uh just to throw those numbers out here a little more simplified if you uh take the i have the yields next to it as well the final yields in both years here so this year we went from 60 down to roughly 30 with these two control methods intercropping and fungicide and then we reduced it even further with both now in 2020 uh we saw again um not quite as much as kakaida with our chickpea alone with no fungicide all right once again we saw a pretty similar amount of uh reduction whether we were intercropping or just using fungicides in our chickpeas okay but the difference is uh when we did both fungicide and intercropping we didn't see that further step down we saw maybe a slight reduction in ascochyta with both but it wasn't nearly as pronounced as the year before right now again um the uh that's not the end of the story here all right this year our flax did really well our chickpeas didn't do so well and so with a very aggressive flax crop and conditions only you know not very great for chickpeas we had huge yield reductions here in our chickpeas so even though we had these amazing drop downs in ascochyta control um this year this might have been financially feasible but most of the time flex prices are more normal this would probably be a bad thing for your system right all right uh 2020 uh we had a much better chickpea yields um and flax seals were quite a bit lower so we still saw a fair amount of reduction in our chickpea yield [Music] not quite as much so depending on the prices again now the one thing we learned is that when we were doing these trials we didn't really didn't have low enough flax rates uh most of the time the flax was just too competitive with the chickpeas and we saw really well i consider a lot of times unacceptable chickpea yield loss because most of the time that's going to be the economic driver right all right here's a little bit more balance here where both the chickpeas did really well and the flax did actually uh quite well as well so it wasn't always one way or the other uh in 2018 we had a year where we had um kind of vote but nonetheless uh because the flex we really weren't testing low enough flax rates in this year either um and we still most likely unacceptable yield loss because if you could market over three three thousand pounds of chickpea when you're going on its own odds are you're gonna be pretty happy with that so uh once again uh very good for asking title blades um but i think we need to be really careful at least in carrington area with the rate of flex that we're using so to summarize what we've been going through here so in carrington without any control measures we might we've been expecting 50 to 60 percent incidence of that circada uh some years is higher than that this is what the medium resistor the one of the less susceptible varieties so we have a little bit of genetic resistance built in there already too so 50 to 60 incidence of infection uh we were able to cut that down by about half to either of these practices or down to about 75 percent reduction by stacking and best case scenario okay all right um and i think this was specific to the 2019. uh our monocrop chickpea had an 80 reduction in yield without our fungicide when we were intercropping our chickpea we were able to gain thirty percent back uh with you know without applying any other fungicides so you know there's a definitely an intrinsic value to having that inner crop growing um there with your chickpeas so the one thing i didn't show here because it's a pretty boring graph but uh we actually saw 100 control of white mold in the one year that we had a big white mold outbreak in our chickpeas we had any amount of flex in the plot we had zero white mold if we had just chickpeas we had substantial white mold okay so it's a pretty boring graph but uh and then of course my biggest takeaway is that um i think in our area 10 pounds an acre of blacks is the most i would consider ever putting in the system okay maybe we need to go even less than that and uh i think turn it over to claire at this point alrighty hello everybody um claire keane and sorry that i'm not there in person um hopefully some of you recognize me from out in my from my time out in williston um been here in fargo the last few months and still adjusting to the new job but very happy to be able to share with you some data from williston okay so i'm going to talk about two trials uh that i conducted in 2018 and 2020 at the williston research extension center dryland farm so these were not done under irrigation and um i think that was a nice transition from mike um in those seating rates of flax because what was i i was interested um you know oh gosh three years ago now um when starting to do this is you know could i identify a flax seeding rate that reduced the ascochyta blight without reducing chickpea yields so that was my goal in both years i used cdc orion chickpea which is a kabuli type and then cdc glass flax and uh the treatments that i used i guess i'll can you see the mouse if i move it on the screen yep you're good okay great so i i had my uh treatments ranging from monocrop chickpea to chickpea with five pounds of flax 10 15 20 40 pounds of flax and then a monocrop flax of 40 pounds per acre is a check um in percents my kid presented um his data in terms of a percent of that full seating rate so five pounds of flax compared to 40 pounds is 12 and a half percent so this is 12 and a half percent of the mono crop 25 37 and a half percent 50 and 100 so just to give you um that continuity there so i did have some of these lower rates included in my trials i also wanted to point out planting configurations and this will this will have implications when we get into the yield but i did use different planters in the two years of these studies so in 2018 we used an old single row planter with 10 inch spacing and on that single row planter there's a different funnel essentially for each row and so i would dump you know packet of flax packet of chickpea packet of flax packet of chickpea um in the inner crop plots or just all chickpea or flax envelopes um for the mono crops so what that ended up looking like was a four row plot of chickpea with monocrop uh as i mentioned flax chickpea flax with the inner crop plot and then mono crop flax all flax and that seeding rate of the monocrop chickpea was about 120 pounds per acre i was targeting that four plants uh per foot of rose so seeding it at about four to five seeds per foot um i didn't uh something that it kind of dawned on me like after i planted the trial this did result in half as many chickpea plants present in the inner crop plots as the monocrop because i didn't double that seeding rate of chickpea in the inner crop so functionally the seeding rate in my 2018 trial was 120 pounds per acre of chickpea in the mono crop but then 60 pounds per acre of chickpea with those different rates of flax in the inner crop and then the mono crop at 40 pounds and so just a picture of that um you can see flax chickpea flax chickpea so that four row plot and alternating rose in 2020 we used a cone cedar and that cone seeder like we used in many of our variety trials is designed to be able to do um you know different varieties of the same crop plot to plot and so it's a six row cedar with eight inch spacing so looking at the mono crop flax that's what normally gets planted out of this planter is um you have your seeding rate and you just put it down the cone cedar and away you go but to do the chickpea we actually put it in the fertilizer box so the chickpea was coming out of the banded fertilizer tubes and so my mono crop chickpea plots were three rows of chickpea at a 15 inch spacing the inner crops that chickpea was still coming out in that 15 inch spacing but then the 8 inch spacing of the flax rose on top of it and then again that mono crop flax was six rows of flax at an eight inch spacing the mono crop chickpea rate was 120 pounds per acre again but because of this different planter configuration i was able to keep the chickpea seeding rate consistent between the mono crop and the inner crops in 2020 and again you know when we get to yield i think there's something interesting there to mention with that so 2020 a picture of those plots um there's an outer row of flax a row of chickpea two rows of flax between the next row of chickpea again two rows of flax chickpea and then an outer row of flax so different configurations between 2018 and 2020. so for effects on ascochytoblite in 2018 um again just remembering that there were half as many chickpea plants in the inner crops as the mono crop um i looked at incidents as the number of chickpea plants out of 10 with ascochyto blight lesions present so just presence or absence from 10 plants randomly selected in the plot and then severity used a 0 to 10 scale oh sorry about that with no lesions being zero and a rating of 10 meaning many lesions present throughout the canopy including on upper leaves and pods and so in 2018 there were significant differences in ascochyta incidents at the july 17 sampling date where mono crop chickpea had higher incidence than intercropping with chickpea and flax but noting that even though it was statistically similar that monocrop chickpea into the vasco kaido was higher than all of the inner crop combinations and on july 31st the severity rating again with severity being on a 0 to 10 scale that mono crop chickpea plot was rated at a rated at 7.3 uh which was significantly different from any of the inner crop rates of 10 15 20 and 40 pounds of flax and then that five pounds of flax being similar to both the mono crop and those higher rates of flax and so there wasn't um you know obviously a statistical difference at every sampling date but i do know that you know even with um severity and incidents of july 17th and 31st again that trend of the monocrop chickpea having the highest rating both in terms of severity and incidents is there and now 2018 um was a pretty wet year for us out at the williston rec um we had approximately 9.2 inches of rain between may and august so certainly one of the better rainfall years we've had in the last last five and then we did spray the whole trial with fungicide twice so on june 25th and july 12th so all of these treatments did have two applications of foliar fungicides now in 2020 so again just reminding you that there's the same density of chickpea plants in the mono crop and the inner crop in this year i also change my scales um with some input from plant pathologists thank you audrey uh number of chickpea plants out of 20 with ascochyta lesions present so again that presence absence um and then the severity of a one nine one to nine scale i learned that that's a more typical scale in uh plant pathology so we went with that so one meaning no lesions and nine again many lesions present throughout the canopy and then also with wilting or dead plants present and so in 2020 we did these ratings july 1 july 9 july 24 and the only time we saw a statistically significant difference was july 24 where on the incidents 15 approximately 15 out of 20 chickpea plants checked um had ascochytal lesions present uh which was different from with 10 pounds of flax roughly 11 and 11 plants with that um 20 pounds of flax um so not a lot of statistical differences in 2020 however again that trend so on july 1st of more plants and the monocrop chickpea plots having ascochyta present then the inner crop plots that that was true at july 1 and july 9 and then severity these severity ratings just were not very high in 2020 which makes sense in light of the the drought that we had so still that trend of the monocrop chickpea having a more um you know more severe nature of that infestation but again relative to 2018 these are pretty low numbers um i'll just go back quick you know so reminder in 2018 looking at a 10 plants by the end of july even with two fungicide applications i was seeing those monocrop uh plots you know 10 out of 10 plants having ascochyta present um but then you go to 2020 and out of 20 plants you know 15 out of 20 in the mono crop and down around you know 11 out of 20 plants in the higher rates of flax center crops so very different years in terms of moisture but i think that that still shows that one in a dry year you can still have ascochyta but then two inner cropping while it may not provide as as high degree as of control is in a wetter year it's still doing something and again just pointing out so in 2020 the growing season rainfall was approximately 4.3 inches so half half of what it was in 2018 and again this whole trial did receive fungicide three times in 2020. um it's something uh mike mentioned in his preface that intercropping might increase the need for desiccation and i do think that's true especially with the p uh canola combination that'll get talked about later but just kind of an interesting side note um in my conversations with lena shaw and some other growers in canada you know they had noticed that they felt that intercropping chickpea and flax generally provided a benefit to chickpea dry down that that chickpea or sorry having the flax with the chickpea just encourage the chickpea to um to shut down you know late summer like you want it to and start drying down rather than staying green and continuing to flower and so i did dry down ratings each year and so in 2018 went out about every 10 days and rated the plots for the percent of chickpea plants with mature color and there were significant differences at each of those dates again this was in a pretty wet year and then in 2020 that dry down happens with the drought certainly much more quickly um but again the the trend of those intercropped uh plots drawing down the chickpea faster uh really held true and i feel like to me and an interesting um observation in 2018 again um a pretty wet growing season you know you start to see the spread really widen you know functionally the difference between zero percent of your chickpea plants with mature color on august 2nd and um hope i keep losing my cursor there we go and five percent um you know doesn't doesn't mean anything right and then the difference between 15 and 30 you know that spread starting to widen but then by the time we get to august 24th um seeing you know pure chickpea and chickpea with five pounds of flax down at this 60 65 mature color um but the chickpea with 20 and 40 pounds up at 80 percent that's a pretty big difference you know that might be close to that tipping point of if you were going to go out and desiccate um to do that and be able to harvest those chickpeas potentially a week or two earlier than you otherwise might have i think is really important um and then in 2020 just with that very dry summer um you know that chickpea was drying down much more quickly august 4th we were already at 30 percent mature color and the mono crop um compared to about 56 with the 40 pounds of flax uh so just that inner cropping does seem to push push that chickpea dry down uh more quickly and again you know maybe at the production scale i'd say we don't we don't have good data on that yet um but if this is a way that a grower could get into that field earlier to harvest those chickpeas prevent it from getting rained on next week or two weeks from now i think that's where there's there's some real potential with this uh for some photos so these are from august 14th of 2018. so monocrop chickpea here on the left um and i'll just point out so there's still quite a few you know dark green healthy leaves doing doing photosynthesis and if you see a dead plant or you know what you might think of this mature color in that mono crop plant i would say in nine out of ten cases those plants aren't mature color because they naturally senesce it's because ascochyta killed them you know a week or more ago and so that's what you're seeing in the monocrop chickpea plants when you see brown with the 10 pounds of flax so those chickpea rose are here and here and then chickpea with 40 pounds of flax on the far right um those chickpea plants just have many fewer lush green leaves they're much more yellow and so that's what i was capturing with those ratings on the earlier slide from 2020 again with a drought year um august 4th so chickpea is definitely drying down more quickly in 2020 than they did in 2018 but again just looking at those mono crop chickpea rose more green present there with five pounds of flax those chickpea rose are starting to get lost in the yellow flax and then at that 20 pound rate of flax i'd say the chickpea leaves are getting pretty hard to pick out from the um flax stems as they're all turning yellow pretty quickly um this is a photo taken at harvest of 2018 so again these are small plots i did not need to desiccate in either 2018 or 2020 to be able to harvest these so after that last set of ratings we waited another five days or so and went out and with the small plot combine it worked there really wasn't much green material it was pretty clean in terms of weeds we did use spartan ahead of planting and that did a nice job in these fields so weeds certainly if you have green weeds out there that could be an issue that needs desiccation and i'd say you know it's certainly too soon to say whether you can get away with desi without desiccation in the system um but there might be years in which that's possible um but again something to to play with at a field scale if you're a grower considering this here's a shot of my inner crop straight out of the combine it to me i mean it did look pretty good certainly we had a lot of pieces of chickpea pods and straw but those separated out very easily with the the clipper cleaners that we have at the wrec so now in terms of yields so in 2018 we i did not see over yielding in any year so just to put that out there um but i do think there were some interesting things happening with um the with both the chickpeas and the flax and these different yields so in 2018 um the monocrop chickpea did yield the most um the most chickpea of all the treatments uh but then certainly the most total poundage of of grain coming out of the field so the different letters on these uh light beige bars indicate statistical differences in the chickpea yield so monocrop chickpea 5 10 and 15 pounds of flax it did step down from the monocrop chickpea we went from about 1700 pounds per acre down to about 1100 pounds um but that was statistically similar to the monocrop but then also the lower yields of chickpea when it was intercropped with 20 and 40 pounds of flax and so down there it was roughly 850 and 620 pounds of chickpea at these higher inner crops and we did see the flax yields stay kind of similar at those lower rates of intercropping but then step up at the higher seeding rates and something again just to remind you about like that planting configuration um i didn't have plant stand counts unfortunately so i don't i don't know the mechanism at play here but i do think it's interesting that even though we had half as many chickpea plants in these inner crops because they're just two rows of chickpea compared to four rows over here we were getting about two thirds of the chickpea yield as the monocrop so we're getting two thirds the yield with half the seeding rate so i you know had i had the uh foresight back in 2018 when i was planning this to put in the other set of plots with the same number of chickpea plants in those two rows um i'm really curious to know what that would have done but but i think that shows maybe there's some potential for over yielding you know at the plant level potentially maybe with that lower density of chickpea there they responded by um getting bigger producing more pods you know but i didn't collect that data so i'm not sure um in 2020 so looking at 2020 um definitely saw the potential for flax to be much more competitive in a dry year than a white year i think that's the take home of 2020. so overall our yields were lower the monocrop chickpea yielded just a little bit over a thousand pounds per acre and then it did step down as the flax seeding rate increased so even five pounds per acre of flax uh did decrease it to about 700 pounds of chickpea um and so so there i think the take home message is if we're in a real dry situation even a very low rate of flax can reduce chickpea yield but then just you know looking at maybe the bright side and certainly a bright side and a year where flax is worth 30 bushel um the flax did really really well i had to you know kind of do a double take when i when i was thinking about it but so our mono crop flax between 2018 and 2020 um 780 pounds in a year with nine inches of rain oh sorry um about 800 800 pounds per acre um in a mono crop flax with nine inches of rain in the growing season uh compared to 780 pounds so very very comparable and excuse me and then that flax again just showing its drought hardiness really um stepping up in yield uh as its seeding rate was increased and i just noted that between the chickpea intercropped with flax at the 40 pound rate between 2018 and 2020 um really just kind of flip-flopped which i thought was interesting so okay and so i'll wrap it up here um so for the optimal seating rate of flax that question you know did we find something that can reduce ascochyto blight but then also maintain chickpea yield i think that 10 to 15 pounds of flax appears to be kind of that sweet spot to balance reducing ascochyta pressure with maintaining chickpea yield however in a dry year that could certainly um reduce the chickpea yield five pounds of flax wasn't enough to consistently reduce ascochyta while 20 pounds did consistently reduce chickpea compared to the monocrop the rate of chickpea dry down if that's something you're interested in did seem to be a little bit more consistent the 15 pound rate of flax and higher but we do need growers to test if this holds true at a production scale and then finally you know again flax is much more competitive with chickpea in a dry year so just something certainly in the western part of the state or eastern montana uh we need to keep in mind if um if that's what the growing season is is like uh so with that um we will um take any questions you have uh myself mike and audrey are all available for your questions well claire i'll kick it off with a ques question on my own if you don't mind so if i'm interpreting this correctly in the 2018 trials the row spacing between chickpea um was all the same you know across your your inter crop and mono crop but in but in 2020 your your row spacing in your monocrop was greater right you have you had an increased row spacing do you think that that could have played a role in the reduction in disease you saw and the less the the reduced difference you saw essentially between that monocrop and the inner crop given that you did have a wide row spacing in your monocrop jv right right so there were 15 inches between chickpea rose and 20 20 where there whereas there was only 10 inches between rows and 2018 but then also i'd say two confounding factors two rows of flax between those two rows of chickpea in 2020 versus only one row of flax between the rows of chickpea in 2018 and then throw on top of it just a much hotter and drier growing season um so i think back to your question yes that wider row spacing um could could be one of the factors why just overall severity incidence severity and incidence ratings were less in 2020 than 2018. um you know but but i guess i don't i don't have a real confidence in whether i would attribute the overall lower ratings to that different planting configuration or just to that much drier uh growing growing season yeah i'm just thinking maybe you would have seen a bigger difference between the treatments in 2020 if you have been on like an eight inch row spacing for the mono crop compared to those chickpea flax chickpea blocks and eight inches true either way you said that's interesting okay so we've got a question looks like in the chat could you talk about any potential benefits or disadvantages to planting and alternating roads versus planting both crops together in the same row i did however you want to take that and i think uh later on atlanta uh shaw has some information that will help with that too but i think claire you had some you had a more of a comparison for this didn't you i had tried um so it ended up being a trial that didn't work out in 2018 i also tried planting some long strips of chickpea and flax in either same rows or alternating rows um actually right next door to those plots that you saw pictures of um to with the goal of tracking ascochyta over the season and seeing if the mecstro versus the alternating rows made a difference and unfortunately we planted that might have been a week to 10 days later i don't really recall but we had let's see 2018. yeah we 2018 my planting conditions were really ideal um that single row planter is not very heavy and doesn't really have good depth control so when we planted the the trial that you saw data from it all went in the ground nicely and germinated nicely and we had good stands but those mixture versus alternating rows that we planted next door going just a week or ten days later the surface had dried out enough that the chickpea just didn't get deep enough and so there was a very poor chickpea stand there and i ended up not not collecting data on it i think sorry for rambling but i think i'll probably defer to elena who has better data on that um just to my limited observation in 2018 um i don't recall um is pronounced differences in ascochyta between say mono crop chickpea and um the inner cropped or sorry monocrop chickpea versus uh chickpea and flax either in the same row or alternating row in those uh strips that i put out but my issue there is there were just very few chickpea plants in in both places so i don't really have a good read on that um my sense is that alternating rose would have an advantage for ascochyta control again knowing that that row spacing and you know if we're uh yeah that row spacing can have an impact on ascochyta incidents in monocrop chickpea than i would expect if you can have essentially an architecture where you're putting lots of barriers between chickpea plants so in the case of my 2020 trial where you have row of chickpea two rows of flax row of chickpeas two rows of flax certainly you know in that same chickpea row there's there's contact between leaves but you're putting barriers there side to side that would help limit physical spread but i'll i'll certainly um deferred elena because i think she's um played with that more more than i have and i will say you know it is a trade-off because um you know again when you're doing these intercrop tickets you're usually picking two crops that have very different seed sizes and so you know of course the big advantage of alternating is that you can set each row to plant the crop exactly where it likes to be planted when you do a mixed rule you have to do something in between in most cases and so you're usually planting your small seeded crop deeper than you normally plant your big seeded crops shallower than your normal implants so the conditions have to be a little more sensitive when you're doing the mixed roll yeah and mike um there's another question in the chat that's a good follow-up to that a question for mike since you seated in the same row did you go at the full chickpea seating depth or shallow up somewhere in between so yeah when we do our chickpea flax um i think we usually target about an inch and a quarter um and then when we do our field peak canola we usually put it right around an inch or maybe just slightly more and you know usually we've found that the smaller seeded crop comes up easier if it's in the mixture because you know it does have that large seeded crop to help it get out of the ground so you do have some synergy there but you know if you're worried about the moisture conditions though um you know and you have different things to plant i would definitely be planting your mixtural inner crop at the right timing for what your soil moisture is i would say that much at least",
