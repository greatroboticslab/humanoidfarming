00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,640
Basic requirements to start your own pig

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,640
farm. That will be the subject of

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,839
today's video. All right guys, it's a

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,120
beautiful moment right here. If you're

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,800
new to this channel, please ensure you

6
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,040
subscribe to this channel. Lots of great

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,559
content on profitable pig farming will

8
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,640
be made available to you. All right,

9
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:19,039
let's start off quickly. What are the

10
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,080
basic requirement for you to start your

11
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:25,680
own pig farm? Now, number one, you need

12
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:28,400
to have a space to keep them. That's

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,760
basic. Uh you you wouldn't keep your

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,480
animals. Of course, people run the

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,840
extensive system, but I would advise you

16
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,120
make use of the intensive because it's

17
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,480
far more better than the the extensive

18
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,079
system because pigs are fatty animals.

19
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,520
So, you don't want your animals running

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,440
all over the place. They would obviously

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,280
lose lots of u energy and fat in the

22
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,200
process. So, you want to ensure you keep

23
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,039
them in an intensive system. So, one of

24
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,640
the basic requirement is for you to have

25
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,199
a space to keep them. And for you to

26
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,719
build that space, one of the uh

27
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,640
important thing you need to have is a

28
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,199
fit trough. Of course, some people drop

29
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,119
their feet on the ground like but I

30
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,200
would not advise you run that all the

31
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,760
time. I think it be good for you to have

32
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,520
like a trough a feeding trough. It could

33
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,560
be as big as this. It could be smaller

34
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,960
than this. Anyh how you decide to do it.

35
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,119
Uh works well as long as you can easily

36
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,280
put their feeds in there conveniently

37
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,200
and they can feed as they want. So

38
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,759
that's one of the basic. Make sure you

39
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,080
have a feeding trough for them. And then

40
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,400
also ensure you make their ground the

41
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,119
the flooring very solid because these

42
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,400
guys are very destructive animals. If

43
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,640
you have not if you have not heard that

44
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,040
before, please quickly know this. These

45
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:42,479
guys can dig almost anything. Once they

46
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,560
get a a an avenue into the the hole,

47
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,320
they keep they keep on digging. So you

48
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,759
want to make sure you spend on quality

49
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:51,200
materials for the flooring. That's one

50
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,360
of the basic requirements you need. Make

51
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,360
sure the flooring is very solid. Don't

52
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,399
use too cheap material. Don't economize

53
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,680
on that. Make a very solid flooring. So

54
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,079
that's one of the other basic

55
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,680
requirement you need to ensure that uh

56
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:07,600
your animals are uh going to be all

57
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,840
right and ensure that your farm will be

58
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,440
good to go. Now you also need uh a way

59
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,040
to give them water. Now there are

60
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,440
different ways to go about that. Of

61
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,840
course we in this pen right here, we're

62
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,920
making use of this innovative way. But

63
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,680
uh that's an alternative also. The

64
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,680
trough you see there, one is actually

65
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,680
meant for food, the other is meant for

66
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,200
water. Now, this is like a deprecated

67
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,920
system. Not too many people are using

68
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,239
this system anymore where uh you are in

69
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,160
short that serves not just as the water

70
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,720
trough, but also as the wallow. I'm

71
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,840
talking about this uh on trough right

72
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,160
here. It also serve as the wall. But not

73
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,319
many people are embibing this system

74
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,560
anymore. The the modern way now is to

75
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:50,000
make use of the shower system. the O

76
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:54,239
system where you make use of O

77
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,519
uh like this make use of O like this to

78
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:00,160
uh to spray the animals. You could get

79
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,239
better one to spray the animals and

80
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,840
after spraying the animals the because

81
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,599
one of the main reason why you have the

82
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,480
wild system is because these guys are

83
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,560
special animals that means they that

84
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,159
means they don't have sweat paws. So

85
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,400
they are special in the way in that

86
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:17,200
sense their body doesn't have sweat

87
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,879
paws. So whenever it's quite hot like a

88
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,480
a situation like this. If you look right

89
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,560
here, you can see what this guy is

90
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,319
doing. You can see how this guy is

91
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,840
sleeping inside the water, that's

92
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,360
because it's trying to find a way to

93
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,120
cool off the body. So because of that

94
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,159
unique character unique characteristics

95
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,920
of pigs, you have to make uh uh an

96
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,000
avenue for them to be able to cool their

97
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,440
body. And uh if you're not going to do

98
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,560
the wall system, as I told you already

99
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,000
is deprecated, you can also uh make use

100
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,319
of the host. That means at a certain

101
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,040
interval during the day, you will just

102
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,799
uh take the O and spray the animals

103
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,480
that's being used. Whichever one works

104
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,720
for you. Some other people make use of

105
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,640
the automated shower system or even the

106
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,760
manual shower system where right on the

107
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,439
top they fix uh the shower right on the

108
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,439
top of their pen. They fix the shower

109
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,720
there and they can switch there will be

110
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,280
a switch where you can switch on the

111
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,920
shower. the shower falls and uh when the

112
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,680
shower is done at a point some people do

113
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,920
some automated one where it comes at a

114
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,720
certain moment in the day maybe in the

115
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,600
afternoon maybe by 12:00 the shower will

116
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,600
on for probably all depends that of

117
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,600
course it's a modern world right now so

118
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,680
lots of great innovations out there now

119
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,440
but uh some people do the manual one

120
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,680
where you just switch the shower on and

121
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,600
it pours uh out for them that's of

122
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,280
course all those things I talk about are

123
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,199
quite expensive so depending on your

124
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,360
budget you can decide on which want to

125
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:38,240
use. So some people actually just make

126
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,880
use of um the water paint. That means

127
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,800
they use like a paint to just like a

128
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,600
water container to just wet them with

129
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,680
bowls. So that's another way people do

130
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,520
it. So people use different means. So

131
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,040
but you know some of these means are

132
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,199
much more uh uh tedious than the other

133
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:59,120
ones. So whichever one works for you,

134
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,880
make sure you uh embibbe that. So one of

135
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,560
the other basic requirement that we

136
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,639
advise you to have on your farm is a

137
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,479
water tank and there's a very big need

138
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,560
for you to have this because these

139
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:13,759
animals are are animals that have uh

140
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,840
good they they use water a lot. Um pigs

141
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,280
are animals that water is a basic

142
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,400
requirement for them. So, you want to

143
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,759
ensure you have a water tank depending

144
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,160
on whatever capacity depending on the

145
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:28,080
farm you have, you go for the capacity

146
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:30,639
that you need, maybe 1,000 or 15 or

147
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,720
2,000 or probably bigger than that. So,

148
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,280
you can get a water tank where you can

149
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,039
easily pump your water into. So, also

150
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,199
that also suggests that you are supposed

151
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,520
to have a pumping machine where you pump

152
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,080
your water into it. For those of us that

153
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,800
don't have uh that are in places where

154
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:50,320
the power supply is not connected there,

155
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,560
we have to make use of the generator the

156
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,440
automate uh the alternative means

157
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,840
generator to obviously channel water

158
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,600
into the tank. Of course, this is a new

159
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,639
age where there is solar available. So,

160
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,319
you can get some solar uh devices that

161
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,240
would also help in pumping depending on

162
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,560
your budget also. But there's a very big

163
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,880
need for a water tank. It be very

164
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,240
tedious for you to make use of a well.

165
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,880
Of course, if your well is very close

166
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,319
by, maybe your well is quite far, it be

167
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,680
very tedious because these animals will

168
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,520
need lots of water. And I would really

169
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:23,199
advise you don't reduce the number of

170
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,919
water you give them because of the

171
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,840
stress that it takes. So what make sure

172
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,759
you find a convenient means that would

173
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,199
ensure that they will get water

174
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:35,520
continually. Also obviously they will be

175
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,319
needing a roof on their head. So please

176
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:41,680
don't make that mistake of leaving your

177
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,520
uh house to the open sky where water can

178
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,759
easily fall in. Even though we say these

179
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,840
guys needs water. We are not it doesn't

180
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,400
mean they need water in that sense where

181
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,919
the rain is always on them. They need a

182
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,080
place where whenever rain is falling

183
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,840
they can be under. They don't need water

184
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,639
all the time. They need water at some

185
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,039
certain time. So please you need to be

186
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,919
informed that you need a roof. And for

187
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:07,039
us right here, this roof was uh this is

188
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:10,720
not the new one. You know, this this uh

189
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,560
iron sheet you see here is uh the used

190
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,560
one. Of course, when you are running a

191
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,560
farm, you want to make use of the

192
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,039
cheapest way to go about things as I

193
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,319
already revealed in a video already. So,

194
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,720
you want to make use of the cheapest way

195
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,560
and you can see uh the way we did this

196
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,120
using the bamboos and everything. So,

197
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,039
make sure you uh do what works for you

198
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,400
and do what works for your budget. But

199
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,000
this is one of the basic grammar. You

200
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,360
need a roof on the head of your

201
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,680
piece. Also, you'll be making use of

202
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,000
buckets obviously to mix your feeds. Uh

203
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,360
the broom, the packa and all those many

204
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,680
things. Those are some of the things you

205
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,759
need to have. The shovel. You need a

206
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,680
shovel. The what you use to mix your

207
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,440
feed. All those things are basic

208
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,759
requirements you should have while

209
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,919
starting your farm. And you want to also

210
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,160
make sure you have uh all the

211
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:59,520
disinfectants that you will make use of

212
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:02,800
to ensure the right bio security on your

213
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:06,560
farm. So these are basic requirements

214
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,560
you know basic meaning the most the

215
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,759
things that you cannot afford but you

216
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,440
must have on your farm. So please uh if

217
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,800
you're planning to start your home pig

218
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,960

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,720
