  "text": "[Music] good afternoon guys today we're going to just be moving cows but but really why we're moving cows I'm just gonna kind of tell you about rotational grazing and what we do here compared to what some farmers do around this area also tell you why we rotational grazing tense of graze and really the purpose of it you know for the longest you've always heard especially big cattlemen say it's impossible to have a cow unless you have acre per cow or two acres per cow and if you're running a big farm and you're you don't have a lot of cross fencing or do some kind of rotational grazing plan that is very that is true however if you learn to manage your your your grass and manage your paddocks the right way a lot of times you can take that that plan and put a lot more cows in a certain area we have about 35 to 36 acres in front of our house and to be honest with you we don't use it you can see all over there it's all pines in front of house so it's a pine thicket if we needed it you know we could cut it I guess but we really don't need it we have five head of cattle and we run through six rotational grazing paddocks now I want to walk you through the packs we have because we're going to be moving them off so you'll see what they've done to one paddock and how we allow it to heal for for about five to six weeks and then we'll they'll be back on it but you see how it'll grow great so let's start off with um kind of where we're gonna move them so as you look right here you see it's just piles of grass all through this little paddock now this paddock is not big enough for three or four or five cows probably not even really big enough for two cows to stay full-time but that's not what we do and when you talk about rotational grazing the whole purpose of rotational grazing is you're gonna take this little paddock and put them in it for a while and then you're gonna move it to this one now you see this one is more splotchy it's got some grass but it's really not where it needs to be well this is the paddock that they came out of before we moved them across to the other side of house so this the third week of it healing now the grass that's here is is a winter grass that's kind of leaving from here but you'll start seeing you can see some of the clover and you see some of the really some Bermuda and Scott some old field behavior growing back up in here but it's not ready to put cows back on so what we do is we will let it heal for about another three weeks and then by then this field will really look like that feel but it's because we're allowing it to heal you know here here we are we have cows who are who are not tearing the grass up but we're letting them eat the grass and then ultimately they're they're fertilizing the grass because they're using the restroom here and have them fresh manure and as it just sits here and the rainfalls ends up making a great paddock so we'll move them into this pack now so we've got this one here that's about three weeks from healing they will stay in that paddock they're the pretty one for about a week to week and a half however long it takes them to eat it now here's the pros and cons to intensive grazing or rotational grazing or whatever you want to call it a lot of that grass there is beautiful grass some of us winter grass some of it spring grass coming back through pros when you put them in a place like that they have to eat with what's there meaning they're not gonna pick and choose when when you don't have cross fencing or you don't have an intensive grazing plans and you let cows just go because hey you have enough acreage for the cow it's just like us when we're at a potluck or a buffet we may all this food may be okay for us to eat ultimately we may pick and choose what we want to eat so what what anticip grazing does is it says not only do you eat the good the good grass and the high-protein grass we're gonna make you eat kind of the junk grass or some of the older grass too if you don't make them eat it they're not gonna eat it so then you have fields growing with a lot more weeds with a lot more mature grasses that are no good for them so what we do is when we put them in this and you'll see on this other side we normally don't split our herd however we have split our herd this last few weeks because we're trying to get one of our cows bred with a bowl so we've got a bowl with a cow and then the other three are in another paddock which I don't even like but in this case we are trying to breed her but but what we're going to do is we'll put them in here and if they they'll eat all this rye grass real quick because it's a winter grass it's beautiful it's got heavy protein but some of this new grass is coming up I see some red clover and and even some junk grass they may not want to eat it however if we leave them here they really kind of have to eat it now does that mean no because ultimate they're gonna get their nutrients and they're gonna have hay and things like that but what it does is it makes all the grass maintain one level and that's what we want so once they finish that they'll move to the next now let me kind of get you over here if you look in this field over here across the little gravel drive now that that grass right there it has a lot of weeds in it it's got some good summer grass growing through it looks like a lot of behavior that's starting to come up you can see the sprigs now I did not plant that in rye grass whatsoever so it's never had winter grass so as these grasses here start dying and they start healing and trying to grow summer grass I've got this paddock over here that has not been touched that's a pretty nice paddock but then all behind it if you look on the other side of these this fence but before you get to the pond we'll have temporary fencing hot wire fencing like poly wire fencing up and then we will do the same plant so we will make another rotation on temporary fencing while all this other ground heals now the reason I say all of that is to say when people tell you you can't have enough you can't have cows on a smaller piece of land you can you just got to learn how many is too many but then you need to learn how to control your grass a wise man once told me that you know when your cattle farm you're actually a grass farmer and that is so true and look I'm no expert I'm trying to learn as I go but ultimately if you get them on a good paddock rotation and you make them eat the the paddock that they're in ultimately it's gonna help them thrive you're not gonna have to do a lot of supplement feeding and you can have a few more cows than you thought you could have had now cons I mean one of the cons right now or was a few weeks ago with rotational grazing it's got to be perfect weather well there's no such thing as perfect weather now when in the south of Mississippi we had about four or five weeks of just just rain I mean just rained and rained and rained and rain and of course I know it's for a purpose but what it did is the paddock they were in they pretty much destroyed just because they were they were slopping around in the mud it hurt the ground because the grass quit growing in those areas that they were on so what what we did was we had to supplement a lot more hay now we have hay and we're happy to give them hay however we were giving them a lot more hay because the grounds tore up so that paddock now had to heal a lot longer so ultimately then it allow it so that feels hurt then we had to move into another field that we kind of had to hold them in for a little bit so they wouldn't tear up any other fields so a con to making sure rotational grazing works is weather when the natural elements happens you've got to be prepared to either supplement with the hay and have the hand accessible or be willing to put them in a paddock and kind of let it get hurt a little bit until that other one kind of grows back so it's a learning curve but like I said I messed up probably one paddock that took me a little bit more time to heal it now I'll show you that paddock because this is fine now but um so elements can hurt it so if you have droughts that grass for those patran are gonna grow as quick so it's important to have maybe like I had like I was showing you back here those paddocks that have not had rye grass on them and they have not been disturbed at all so say for instance I get a drought or I get major weather and it's stead of tearing up my paddocks that has fertile ground and seed that's already in it I may put them in poly wire out in the middle over there just to get them off this land to let it heal so the good thing about digital grazing is it can it can help your land and make it more fertile however if you abuse that it can really hurt your land because if you leave them too long on this paddock instead I haven't grass at two or three inches you have dirt because they've ate it all so make sure you're taking care of rotational grazing and making sure they're eating but don't let them eat it to the ground because it won't grow back nearly as fast so again this is where we're moving them all right summer over there that's why we will move on why these heal one they came out of about two or three weeks ago so you see it's it's it's a lot more dirt a lot the grass is not growing heavy and all the areas yet but it will come back but we've got another three weeks of healing so let's go look at the other side if you remember my aspiring bull rider that I brought the bull over and you saw the video of him going crazy after that we say you know what we may want to figure something out because we have some young casts and also a ball and with our kids out we want to make sure they're safe and make sure the ball don't get away or either the little casket away so we built this we got a guy that was a good friend of ours build this uh this run basically it's like a true cattle run so it's it's it's gonna be a way that we can get from paddock to paddock and still be in a closed system we have one little angus who I tell you he's a handful he will not listen he's stubborn he's actually a very smart you know bull but he won't listen he won't get close to us so this little walk instead of us having to put him in a trailer our chance walking him and all sudden something happening to him or he gets in the woods and we got tried track him down we built this little walkway through so you see look at this how cool it is it's awesome so at least to the other three paddocks and so basically we're gonna go look at those and now here's another thing I have three dairy cows or actually two dairy cow and a deer bull when we talk about grazing and we talked about homesteading a lot of times we most home stores will have dairy animals well if you're doing paddocks remember their animals need a lot more grass and a lot more food a lot more substance than sometimes even meat cows or meat goats and the reason being is because hey they're giving you a lot of milk this is water they're nutrients but luckily you want to do is drain them so you have to watch your cows to make sure they're getting enough nutrients but if you do a good intense cruising plan they won't matter if their dairy won't matter if they're beat but it will they all do fine okay let me show you this this is our dairy field as you see we have a stanchion right there now my daeryuk health that I'm milking Elsa stays in these fields these two paddocks just because it makes it easier for us to have her here now most of the time I'll put the cows with her and then she's the only one that kind of stays back but as you can see over here in the far corner right there we've got her with with our bull because again we were trying to breed her back she had a calf in January so now as we get closer to April she's starting to come back and heat she could have been bred this last time but I don't know I didn't see it so we're putting them back together now let me show these two paddocks this paddock here you see it looks like I've cut grass you see if they've taken it down to Harley nothing still grass not dirt because we don't want dirt showing but you see how they have maintained it now so that means they're ready to move so now this one this field right here will have about a five and a half to six and a half week healing process on that land now I've got rye that they pretty much ate which is a winter grass and fall grass my spring grass is all starting to really come back up in this field so now it will have six weeks of growth and healing that's awesome so again intense crazing we want to make sure they're eating everything now let's talk about this paddock you see I don't know if you tell by the video there's some grass that's getting a little thicker that's growing better here I'll show you some let's look you see you see these little I'm sorry it's windy so excuse the noise and also the movement home but you see it's starting to grow right here in the middle this is the dairy field we only bring her in to eat and then we bring the bull in with her when I do milker but ultimately they were here about two weeks ago too so they were over there three weeks ago over here two weeks ago so you see this one's a little bit behind that one over there so again this one's still got about four weeks for it so they're going they jump back and forth and it is you got to make sure you you remember where they were and make sure you have a good plan because ultimately you don't want to skip a field and all sudden you you heard another field and abused it because they've been there too long or you heard another field because of the rain look right here see that dirt that is that's that's the passage between this gate yeah I told you the bad rain of the that came for about five weeks this was the field they heard now as you see it's healing it's healing all next to the barn but right here under me it needs some help you see some sprinkling grass starting to grow but they've heard it now there's nothing we can do it was rain so that's one they actually have not been in here and won't be in here really for another four weeks we'll see how it goes I may even bring a disc in here disc it up lightly and put a little extra seat in here just to make sure it's gonna thrive we try not to have any kind of fertilizers unless they're they're natural and organic we do have an organic fertilizer we can't throw out we just choose not to again because our dairy cows eating this grass and turn around we're milking nurse I'd rather not do that if we don't have to but but you see where they're at the grass is down so we're going to go ahead and take them out of this field and we'll take them across to the other side now as I said I true I really don't like splitting our herd however since I'm milking her and also I'm trying to breed her with our bull we've allowed them to stay away from the Angus and the other two jerseys or other Jersey excuse me the other Jersey is bred she is a beautiful little Jersey she's my low-lying Jersey and hopefully the one will start milking by the year in when she casts but she's a beautiful first-time heifer and and she's on the other side with the anguses but I'm going to show you their fields because they're being very choosy they're not eating on the grass they're supposed to be eating so guess what I'm gonna leave them there probably for another at least 3 to 4 days to make them eat the grass that they may not want to eat and the whole purpose of that is just to make sure they're taken care of because it guess what if you leave it what's gonna happen is either I'm gonna have to bush hog the junk down or either it's gonna have hey buddy hey buddy he always wants to rub it here but if you don't let them eat it you're going to mature grass well guess what they want fresh good immature grass to eat they don't want this big thick kudzu style weeds and heavy grass so I'm gonna make them eat it because if they don't that means they're gonna be more weeds over there that means I'm gonna have to get in there with some kind of disc or bush hog and there's no purpose because there's a good grass for them to eat so let's go look at it right quick all right now we're at the other paddock it's a get to where we're at eight they meet up across our roads that's where the two cows are for the paddock they're in right now the paddock they were in which is the dairy barn side and then basically on the other side of the house right here is where that that little crossover is so we'll go over there and take all the cows from these fields over that crossover and get them to the other fields but let me show you this field now do you see how they've taken some grass down but not all of it it's kind of patchy now I'm gonna make them stay here for a little bit longer but ultimately they need to they need to eat this grass and that way when this heals back up this field look great so this again once I hey girl hey girl so again once this field and once we move them completely out of here once these come over to the other side probably the next three or four days with the ball and with them the milking cow this this field baseball except for another five to six weeks so it will heal back up with no problem now you see the taller grasses some of the winter grasses left and there are some weeds in there too but the shorter grass is where they've already ate but we're already starting to see some spring grass Pro back through so that's another thing about the cons of this time of year of paddocks here in the mid season going from spring going to spring from winner are either coming out of summer going into all kind of go into winter when you're planting your ride you got to make sure they're still on some good summer grass or either they have some hay again coming out of winter rise gonna start dying especially if we have some hot days and so that spring grass may not be coming up because we may still have some frosty nights so you got to make sure that you're leaving some grass that's untouched start out making sure you have a good bit of supplement hay and then that way you're taking care of them while you're going through these seasons as well so as you see we've got the little anguses the and of course the Jersey Ally this is the one that we know is bred she is probably three two or three months bred and she's looking she's a just a beautiful beautiful church she's a low-lying Jersey then we have the two anguses then we have of course that EO is a registered miniature New Jersey and then of course Elsa is a full-size Jersey alright I hope you've learned a little bit again the pros and cons to rotational grazing we love it it allows us to have cows if we put all these fields together we'd have enough probably for the cows but ultimately you would not be able to control and they would pick and choose what they wanted to eat so then we'd be wasting a whole lot of grass and really it would kind of hurt the ground cuz ultimately they'd be all over it when you put them in a place even if you use poly wire fencing poly tape fencing wire hot wire fencing are either true barbed wire it's good to make them stay in one spot eat it down and then move it over don't let them up use the ground but let them eat it and then move them over because ultimately it's gonna help your head will stay fertile and keep it going hope this videos been good thank you happy homesteading y'all you",
