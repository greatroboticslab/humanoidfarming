00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:34,360
[Music]

2
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:37,760
we are F we're located in North Indiana

3
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:41,120
about 5 hours from here an hour and half

4
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,399
Chicago um we've lived there for about

5
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,680
almost five years now so that's where

6
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:45,680
we're

7
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:56,239
at and as said our topic is

8
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:58,920
improving SE production you can see some

9
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:02,559
pictures of our family we do have two

10
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,439
young children S three that help us out

11
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,320
and also add some

12
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:09,880
challenges and you can just see some

13
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:12,320
pictures of our property there well we

14
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:15,479
we grow about a quarter acre of garlic

15
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,280
seed right now and we we are looking to

16
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:22,200
double triple that um I work fulltime

17
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:24,680
off the farm and J kind of runs the farm

18
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,119
basically and so uh we just want to

19
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,880
share a little bit of our experience and

20
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:31,560
then talk really about the specifics of

21
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,560
our production system

22
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,720
yeah no

23
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:44,240
that's so I grew up working at King

24
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,759
green houses starting at age 12 working

25
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,560
there through college so that was the

26
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:51,119
beginning of my farming experience that

27
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,880
was all conventional but everything from

28
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,600
you know transplanting to retail in that

29
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,240
business um I grew up in Maine and ended

30
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,399
up in the Midwest and so I grew up a

31
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,360
city k

32
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,920
and now uh went on to manage a couple

33
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,800
Farms um just small scale vegetable

34
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,720
production Apprentice on caretaker farm

35
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,239
you may have heard of that in

36
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,920
Massachusetts I believe it's the second

37
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:18,319
oldest organic farm about 150 200 member

38
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:21,640
PSA went on to Iowa to start a small

39
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:24,239
farm to Port Julie um see if we were

40
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:27,640
right for each other while

41
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,440
farming and um then B and I together

42
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:34,120
went on to Victory acres and Upland

43
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:38,120
Indiana down down by m and took a small

44
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:41,120
farm from about 20 csas members to about

45
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:43,080
12550 we had two houses chick so we've

46
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,080
kind of done it all in a lot of

47
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,560
different ways and now we're at our

48
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,720
current location living a small farm

49
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,599
dream and garlic is hopefully a key part

50
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,760
of

51
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:58,560
that so another part of our farm is a

52
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,800
winter produce program we just started

53
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:05,720
that this past season we buil the hoop

54
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:08,080
house last summer did um just a 7 we CSA

55
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:10,720
through the hoop house pick up at the

56
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,040
farm Dan to delivery by his office about

57
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,400
half hour away and that was really

58
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,239
successful we ended up with a reading

59
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,440
list by hand of the season and also

60
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,519
requests for more vegetables all the

61
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,440
time people saying you know my kids only

62
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:25,920
eat your lettuce Your Spinach so that's

63
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,799
great and we're planning on doing

64
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,760
another trial um we just started ping

65
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,760
and we're hoping

66
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:41,000
so in terms of our specific garlic cart

67
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,360
production um we were looking for a cart

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,200
um with organic hardnet garlic we have

69
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,000
to plant by hand because if you go non

70
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,400
caret garlic it has to be oriented a

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,280
certain way otherwise the neck gets bent

72
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,040
and people don't want to buy that so um

73
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,400
there's yet to be a machine that can do

74
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,720
that efficiently um and so we were

75
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,519
looking to scale up for tion that could

76
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,640
do that for us um and also ease some of

77
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,519
the labor fatigue that goes into

78
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:12,560
planting molting those sorts of things

79
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:15,360
um also in terms of looking towards

80
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,560
sustainability trying to find a A system

81
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,079
that we didn't have to till as much we

82
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,759
as vegetable farmers are are guilty of

83
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,759
probably over tilling so we're trying to

84
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:27,000
move away from that especially in our

85
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,759
really sandy soils low organic matter uh

86
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,280
we need to really um work on that so

87
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,440
that was kind of one of our goals we

88
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,280
were kind of hoping the cart would help

89
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,840
us multra straw and Aid in harvesting as

90
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:41,360
well um one of the products we have so

91
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:44,400
far is a review of carts available so

92
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:47,240
this is a 34 page document that's

93
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,320
available on the s website that kind of

94
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,080
um part of our grant was working with

95
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,960
Purdue University so their a engineering

96
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,280
department and a couple students that

97
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,280
came up to the farm kind of figured out

98
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,240
what we needed and it was their job to

99
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,360
see what was out there

100
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,039
and see if um if they could come up with

101
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:08,280
a better system um something that wasn't

102
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:10,160
commercially available so I'm not I can

103
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,960
weld but I'm not a great welder so this

104
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,560
was a great opportunity to partner and

105
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,199
maybe come up with something today so

106
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,600
that document is available so if you're

107
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:20,960
thinking about ways to increase your um

108
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,240
comfort level whether you have

109
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,400
strawberries or any sort of crop it's a

110
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,400
you really useful

111
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:31,080
document so just to give you an idea of

112
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,880
what prodction system actually looks

113
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:36,440
like as we think about what kind of kind

114
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:41,000
machine do we want to help us on our so

115
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:42,919
you can see this a picture field that's

116
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,280
in October but we're going to start

117
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:52,280
looking at midly so we SC pasture and we

118
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:54,720
spread on field and then first part

119
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:57,240
that's when we do the cover so we

120
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:01,520
brought a broadcast for the cover you

121
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:04,520
can see we oats spring radish and we

122
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:08,240
like disc that that's the beginning of

123
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:10,120
August then month later in

124
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:15,800
October

125
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:19,720
trop strips creat beds and then St BS

126
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,720
Fin and add

127
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:25,680
am and then

128
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,759
October garlic and this is specifically

129
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,680
what we're looking at the cart for this

130
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,440
is where we are doing everything by hand

131
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,759
and placing each bold to the ground

132
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,960
after we've done that you know you're

133
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,240
hovering it all back up and mulching it

134
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:41,319
and you can see you from the position

135
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,180
there that it gets to be a little bit

136
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:45,360
uncomfortable um then we have the 9 mons

137
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,280
[Music]

138
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:52,000
where

139
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:55,280
and early to mid July you also dri

140
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,960
irrigation for the water of the garlic

141
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:01,560
um and then July we Harvest and cure so

142
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,160
that's the Bas production system we're

143
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,840
looking

144
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:09,000
at we'll take questions at the end just

145
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,000
because we do have a short amount of

146
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,919
time so here some more pictures of us

147
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:21,800
planting so we have these little buckets

148
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:25,919
around our waist

149
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:28,080
to where we need to go and then um

150
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,280
here's another picture just again trying

151
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,000
to adjust your back so that

152
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,879
you you have least amount tension at the

153
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,120
end of the day so that's how we

154
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:39,960
currently do our

155
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,120
system a lot of hands and knees work

156
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:44,440
which you know over quarter acre that

157
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,120
doesn't sound like a lot but try doing

158
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,680
that for four days straight really kind

159
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,400
of adds

160
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:54,319
up wear and tear on the

161
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:56,479
body so part of the grant was to kind of

162
00:07:54,319 --> 00:08:00,720
look at okay where do we really spend a

163
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:02,639
lot of our time um and where can we

164
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,319
maximize the use of equipment if we're

165
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,080
going to spend money on it how are we

166
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:09,159
going to use that efficiently so one of

167
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,120
the things we did is looked at our

168
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:13,400
system and timed it out okay where are

169
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,720
we spending our time and if you add it

170
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,560
all up planting harvesting and molting

171
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:22,360
is where we are spending 60% of our time

172
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:24,000
and so um and then we also kind of

173
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,080
looked at okay what's the most

174
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,759
physically hard um actually harvesting

175
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,639
and hanging it we spend a lot of time

176
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:32,560
there but that's actually somewhat not

177
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,800
leisurely but it's it's more upright

178
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,719
work and and it's can kind of be done in

179
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,399
different stages so we kind of looked at

180
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:42,000
planting as kind of the big one that we

181
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:44,519
were trying to trying to

182
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
address so how do we eliminate back

183
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:48,680
bending awkward positions um how do we

184
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,360
eliminate unnecessary tillage so this

185
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:53,080
cart's going to be have have to be able

186
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,440
to drive through this pretty um heavy

187
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,279
cover crop and we'll show you some

188
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,120
pictures here and then of course related

189
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:02,200
to that in our Sandy soils you know we

190
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,880
have about about 18 hot soil it's all

191
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:07,079
yellow so conserving that moisture is

192
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,720
really important to us and then what's a

193
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:12,000
scale appropriate machine for us I'm

194
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,360
just going to walk through real quick

195
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,959
kind of what the student at Purdue found

196
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:20,600
available options here's a cart you

197
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:22,040
found um and looking further details

198
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,079
this cart didn't end up working that

199
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:27,000
well the hand crank broke and couldn't

200
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:29,040
really move along but maybe it has some

201
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,279
merits uh this is something that's

202
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:35,839
current exists in the US about

203
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:37,360
$3,500 um but we didn't know you know

204
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,399
we're not doing strawberries we're doing

205
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,800
Carli could it drive through that type

206
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:45,680
of heavy biomass we weren't sure uh this

207
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,760
is another cart that's quite a bit more

208
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,839
expensive um you'd have to import it

209
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,440
into the US to find it as far as we

210
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:56,000
could tell and then here's kind of the

211
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:58,360
cream of the crop the most ideal cart um

212
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,600
kind like a small tank on Wheels but

213
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,600
again it's it's pretty expensive so if

214
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,839
you had a lot of Acres it might might

215
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:08,200
work um so here's some of the unique

216
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:12,440
features yeah that these unique features

217
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:14,040
of how we do our so we pl we have a tall

218
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:17,120
living cover crop that's really

219
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:19,800
important on our farm to build the soil

220
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,519
add those nutrients create

221
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:25,399
iteration garlic not strawberries as you

222
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:28,000
saw some of the carts the right height

223
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:30,800
for the that you're doing uh we need

224
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,160
something that's small medium scale

225
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,560
appropriate we like said we're only

226
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:38,360
quarter acre we like to you know grow

227
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:41,040
that but this is not a full time thing

228
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:44,639
at this point and then also also

229
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,040
something that multitask planting eating

230
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:48,560
harvesting

231
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:51,000
muling um and then finally we want

232
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,600
something that can be built on far we a

233
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,120
welding shop like just across the street

234
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,959
from us um you know you import something

235
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:00,519
and there's mechanical problems this

236
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:04,880
can't always be fixed right commun so

237
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:04,880
that us

238
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:12,079
and yeah and as with most Grant projects

239
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,519
you go into these ideal thinking ideal

240
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,639
goals um and how it ends up is often

241
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:19,399
very different that that's okay that's

242
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:21,040
part of why um s does these types of

243
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:24,120
funding projects you don't have to

244
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:27,600
necessar accomplish gos all here's a

245
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:30,519
picture of the tall cover CR um these

246
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,120
are our two boys here and some years

247
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:34,639
that cover poop can be four feet

248
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,839
depending on you know how the fall goes

249
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:38,959
um and and it's it really provides

250
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:41,480
probably 80% of our fertility for our

251
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,079
Gar so this is really important that we

252
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,800
keep this our

253
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:47,480
Sy here's uh what it looks like I've

254
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,800
mowed the strip where our bed is going

255
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,720
to be we do two rows of garlic per bed

256
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:55,120
our soils are that PO we can't do it

257
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:57,839
that any more intensively um and then we

258
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:01,079
um Roa till strip Roa till and so you

259
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:03,600
can see this thick mat right here um of

260
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:05,880
cover crop that is going to have to be

261
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,320
able to be driven over by some sort of

262
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:10,680
machine if we're

263
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,560
plant so here it is a pulse up with our

264
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:15,720
drip tape this is after planting um and

265
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:18,920
here's Julie doing some planting you can

266
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:22,079
see that we have really a lot of uh

267
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:25,000
cover crop for garlic area

268
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:27,279
plant you do that again for

269
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,040
our and we're actually moving towards a

270
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:33,120
system where we don't Roa till at all

271
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:35,240
but just deep rip a a row um or a shank

272
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,800
on our tractor um so that we don't get

273
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:40,839
so at all and so that's kind of we

274
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,839
trying to think through how we

275
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:48,199
plant so here's uh just our farm all 100

276
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:50,120
with the shank um RI through you kind of

277
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:52,560
see that there we do have some video on

278
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:54,160
our YouTube channel that shows it

279
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,040
specifically we won't take time to play

280
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,920
that today but it is

281
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:03,880
good so this is what uh the looks like

282
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:05,560
around mid April um May June that's when

283
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:12,639
we start getting

284
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:12,639
thecate which we har and sell or to

285
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:19,880
friends and then um in July we're

286
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,480
looking for about a third of the plant

287
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:25,480
round back and then we know it's time to

288
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,480
harvest

289
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:31,800
yeah uh so the garlic part here's the

290
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:34,399
actual cart un constructed it's got a

291
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:37,240
canopy here where a tar can be put and

292
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:40,920
then it's a lay down design um and we

293
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:42,320
have you know a place where we can

294
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,040
here's actually a better picture some

295
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:48,079
some of the students actually driving it

296
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:50,399
around um and we went through about four

297
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:54,279
engineering students and two

298
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:56,480
professors so turnover was really high

299
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:58,560
um not because the carlet cart is that

300
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,320
difficult but that's just the nature of

301
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,759
working with with um you know University

302
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:06,199
students so that's something we learned

303
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:09,800
uh I was hoping to be up to about 3/4

304
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:12,079
acre garlic production by this time but

305
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,600
the cart never really got done um which

306
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,240
actually turned out to be the best thing

307
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:20,800
because um maybe family structured time

308
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,800
wi we wer really ready to go

309
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:29,360
so yeah you had to get an extension

310
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:32,759
which Sarah was gracious to understand

311
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,759
um and at this point uh you know the

312
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:38,160
part they're having some trouble with

313
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:39,759
the design um in terms of how the wheels

314
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,040
actually swivel when it's going down the

315
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:43,639
road so we're almost there but now it's

316
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:46,560
got a new student new group of students

317
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:49,519
work so it is what it

318
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:52,160
is uh some lessons learn keep it simple

319
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:55,759
I think we tried to put too many things

320
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:58,040
into one cart um maybe a couple versions

321
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:59,880
down the road we could have done that

322
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,600
but I think uh maybe should have

323
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,600
acknowledged that up

324
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:12,959
front students really wanted to

325
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:15,199
motor think you can do

326
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:17,440
it yeah I know

327
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,759
Engineers we found that the review of

328
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,759
the current options was really valuable

329
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:23,480
that was part of something available to

330
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:25,560
you

331
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:30,079
to

332
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:32,199
that so that was a great part of this

333
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,279
we enough time I mean if you think a

334
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:35,680
Project's going to take two years leave

335
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:39,800
two and a half or

336
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:41,680
three you know this not an Ideal World

337
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,880
don't try to do too much we kind of said

338
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,680
that um and it's about the process we've

339
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,319
really kind of refined our garlic

340
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,000
growing process and really thinking

341
00:15:47,319 --> 00:15:51,319
about mechanizing why we want to do that

342
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,959
valuable

343
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:56,279
for and then just the concept of working

344
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:59,800
with students is great um but there are

345
00:15:56,279 --> 00:16:01,639
some limits to that

346
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:04,720
so it

347
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:07,199
goes all right uh any questions we got a

348
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,199
couple minutes for questions so anything

349
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,199
else

350
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:20,839
question yeah so we have a website where

351
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:23,959
we sell Harden X seed garlic um and then

352
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:26,440
we also do eating Garlic um and so we do

353
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:28,440
eating Garlic for about 50 cents a bulb

354
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:32,319
and then our uh seed goes for about

355
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:34,720
anywhere from to a pound since we're not

356
00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:36,639
certified organic we can't charge quite

357
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,040
that higher price but that's certainly

358
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,440
where

359
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:46,440
certified

360
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,440
and customers us you're not charging

361
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:52,240
enough it cost us about 30 cents of

362
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,800
linear row put to produce the garlic so

363
00:16:52,240 --> 00:17:00,839
we were 50 cents a ball that's pretty

364
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:00,839
good INE but we we should do it more

365
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,120
questions yeah well fortunately one of

366
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,240
the great things with working with

367
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:14,319
Purdue is that they had the students

368
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,839
each have a budget so that like the

369
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:19,039
motor um some of the materials they

370
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:21,480
didn't have to pay for so we did like a

371
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,640
5050 C share on that so that worked I

372
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:27,120
mean that that worked out great so we're

373
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:31,760
about three grand into the project

374
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,760
yeah let's say wants to make

375
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:42,679
that right and that's where the students

376
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:46,160
have their final report they'll have

377
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:49,840
their materials list still

378
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,840
in yeah excellent

379
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:58,080
question well depending where the

380
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,360
students end up with this I'm thinking

381
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,799
we might just take them the motor off

382
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,480
and pull it with our

383
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,480
pH that might be the

384
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:09,960
simplest no they they thought about that

385
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:11,760
but I think the students weren't didn't

386
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,559
know enough or weren't didn't have the

387
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:19,559
staff to do that and I don't but yeah I

388
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:19,559
think that's that that's a be

389
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:32,880
aable yep those those are good points

390
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,159
yeah yeah and in that 34 page document

391
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,120
there's kind of

392
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:39,280
a an assessment of of do we use electric

393
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,400
why I

394
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,640
not the one

395
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:46,640
were

396
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,640
seen

397
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,320
okay

398
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,320
yeah

399
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,720
cover um

400
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,120
I want my cover pup to Winter kill

401
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,360
because we're not

402
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:10,320
gonna we want it to grow as long as

403
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,720
possible and then we Mt sometimes we

404
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,200
melt in the fall sometimes we melt in

405
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,840
the spring and so I don't I can't come

406
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:19,440
in there with an herbicide to burn it

407
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:25,360
down and I've planted so I can't till

408
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:25,360
it's oats radish and uh Canadian field

409
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:35,039
yeah that we we know we burned through

410
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,039
that really quick

411
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,039
um any other

412
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:56,520
questions yeah

413
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:05,600
yeah so we the re part of the reason we

414
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:09,520
do two rows um to a bed and then our

415
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:12,280
beds are 36 inches on Center is because

416
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:16,799
of our soil fertility our soils are so

417
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:19,000
poor basically Sands um and the way our

418
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:21,320
cultivating tractor set up that was kind

419
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,320
of the

420
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:31,520
easiest the cart was then designed for

421
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:34,559
that um get fourt wide so rle one B

422
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,440
at you consider a cover prop you could

423
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,400
use a

424
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,280
roll

425
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:44,240
spr the question is H have we considered

426
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:49,120
using a a roller crier as a cover crop

427
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:52,400
um yes the problem is Roller crimping um

428
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,760
like tyly winter peas

429
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,840
um it needs to be

430
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:59,120
flowering um to actually kill it at

431
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,159
crimping

432
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:05,600
um and likewise the oats would have to

433
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:09,039
be at drain fill so yeah some something

434
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:12,320
we could consider um Tim

435
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:14,640
didn't yeah it it might if it winter

436
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,320
killed but again ripping that narrow

437
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:22,000
shank through we may not even

438
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:25,000
need we're we're actually TR to not

439
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
touch

440
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,760
yeahp good question that are we growing

441
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:32,120
more than one type of garlic yes we have

442
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:36,240
about

443
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:41,760
seven varieties right now we sell four

444
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:43,720
we s Ukraine music um German career and

445
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,360
then we have three or four others that

446
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:53,600
we're working on building for are they

447
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:56,559
all generally ones that in early

448
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:59,039
July yeah our some of our um we do like

449
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:02,520
a porcelain lome

450
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:05,120
and uh Asiatic those are kind of three

451
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:07,240
categories our asiatics tend

452
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:12,039
to be

453
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:12,039
ready whichs The

454
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:21,640
Works stra yes a wheat straw um we have

455
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:25,480
quite a bit of pasture that a guy cuss

456
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:25,480
for us and so we stre

457
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,200
need to it well we mulch it thick enough

458
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:36,600
so we don't

459
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:39,600
have that's that's our goal but yeah if

460
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,600
we do need the weed we are

461
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:52,880
in yeah I I've um done a little bit of

462
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:56,480
experiment we do apply a little bit of

463
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:58,559
nitrogen blood meal because of our sandy

464
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:02,120
soil so I'm starting to try to cut that

465
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:03,480
back a little bit more um and you know

466
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,880
we're looking at our soil test we've

467
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:08,279
only been in the spot for four years so

468
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,279
we haven't

469
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,440
seen am

470
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:37,080
okay so the question is what benefit

471
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,320
will a c give us in terms of

472
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:44,880
increase um for right now we don't hire

473
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:49,159
anyone ver and I um and so the the cart

474
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,400
will enable us just in my thinking

475
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:52,200
looking at the numbers to double

476
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:57,080
production and still do

477
00:23:52,200 --> 00:24:00,400
that also you know few years ago had

478
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:01,880
give back problems to the keep work and

479
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:06,039
you know those are fixed now but we

480
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:09,039
don't want that again so that's time

481
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:11,520
just exactly yeah and our goal is

482
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,679
hopefully someday bearm full time just

483
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,640
we're taking it

484
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:16,919
slow we're going to do things that are

485
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,919
best for

486
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:29,440
ourf well um the question was is the

487
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:32,320
cart used for um I don't think it will

488
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:35,520
be but right now when we Harvest we're

489
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:38,720
able to pull the plants um our soil is

490
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:41,399
so light it's one advantage of um and we

491
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:45,720
pick it right into a wagon pull by a

492
00:24:41,399 --> 00:24:45,720
truck so it's that's much more

493
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:03,480
efficient the question was what is your

494
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:05,640
current bu on a quarter acre um so we do

495
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:08,279
uh

496
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:11,679
so garlic

497
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:17,000
plant but we we plant a BAL every six

498
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:20,679
inches so our rows are about 250 ft long

499
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:25,039
and so we have let's just say we had 10

500
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:29,320
rows so that's

501
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:29,320
50 that's 2500

502
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:32,320
5,000

503
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:40,799
Vols and about probably six 40 to 50% of

504
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:44,039
that is actual marketable seed garlic in

505
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:46,880
terms of size grade and then the rest

506
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:48,880
are that's typically what we found that

507
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:52,600
varies by

508
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,600
variety but that's

509
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:02,120
a questions

510
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,120
haven't

511
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,159
seen years ago when

512
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:25,200
had F yes we do foler feed um hous

513
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:27,200
particularly because inanity soil

514
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:31,840
housing one of the first things to Le

515
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:35,320
out um and so we I do a little fish

516
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:38,640
fertilizer I spray

517
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:39,760
every during the month of end of April

518
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:44,200
through

519
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,200
May we found that that makes a

520
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:55,399
difference we business cards if anyone

521
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,399
wants for contact information

522
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:03,799
website and a Facebook page and you know

523

00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:09,159
willing to learn and grow from other

525
00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:09,159
people trying to grow

526
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:18,240
garlic in

527
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:20,880
October uh we do pre-sales we let our

528
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,960
you know our customers know in June and

529
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,640
then they pre-order and it goes really

530
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,919
fast so that's why we will be uper

531
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:30,159
