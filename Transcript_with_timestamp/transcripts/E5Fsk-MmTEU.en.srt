1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:05,580
well hello there everyone coming to you

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:11,400
from home today

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:13,590
this is April 16th 2020 web presentation

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,230
for the Eastern Ohio grazing council

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:18,810
we're gonna talk to you today a little

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,150
bit about grazing terminology and

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,160
definitions and I gotta admit when I

8
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,619
started thinking about doing this topic

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,750
it was because I just come back from the

10
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:30,390
western Pennsylvania grazing conference

11
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:33,180
and they had talked about some things

12
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,850
there that I wasn't quite sure what the

13
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:38,940
definition was and so I figured how

14
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,980
better than to look up definitions or

15
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,829
try to figure out what those things were

16
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:47,460
and to also put them in presentation

17
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:49,110
form for all of you and then as I did

18
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,510
the presentation I thought boy you know

19
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,600
maybe we're going a little too basic but

20
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:57,239
I'll tell you as I did the research and

21
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,719
kind of look through some other

22
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:04,619
terminology I really found out that I

23
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:07,430
learned a lot myself had some some

24
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:10,049
grazing epiphanies along the way and

25
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:12,630
really enjoyed putting this one together

26
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:15,180
I will say that that I put a really big

27
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,130
breeze and take two together and I ran

28
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,799
through it once and it was gonna be

29
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:22,770
almost an hour long so I've cut it way

30
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:25,860
down and we'll probably have to pick up

31
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:27,990
some other grazing terminology somewhere

32
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:33,990
on down the road but we'll go ahead and

33
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:38,189
get started ok first I wanted to talk

34
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:41,009
about the management definitions or the

35
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:44,280
management descriptions of grazing but

36
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:46,890
first let me say that there's no real

37
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,350
written down definition of a lot of the

38
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:53,119
terms we're going to discuss here and so

39
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:58,290
you're getting the Clint vini version of

40
00:01:53,119 --> 00:02:02,939
each of these terms or words that we use

41
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:05,070
and I may not be exactly right but it's

42
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:07,979
the best that I can find and the best

43
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:10,319
that I can put together certainly we can

44
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:12,480
do some more research and some more

45
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,650
thinking and talking about what each one

46
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,840
of these terms mean

47
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,269
to us as we go through this presentation

48
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,790
but first one on the list their

49
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:25,530
management intensive grazing will always

50
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:27,930
be shown as capital M small I capital G

51
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:30,359
and and that's because when Jim garish

52
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:32,310
coined the phrase management intensive

53
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:34,560
grazing he wanted all the focus for

54
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:38,519
intensity to be on management and not on

55
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:41,129
grazing we want our management to be

56
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:42,569
intensive and not the grazing it's

57
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:44,519
really easy to have intensive grazing

58
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:46,079
you put too many animals into small

59
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:48,510
space and leave them for too long a time

60
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:50,670
and that's intensive grazing or what we

61
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:54,180
would call over grazing but we want our

62
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:56,010
management to be intensive it's the the

63
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:59,370
management that we make intensive

64
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:02,129
grazing so management tents and grazing

65
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:04,859
is all about the forage and letting it

66
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:08,909
get to the correct height before we

67
00:03:04,859 --> 00:03:11,879
graze it removing the animals when they

68
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:15,090
get to the residue we're shooting for so

69
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:18,120
bluegrass 2 which is 3 inches which your

70
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:20,340
grass fescue 4 inches residue and

71
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,340
removing the animals moving them on to

72
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:27,470
another paddock they're being rotation

73
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:30,239
involved they're rotating to a new panic

74
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:32,579
typically the stays in a paddock would

75
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,159
be less than three days because we don't

76
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:37,739
want the animals to to regrade plants

77
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:40,590
that are starting to regrow after your

78
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:44,069
grazing event we don't return to a

79
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:47,419
paddock until the height is where we our

80
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:51,150
target is for entering a paddock and

81
00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:53,489
we'll skip a paddock if we need to if

82
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:55,889
the Ford isn't grown enough to be able

83
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:57,690
to put the livestock in then management

84
00:03:55,889 --> 00:04:00,269
intensive grazing takes in stockpiling

85
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:03,019
and winter feeding and and really as it

86
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:06,389
scores focus was on reduction of cost

87
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:09,419
for grazing and for farming in general

88
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:12,449
and also increased production per acre

89
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:15,359
as management ends in grazing we do see

90
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:18,419
sometimes that our individual production

91
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:20,130
or per cow or purse tier has gone down a

92
00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:25,770
little bit but our overall production

93
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:27,600
per acre has has actually gone up so mr.

94
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:28,950
garrison wrote a great book

95
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,930
that same name management intensive

96
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:32,610
grazing if you're interested it's out

97
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:36,750
there and it goes through all those

98
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:40,800
things while we're on that same thought

99
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:44,730
I hope that these terms here we'll be

100
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,680
putting into a future presentation I'm

101
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:49,110
probably gonna call it stepping up our

102
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,820
grazing game and we're gonna go a little

103
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:52,620
more in depth into some of these so I'm

104
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:55,140
trying to hold myself back and not put

105
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:58,200
everything into each one of these the

106
00:04:55,140 --> 00:05:00,120
next one they're mob grazing this is

107
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:02,460
something that I've said that I've been

108
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,650
doing for years and as I did the

109
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,840
research for this presentation I kind of

110
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:08,760
realized it maybe maybe I'm doing it

111
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:12,270
wrong or maybe maybe it's not what I

112
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:15,150
exactly want to be do it every time but

113
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:19,050
mob grazing typically uses high stocking

114
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:21,360
densities per acre so a stocking density

115
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:24,270
of a hundred thousand pounds per acre

116
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,970
plus for those of you that don't know

117
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:29,850
how we calculate that stocking density

118
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:32,070
is is how many pounds of animal is on

119
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:35,040
that acre so if we want to get a hundred

120
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:37,620
thousand pounds per acre of stocking

121
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,600
density and we've got 10,000 pounds of

122
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:42,600
cattle and our herd we need to split

123
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,940
that acre up ten times to be able to get

124
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,640
a hundred thousand pounds per acre of

125
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,320
stock density so we won we've got to

126
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,990
have enough forage out there to graze

127
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:55,530
and keep those animals on for for a day

128
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:57,690
and at least split up ten times but also

129
00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:01,950
we've got to split that acre up ten

130
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:05,190
times to get that stocking density mob

131
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:07,950
grazing incorporates longer rest periods

132
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:10,650
and things really the at the core of mob

133
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:13,350
grazing it's it's thinking about putting

134
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:14,070
all of our livestock in one big group or

135
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:16,560
mob

136
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:18,720
so our growing steers are finished

137
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,670
steers our calves our cows are stalkers

138
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,740
if we've got other grazing livestock

139
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:26,040
putting them all out there in one big

140
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:29,430
group tall grass grazing kind of follows

141
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:31,710
along with that we would be grazing

142
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:36,150
stuff that's kind of over mature maybe

143
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:38,520
has gone to seed at Brown in the hope of

144
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:41,070
tall grass grazing is when we go those

145
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:43,080
ultra high stocking densities that

146
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:44,850
livestock are trampling the Fords that's

147
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,310
over mature returning it back to the

148
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:51,090
soil and they're grazing the vegetative

149
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:53,490
parts of the sward that we have out

150
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:55,770
there the real issue with tall grass

151
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:58,980
grazing is we're allowing the forage to

152
00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:01,260
get over mature and as we think about

153
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:04,500
grazing we think about it being a solar

154
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:07,320
panel out there and collecting sunlight

155
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,570
and if we've let that Ford to get over

156
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,520
mature then it's snow we're collecting

157
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:13,380
the sunlight that it could be hearing

158
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,030
Easter Ohio we only get seven eight

159
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:17,910
months of growing season we don't want

160
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:19,620
to let that solar panel get dirty or

161
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:21,870
shaded I guess is the way to think about

162
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:24,360
it we want it to stay green and growing

163
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:26,250
and vegetative that may have been the

164
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,680
biggest Epiphany I had while I was doing

165
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:31,410
the research for this presentation is

166
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,120
that at times I'm letting things get too

167
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:35,070
tall that was the way I knew how to do

168
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,670
mob grazing was let it get too tall with

169
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:40,980
a lot of forage out there per acre and

170
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:42,960
in doing so I'm hurting myself in the

171
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:46,260
production in because I'm not keeping it

172
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:50,580
vegetative and keep it growing adaptive

173
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:52,440
grazing what else started in did because

174
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:55,350
I wanted to really know what adaptive

175
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:57,210
grazing was over the western

176
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:59,010
Pennsylvania grazing conference Alan

177
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,210
Williams talked a lot about adaptive

178
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:03,060
grazing and it really didn't know the

179
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:04,410
definition so to me as I did some

180
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,000
research and there are some really

181
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:08,040
awesome YouTube videos there's a whole

182
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,600
series out there on adaptive grazing

183
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:14,490
that Alan Lance did so it's core it's

184
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,830
kind of rolling management and some

185
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:18,600
grazing mob grazing ultra high stocking

186
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:21,240
density grazing kind of rolling those

187
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:23,340
all in together and and it's just what

188
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,290
it says it's adaptive so at times were

189
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:28,230
at low stocking densities depending on

190
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:30,570
our goals at times we're at high

191
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:32,070
stocking densities depending on you know

192
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:36,140
we may have a problem we'd we're trying

193
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:39,270
to mob up and graze hard or or trample

194
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:41,099
we may have tall grass that we need to

195
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:42,719
be able to put them at a high stocking

196
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:45,360
density to get them to actually eat

197
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,340
consume and trample that forage but

198
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,070
adaptive grazing is adapting our grazing

199
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:52,500
management to our current situations the

200
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:54,240
seasons how the grass is growing and

201
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,130
what our herd needs and

202
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,899
and it may have role in a little bit of

203
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:02,310
the holistic management we'll talk about

204
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:04,560
in just minute rotational grazing this

205
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:06,240
is one that I think is kind of a slang

206
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,870
term for management intensive grazing

207
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,940
but to me rotational grazing is

208
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:13,680
somewhere that we've got a set number of

209
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,779
paddocks and we rotate through them and

210
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,870
a set number at Daiso really we're

211
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:20,399
rotating by the calendar I've set up a

212
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:22,279
lot of these systems designed a lot of

213
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,570
these systems the farmer usually goes

214
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:27,270
something like well I can only move them

215
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:29,310
once a week so we set up a system with

216
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:31,640
five to seven pastures they move them

217
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:35,160
once a week there's really not any

218
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:36,959
thought put into the forage it's all put

219
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,730
into the calendar that to me is a

220
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,010
rotational grazing system where we're

221
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:44,339
just rotating based on the calendar and

222
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:45,630
in continuous if sets not grazing we

223
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:48,360
talk about continuous we're talking

224
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:51,060
about an area where the animals are just

225
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:53,550
out there loose there's no real rotation

226
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:56,160
to it they may be their season-long they

227
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:58,709
may be their month-long really any time

228
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,770
we leave animals in a paddock more than

229
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:03,990
let's say 10 days we're at that sort of

230
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:06,600
continuous grazing level because our

231
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:09,450
utilization rates have fallen to a point

232
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,370
that they're the same as if we would

233
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:13,110
have left them there all season al-bait

234
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:14,910
if there's a rotation of any kind it's

235
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:18,930
better than continuous and being there

236
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:20,149
all season but anytime we've been in a

237
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:23,190
paddock probably more than ten days

238
00:10:20,149 --> 00:10:25,950
we're getting to that continuous grazing

239
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:28,709
kind of situation then regenerative

240
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:32,579
agriculture that's kind of the new term

241
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:34,709
out there if I had to pick a kind of a

242
00:10:32,579 --> 00:10:36,660
face of regenerative agriculture it's a

243
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:39,270
guy by the name of Gabriel in North

244
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:41,430
Dakota but the regenerative agriculture

245
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:43,800
folks really take soil health into

246
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:45,899
account a lot of them are cropland

247
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:51,029
producers that are integrating livestock

248
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:52,410
into their cropping rotations as as Gabe

249
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:54,060
Brown talks about it he's got

250
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:55,800
regenerative agriculture right there on

251
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,839
his ranch side as you go into his place

252
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,130
in North Dakota and one of the things he

253
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,770
said in one of the presentations I

254
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:03,870
listened to was you know we wanted to

255
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:05,490
talk about being sustainable and I

256
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,000
didn't want to be sustainable I wanted

257
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:09,819
to be regenerative I want

258
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,189
our ranch to get better than what it was

259
00:11:09,819 --> 00:11:15,490
so that's sort of the thought for

260
00:11:12,189 --> 00:11:17,860
regenerative agriculture is they want to

261
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:19,990
regenerate and it's also partially

262
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,519
realizing that our soils are degraded

263
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:24,370
they're degraded from the time we

264
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:27,399
arrived here and we wanted to put them

265
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:30,040
back to as good or better a state than

266
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:33,279
they were when we arrived and then

267
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:36,279
holistic management created by a man

268
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:39,879
named Allen savory in Africa but also

269
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:42,790
has some some interest in southwest

270
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:44,470
desert areas of this country but

271
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:46,389
holistic management is a whole

272
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,540
management system and it can be for

273
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:50,740
wildlife it can be for grazing animals

274
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,480
incorporate some of the high stocking

275
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:55,120
density stuff that's where some of the

276
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,370
mob grazing stuff comes from adaptive

277
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,189
grazing certainly includes some of the

278
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:02,290
holistic management stuff but it was

279
00:12:00,189 --> 00:12:05,889
really created for some of the brittle

280
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:07,480
climates and in managing those brittle

281
00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:10,930
climates and getting them to produce

282
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,430
forage again so they're there again

283
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,350
there's a really good book Allen wrote

284
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:16,300
Allan savory wrote about holistic

285
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:18,699
management it's a very very hard read

286
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,529
but it's a very good read on what

287
00:12:18,699 --> 00:12:23,649
holistic management is and it's kind of

288
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:28,779
managing all the parts of your grazing

289
00:12:23,649 --> 00:12:30,009
operation or of your field or farm next

290
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:33,639
we're going to talk a minute about

291
00:12:30,009 --> 00:12:36,839
pastures and the different terminology

292
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:40,389
we use for pastures so a paddock for

293
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:42,699
those under many different definitions I

294
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:46,750
think as we talk about grazing but to me

295
00:12:42,699 --> 00:12:50,589
a paddock is the interior really fenced

296
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:54,459
areas in our large or a pasture area so

297
00:12:50,589 --> 00:12:56,769
at home we have 14 paddocks then we can

298
00:12:54,459 --> 00:12:59,259
infinitely break those paddocks up into

299
00:12:56,769 --> 00:13:01,559
smaller areas that we should probably

300
00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:05,829
call sales I usually call them breaks

301
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:09,009
but a paddock to me is a internally

302
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:10,990
fenced area inside our larger pasture

303
00:13:09,009 --> 00:13:14,500
area so from that you can take a cell

304
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:16,630
cell being for me it's one day's grazing

305
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:19,260
or twelve hours worth of grazing I guess

306
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:22,800
it's it's your grazing durations

307
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:24,150
a time or length so if some of us is

308
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,500
selling a paddock would be the same

309
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:27,710
thing for some of its it's different

310
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:30,120
like I said I used the term brake

311
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:32,700
especially in a paddock where I've split

312
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,530
it up maybe three different times and

313
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:38,250
I've allowed them to walk back to water

314
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:41,460
for those that 24 hour or however many

315
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:43,590
hours that time is usually it's less

316
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:45,720
than three days I may give them breaks

317
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:47,610
within a paddock and allow them to walk

318
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,210
back to water as long as it's less than

319
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:52,800
three days from their strip grazing

320
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:56,220
strip grazing something we use in the

321
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:59,160
fall when we do stockpile grass

322
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:01,410
stockpile grazing strip grazing

323
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,540
typically is given animals a small strip

324
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:06,540
and then allowing them to walk back to

325
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:08,520
water and this may be for a month in the

326
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:10,140
winter time that we keep giving them

327
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,400
more strips and allowing to walk back to

328
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:15,540
water because we're really not concerned

329
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:16,980
with how much forage they're gonna be

330
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,930
picking at what they've already walked

331
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:22,770
over because we're not in the growing

332
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:25,740
season bale grazing sort of like strip

333
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:29,490
grazing with bales we have the bail set

334
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:32,100
stocked out there at 25 foot centers

335
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:34,380
typically we build temporary electric

336
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,000
fence around those bales and then we

337
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:39,480
move the temporary fence to allow the

338
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,400
livestock access to the bales so use a

339
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,800
lot in the western states we talked

340
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:46,730
about that a couple of presentations ago

341
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,660
for here in Ohio but is a good system

342
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:51,360
especially if we get frozen weather

343
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:53,880
creep grazing something we might do with

344
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,860
cows and calves we may build an area in

345
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:58,770
the fence so that the cows can her

346
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:00,960
calves can get to the next day's grazing

347
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:05,160
or next week's grazing to allow them to

348
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:07,050
kind of pick a better forage or or have

349
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,640
a better meal than what their mothers

350
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:11,640
are eating in the product that they're

351
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:14,340
in creep grazing can use a creep gate it

352
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:16,410
can use a raised area in the fan sir

353
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:18,420
simply the calves can go under the one

354
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:21,750
strand of wire to get to the next field

355
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:25,140
to creep graze leader follower grazing

356
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:27,330
sort of along that same line what we do

357
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:29,910
there is we're putting the animals that

358
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:32,850
are on a higher nutritional claim ahead

359
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:35,549
of the animals that don't need to be

360
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:38,850
let's think grass finishing steers in

361
00:15:35,549 --> 00:15:41,429
the front paddock and cows in the second

362
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:44,459
pasture so the cows follow this the

363
00:15:41,429 --> 00:15:45,989
grass finishing spear so the grass

364
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:48,329
finishing steers are only eating the

365
00:15:45,989 --> 00:15:51,209
best and the cows are eating what's left

366
00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:51,989
over or eating the rest before we move

367
00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:54,359
them on

368
00:15:51,989 --> 00:15:57,359
so the steers move ahead the cows fill

369
00:15:54,359 --> 00:15:59,429
in the field that the steers were in and

370
00:15:57,359 --> 00:16:01,739
then flash grazing is something we talk

371
00:15:59,429 --> 00:16:03,779
about if we're Grace and say like

372
00:16:01,739 --> 00:16:07,079
riparian areas that we fenced out so

373
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:08,879
streams creeks ponds places we might

374
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:12,209
only turn the cows in there for an hour

375
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:13,799
or two hours are very short duration so

376
00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:15,209
they go in they graze and we get them

377
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:17,789
out of there before they lounge around

378
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:21,209
and before they have a chance degrade

379
00:16:17,789 --> 00:16:22,379
that area like tamping down stream banks

380
00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:24,720
or waiting in the ponds

381
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:31,350
those are areas that we would do flash

382
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:32,970
grazing we'll talk about forages here I

383
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:37,049
just kind of threw in some terms that

384
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:38,339
maybe everybody's not really up on and

385
00:16:37,049 --> 00:16:41,009
also maybe some things that need a

386
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:43,829
little bit better definition to them so

387
00:16:41,009 --> 00:16:46,829
a s'more the sward would be all of the

388
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:51,419
forages contained in our pasture or in a

389
00:16:46,829 --> 00:16:53,309
paddock so our grasses legumes forbs

390
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:56,759
weeds everything that's out there that

391
00:16:53,309 --> 00:17:00,539
is graze able is what we consider our

392
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:02,549
sward out there in the pasture dry

393
00:17:00,539 --> 00:17:04,409
matter we talked about a little bit last

394
00:17:02,549 --> 00:17:09,919
week and I don't don't feel like I left

395
00:17:04,409 --> 00:17:13,370
with a very good so dry matter is the

396
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:16,259
dry matter equivalent of our pastures

397
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:18,899
dry matter typically is around 14%

398
00:17:16,259 --> 00:17:23,189
moisture that's self stable for grains

399
00:17:18,899 --> 00:17:25,620
and for Hayes so we figured dry matter

400
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:27,629
based on that so if a cow eats three

401
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:32,009
percent of their body weight in dry

402
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:34,769
matter a thousand-pound cow that's 30

403
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:36,419
pounds of dry matter per day the thing

404
00:17:34,769 --> 00:17:38,610
we have to remember is this time of year

405
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:40,049
our grasses are really wet our forges

406
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:42,510
are really wet they're ninety percent

407
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:46,440
points so that means that they have to

408
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:50,160
eat a whole lot more pounds of forage

409
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:52,470
to cover that dry matter need so we

410
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,960
convert everything to dry matter because

411
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:58,230
we don't know what the moisture content

412
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:01,140
of the forage is we know dry haze dry

413
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:02,880
matter but we don't know our forages so

414
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:05,270
when we're talking about how much it cow

415
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,490
eats we always convert it to dry matter

416
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:11,550
residue or residue there again my

417
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:13,680
challenge to everyone to leave a more of

418
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:16,650
a residue residues what we leave behind

419
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:18,960
us so that four inches that we left when

420
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:22,650
we when we move the cows or on our

421
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:25,230
livestock on in a cornfield the residue

422
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:27,900
is the leftover corn flour that's coming

423
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:29,040
through the combine I maintain we should

424
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,230
come up with a better term in that

425
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:34,350
residue still sounds like waste to me

426
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:36,960
that sound like what we what we want to

427
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:39,390
leave behind and it takes grass to grow

428
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,910
grass and if we leave that residue we'll

429
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:44,250
have grass next time if we take it all

430
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:46,530
we won't have gas when we're ready to

431
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,970
come back to it the spring flush

432
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:51,090
something we're going to talk about in a

433
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:53,280
web presentation here coming up if

434
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:56,430
you're looking at that percentage total

435
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:58,800
gross by month chart down below it's the

436
00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:00,870
Green Line it's that first real big bump

437
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:03,390
in our forage production we're gonna be

438
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:05,190
hitting that here in a couple weeks when

439
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:07,800
everything seems to be putting on a seed

440
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:09,960
head we can't get ahead and we can't

441
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,850
graze enough grass the cows physically

442
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:14,700
aren't eating enough grass that's the

443
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:16,470
spring flush conversely the summer slump

444
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,570
follows that up it's the time of year

445
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:22,590
when the forage is just kind of stopped

446
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:25,200
growing typically brought on by lack of

447
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:27,690
water it's thought that it it's heat

448
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,790
related but it really is more a lack of

449
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:31,890
moisture even though those are are some

450
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:35,370
of our wet or months it's that we have

451
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:38,820
so much heat that our water around here

452
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:40,800
turns to humidity and is in the air and

453
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:43,080
not in the soil and not feeding the

454
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:45,960
plants stockpile we talked a little bit

455
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:49,410
last slide about stockpile forage would

456
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:52,350
be forages that we've grown for the

457
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:54,930
purpose of grazing later in a time when

458
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:57,240
forges aren't actively growing so that

459
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:59,040
could be it's typically the fall and

460
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,169
winter but also could be the summer

461
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,359
slump we could be doing

462
00:20:00,169 --> 00:20:05,119
all grass grazing in that summer slump

463
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:06,799
area and in plugging something we talked

464
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:09,859
about this time of year bugging

465
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:12,200
basically is when we've grazed a pasture

466
00:20:09,859 --> 00:20:14,929
that was too wet we had livestock in a

467
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:19,249
pasture when it was too wet their hoof

468
00:20:14,929 --> 00:20:21,259
action has caused the soil to lose all

469
00:20:19,249 --> 00:20:24,649
of its pore space soils always have pore

470
00:20:21,259 --> 00:20:27,529
space for both air and water and if the

471
00:20:24,649 --> 00:20:29,989
cows especially get to chomping around

472
00:20:27,529 --> 00:20:33,080
in a wet pasture they do what we call

473
00:20:29,989 --> 00:20:35,389
hogging them up and that is that they

474
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,429
leave hoof tracks and they they push out

475
00:20:35,389 --> 00:20:39,830
all the air and water and pore space and

476
00:20:37,429 --> 00:20:42,409
so the plants have nothing left to grow

477
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:44,720
on the microbes are even going to be

478
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:50,480
severely affected because there's no air

479
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:52,789
for them to get in the soil I wanted to

480
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,340
talk just a minute about animal units

481
00:20:52,789 --> 00:20:58,549
and how they pertain to our grazing

482
00:20:55,340 --> 00:21:00,799
system so an animal unit typically is a

483
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:02,149
thousand pound beef calf we talk about

484
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,429
an animal unit we're talking about a

485
00:21:02,149 --> 00:21:06,769
thousand pound beef cow and so we

486
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:11,149
convert our actual cow weight down to

487
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:14,029
thousand pound beef cow range and we can

488
00:21:11,149 --> 00:21:16,249
talk animal units with dairy cows that

489
00:21:14,029 --> 00:21:20,179
typically we're factoring it down to a

490
00:21:16,249 --> 00:21:22,489
thousand pound cow for the CAFO units

491
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:25,039
and for permited livestock operations

492
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:27,019
there's whole charts on what is an

493
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:29,480
animal unit and it's all converting

494
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:32,960
those animals to what a thousand pound

495
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:35,659
cow would do that way we're converting

496
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,600
two things one what that animal eats and

497
00:21:35,659 --> 00:21:42,859
two the manure that that animal produces

498
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:45,859
all to one standard unit of measure so

499
00:21:42,859 --> 00:21:47,629
and we unit follows along with what we

500
00:21:45,859 --> 00:21:50,149
talked about with dry matter you know

501
00:21:47,629 --> 00:21:52,820
it's kind of a conversion ratio for us

502
00:21:50,149 --> 00:21:57,139
so the animal unit day is how much

503
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:59,600
forage and animal if we're talking about

504
00:21:57,139 --> 00:22:01,940
animal unit day we're talking about how

505
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,309
much forge that they will consume in

506
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:07,429
that day's time same with a animal unit

507
00:22:04,309 --> 00:22:10,639
month are our soil surveys are typically

508
00:22:07,429 --> 00:22:13,860
put in there for production under animal

509
00:22:10,639 --> 00:22:16,230
unit months so that's anim it's time

510
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:19,590
thirty days to make it months of

511
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:22,040
production so I know in the western

512
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:24,750
states that use a lot at AUM Xan au DS

513
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:26,880
to talk about how much forage is out

514
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:29,100
there if they're renting pasture or if

515
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,200
they're figuring out how much they have

516
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:33,179
under a center-pivot irrigation system

517
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,100
they talk about animal units and animal

518
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:37,320
unit days then the carrying capacity

519
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:39,210
could be the carrying capacity for our

520
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:41,070
entire operation could be carrying

521
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:42,929
capacity for a particular set of

522
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:45,660
paddocks or product or one paddock for

523
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:50,400
that matter but a carrying capacity is

524
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:51,929
the standard set unit for for an area so

525
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,730
a lot of the grazing leases in the

526
00:22:51,929 --> 00:22:57,120
western states are under carrying

527
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:59,820
capacity they've got a set number of

528
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:02,370
livestock and typically they go back to

529
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:05,970
animal units for for what that carrying

530
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:08,040
capacity is on that particular piece of

531
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:11,400
pasture and a grazer

532
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:13,620
I threw grazer in there as a an animal

533
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:16,260
in the animal unit category but it

534
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:19,799
really isn't grazer is us it's it's the

535
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:22,890
farmer or the producer that is managing

536
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:25,220
their animals in a grazing situation as

537
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:27,570
I said I had to cut some slides so

538
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:29,190
grazer within another one but I put this

539
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:31,590
in here because every time I spell it

540
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:33,690
out I get the big red line in spellcheck

541
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:36,360
and I just want to put that out there

542
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:38,460
that I'm not misspell in it that is

543
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:41,280
actually considered us that's us the

544
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:44,370
grazers and anyone that manages their

545
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:49,710
livestock in in a grazing way can be

546
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:52,230
considered a grazer so just a minute

547
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:54,570
here on some what I consider marketing

548
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:55,919
terms now I know if you're eating down

549
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:59,190
through there is saying well those are

550
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:01,290
management terms and they are some for

551
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:04,710
some of us it's lifestyle choices our

552
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:07,020
farm style choices but to me I tend to

553
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:09,780
put these in a marketing type category

554
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:14,370
because this is how folks choose to

555
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:17,299
market their products I guess I put this

556
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:20,520
in here because I end up seeing a lot of

557
00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:22,410
things on social media and out there in

558
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:27,690
the community where folks are poking fun

559
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:29,850
at one Marketing Avenue or another and I

560
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:31,710
is calling it back it's all marketing

561
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:34,559
we're all in this together

562
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:38,460
2% of the population or less our farmers

563
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:41,279
and so we don't have any room to kind of

564
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:43,409
worry about how someone else chooses to

565
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,779
market their product these are marketing

566
00:24:43,409 --> 00:24:48,779
avenues they're ways for us to market a

567
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:50,580
product so organic organic is is a done

568
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:53,250
by a certifying agency you have to be

569
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:55,950
certified organic to sell organic

570
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:57,659
products now there is a loophole there

571
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:59,009
where you can sell less than so many

572
00:24:57,659 --> 00:25:01,019
thousand dollars and call yourself

573
00:24:59,009 --> 00:25:02,429
organic but for the most part those

574
00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:04,259
folks are certified they've got a

575
00:25:02,429 --> 00:25:08,549
certifying agency that looks into what

576
00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:10,679
they do and an organic typically are not

577
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:13,259
allowed to use certain products if

578
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:15,029
they're not naturally derived so one of

579
00:25:13,259 --> 00:25:17,309
the things we run into is is we can't

580
00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:19,799
use treated fence posts sometimes with

581
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:23,700
organic things because that's a not a

582
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:25,799
naturally derived product Organic to

583
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,000
gets into the discussion of pesticides

584
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:29,129
you know they're not allowed to use a

585
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,980
lot of the pesticides that you do use

586
00:25:29,129 --> 00:25:35,070
some the ones that they use are

587
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:36,509
typically naturally derived pesticides

588
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:39,240
they don't use a lot of synthetic

589
00:25:36,509 --> 00:25:42,899
fertilizers but they do use a compost or

590
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:46,110
or other things natural kind of follows

591
00:25:42,899 --> 00:25:47,610
along with that organic type thing then

592
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:48,899
the natural and I'm not sure whether

593
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:50,820
they're natural even had whether they

594
00:25:48,899 --> 00:25:54,169
have their own label or not I'm not

595
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:57,360
really up on that but the natural folks

596
00:25:54,169 --> 00:26:00,360
typically tend to to say that their

597
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:03,379
stuff is pasture raised so pasture

598
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:06,090
raised poultry or hogs on pasture

599
00:26:03,379 --> 00:26:07,980
they're considering that they're natural

600
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:10,679
because there there are some folks that

601
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:12,929
raise organic products that raise them

602
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:15,570
in a more conventional setting but they

603
00:26:12,929 --> 00:26:17,610
they use an organic feed and follow some

604
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:18,659
of the organic practices so the the

605
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:20,820
natural folks are kind of

606
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:22,980
differentiating themselves away a little

607
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:25,049
bit by saying that it was naturally

608
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:27,120
raised and then grass fed and grass

609
00:26:25,049 --> 00:26:30,899
finished kind of is a sticky situation

610
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:34,049
sometimes as they started marketing

611
00:26:30,899 --> 00:26:36,659
products as grass fed we found that that

612
00:26:34,049 --> 00:26:40,409
some producers can say well it was grass

613
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:41,520
fed it had grass or had forage but it

614
00:26:40,409 --> 00:26:44,370
was also fed a

615
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:46,380
Green product one way or another and so

616
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:49,530
the grass-finished has then kind of come

617
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:51,510
up from from there to denote that the

618
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:54,720
product or the the livestock was

619
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:57,800
produced using only forage typically is

620
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:01,050
what the grass-finished would would say

621
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:02,370
conventional then is is the conventional

622
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:05,250
way of doing things with they're

623
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:07,500
following a conventional kind of way of

624
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:10,650
agriculture and doing things in the

625
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:12,890
conventional way and that's not to be

626
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:17,190
derogatory of the conventional folks I

627
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:18,930
firmly keep myself on the fence on all

628
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:21,810
of these marketing what I consider

629
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:24,210
marketing terms because I see merits in

630
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:27,030
all of them I think all of them have

631
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:29,310
some good points and all of them work

632
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:31,020
for themselves and and and that's why I

633
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:33,450
consider it marketing because it's it's

634
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:36,540
all in what works for that operation and

635
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:41,670
how they manage their operation how its

636
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:44,880
used to market their product well that's

637
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:47,130
a wrap for this web presentation I hope

638
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,680
I helped you guys have a little more

639
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:52,770
understanding about some grazing terms

640
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:55,560
and some definitions for them win this

641
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:57,690
presentation by thanking our sponsors I

642
00:27:55,560 --> 00:28:01,470
hope you guys enjoy what we've put

643
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:04,590
together here also while I'm here I'll

644
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:06,480
say don't be afraid to go look up some

645
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:09,060
of these grazing terms if you enjoy our

646
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,850
web presentations there are really good

647
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:14,850
YouTube videos out there about a lot of

648
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:16,650
these topics that you can pick up and

649
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:19,320
watching and some there's even whole

650
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:23,430
series of them and I've kind of done

651
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:26,010
that here in this time that we seem to

652
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:28,080
be faced with quite a bit because it's

653
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:31,230
nice to just sometimes turn off the news

654
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:33,720
and pull out a good YouTube presentation

655
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:35,880
and boy have I really learned a lot over

656
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:38,850
the last few weeks just doing that

657
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:41,580
whenever I got a chance and really

658
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:43,380
excited about the spring grazing season

659
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:45,840
and what we've got coming up here

660
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:48,030
especially with all the newfound things

661
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:51,450
that I've kind of been watching reading

662
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:53,970
through be looking for our virtual

663
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:55,299
pasture walk next week I believe we're

664
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:58,360
going to start shooting some

665
00:28:55,299 --> 00:29:00,489
Oh's for it tomorrow and try to get it

666
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:02,769
