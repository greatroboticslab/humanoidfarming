  "text": "I'm luk D and I work for re Creek Partners which is Our Family Farm it's comprised of my father and my uncle my mother and myself and my wife um we run a mixed Farm here grazing cropping and livestock um my background I'm from Precision farming and we're um yeah I'm always trying to find the most economical economical way to give the greatest efficiency in what we do and also be sustainable and look after our land since the drought broke ended sort of 2020 we um got a lot of rain and we've had nearly four three to four really really exceptional Seasons really really wet that's bought some of its own problems but every every time everything brings problems but yeah we've had good stock prices and yeah good yields good livestock um and we' sort we yeah have done reasonably well so we've decided yeah to what we've made we're investing back in to continue on to be able to keep farming into the future and that's through Water Works and fencing and improving our pastures for the last couple of decades I suppose we've moved to minimum to no till mainly M till uh improved pastures and Native pastures on our grazing country and in the last droughts or last couple droughts we learned it was really important to maintain ground cover and since then in the last 3 to 4 years we've had high rainfall and good pasture growth and um very little water runoff in our traditional dams and waterways and this has decreased our ability to have Livestock on country that does have pasture but very very little water so yeah we've decided to put a couple of Bs together and put a big header tank in and upgrade some pipelines and add new pipelines and Interlink all our farming country and grazing country and start putting troughs in it's a big task and yeah the last couple years we've embarked on doing that even through the dryer what would have been Dyer pinches and spells by having the rotational grazing being able to maintain the the feed body there and have the water is definitely certainly improving that we've noticed so we can yeah continue our stocking rate through the year instead of destocking and restocking likewise so it's something we want to keep doing more more work so we can continue increasing our stocking rate had some cropping country that we're slowly breaking down into rotational grazing country um and they'll be they're basically 50 hectare paddocks or more and we'll be splitting them down into 20 hectare paddocks and then whilst we're doing the fencing we've been putting troughs in in the fence line so they can be divided like one one trough is being utilized between two paddocks and that's sort of help helping keep costs costs down a bit but still providing the water there um that's something we've done for a while and yeah it's worked well so we'll continue doing we live in our grazing country lighter country and it's traditionally that water runoff country that's what you were talking about iron bark country um Native grasses and we're currently we're doing an Autumn our terminal use but join a terminal size uh are laming down in that country at the moment um and we wrote uh don't rotate we sort of set stocked lamb but in small mobs of 100 in Twins and singles so each each Paddock on the Farm's getting utilized and each padic needs to have water but there's there's several paddocks that we'll probably even go and look at possibly that don't have any water at the moment or just about to run out of water with with uh Lambs at foot on the U which is yeah it's not really a good situation I'd like to thank the local Land Services for um providing information and these updates they're very helpful um they point out a lot of things that are going on or what other people are doing in the area that we might not be doing or that what we can learn on we try to attend most programs that are run by the LLS AWI DPI trying to always improve on what we're doing because we can always do stuff better trying to always improve our 1centers if you want to do something there's plenty of contacts to talk to and they've got good information and there are resources that are there there independent of of any major companies or anything and they give out great advice and it's something that we should we as farmers and upcoming Farmers should definitely support",
