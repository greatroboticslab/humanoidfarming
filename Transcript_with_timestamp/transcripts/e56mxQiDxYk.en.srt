1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:05,680
uh Dakota lakes research

2
00:00:02,679 --> 00:00:08,240
Farm you know one of the things as I go

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,160
through today I think I I really want

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,839
you guys to think about where you want

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:17,199
to be in a 100 years because you've got

6
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:20,760
to get in gear and get the agricultural

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:25,240
research system working to get you

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:27,960
there if we if we had the system we have

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:30,480
now if we' have had that 30 years ago we

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,640
would not have Dakota lakes and you

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,800
wouldn't know any of this

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,399
stuff okay so you really need to start

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,320
paying attention to what's happening at

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,760
all the land grant universities in the

15
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,120
United States because they're just

16
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,199
totally

17
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,640
being taken

18
00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:51,600
over and and it really isn't applied

19
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,879
research a lot of it so there's the CES

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,640
research Farm it's owned by Farmers both

21
00:00:53,879 --> 00:01:00,000
irrigated and dry land we've been 100%

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,960
low disturbance snow till um production

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,519
Enterprise profit supports the research

24
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,799
and that's why we've been able to

25
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:07,759
continue if you're not a member of

26
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:11,040
Dakota lakes you should

27
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:13,880
be if you haven't visited Dakota

28
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,600
lakes you should I have people from all

29
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,720
over the world come to visit us there

30
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,680
and they have a lot of people in South

31
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,320
Dakota never been there which is kind of

32
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:24,159
interesting uh and we're building an

33
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,720
addition on our shop so if you want to

34
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,920
really get involved you could make a

35
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:31,000
donation to that so there's our native

36
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,720
vegetation this is one of the most

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,759
exciting days I've

38
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:39,280
had my time at Dakota lakes this is not

39
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:43,320
quite a year ago January last year this

40
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,040
is Colin SC he's from Australia he's a

41
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,799
green and grays guy I've talked about

42
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,439
it's kind of a perennial cover cropping

43
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,799
system in Australia that works really

44
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:54,159
well this is Ralph derps I think a

45
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:57,320
couple people mentioned Ral uh he's from

46
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:00,119
Paraguay and this is durug Goan we call

47
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,719
him duracel cuz he always goes these

48
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,600
from Brazil as well and they came

49
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:06,680
through now these guys you notice Brazil

50
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,920
Paraguay and Australia was about 23

51
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:12,239
below that day and they wanted to take a

52
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,879
picture by the sign because they'd come

53
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,200
to the Dakota lakes research farm so

54
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:16,599
they wanted the sign so we're standing

55
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,319
out there we found all the coats we

56
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:19,599
could and then we went out and showed

57
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,680
them some of what we did this is

58
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,800
irrigated corn on corn we plant between

59
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,440
the cornrows uh we'll do a 2-year stack

60
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,599
and then and then this past year we

61
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,920
planted canola right in this little spot

62
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,519
here

63
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:36,840
uh and we dug around uh dersu is much

64
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,560
more excited than Ral and and you notice

65
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,400
Colin isn't even there he's in the damn

66
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,159
truck he's had enough of

67
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:48,519
this okay so a little bit of

68
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:50,680
biodiversity growing there um anyway

69
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:51,879
1979 I've shown you this before the

70
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,720
average wheight

71
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:59,920
price in in in in 1970 is $137 the

72
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,920
average price of Bar Oil was $3.39

73
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:06,040
so you just do the math for today it's

74
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:09,360
about 89 bucks for a barrel of oil today

75
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:11,239
uh but n bucks for wheat Minnesota where

76
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,959
tillage is King it takes slightly under

77
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:14,440
10 gallons of diesel fuel prak for

78
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,239
tillage seating and

79
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:20,319
harvest so that's not a lot four bucks a

80
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,720
gallon that's 40 bucks it's not a big

81
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:27,799
input if you're looking at price of land

82
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:30,760
in Minnesota for for whatever so uh to

83
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:33,760
take no till is not about taking out the

84
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,400
energy cost it takes the energy one

85
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,680
gallon diesel fuel to manufacture

86
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,799
transport to pipe 5 lounds of

87
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:44,239
nitrogen so that Minnesota farmer puts

88
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:47,040
on 150 pounds of AC per acre of an the

89
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,040
energy is three times 30 gallons they

90
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,400
had to use for tillage seeding and

91
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,599
harvest so the big energy input is

92
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,760
nitrogen

93
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:56,519
fertilizer the big problem with doing

94
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,319
tillage is it screws up all the things

95
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:00,280
these guys talked about had one guy come

96
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,159
up and said boy you're how conventional

97
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,599
tiller you're really making us

98
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,760
conventional tillers feel bad and

99
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,570
whatever and I said well you better go

100
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,280
home before

101
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:12,280
[Laughter]

102
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,280
3

103
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:20,280
so 80% of the total input cost in

104
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,960
agriculture can be traced directly to

105
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:25,320
energy we all feel really good about how

106
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,280
we how good a farmers we are 80% of

107
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,400
that's due to energy 120 years ago that

108
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:33,560
was Zero

109
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,120
120 years from now it has to be zero

110
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,479
again because we're going to be out of

111
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,479
fossil

112
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,440
fuels now some people say I'm going to

113
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,440
use

114
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:54,080
biodiesel if we took and we are cold

115
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:56,360
pressing our oil seeds and stuff right

116
00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:00,360
at the farm because we're going to be

117
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:02,960
fossil fuel neutral by 2026

118
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,199
but if I took all the oils and fats in

119
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,840
the United

120
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:10,919
States beef Tallow pork lard all the

121
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,600
corn oil soybean oil and whatever and

122
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:17,639
made them into b00 we would have about

123
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,800
20% of our road diesel plus home heating

124
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,560
needs and that's it we'd have nothing

125
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,680
for agriculture nothing for electrical

126
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,680
generation nothing for

127
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:31,039
industrial and we still need 80% it's

128
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:36,639
not the answer

129
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:38,720
okay it's a way for us to have diesel

130
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,400
fuel in case we can't get it to run our

131
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,880
combines but it's not a long-term

132
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,479
solution so I'm a farmer I take sunlight

133
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,240
water and carbon dioxide and make them

134
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,560
into products I can sell you notice I

135
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,120
didn't say anything about energy and

136
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,560
iron and whatever how well do we do this

137
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,199
one of the things we do is we get hung

138
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,319
up on these terms Randy England was over

139
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:02,039
here running all these terms by I mean I

140
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,039
had this put together already Randy and

141
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:07,960
they sat there and smiled at you

142
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:10,240
right sustainable no till regenerative

143
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,240
organic zero Tails Drex seed what the

144
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,680
hell you want to call yours

145
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:19,720
R I don't know yeah I got another name

146
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,639
right the new one is soil

147
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:25,080
Health okay but you have a hell of a

148
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:27,199
time defining that too we had nrcs had a

149
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,360
whole soil health Team right remember

150
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,319
all the boys out in Colorado they showed

151
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,479
up one day and they're trying to write a

152
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:35,080
definition this is what you do got to do

153
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:36,720
to have a healthy soil you got to and

154
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,680
you and I took them out of one of my

155
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,880
fields and I dug up a little soil I said

156
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,720
smell

157
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,759
this and they smelled it and they said

158
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:50,000
now you know if you get something that

159
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,000
measure that smell that would

160
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:56,479
work but I also challenged him I said

161
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:59,960
define a beautiful woman or a handsome

162
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:04,800
man how tall how what size hair what

163
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,800
color hair what size different things

164
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:13,479
right you can't write a definition for

165
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:16,599
but we all know one when we see one

166
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:20,520
okay mine mine happens we had 20 our

167
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:20,520
25th wedding anniversary about two weeks

168
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:27,280
ago she needs a sympathy card not a not

169
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:32,680
an one I get a really kick out of it I

170
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:35,120
was traveling in Canada last year they

171
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:37,919
came up with this turb ethical

172
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,120
oil it means that the oil from Canada

173
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:43,440
even though they they dig it out of the

174
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,400
tar Sands and heat the he 11 hell out of

175
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,400
it and do all this stuff at

176
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,560
least their

177
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,120
women are well

178
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,000
treated and they get educations and

179
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,240
whatever whereas in some of the Saudi

180
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,960
the the Eastern Middle Eastern Nations

181
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,080
they aren't treated as well right and

182
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:03,639
they have human rights and whatever so

183
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,639
thorough oil is better it's ethical

184
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,919
oil and I'm yeah

185
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,759
okay that

186
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:13,960
works okay we spend lots of time trying

187
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,000
to find what we should do and should not

188
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,319
do and little time focusing on where we

189
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,199
want to

190
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:22,919
be where do you want to

191
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:24,639
be consequently much of the research and

192
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:26,520
management effort is devoted to

193
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,440
optimizing a single component like

194
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,599
canola or corn you know how can you

195
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:33,399
better manage what how can you kill that

196
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:34,919
what event do you have in that corn and

197
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:36,839
when you're resistant to that corn you

198
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:39,479
got to get another

199
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:42,440
event right spend all this time looking

200
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:42,440
at these little tiny

201
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,600
details and we're using more and more

202
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,640
specialized treatment we're really

203
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:54,440
focusing on the end instead of acting to

204
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:57,320
get where we want to be we're

205
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,680
reacting reacting from

206
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,200
going where we do not want to be be

207
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,640
instead of focusing on where we want to

208
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,720
be it's a little bit like trying to

209
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,680
drive your car Down The Highway by

210
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:11,000
looking at the edge of the

211
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:13,160
ditch okay that works in a blizzard for

212
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,399
you boys from the south that don't

213
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,959
really understand how to drive in a

214
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:17,959
blizzard

215
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:25,399
Ray see all these South Dakota guys know

216
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:28,040
how to do

217
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:30,120
this when you're drunk driving a blizard

218
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:34,000
in the old days it's really fun

219
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:36,720
but it's not ideal way to get

220
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,279
home now there's no better time than now

221
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,320
we've never been more

222
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,959
profitable you know I can tell by all

223
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:47,519
the four-wheel drive pickups around

224
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:49,600
people have some spare cash right so

225
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,240
where do we want to be where do you want

226
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:56,160
South Dakota to be in 200

227
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,640
years what do you want to look like we

228
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,200
keep doing what we're doing what's it

229
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,200
going to look like

230
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:07,360
okay so what 30 years of noil and crop

231
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,120
ration work have taught me remember that

232
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,480
I'm a slow

233
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,079
learner if you don't believe that ask my

234
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,600
wife I've learned more from Farmers than

235
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,160
they have learned from me and I've learn

236
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,600
more from Farmers because they call me

237
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,279
up and

238
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,360
say how would you do this or I did this

239
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:27,240
and this happened and my advantage is

240
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,880
I've talked to a lot of farmers that

241
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,839
have made a lot of mistakes and we all

242
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,800
learned

243
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,000
and I've also had 30 years to make

244
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,839
mistakes of my own I've learned more

245
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,160
from observing nature than trying to

246
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,639
change

247
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:43,720
it and I gave a talk last

248
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:45,760
spring at SDSU to a bunch of really

249
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:48,639
young faculty members that don't know

250
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,560
South Dakota about where Dakota lakes

251
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:53,440
came

252
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:55,480
from and I started with the LA Andre

253
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,160
Brothers how many people here know who

254
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,360
the LA Andre brothers are yeah people

255
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,800
from real Pier do

256
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:06,440
okay they are the French fur Traders

257
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,160
sons from Winnipeg that came across the

258
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,480
Continental Divide from the Red River

259
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,639
Valley to the the Missouri River Valley

260
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:16,040
looking for a Westward passage and also

261
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:18,000
to claim this area for France and the

262
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:20,040
reason we bought it in the Louisiana

263
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,480
Purchase from France were those guys but

264
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,480
they're also looking for

265
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,920
beavers and then Lewis and Clark we

266
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,800
looking for beavers to kill and once we

267
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,000
killed the Beavers we no longer had the

268
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,399
beaver that kept the water from flooding

269
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,959
the Missouri

270
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,120
River and white man wasn't smart enough

271
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,800
to build his houses up on the Hills they

272
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,279
build them in the river

273
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,839
bottoms and we start flooding so then we

274
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:46,399
had to build big ass

275
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,720
dams and we built the dams we had to

276
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,959
take water

277
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,200
from

278
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:54,200
Pier to

279
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,880
Redfield to irrigate because you

280
00:11:54,200 --> 00:12:00,320
couldn't possibly grow corn and soybeans

281
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:00,320
in the gim rer Valley without irrigation

282
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,120
duh

283
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,279
right I've learned more from observing

284
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,560
nature them prying to change it I

285
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,279
thought hell we can do this we can grow

286
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:16,320
corn so in Jimmer

287
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:18,800
Valley if we know till we can grow corn

288
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,680
at Pier if we no

289
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,120
till if we better use the water because

290
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:27,800
Mother Nature could do just fine doing

291
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:29,480
that noil is just one tool among many

292
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,959
that we use to help us manage our

293
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,399
ecosystem but if we do tillage we got

294
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:35,639
everything so screwed up we can't manage

295
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:36,800
it anymore so the first step had to be

296
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:39,959
quit doing

297
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,639
tillage and then you do adjust all these

298
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:44,000
other things and you guys have seen this

299
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:45,800
before but a lot of guys just quit doing

300
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
tillage didn't change anything else oh

301
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:50,040
we're just going to do corn beans like

302
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,800
we always did and it

303
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:56,399
collapses okay so cultural practices

304
00:12:53,800 --> 00:13:00,320
technology and

305
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:04,680
management we have to till

306
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:09,120
is a cultural practice we have to

307
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:10,519
replace it with other cultural practices

308
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,839
not

309
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:17,839
with technology technology is fine but

310
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:20,240
if you try to replace what you did with

311
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,800
tillage with only technology there's not

312
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,000
enough technology

313
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,760
available if it were available we

314
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,800
couldn't afford

315
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:31,720
it you know it's not available because

316
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,680
we get resistant if it were available we

317
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,959
couldn't afford it and if it even if it

318
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,440
were available we could afford it you

319
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:40,800
got to sell it to the consumer and they

320
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,839
frankly don't want us doing

321
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,760
that nature tillage is a catastrophic

322
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,079
event so when we take it out let's do

323
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:52,160
this rotation sanitation comp

324
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:54,759
competition proper intensity using this

325
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,800
water and cover crops is part of that

326
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:59,160
adequate

327
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:01,800
diversity Mother Nature tends to produce

328
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,160
lots of diversity when giving her way

329
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,880
and we try

330
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:08,480
to Crunch this down to do one or two

331
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:10,480
species and she's trying to have all

332
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,800
this diversity we're just going against

333
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,399
what she's trying to do and trust me

334
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:19,120
she's had several million years of doing

335
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:22,279
this and no matter what them Jean

336
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,320
jockies at SDSU think she's better at it

337
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:24,959
than they

338
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,399
are

339
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,839
okay and so they can keep doing it

340
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:33,759
that's fine but she's just going to say

341
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:33,759
oh oh I see what you're up to here try

342
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:42,320
that and if we can get this part right

343
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,480
then we're going to be stable and

344
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,040
sustainable the other way to look at it

345
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,880
is water cycle Are We Cycling the water

346
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:53,320
the way it was cycled before we start

347
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:57,079
farming if not we're leaking

348
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:58,800
stuff and we're leaking nutrients out

349
00:14:57,079 --> 00:15:00,399
and they're going like Ray said to the

350
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,199
golf for

351
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:06,040
Mexico or whatever okay if we put drain

352
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,680
tile in we really screw these up energy

353
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,920
flow how much of the energy that's

354
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,720
falling there are we catching I'm going

355
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:16,000
to Manitoba tonight they used to do

356
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:18,880
summerow last week I was in Montana with

357
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,320
with Paul and they still do summerow

358
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,519
what percentage if they're doing spring

359
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,920
wheat summer fallow what percentage of

360
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:27,880
the sunlight that falls on the ground in

361
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:30,120
two years do they catch well everything

362
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:33,600
from May June and July why one year out

363
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:36,920
of two 3 months out of

364
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:40,199
24 not very

365
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:43,839
good and Community Dynamics what happens

366
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:46,160
with how many species do you have there

367
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:49,560
farmers and ranchers Harvest sunlight

368
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,639
carbon dioxide and water right some of

369
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:55,560
this is human food we need to be aware

370
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:55,560
of nutritional issues and offsite

371
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:03,360
impacts when you raise food in different

372
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:05,560
ways wheat for instance it has different

373
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,600
qualities people are starting to become

374
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:11,040
interested in that Cod Lakes right now

375
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,920
is having long discussions with the

376
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:17,839
people who buy buy Grain and things for

377
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:20,920
kog and Kashi and Starbucks and whatever

378
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:24,240
based on this factor and they initiated

379
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:26,160
it not us if we want to eat beef that's

380
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,079
great maybe we should concentrate on

381
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,240
producing beef instead of trying to grow

382
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:33,720
corn and barley that feeds beef and feed

383
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,440
Lots know just if we all want to grow

384
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,639
some beef out here let's figure out how

385
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,199
the best way to do that weeds and

386
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:41,680
diseases are Mother Nature's Way of

387
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:44,199
adding diversity to system that lacks it

388
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,720
so the more you try to concentrate on

389
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:49,440
one species the more she's going to try

390
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,480
to offer Alternatives nothing new you've

391
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,959
seen these before for me savings might

392
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,079
be expected in the amount of fertiliz

393
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:57,120
and irrigation water used in a

394
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:59,240
three-year rotation he's talking about

395
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:03,439
wheat because of healthy or more

396
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:05,959
functional root systems that could be

397
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,919
corn when you have a drought year like

398
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:11,520
this

399
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:14,880
year was your plant root

400
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:17,079
healthy was it in a healthy soil that

401
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,760
had all these macropores so it could

402
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:23,400
explore the whole root

403
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:25,959
Zone because that's part of what has to

404
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,679
happen biological control of soil and

405
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:29,320
residue inhabiting past of weed is

406
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,280
accomplished by not growing eat more

407
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:34,720
frequently than every third year second

408
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,679
or third year a change in cultural

409
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,480
practices not pay may not pay off at

410
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:40,440
first one or two years R was talking

411
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:44,160
about that might take a while so did

412
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,160
Paul but we'll pay off in

413
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:50,400
time each future wheat field or corn

414
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:53,480
field is treated to the extent possible

415
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,840
as an ecosystem to be nudged rather than

416
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,720
shocked in a desired

417
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,480
Direction right now everybody's trying

418
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:03,320
to shock the thing we throw this

419
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,320
fungicide on but that kills his

420
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:08,880
beneficials and if you put fungicide on

421
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:11,120
there F fungus is what the earthworms

422
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,840
eat bad ones and good ones so you're

423
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,520
going to starve them to

424
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,640
death we haven't used an insecticide at

425
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:21,000
Dakota Lake in 12

426
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:22,559
years not because I'm saying gee we

427
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,360
don't want to use insecticide because we

428
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,960
don't have to we have predators we use

429
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:29,360
some seed treatments and things but we

430
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:31,559
don't use the high rate Cruis and stuff

431
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,039
either it kills our

432
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:36,880
Predators the shest

433
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:40,280
way for me to guarantee that I'd have to

434
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,960
use a poster insecticide is to put some

435
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:46,159
insecticide with my herbicide just

436
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,159
because it only costs a

437
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,320
buck

438
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:54,159
okay crop rotation is the single most

439
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:58,200
critical Factor affecting the health and

440
00:18:54,159 --> 00:19:00,360
productivity of future crops in general

441
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,480
crop ation allows time for natural

442
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,880
enemies to destroy the pathogens of one

443
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,280
crop while unrelated crops are growing

444
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,200
this is not hard choose a sustainable

445
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,400
economic approach that optimizes

446
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,559
productivity while taking maximum

447
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:17,360
advantage or at least not getting in the

448
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:19,000
road of Mother Nature's contribution to

449
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,200
the health of a

450
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,679
crop over Reliance on herbicides leads

451
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,760
to resistant

452
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:29,039
weights and maybe disease

453
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:32,039
problem is there anybody in this room

454
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:36,039
that was in Denver in 1994 at monsanto's

455
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:39,520
Big conference out there where I did the

456
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:42,159
clothes 1994 I did the closing talk in a

457
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:45,520
Monsanto conference in Denver 2,000

458
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:48,280
people and I predicted Roundup

459
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:51,320
resistance I have the

460
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:54,480
tape not a popular position to take in a

461
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,480
Monsanto conference in

462
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:03,240
1994 it's simple you hadn't know that

463
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,360
was going to happen unless you were just

464
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:08,200
totally brain dead monsano knew they

465
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,320
were just hoping that their patent ran

466
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,720
out before it happened and it's not

467
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:16,120
their problem it's your problem it's

468
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:18,559
because we misused it right and maybe

469
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:21,159
disease problems if we use

470
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:23,159
surfactants too frequently may increase

471
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:27,919
disease issue have we seen an increase

472
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:27,919
in bacterial blight and goss's we

473
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,440
those used to be associated with hail

474
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,960
and wind and

475
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:38,640
things which weaken the LA wax on the

476
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:41,840
leaves but if we go out and

477
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:44,159
spray Fung surfactants with fungicide

478
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:49,720
surfactants with herbicides surfactant

479
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,720
with whatever we weaken the wax on the

480
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:56,400
leaves makes it easier for the bacteria

481
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:59,240
get in there it also kills beneficial

482
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,840
bacteria that attack fungi in

483
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,400
Saskatchewan they found that if they

484
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:06,200
spray fungicides early on wheat they

485
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:10,120
increase the amount of ferium because

486
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:12,799
because they kill a beneficial fungi

487
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:16,039
early go the web it's there been

488
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:18,120
published real science fungicides and

489
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:19,600
insecticides cause collateral damage

490
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,880
they are

491
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,000
disturbance just like anything else so

492
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,320
we're going to use them but we're going

493
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,200
to try to use them judiciously so we

494
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,640
look at some other things like chloride

495
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,240
soil testing

496
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,000
can be used to minimize the need for

497
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,640
early SE seasoned fungicide if you have

498
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,080
a chloride deficiency it makes you

499
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,080
susceptible to Le spotting

500
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:46,320
diseases rotation interval and weeds if

501
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:49,000
we want to prevent weeds this is U if

502
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:54,000
you have a resistant weed 10 of them

503
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:57,120
here with 10 seeds per per weed and you

504
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,000
do a rotation that's every other year

505
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,520
like corn Bean you have 10 million of

506
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,039
them in seven

507
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,600
years and that's assuming that you kill

508
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,400
it during the bean year so Roundup

509
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:12,159
resistance this doesn't count that's

510
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:14,799
more like a whatever if I go two years

511
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:17,320
out it never happens if I'm going to do

512
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:19,840
half corn and half beans I'd be better

513
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,159
off to do a stack where I do two corns

514
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,720
two

515
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:26,159
beans

516
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:29,760
okay here's a study that we did years

517
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:32,640
ago where we did 12 years of different

518
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:35,039
rotations on the 13th year I just

519
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,880
planted the whole thing to Spring

520
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:40,600
week and Randy Anderson from ARS came

521
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:43,320
out and he counted the weeds that came

522
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:45,440
up okay so we he counted the weeds we

523
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:47,960
sprayed sprayed round up and then we

524
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,679
planted our spring wheat and then we

525
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,520
just didn't put any more herbicide on he

526
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,840
counted the wheat where we had wheat

527
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,039
chickpea and that's could be corn

528
00:22:52,840 --> 00:23:01,200
soybean if you want to he had 94 weeds

529
00:22:56,039 --> 00:23:05,360
per square yard wheat corn chickp 40 P

530
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,360
wheat corn soybean more diversity

531
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:13,720
7 Now High disturbance techniques

532
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:16,880
increase web pesture and cause tillage

533
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:19,120
erosion this is 97% weed control by the

534
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,320
way with no

535
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:24,120
herbicide case you case you're wondering

536
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,120
uh High disturbance techniques increase

537
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:28,760
weed pressure and cause tillage erosion

538
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:30,559
he did the same count

539
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:33,600
in a tilled site with a two crop

540
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:38,320
rotation there's 225 versus 94 four crop

541
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,320
rotation 7 versus 44 this is due to the

542
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,039
tillage causing more weed somebody

543
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,320
talked about that earlier today was it

544
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:50,799
you right yeah God he's good isn't

545
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,919
he worth all the money we spent getting

546
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:55,279
him

547
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,360
here no you're not we're all taxpayers

548
00:23:55,279 --> 00:24:00,320
we

549
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:02,960
all we all paid for you to come here I

550
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:06,960
knew you were going to say that you you

551
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,960
may be cheap but you're not free

552
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:14,120
right till age dist servance and poor

553
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,559
rotation 225 weeds per square meter no

554
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:19,799
till good rotation 7 there's your

555
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:21,360
97% weed control tillage was good at

556
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:22,720
eliminate weeds the damn thing should be

557
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:26,480
all gone by

558
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:29,240
now especially in Iowa and Illinois

559
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:32,720
right best weed

560
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:35,520
is a good crop canopy we keep this old

561
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:38,279
crop canopy in place or a cover crop

562
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:40,440
canopy or anything like that in place

563
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:42,399
until a new crop canopy

564
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,760
forms that's one of the things with a

565
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:45,919
cover crop you just go out there and put

566
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,640
another crop canopy there instead of

567
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:50,559
trying to kill it with a nervous

568
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:54,360
ey this one we had an a to

569
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:56,520
steer we have an auto steer now but this

570
00:24:54,360 --> 00:25:00,320
is when we had an ought to UT to steer

571
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,320
better and

572
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,919
and you you don't pull in straight but

573
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,679
this is no herbicide on

574
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:10,120
wheat with a with a spot there that's

575
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,799
left and no competition that's what you

576
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:14,240
want to be able to see but there's

577
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:14,240
tillage

578
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:20,320
erosion we took the dirt from here

579
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:24,840
pulled it down here started out looking

580
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:26,760
like this then it medium term it's got

581
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,000
this bear that's about where we're at if

582
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,480
we keep doing that we're going to take

583
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,240
the CRA happy soil and cover up the good

584
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:33,399
soil down the

585
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:35,559
bottom and we're all going to use

586
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:37,840
variable rate technology so we fertilize

587
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:39,960
the top of the hill and drag the

588
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:43,440
down the bottom down

589
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:45,960
here now in Canada they do bail grazing

590
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,279
they put their Bales up here and turn

591
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:50,600
the cows out and the cows poop and eat

592
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:52,120
and whatever and you restore fertility

593
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,399
and organic matter back to top of the

594
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:56,919
hill it makes a lot of sense it put put

595
00:25:54,399 --> 00:25:59,399
a fence around the Bales really kind of

596
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:01,039
a good system sanitation rotation and

597
00:25:59,399 --> 00:26:02,200
competition are the primary methods of

598
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:04,600
pth

599
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,520
control herbicides are part of

600
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,799
competition they're part of Sanitation

601
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:11,080
they're part of rotation they're I don't

602
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:14,039
use herbicides for Pest

603
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:16,600
Control I use them as Tools in this

604
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:19,240
other little goal pesticides are only

605
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:21,000
part of these fertilizer placement

606
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:23,360
residue distribution are part of

607
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,320
competition going Place some fertilizer

608
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,640
maybe move a little residue we're much

609
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:32,320
less gung-ho about moving residue them

610
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:34,919
before but if I put my crop here and I

611
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,559
put fertilizer there and nothing out

612
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:39,720
here then my weeds don't have a chance

613
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:42,600
so again I can get this guy going before

614
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:45,919
these guys have any nice warm conditions

615
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:47,919
and before they get any

616
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,520
fertilizer this guy's got to learn to

617
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,880
drive on the other side of the field so

618
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:56,080
this blows

619
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:59,720
away if you get a 45 foot head from

620
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:02,480
somebody like John Deere and say you

621
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,840
know if you make a head 45 foot wide you

622
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,000
should make a thing in the back that

623
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:09,039
spreads it out 45

624
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,440
ft right should be a requirement we use

625
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,720
a lot of stripper heads for that reason

626
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,600
John Deere hasn't figured that out

627
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:18,120
neither's anybody

628
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:19,679
else place a fertilizer you know strip

629
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,960
Tail's hot but basically it's a

630
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,720
fertilizer placement thing and here's

631
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:26,960
that bar that somebody was talking about

632
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:29,159
today this is the cheap bar just now

633
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,919
some guys want corn heads that chop it

634
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:32,360
all

635
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,880
up and whatever but then it blows away

636
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,559
and floats away you leave it tall and

637
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,240
you use this thing to lean it over put a

638
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:40,240
little fertilizer and plant this is Mike

639
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:42,200
Arn's planter from whatever so what we

640
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,360
do is some s pee with the seed other

641
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:47,120
nutrients place near the row at seeding

642
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:49,600
time or on the soil Surface after crop

643
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,440
canopy if you broadcast fertilizer

644
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:55,840
before at seating it encourages

645
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:58,279
weeds three key factors available

646
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,039
nutrient moisture and Roots all three in

647
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:02,399
the same place the same

648
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:03,880
time and Ray Ward will tell you how much

649
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:06,600
available nutrient you have there

650
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:09,240
estimate it give you his best

651
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:12,799
guess how many of you guys know Ray

652
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:15,080
wart yeah okay do you know that he got

653
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:17,880
PhD from

654
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:19,679
SDSU he used to run the soil testing lab

655
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:22,440
his major professor and his PhD was the

656
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:25,519
same guy as my major Professor he ran

657
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,120
the Redfield farm at one time we're like

658
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:30,399
twins

659
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,399
okay maybe

660
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:37,080
not he's hell a lot better looking than

661
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,320
I am okay we don't kill our coyotes they

662
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,720
can't figure out why everybody wants to

663
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,480
kill their damn coyotes they eat they

664
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,799
eat

665
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:46,679
mice we don't kill our rattlesnakes

666
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:48,080
right one of the reason we kill a

667
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:49,640
rattlesnakes is somebody who does

668
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,679
organic

669
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,159
comp and they say well you're using

670
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,880
these terrible chemicals and I said well

671
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:57,039
what's what do you use we only use

672
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,600
natural stuff it's not dangerous it's

673
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:02,399
good I got rattlesnake need to move cuz

674
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:05,120
he's not going to hurt you obviously he

675
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,120
might cuz it's

676
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:14,480
natural proper nutrient cycling is

677
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:18,320
important ecosystems that leak nutrients

678
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,320
for extended periods of time become

679
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:23,320
deserts if you ship your wheat out and

680
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,200
don't bring

681
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:28,799
back the

682
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:31,679
nutrients in terms of fertilizer

683
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:35,000
you have a desert you're exporting

684
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:37,200
you're leaking we had a Taiwanese Randy

685
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,880
was there right had this time when need

686
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,679
trade delegation one of the things about

687
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,039
being close to Pier right were just

688
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:44,159
handy for these trade delegations they

689
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,720
got meet with the governor and they got

690
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,880
to stall them for an hour and a half so

691
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:49,279
let's go see some wheat we're going to

692
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,840
sell you wheat so

693
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:54,960
I'm talking to him and I got this wheat

694
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,360
coming up and the cover crop is dying

695
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,039
and I'm talking about how it's feeding

696
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,159
the nutrients the wheat and everything

697
00:29:58,039 --> 00:30:01,640
and the guy goes oh you don't need to

698
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,399
use fertilizer and he said well yeah I

699
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:07,320
do need to ferti use fertilizer if I'm

700
00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:09,000
going to ship you the wheat to Ty pay

701
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,600
because I'm sh shipping you nutrients

702
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,080
unless you're willing to take the poop

703
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,480
from Tai pay put it in a container and

704
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,480
ship it

705
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:20,200
back and he got this real stunned look

706
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:23,399
on his face and I okay I started a

707
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:25,559
diplomatic problem

708
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:28,600
here and then all of a sudden he gets it

709
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:31,640
and he starts laughing and he translates

710
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,640
and then they're all making a little

711
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:38,240
Scoopy sailing seeps are symptoms of

712
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,760
improper nutrient water

713
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:43,840
cycling if it wasn't salty when it was

714
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:46,640
in the prairie it's you'd done something

715
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:49,519
nutrient placement is part of cycling

716
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:52,679
try to make it go into the

717
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:54,399
plant developing proper water cycling

718
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:56,840
information is important you need to

719
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:59,360
know soil's water holding capacity

720
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:01,240
characteristics long rainfall and

721
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:05,399
covering forage crops are useful to help

722
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:08,279
fine tunes so here's my North unit Pier

723
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:11,039
Shale Drive promised soil and opal

724
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:14,120
soils uh pretty crappy don't hold much

725
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:16,240
water went to web soil survey which you

726
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:19,440
have in the United States how many

727
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:23,000
people have been to web soil survey

728
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:27,159
good good on you go home go to web soil

729
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,519
survey get a map this is coro's Bucking

730
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:31,399
Horse pasture if if you're watching the

731
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:34,840
National Finals you see my

732
00:31:31,399 --> 00:31:37,320
neighbors you know CU corco takes my

733
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:39,399
neighbors takes them to Las Vegas and I

734
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:41,120
don't get to go and this shows you how

735
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:44,799
much available water holding capacity

736
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:47,519
this is three in this is 5 in total

737
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:49,320
water holding capacity in that really

738
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,960
heavy soil it's like a sand with a

739
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,960
really bad

740
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:57,440
attitude there I use cover crops a lot

741
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,000
because it gets full very quickly I'm

742
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,880
not going to talk about a lot of what we

743
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,279
do there there's a main Farm there's my

744
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:07,919
good soils that's about 12

745
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:09,360
in available water holding capacity okay

746
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,399
those are my good soils then we take

747
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:14,120
some place like Onida which is kind of

748
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:17,840
dry there's your rainfall from October

749
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:20,519
to September I use October one to

750
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,960
September take the E out of ET yeah Paul

751
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:24,799
I know you can't get it all out of there

752
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:26,760
but it sounds better you know taking

753
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:29,840
take part of the E out of ET you can't

754
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,840
take it all out I'm

755
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:34,799
so from October to June from the time

756
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:38,399
you would harvest corn until sunflowers

757
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:42,200
would start using water Onida way the

758
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:44,279
hell out there gets 10.36 in of rainfall

759
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,559
if you make it go in the ground and you

760
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:48,720
keep it

761
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:50,960
there and you have a promis soil you're

762
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,200
saturated and you're getting saine seeps

763
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,200
and you're

764
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:57,840
screwed now if you have a good soil if

765
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:59,679
you were way dry when you harvested the

766
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:03,279
corn which you usually

767
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:05,000
aren't you're going to be we full okay

768
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:07,919
so you can do that kind of exercise half

769
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,120
of normal is usually a drought this year

770
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:12,559
is a little bit more than half a little

771
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:15,279
less than half a normal and then this is

772
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:17,240
one and a half that wet year okay and

773
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:20,919
you can do that for different time

774
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:22,960
periods right the long phow the wheat

775
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:25,840
long phow they used to do it a Ida one

776
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:28,399
crop of winter wheat every two years

777
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:32,399
they tried to put 24 in of rain into

778
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:35,639
soils that hold somewhere between 7 to

779
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:39,840
12 is there any wonder they had sailing

780
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:41,960
seeps duh no till does make saine seeps

781
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,000
worse because it makes the water go in

782
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:47,120
the ground unless you do something

783
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
beneficial with that water why is land

784
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,600
sell for more in Iowa than it does in

785
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
South

786
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:55,440
Dakota they get more

787
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:59,039
rain but yet we have guys here trying to

788
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,039
get rid of their water

789
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:04,519
so if you put this rain in here with no

790
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:07,159
till you got to use it here or it

791
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:08,520
becomes a saine SE here and what's in a

792
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:11,520
saine

793
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,520
seat

794
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:16,960
Ray calcium salts what else is in there

795
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:21,000
sulfur is that a

796
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:22,159
fertilizer and calcium's a like lime

797
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,440
yeah what's the other one that's in

798
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:29,240
there chloride chloride oh we use that

799
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,879
for fertilizer yeah nitr nitrates do we

800
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:34,560
use that for a

801
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:34,560
fertilizer yeah who said

802
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:40,720
salt but it's these really good

803
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:43,399
salts sometimes you get a little

804
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:45,480
sodium but most of the time what's in

805
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:48,159
there is the good guys your fertilizers

806
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,520
that you're paying the hefes for and

807
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,839
what they really want to do is get you a

808
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,679
drain tile so you can get that damn

809
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:56,679
stuff gone quicker so they can sell you

810
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,679
more

811
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:05,960
[Applause]

812
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:07,640
duh cover and forage crops provide

813
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,280
opportunity increase both intensity and

814
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:11,480
diversity in situation where production

815
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:14,040
of grain crop would not be

816
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:16,680
possible so where you can't do a double

817
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:18,320
crop like the guys in Kansas you start

818
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:20,960
doing some of this stuff and add

819
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:23,040
biological diversity in human

820
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,880
environments tall grass prair or weather

821
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,119
which is kind of here in

822
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,560
East the goal should be have something

823
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,760
growing all

824
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,680
times where we have limited growing

825
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:35,400
season this will require use of cover

826
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:36,599
crops and forage crops or double crops

827
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,160
so that's here you don't have a long

828
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:41,800
enough season like the guys in Kansas in

829
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:43,800
subhuman to the west of here semi Aid

830
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,960
environments cover crops are utilized

831
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:48,240
less actually but it gives us a chance

832
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:50,200
to add organic matter and biological

833
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:55,119
activity sometimes we have to keep our

834
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:57,359
powder dry uh so here we're adding

835
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:59,000
carbon this is going to go to beans next

836
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:02,160
year versus not doing anything so here's

837
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:05,160
stripped wheat stubble here's adding hay

838
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:07,720
Millet and oats in there and then here

839
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:11,720
we have some feed that we can graze for

840
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:13,960
our tall cows and our short cows

841
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:17,800
uh I like that

842
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:19,520
joke uh now here's a real mixture of

843
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,000
stuff and that's what we look for is

844
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,720
this diversity they grow at different

845
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,480
times we'll start with like cow peas and

846
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:27,079
the brassas and the lentils and the cow

847
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:29,960
peas will grow early when it's hot and

848
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:35,960
then when it gets to be first night it's

849
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:38,640
36° they go oh damn this isn't Oklahoma

850
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:40,319
and they just die and then you got the

851
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,359
next step same way with the forage torgs

852
00:36:40,319 --> 00:36:45,160
I use oats and forage torgs and the and

853
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:46,760
and the hay millets and when they get it

854
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:49,119
gets too cool for them they die and the

855
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:51,480
oats comes so that's what we looking for

856
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:54,760
is filling these different Niche so

857
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:56,319
there's there's a cowy that comes early

858
00:36:54,760 --> 00:37:00,839
this stuff back here I actually got this

859
00:36:56,319 --> 00:37:00,839
in the wrong order this comes later

860
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:08,880
okay does it work kind of here's a study

861
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:11,960
we did where we had a a cover crop of

862
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:16,079
lenel chickp uh chickling vetch and

863
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:18,119
turnup between a wheat a wheat wheat

864
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,359
corn corn soybean soybean so right in

865
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:22,240
here between the wheat and the first

866
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:25,160
corn if we put no nitrogen on the next

867
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:28,200
spring we got 176 belel of corn with 36

868
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:30,560
lbs of nitrogen we got 236 bush corn was

869
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:34,000
72 lb we got

870
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:35,680
214 no sometimes you get you know what

871
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,359
we got to do is start figuring out how

872
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,720
to predict that's going to happen but

873
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:42,720
the good thing in South Dakota

874
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:45,079
is if I want to use this nitrogen I cons

875
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:48,319
soil test and I'll have it again next

876
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:51,240
year just get it in the pool it doesn't

877
00:37:48,319 --> 00:37:52,839
hurt to have it there so this is what I

878
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,960
call Catch and Release nutrients and a

879
00:37:52,839 --> 00:37:56,640
lot of people use this and we should

880
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,359
give the credit for that to Jeremy

881
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:02,240
Wilson from Jamestown North

882
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:04,160
Dakota really good young no tail farmer

883
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,280
from Jamestown North Dakota and he used

884
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:09,720
this term and I walked up after he' used

885
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:12,720
it at a meeting I said Jeremy can I use

886
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:14,440
that oh sure he didn't know that

887
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:17,560
everybody else is going to start using

888
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:19,440
it right so anyway we need to

889
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:20,960
acknowledge that if you get stranded in

890
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:25,079
rain in the back 40 you drive home

891
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,079
across a child a tilled field or

892
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,240
pasture that's that soil structure thing

893
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,319
that Jim Horman talked

894
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:33,520
about okay it doesn't get there if you

895
00:38:31,319 --> 00:38:35,640
do tillage every other year or whatever

896
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:38,440
okay but at least some components of a

897
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:40,319
rotation do not fail in excessively dry

898
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,599
years it's an indicator there's not

899
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:44,079
sufficient

900
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:46,920
intensity so if you failed on something

901
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:50,480
this year you did

902
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:53,760
good okay some of us did better than

903
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:56,560
others the rotation does

904
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:59,480
not but I'll give you an example we we

905
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:03,440
do a third of our Dryland corn at Pier

906
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:05,160
in soybean or sunflower

907
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,720
residue a

908
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:09,280
third because I call my mother-in-law

909
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:12,800
corn or my banker

910
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:16,280
corn because they come to visit in

911
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,760
June that's my corn that looks good and

912
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:21,400
then two-thirds of my Corn's in wheat

913
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:23,319
stubble and if my banker comes in

914
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,720
September or August I to show them the

915
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:27,560
stuff in wheat stubble right but in a

916
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:29,880
good year

917
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:32,200
that's my cheapest corn in soing

918
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:35,640
stubble I don't have to maintain the

919
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:37,200
wheat stubble right I just harvest the

920
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,680
beans the first thing the spring I plant

921
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:42,680
the

922
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:45,280
corn that's it pretty easy to manage

923
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:47,680
last year I had 140 bushel corn there

924
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:49,640
this year I had zero on average we're

925
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:53,240
about

926
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:56,960
110 okay that's okay it's not as

927
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:59,880
consistent as the stuff in wheat stubble

928
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:02,760
but if I don't fail in the really dry

929
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:05,839
year I haven't taken full advantage of

930
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:09,520
this normal year when I get 108

931
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:11,880
bushel and I fail badly in wet years and

932
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:14,599
that's what a lot of us did early on

933
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:17,200
we're so afraid of being too damn

934
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:19,040
dry that we get too conservative in

935
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,359
terms of pushing the rotation and we

936
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:23,000
fail because it's too wet if you're

937
00:40:20,359 --> 00:40:25,520
failing cons what you want to do is

938
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,319
fail parts of the rotation when it's too

939
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,960
wet fail parts of the rotation when it's

940
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:31,920
too dry in most years they all work

941
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:36,160
pretty good we all we also harvested 100

942
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:38,160
Bush of wheat so uh 99 eight or

943
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:42,280
something like that average on the main

944
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:44,760
farm so we had a good year from that

945
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:46,480
standpoint crop insurance regulations

946
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:49,720
impact risks associated with different

947
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:52,680
rotational intensities and also make

948
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:54,960
sure that your crop insurance rules fit

949
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:57,599
what you're doing with cover crops so we

950
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,240
got a guy in Kansas that basically lost

951
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:01,720
his whole payment because he did a bunch

952
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:03,119
of stuff with cover crop and they came

953
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:05,520
out and

954
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:08,079
said that's not

955
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:10,760
approved there should be no need for a

956
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:12,520
ground engaging component to seed and

957
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,880
fertilize crops we should be able to

958
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:16,160
shoot them in the ground with something

959
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,160
like

960
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:22,200
this so all this St about trying to cut

961
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,960
residue and do all that kind of stuff if

962
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,480
we just have a seed in a thing that

963
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:28,119
looks like a gol tea and just shoot it

964
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:31,119
in the ground it'd be great go out there

965
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:31,119
with our floater and put it

966
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:38,040
on Ray talked about one straw

967
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:40,839
Revolution using clay seed ball same

968
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:42,440
idea seed Stakes would do the same thing

969
00:41:40,839 --> 00:41:44,520
and basically what he's doing is he

970
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:48,440
spreads his seed balls

971
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:50,520
out drains the the rice fields spreads

972
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:53,160
the seed balls out for his wheat

973
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:56,040
crop the wheat crop takes off and grows

974
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:57,319
after the rice and he's before he

975
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:00,000
harvested the wheat he put seed seed

976
00:41:57,319 --> 00:42:02,319
balls out grow cover crop and then he

977
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,760
throws his rice out and floods a field

978
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:06,760
and the rice grows I read the

979
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:13,520
book livestock integration will be

980
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:16,160
needed if if you're want a cycle

981
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,680
nutrients cows help it gives you better

982
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,640
nutrient Cycles it gives you more

983
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:22,680
rotational flexibility more crops you

984
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:25,520
can grow we need to work on automating

985
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:28,319
that and making a multispecies and we're

986
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:30,559
working or hope to be working on these

987
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:32,440
selfpropelled grazing cells but we have

988
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:33,640
the technology now you just have a cell

989
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:36,160
out there you call it up on your

990
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:37,559
smartphone and go how my cow's doing oh

991
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:40,440
looks like they're out of feed push a

992
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:42,920
button and the thing would move we could

993
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:45,480
do that now the technology is there

994
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:47,680
somebody says this makes sense

995
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:49,640
we've automated them in feed Lots we

996
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:51,480
haven't automated them in the field and

997
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:53,599
there's way less disease pressure and

998
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:55,839
stuff we kept them in the field it gives

999
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:59,160
us a chance with these

1000
00:42:55,839 --> 00:43:00,800
high price we have for land to get young

1001
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:04,280
people back into the

1002
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:05,960
business so best biomass digestor has

1003
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:09,240
four legs and goes

1004
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:11,240
move right and I like this one we're

1005
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:14,599
soil testing and then they're going to

1006
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:14,599
apply the fertilizer

1007
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:23,800
right I couldn't resist that one that

1008
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:27,000
was too good uh but here the Canadians

1009
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:28,599
do a lot of this they SWA the residue

1010
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:33,280
and and whatever and the reason they do

1011
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:36,040
is they have they have had more BSE mad

1012
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:38,640
cow so if you have a cow over 24 months

1013
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:40,200
old is basically worthless in Canada and

1014
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:43,079
for you guys that came to the conference

1015
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:46,119
in year on several years ago we had guys

1016
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:47,960
talking about doing this kind of thing

1017
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:50,000
perennial sequence or perennial cover

1018
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:51,640
crops will probably be necessary because

1019
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,559
annual crops don't go deep enough to

1020
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:56,760
bring the line back to the

1021
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:58,200
surface okay in Australia they have a

1022
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:01,359
huge problem with

1023
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:04,480
this and that's where Colin sizes thing

1024
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:07,520
works but I was in a sorghum field one

1025
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:10,680
time where they thought it was drought

1026
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:12,119
problem with sorghum but the only place

1027
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:14,280
the Sorghum looked good was right around

1028
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:14,280
the

1029
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:21,079
tree and then Ray Ward can tell us what

1030
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:22,800
that is what nutrient deficiency symptom

1031
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:27,599
looks like drought

1032
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:30,960
problems there you go see how good he is

1033
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:34,160
so when we test it what the tree does is

1034
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:37,079
it brings the potassium up and puts it

1035
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:40,880
back at the surface so in high rainfall

1036
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:43,520
areas that's our cycler in Prairie areas

1037
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:46,359
it's a deep rooted grass because we

1038
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:49,400
don't get as much rainfall that's enough

1039
00:44:46,359 --> 00:44:51,400
need a tree where it rains more they get

1040
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:53,240
the rainfall in the winter time so what

1041
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:55,160
happened is we had 100 parts per million

1042
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:57,440
potassium around the tree five parts per

1043
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:59,480
million where we're away from the tree

1044
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,800
so the drought wasn't a drought it was a

1045
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:03,880
potassium

1046
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:05,920
deficiency I'll be D nutrient cycling

1047
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:07,839
rotational flexibility building organic

1048
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,359
matter we need to do all those things we

1049
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:11,240
might if we're going to do fuel we might

1050
00:45:10,359 --> 00:45:14,000
want to

1051
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:16,000
do biomass Fuel and our new building

1052
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,160
we're building we're going to heat it

1053
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,800
with solar wind and

1054
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:22,319
biomass biomass only when we need to

1055
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,440
because we like to keep organic matter

1056
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:26,760
and feeder

1057
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:28,079
cows the austr the Argentine used to

1058
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:30,599
have

1059
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:32,319
systems that were seven years of pasture

1060
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:35,240
and seven years of grazing so here's

1061
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:36,839
cover crops no cover crops but this

1062
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:38,240
field would have been in seven years of

1063
00:45:36,839 --> 00:45:43,040
pasture and then probably about its

1064
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:44,119
fifth year of of of crops look at the

1065
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:47,359
soil

1066
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:47,359
structure that's

1067
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:54,640
1997 and then the Argentine government

1068
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:54,640
outlawed the export of

1069
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:59,920
beef and they said it was so the poor

1070
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:01,359
people could afford to own bee to buy

1071
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:04,040
beef because they atat twice as much

1072
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:06,599
beef per capita as we do great place to

1073
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:09,640
visit if you're a young single male guy

1074
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:11,480
especially pretty girls wine and beef I

1075
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:15,960
mean

1076
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:18,000
it's doesn't get any better than that um

1077
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:20,119
but Ruth said are they pretty and I said

1078
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,800
yeah and but I said it's kind of like a

1079
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:23,520
dog chasing a car deer I wouldn't know

1080
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:26,520
what to do with it if I caught it anyway

1081
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,520
so

1082
00:46:28,839 --> 00:46:33,440
but when they outlawed the the real

1083
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:35,760
reason for out

1084
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,400
outlawing the export of beef is they

1085
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,920
wanted more soybeans because the way

1086
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:42,880
they collect taxes in in Argentina is

1087
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,760
they take 32% of the soybeans that leave

1088
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,960
through the

1089
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:49,960
port go to the government so we have the

1090
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:54,000
IRS and all these rules and everything

1091
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:58,720
right brick buildings cars computers

1092
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,720
they got one guy an auger and a gun

1093
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,599
but

1094
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:06,520
anyway so everybody went to doing lots

1095
00:47:04,599 --> 00:47:09,240
of

1096
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:11,319
soybeans because we can't do cows can't

1097
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:13,160
do the pastures we're going to do

1098
00:47:11,319 --> 00:47:16,960
soybeans and I

1099
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:18,240
finally in 2006 got to go back to the

1100
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,319
same field because I've been there a

1101
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,960
couple times I was noticing I thought

1102
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:24,520
they were losing soil structure but

1103
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:27,200
unless they went back to the same field

1104
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:31,240
I couldn't tell you that's the same

1105
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:35,119
field in 2006 that happened in 10

1106
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:36,480
years soybeans on soybeans on soy beans

1107
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:37,920
there's not enough carbon there's not

1108
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,880
enough residue your carbon nitrogen

1109
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:42,040
ratio is all screwed up you're just

1110
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:43,599
going to totally destroy structure very

1111
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:45,720
fast it's like doing tillage over and

1112
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:48,559
over and over again and this is a plate

1113
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:51,680
plate type structure here's one that

1114
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:55,319
we're doing right now we have elala this

1115
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:57,440
is our long-term 23-year corn field but

1116
00:47:55,319 --> 00:48:00,160
we planted alala in half of that and

1117
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:03,000
we're keeping the elf alive and the corn

1118
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:05,240
alive and so far so good but we'll find

1119
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:08,839
out next spring so the idea is kind of

1120
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:09,599
Colin SC is doing a warm season grass as

1121
00:48:08,839 --> 00:48:12,880
a

1122
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:16,319
grazer like a looks like switch grass or

1123
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:18,559
or big blue stem and then he grows

1124
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:20,839
canola and wheat during the winter time

1125
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:24,880
during the dormant

1126
00:48:20,839 --> 00:48:25,760
phase here during the dormant phase of

1127
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,200
the

1128
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:31,280
Corn the fall and the winter we're going

1129
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:32,960
to have this perennial guy okay we'll

1130
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:34,480
see if we can keep them both alive

1131
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,720
organic matter is the most important

1132
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:39,119
factor in determining the productivity

1133
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:41,599
of soil small amount of organic matter

1134
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:45,720
by weight has a big impact on for

1135
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:47,559
space within all texture groups is we go

1136
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:50,799
from 1 to 3% the available water

1137
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:53,280
capacity doubles go to 4% at

1138
00:48:50,799 --> 00:48:54,760
60% your water does not hold as much

1139
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:58,319
your soil does not hold as much water as

1140
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:59,920
it did when Grandpa got here

1141
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:04,119
because he's taking out the organic

1142
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:08,440
matter so if you had a soil like on a a

1143
00:49:04,119 --> 00:49:10,920
soil web that says okay it holds 8 in

1144
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:15,040
now it maybe holds six what's that mean

1145
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:15,040
a rainfall makes you saturated

1146
00:49:15,079 --> 00:49:20,359
sooner and then when you get a crop

1147
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:22,400
planted there you get dry sooner you

1148
00:49:20,359 --> 00:49:24,160
have less resiliency your bucket is

1149
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:27,920
smaller the best thing to do is get a

1150
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:31,640
bigger bucket okay the other thing that

1151
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:34,480
happens is we might be changing carbon

1152
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:36,799
dioxide level in a canopy because if

1153
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,799
residu these cover crops that de

1154
00:49:36,799 --> 00:49:41,280
decompose after crop canopy is

1155
00:49:38,799 --> 00:49:43,280
established or the residue that decompos

1156
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:44,760
them can feed carbon dioxide to

1157
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:47,599
especially C3

1158
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:49,400
plants cook and vth talked about that

1159
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:52,160
perhaps some of the improved water use

1160
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:55,440
efficiency results can be attributed to

1161
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:57,200
enhanced carbon dioxide concentration so

1162
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,000
here's an example of our you've seen

1163
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:01,280
before probably but here's two rotations

1164
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:04,160
that look almost exactly the same corn

1165
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:05,920
pea winter wheat this one though has

1166
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:07,319
another soybean in there so it's half

1167
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:11,440
broad

1168
00:50:07,319 --> 00:50:13,440
leaves this one up here is only a third

1169
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:16,720
broadleaf look at the difference in a

1170
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:19,760
dry year 60 versus 29 with 7.9 Ines of

1171
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:23,799
rain in from July to

1172
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:26,319
July in 2006 in a good year 92 ver 57

1173
00:50:23,799 --> 00:50:28,799
that's when we had 23 in of rain here we

1174
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:32,839
had .4 56 versus

1175
00:50:28,799 --> 00:50:35,839
28 that tells you the difference in

1176
00:50:32,839 --> 00:50:38,240
resiliency there's what it look like

1177
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:40,720
this is the low residue rotation there

1178
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:43,240
high residue rotation there that's what

1179
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:44,440
it looks like in an aerial photo when

1180
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:47,640
you take

1181
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:49,680
off half of 150 Bush acre corn crop

1182
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:53,480
you're taking off 50 pounds a acre of

1183
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:54,680
Van 5 lbs of P 100 lb of K and 3,000 lb

1184
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:56,920
of

1185
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:58,400
carbon I had a guy last week we when I

1186
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:00,079
was traveling to Montana somebody called

1187
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,760
me on the phone wanted to buy my baales

1188
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:04,359
that we had spread out to do some bail

1189
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:06,119
grazing and stuff I'm going you can't I

1190
00:51:04,359 --> 00:51:07,920
it took me like 20 minutes to convince

1191
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:10,920
him I didn't want to sell my damn

1192
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:12,760
residue you can't have it you know like

1193
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:15,240
well I'll pay you good for it you can't

1194
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:18,359
have it don't you want to know how much

1195
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:22,280
no you can't have

1196
00:51:18,359 --> 00:51:25,200
it a friend or guy from South Dakota no

1197
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:27,119
tilling it's not about no till it's

1198
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,760
about residue

1199
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:31,599
doesn't have any

1200
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:33,920
residue doesn't do any good to not do

1201
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:35,720
tillage because it's all sealed up right

1202
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:39,520
Ray it's all screwed up there there's no

1203
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:44,160
residue it looks like Paul yaz's organic

1204
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:46,640
thing where' the residue go Abdul took

1205
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:50,640
it and he took the

1206
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:52,559
roots along with it because in mlim

1207
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,119
culture if you leave anything out there

1208
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:57,160
belongs to the

1209
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:59,400
community so you take it all and you put

1210
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:02,599
it on your

1211
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:05,480
semis or your straight trucks and

1212
00:52:02,599 --> 00:52:09,160
you and you take it to the building but

1213
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:11,640
we laugh but that guy if that's the

1214
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:14,799
residue he's going to feed to the goat

1215
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:17,440
that's going to give milk to his

1216
00:52:14,799 --> 00:52:18,720
children it's not because he's a greedy

1217
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:21,440
bastard that just wants a bigger

1218
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,440
four-wheel drive

1219
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:28,520
pickup okay there wouldn't be anybody in

1220
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:28,520
this room that would do that

1221
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:32,760
take the E out of e and take the T out

1222
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:36,640
of

1223
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:38,760
can't go to the South dakota.com and

1224
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:40,440
we've got like a good thing for doing

1225
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:42,799
rotations or different styles of

1226
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:46,140
rotations that you might have fun

1227
00:52:42,799 --> 00:52:54,890
reading okay thank you

1228
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:54,890
[Applause]
