00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:09,260
welcome to Paulina garden there are many

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:13,410
benefits of raised bed gardening a

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:16,109
raised bed that is about 1.5 to 2 feet

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:18,420
tall will be ideal for people with back

5
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:21,900
pain because they don't have to bend as

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:26,150
much while growing in a raised bed you

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:29,310
will spend less time pulling weeds out

8
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:31,680
gardening in raised beds prevents soil

9
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:35,130
compaction because you won't be working

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:39,420
on the soil and it provides good

11
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:42,510
drainage for all these reasons raised

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:46,010
beds are great for growing vegetables

13
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:49,320
and flowers in a small backyard garden

14
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:53,880
you can build raised beds using many

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:56,640
materials such as wood concrete metal or

16
00:00:53,880 --> 00:01:02,190
even plastic based on your budget and

17
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:06,149
preference here is an example of a

18
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:09,899
raised bed built in 2015 using cinder

19
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:12,780
blocks or concrete blocks the advantage

20
00:01:09,899 --> 00:01:14,700
of cinder blocks is that you can just

21
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:18,240
place them on the ground and quickly

22
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:21,840
build a raised bed and they last longer

23
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,779
than wood however because they are not

24
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,259
held together by anything gravity and

25
00:01:24,779 --> 00:01:31,139
weight of the soil can push down on them

26
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:34,229
and create gaps between the blocks

27
00:01:31,139 --> 00:01:37,670
especially in a garden area that slopes

28
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:40,079
just like mine this requires some

29
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:43,889
realignment to close the gaps every

30
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:47,340
season this raised bed is made up of two

31
00:01:43,889 --> 00:01:51,029
layers of cinder blocks and this gives

32
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:54,749
me a good working height so I don't have

33
00:01:51,029 --> 00:01:58,380
to bend a lot the next bed I have in my

34
00:01:54,749 --> 00:02:01,169
backyard was built in 2016 using

35
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:04,679
untreated lumber bought from hardware

36
00:02:01,169 --> 00:02:08,910
store it is not very high but it still

37
00:02:04,679 --> 00:02:13,080
helps in controlling weeds what you see

38
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:14,670
here is a 2 feet tall keyhole shaped

39
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:19,890
raised bed under

40
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:22,530
construction I built this in 2017 and it

41
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:26,700
was also built using untreated lumber

42
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:29,970
bought from hardware store I started off

43
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:33,480
this raised bed by clearing the ground

44
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:34,170
of grass and weeds and then I leveled

45
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,630
the ground

46
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:39,720
place the first level of lumber and

47
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:43,709
joined them together using galvanized

48
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:47,010
screws I then placed some hardware cloth

49
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:49,340
or wire mesh on the ground on top of the

50
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:52,080
wire mesh I placed some cardboard

51
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:56,250
because it was going to be a two feet

52
00:02:52,080 --> 00:03:00,450
tall structure I filled it up to a good

53
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:03,480
height with layer of twigs and garden

54
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:06,540
waste on top of the cardboard I then

55
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:09,420
topped off the raised bed by adding

56
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:14,100
compost première sphagnum peat moss

57
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:17,340
perlite and azomite rock dust and mixing

58
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:20,280
them well after about a year of growing

59
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:23,790
vegetables the level of soil went down

60
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:27,150
by four to six inches so I have topped

61
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:29,989
it off again as you can see here the

62
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:33,480
other thing I have done on this bed is

63
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:36,510
added irrigation drip irrigation as you

64
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:39,060
can see here the one thing that was

65
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:42,090
common in the three raised beds you saw

66
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:45,109
till now was that I had to spend money

67
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:48,870
to buy the materials required for

68
00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:52,380
constructing these raised beds it does

69
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:55,530
not always have to be that way this year

70
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:58,319
that is in the year 2018 I am

71
00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:00,450
constructing a raised bed with some wood

72
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:04,709
logs that are lying around in my

73
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:08,069
backyard these wood logs were delivered

74
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:11,670
last year by chip drop along with the

75
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:14,160
wood chips that you can see here and I'm

76
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:16,919
going to use these logs to construct a

77
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:19,769
raised bed the location for this raised

78
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:22,950
bed is at the north end of the garden by

79
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:26,789
the fence not an ideal location for

80
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:28,199
growing sun-loving vegetables but I can

81
00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:33,719
try to grow vegetable

82
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:36,030
or plants that love partial shade or the

83
00:04:33,719 --> 00:04:39,539
plants that can climb up the fence and

84
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:44,180
reach out for additional light I cleared

85
00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:48,349
the ground of grass and weed seeds and

86
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:51,539
loosened the clay soil like you see here

87
00:04:48,349 --> 00:04:54,960
there after I removed the soil from this

88
00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:55,889
location and placed a hardware cloth on

89
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,770
the ground

90
00:04:55,889 --> 00:05:01,050
this helps to discourage critters from

91
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:04,620
making burrows and reaching the raised

92
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:08,490
bed from underneath the ground had a

93
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:10,949
slope but I did not level it I'm just

94
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:14,759
going to place the wood logs along the

95
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:18,060
slope in a rectangle shape and form the

96
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:20,219
raised bed structure this is how it

97
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:23,339
looks like after the wood logs are

98
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:26,669
placed next I am going to fill this

99
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:30,150
raised bed with different materials to

100
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:32,639
form the growing medium I placed a layer

101
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:35,759
of cardboard on top of the hardware

102
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,729
cloth as it helps to block sunlight and

103
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:42,300
prevent the growth of any grass or weed

104
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:45,300
roots or weed seeds that may still exist

105
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:47,939
on the ground I placed a layer of

106
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:51,419
vegetable scraps from a kitchen on top

107
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:54,509
of the cardboard I reuse the clay soil

108
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:57,629
removed from this location earlier to

109
00:05:54,509 --> 00:06:00,419
cover these vegetable scraps eventually

110
00:05:57,629 --> 00:06:04,710
the vegetable scraps will decompose and

111
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:06,810
provide nutrition to the plant roots the

112
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:07,529
other ingredients used to fill this

113
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:11,399
raised bed

114
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:15,750
we're mushroom compost organic planting

115
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:18,449
soil from Costco course premium grade

116
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,909
perlite to provide better drainage in

117
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:22,830
the soil

118
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:27,029
Magnum peat moss as it helps to loosen

119
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:30,719
the soil and retain moisture and as a

120
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:34,229
mite rock dust used to replenish trace

121
00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:36,990
minerals after adding all the items

122
00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:38,310
shown earlier into the raised bed I used

123
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:41,910
a pitchfork

124
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:44,880
to mix them well that is how I consider

125
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:49,080
a raised bed using wood logs already

126
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:51,330
available in my backyard it got dark by

127
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:54,450
the time I completed this raised bed and

128
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:59,190
I apologize for the lower visibility

129
00:06:54,450 --> 00:07:01,980
towards the end of this video recently a

130
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:06,000
friend of mine had requested me to

131
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:08,780
upload a video on raised bed I hope this

132
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,850
video is helpful for that friend and
