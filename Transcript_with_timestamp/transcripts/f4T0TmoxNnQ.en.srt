00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:10,160
agricultural disasters aren't just about

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:14,519
crops failing they're about lives being

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:17,119
torn apart droughts that last for years

4
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,720
flash floods that destroy entire

5
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:22,480
harvests and extreme weather events

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:25,840
becoming the new normal and it's not

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,480
just nature turning against us our own

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:32,040
practices are accelerating this

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,640
crisis over farming

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,360
deforestation and the excessive use of

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,640
chemical fertilizers are stripping the

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,480
land of its

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,239
nutrients leaving it vulnerable and

14
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,079
Barren take a look at the dust bowl of

15
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,000
the

16
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:50,680
1930s a man-made disaster where poor

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,120
Land Management and Relentless farming

18
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,680
turned the Great Plains of the United

19
00:00:53,120 --> 00:01:00,000
States into a vast

20
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:03,160
Wasteland today we Face a similar threat

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,280
but on a global scale from Africa's

22
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:09,840
sahal region to the fertile Plains of

23
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,799
Asia once thriving farmlands are turning

24
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,799
into

25
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,520
deserts but the challenges don't end

26
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:20,159
there climate change is the Ultimate

27
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:23,960
Game Changer Rising temperatures

28
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,920
unpredictable rainfall and severe storms

29
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:29,560
are making farming more challenging than

30
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,560
ever crops that once flourished in

31
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:35,600
certain C regions are now struggling to

32
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,560
survive forcing Farmers to either adapt

33
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,680
quickly or abandon their lands Al

34
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,680
together this isn't just an

35
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:48,079
environmental issue it's a humanitarian

36
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:51,600
crisis as crops fail the Ripple effects

37
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:54,600
are felt far and wide food prices

38
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,920
Skyrocket and in some areas basic

39
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:00,479
Staples become scarce imagine walking

40
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,560
into your local grocery store only to

41
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:06,240
find empty shelves and prices so high

42
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:09,119
that feeding your family becomes a daily

43
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,840
struggle this is not just a problem for

44
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:16,000
Farmers it's a problem for all of us but

45
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:20,239
it's not all doom and gloom around the

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,879
world scientists farmers and innovators

47
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,959
are working tirelessly to find

48
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:28,000
solutions from developing drought

49
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,800
resistant crops to exploring sustainable

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
farming practices the fight to secure

51
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,480
our food future is

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,800
underway Technologies like vertical

53
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:40,879
farming and hydroponics are

54
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,879
revolutionizing the way we grow food

55
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,440
making it possible to farm in

56
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:48,239
environments once considered

57
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,640
impossible communities are also rising

58
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,640
to the challenge implementing

59
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,599
regenerative agriculture practices that

60
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,080
restore the soil conserve water and

61
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:00,599
reduce carbon

62
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,120
emissions these efforts are not just

63
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:04,440
about survival they're about thriving in

64
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,680
the face of

65
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:10,360
adversity it's a powerful reminder that

66
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,040
when we work with nature rather than

67
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,239
against it we can overcome even the most

68
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,879
daunting

69
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:21,200
challenges but the question remains will

70
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:23,640
we act in time the future of our food

71
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,840
system depends on the choices we make
