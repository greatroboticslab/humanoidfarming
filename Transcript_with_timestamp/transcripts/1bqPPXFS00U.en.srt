00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,920
friends welcome back to bloom garden and

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,600
today we are talking once again about

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,160
the Garden today we're talking about

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,440
soil testing now you can see our garden

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:15,719
is all tilled up the soil is really soft

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:17,760
and fluffy and it's ready to plant or is

7
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:19,800
it there are a couple important steps

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,080
before we start thinking about actually

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,960
putting our plants in the soil just by

10
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,840
looking at the soil we can't tell what's

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,519
in here and if it will be beneficial for

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,480
the plants that we want to plant that is

13
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:35,600
why soil testing is so important just

14
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,800
like we need nutrients and vitamins and

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,800
carbohydrates to be strong and healthy

16
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,239
our plants need certain vitamins and

17
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:45,760
minerals as well that are typically

18
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,280
found in the soil however this Garden

19
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,160
has been planted several times and the

20
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,239
plants that were here before took out

21
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,280
certain nutrients and I need to know

22
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:58,519
what is existing in this soil before I

23
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,640
put new plants in so soil testing

24
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:04,159
measures those important minerals and

25
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,439
substances that are nutrients for our

26
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,520
plants that our plants need to grow and

27
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:10,280
Thrive and eventually produce the

28
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,680
produce that we're looking for in our

29
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:17,439
garden some plants do not like soil that

30
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,360
is high in acids most vegetables do not

31
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:23,159
so if our pH is not correct our plants

32
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,640
are not going to thrive so soil testing

33
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,759
is kind of like a little money in the

34
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,640
bank a little Assurance to tell us what

35
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,280
is going to happen to our plants once

36
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,960
they go in the soil part two of that is

37
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,720
amending the soil before the plants go

38
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,399
in now once we test our soil and we get

39
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:44,079
the results and we know what's in here

40
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:45,719
and what is lacking then we can add

41
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,520
those things that are needed that is

42
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:50,719
called amending or fixing and making the

43
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,880
soil proper for the plants that we want

44
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:56,000
to put in here now there are several

45
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,680
tests that you can do to test your soil

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,520
they can be as simple as a one test just

47
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:05,159
to test the pH you can go deeper with

48
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,880
nitren and poach and several others

49
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,200
another thing that you can do is take

50
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,039
some soil samples and send them into

51
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,239
your Cooperative Extension Office or

52
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:17,480
other agricultural lab that also has a

53
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:19,959
fee but they give you a complex rundown

54
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,120
of exactly what's in your soil that also

55
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:24,400
takes some

56
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,360
time so for me the best way to test my

57
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,560
soil is by using an at home test now the

58
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,400
one that I have selected is easy to get

59
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,879
from Amazon and I will link it down

60
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,480
below let me show you what that test is

61
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:41,040
like I am using this Luster Leaf rapid

62
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:43,480
soil test kit it measures is pH potash

63
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,080
phosphorus and the nitrogen

64
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,560
content it's a very simple test we're

65
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,879
just going to collect some soil and then

66
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,080
we're going to add some water into each

67
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,319
of these tubes and add a little powder

68
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:56,560
from the capsules and it will show up in

69
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:58,680
these ranges and show us where we are on

70
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,680
the scale from too much to not enough

71
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,120
help us decide what we need to add or

72
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,080
subtract from our soil to gather the

73
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,799
soil for our soil test we're going to

74
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,799
want to go down a few inches we're going

75
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:10,879
to want to get the soil where the roots

76
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:12,599
of our plants are going to be once

77
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,760
they're established that's where they're

78
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:16,200
going to be sucking up the nutrients we

79
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,640
really don't want to get anything on the

80
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,720
top of the soil because nothing really

81
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,959
grows on the top we also want to get our

82
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,799
samples from several different areas in

83
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:29,340
the garden so we have an overall view

84
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:50,920
not just one spot

85
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:54,159
[Music]

86
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,159
we're going to need the soil we

87
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:59,400
collected a couple of quart jars now I'm

88
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:03,200
doing three separate tests I'm going to

89
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:05,519
do the test of what the soil is made of

90
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,159
I'm going to test our garden soil and

91
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:12,959
I'm also going to test the compost that

92
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:15,519
I want to add into the soil later so I'm

93
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,120
going to do three tests but for each

94
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:21,639
test you only need one

95
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:25,440
jar you are going to need some

96
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:28,759
water measuring devices as well and I'm

97
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,639
just using this purified drinking water

98
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:32,680
you want to be sure that the water is

99
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,160
purified and not well water because

100
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:40,720
that's going to alter your testing so

101
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:43,039
purified water I have some notes Here

102
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:47,560
labels that I'm going to use and then of

103
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:50,080
course I have something to jot down my

104
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:55,000
test results of course you're going to

105
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,000
need your soil test kit

106
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:04,370
[Music]

107
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:11,080
now that I have my half cup in my

108
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:14,600
nutrient testing jars I'm using a

109
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:17,080
totally different jar for the soil test

110
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,440
it even has a smaller ring around the

111
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:22,240
top so I can tell it apart should my

112
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,840
label get knocked off or something I

113
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,639
want to be able to tell that it's

114
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:31,210
distinctly different because this is the

115
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:34,440
soil type test not the soil nutrient

116
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:34,440
[Music]

117
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,759
test we're adding in our 2 and 1/2 cups

118
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:50,000
of distilled water for our nutrient

119
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:53,600
testing test and now for the soil type

120
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,319
testing the soil was halfway up the jar

121
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:59,120
and then we add water until it's 3/4

122
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:02,880
full so the entire contents brings the

123
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:05,400
jar to 3/4 full so it's not 3/4 cups of

124
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,360
water it will depend on your soil if

125
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,720
your soil is heavy or if your soil is

126
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,440
light how much water you're going to add

127
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,240
here but you're just going to add until

128
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:17,160
the jar is 3/4

129
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,560
full and don't forget to add your

130
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:23,319
teaspoon of liquid dish detergent to

131
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:26,720
your soil type test jar only not the

132
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:28,919
nutrient jar just the soil test give

133
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,639
everything a good shake you really want

134
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:33,280
to mix it up up get everything stirred

135
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:35,800
in really really well this is going to

136
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,199
help us get the best results so give it

137
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,199
a good

138
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:43,800
shake and then you want to set it down

139
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,800
and not disturb it

140
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,720
again once you have your jars filled you

141
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,000
want to place them back away where

142
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,240
they're not going to get Disturbed again

143
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,199
and I realized that I also wanted to

144
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,599
test for the raised bed garden and I

145
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,800
didn't do that so I'm going to go ahead

146
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:13,560
and get that one ready and I will meet

147
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,039
you back in 24 hours but first we're

148
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:19,639
going to go over our little test kit and

149
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:21,160
I want to share um just what's in it and

150
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:24,039
to let you know that I will be sharing

151
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:28,520
the review after using this product this

152
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:30,840
is the first time I have used this

153
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:33,000
product so we're opening up and the

154
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,800
first thing I like is that is it that's

155
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,360
just how easy you just pull that back

156
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:41,639
card up no cutting no getting stabbed or

157
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,919
cut on Sharp blister packaging that you

158
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:48,159
can't open when you have arthritis that

159
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:50,080
is a huge Plus for me so I like it this

160
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:52,240
card you want to hang on to it looks

161
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,319
like just a piece of cardboard but

162
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:59,039
inside they have given you all kinds of

163
00:07:55,319 --> 00:08:03,039
valuable information information on what

164
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:05,280
the test are how to test what's

165
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:08,280
beneficial and all those things that are

166
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:12,000
going to work into the success of using

167
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:14,680
the test and they also give you all the

168
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,400
information about determining what to do

169
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:19,960
after your test results so I thought

170
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,560
that was a load of great information

171
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:24,120
especially if you're just starting out

172
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,800
or you need a refresher this comes with

173
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,759
an eye dropper of course the capsules

174
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:31,440
you see me unpack and it comes with the

175
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:34,919
four test vials and these were a good

176
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:38,240
quality plastic and they were large

177
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:40,880
print easy to read so this was a plus

178
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:44,240
for me also by the way guys zero

179
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:47,240
sponsorship for this review this was

180
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,519
just one I picked up off of Amazon I

181
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,760
want to try it but if I'm going to try

182
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:56,399
it I want to give you the information

183
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:59,480
too so I like that the capsules are

184
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,800
colorcoded and you cannot mix up with

185
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:04,959
which one goes in which container the

186
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:07,000
fronts are easy to read and of course

187
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,480
the lid is colorcoded to the little

188
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,120
plastic information on the front the

189
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:15,640
range and the capsules are colorcoded to

190
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,320
that and you get lots of capsules so

191
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:24,120
that you can repeat the test more than

192
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:24,120
once so that is all a plus love

193
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:31,720
that as you can see everything is clear

194
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,360
and organized and easy to use they also

195
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:37,519
send you this little piece of paper that

196
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:39,279
has a ton of information so for flowers

197
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,440
plants shrubs

198
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:44,200
trees everything that you can think of

199
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:48,200
they have it categorized and the pH

200
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:50,000
level that they are most healthy at and

201
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:53,279
there's also an order form to order more

202
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,399
supplies so this is not a oneandone test

203
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,519
guys this morning everything has set

204
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:59,920
overnight and we have some interesting

205
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,720
findings let's look and see what of soil

206
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,519
we have and I'm really nervous about the

207
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,760
outcomes I really want to know what is

208
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:08,640
in the soil so it would be interesting

209
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:11,680
to know what I'm going to need to do to

210
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:16,160
make my soil ready for

211
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:19,160
my well here is my soil type jar and as

212
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,240
you can see it did separate and what

213
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:24,040
does that separation mean what kind of

214
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:26,839
soil makeup do I have what are the

215
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:30,000
things combined that makes my soil what

216
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:33,760
it is we're going to take a look

217
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,360
now according to the science behind this

218
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,600
project sand which is the heaviest of

219
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,959
all particles is going to fall to the

220
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:44,040
bottom the middle

221
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:47,680
layer which is very hard to see but it's

222
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:51,360
right here it's about a/4 of an inch

223
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:55,200
thick that would be the layer of silt

224
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:57,200
clay will be the top layer and if you're

225
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,639
lucky you'll have a lot of organic

226
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,000
matter up here and that's good thing

227
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:02,240
that is very good to have a lot of

228
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,560
organic matter the combination that

229
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:09,320
we're looking for is 40% sand 40% silt

230
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:12,800
and 20%

231
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:15,880
clay as we examine my garden makeup you

232
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:19,000
can see my layer of sand is a high

233
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:21,560
percentage my layer of silt is not and

234
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,680
then we have this layer of clay which is

235
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:27,200
probably more than the 20% we want it to

236
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,800
be so obviously my makeup is not that

237
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,040
perfect 40 4020 recipe

238
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,800
that we are looking for and I know

239
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,200
that's true because we live in an area

240
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:39,519
where the soil is very Sandy and sandy

241
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:42,760
soil drains very rapidly it's a blessing

242
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:45,959
and a curse water does not stand nor

243
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:48,680
does it last for any length of time and

244
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:52,160
what happens is as that clay dries out

245
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:55,079
it forms a crust and then the top of my

246
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,720
soil is very hard it often cracks open

247
00:11:55,079 --> 00:12:01,760
and you know the recipe for making

248
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:06,839
bricks is sand and clay and to bake it

249
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:09,200
in the hot heat so that's what I get and

250
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:12,079
I know we can make this better I have

251
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:15,560
some organic material we can add more

252
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:17,720
organic material into this by taking the

253
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:20,839
things that I've added to the raised bed

254
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:23,839
and that compost and adding it into my

255
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:25,880
big garden soil I believe that we can

256
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:31,160
certainly make this work and get closer

257
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:31,160
to that perfect 40 4020 recipe

258
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:38,320
so here we have our three jars and this

259
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:40,639
is our raised bed soil this is our

260
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,600
regular garden soil and this is the

261
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,600
compost that I had delivered that I

262
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:48,240
would like to add to this now I think

263
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,360
adding this to this because we just

264
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,600
looked at that Garden makeup is really

265
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:55,040
going to help that middle layer that I'm

266
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,800
lacking in now these I didn't separate

267
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,519
because I didn't do that kind of a test

268
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:03,480
I didn't add the soap and I didn't shake

269
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:06,639
them um other than just to mix them

270
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:08,720
so we don't know the makeup of how much

271
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,519
sand and L and and everything well we do

272
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,519
this one because we that's the one we

273
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:15,160
actually measured but for the raised bed

274
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,120
and the compost I really didn't feel

275
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:20,839
that that was important the raised bed

276
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:23,519
is all added soil so I had bag soils

277
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:26,279
that I've purchased and then last year I

278
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,720
added a lot of this and this year I

279
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:30,519
filled my beds with this and I mixed it

280
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,519
really well well so that's why these two

281
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:37,440
look alike because there is a lot of

282
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,920
this in this and you can see though that

283
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,519
there are other things in here because

284
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:44,320
while this is real watery at the top

285
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,199
this does have more heavy materials in

286
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,079
it

287
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:50,199
so let's get into the nutrition content

288
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,759
and see what we

289
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:54,959
have now I'm going to start with the

290
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:58,160
large garden soil first and we're going

291
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,600
to do the pH test first the pH test is

292
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,480
done a little different L we're just

293
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,360
going to put soil in the container just

294
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,399
to that little line and I don't know if

295
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,839
you can see them then there's another

296
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:10,120
little fill line with water and we're

297
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:14,720
going to put in the tablet and it will

298
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:17,920
tell us on the scale where our pH is for

299
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,920
the large garden

300
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:27,240
soil now there is a sweet spot it is

301
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:30,759
right in here and that is where our

302
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:32,880
vegetables like to be so so hopefully

303
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:35,399
our pH is at that

304
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:39,000
level let's take a minute to talk about

305
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:40,360
pH and why we test it what is pH pH is a

306
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,120
measurement of the acidity or the

307
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,480
alkalinity of something in this case

308
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:47,759
we're talking about our

309
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:50,480
soil it is measured on a scale of 0 to

310
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:54,240
14 and seven is neutral as the numbers

311
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:56,880
go down from Seven it is more acid and

312
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,079
if it goes up it is more alkaline and

313
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,560
like I said there is that sweet spot

314
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:04,279
about

315
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:07,320
65.5 6.5 somewhere in there now there

316
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:10,240
are acid loving plants and fruits and

317
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:12,880
there are some who like it more alkaline

318
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:18,240
but for our purposes we want it kind of

319
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:18,240
right there in the middle soil PH

320
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:23,320
also influences soil dwelling

321
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,880
microorganisms and organisms like

322
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:28,519
earthworms that provide benefits for our

323
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,560
plants and help our plants take up other

324
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:32,199
nutrition

325
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:34,639
and you can see here that just in the

326
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:38,680
few seconds that we're testing we're

327
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:41,399
kind of right in that slight acid 6.5

328
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:44,480
perfect spot now we're going to move on

329
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:46,839
and do our garden soil nutrient testing

330
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,800
and we're going to test for the

331
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:51,920
important nutrients found in the soil or

332
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,519
should be found in the soil and we're

333
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:57,079
just going to use the water that we've

334
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,240
already mixed up yesterday and allowed

335
00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:00,959
to sit overnight and we're actually

336
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,759
going to test all three soils but right

337
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,199
now we're going to start with the large

338
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:08,040
guard soil and we're going to do our

339
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:10,920
nitrogen our pot as and our phosphorus

340
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,920
and I'm just going to talk about why we

341
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:15,720
do the test you can see how I'm doing

342
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,759
the test so if you have questions go

343
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,560
ahead and put them in the comment

344
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:21,440
section but we're just going to get in

345
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:24,800
and talk about the importance of these

346
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,839
tests now nitrogen is needed in the

347
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,959
greatest amounts it's what feeds our

348
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:32,920
plants it is the first number on on all

349
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:36,000
fertilizers both organic and

350
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:38,839
synthetic not only is it the most needed

351
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,759
it's the most readily lost from the soil

352
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:42,440
as our plants are planted they're taking

353
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:46,199
up those vitamins and nutrients and

354
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:47,880
they're using it up so it gets used up

355
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:51,279
easily

356
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:54,319
and it's vital it's a the natural part

357
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:57,000
in chlorophyll manufacturer through

358
00:16:54,319 --> 00:16:59,759
photosynthesis it stimulates leafy green

359
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,800
growth and promotes that healthy plant

360
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,360
and encourages seed and fruit

361
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,480
development or produce as you know

362
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:09,360
tomatoes and peppers and all those

363
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:12,799
things so you can tell when you're

364
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:15,839
deficient because you have overall Leaf

365
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:19,280
yellowing and very weak plants and if

366
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:21,600
your plants are weak it limits the

367
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:25,000
ability for them to take up phosphorus

368
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:29,280
which is another poor important part

369
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:32,080
moving on to pot ash or potassium they

370
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,440
call it potass or pot ash because back

371
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,320
in the day they extracted it by putting

372
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,880
ashes in a pot and squeezing them down

373
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,160
and getting the nutrients

374
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:43,080
out potassium or pot ash is one of those

375
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:47,039
essential nutrients for all plant and

376
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:49,799
animal life it synthesizes plant sugars

377
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:52,240
and it helps it uptake food it protects

378
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:54,640
the plants against stream temperatures

379
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,320
fights stress fights diseases protects

380
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,960
against wilting strengthens those roots

381
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:02,799
and the stems it helps them use water

382
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,760
efficiently so without it magnesium

383
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,600
stagnant or would cease to grow and it

384
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:09,720
would be a crucial balance in the

385
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:12,679
alkaline soils so very important that we

386
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:15,760
keep up with our

387
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:18,120
potassium phosphorus is another

388
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,919
important element it's also included

389
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:23,520
it's that second number in all

390
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:26,039
fertilizers and it helps plants uptake

391
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,000
those other nutrients building strong

392
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:29,760
roots and it's easy to see your

393
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,280
deficiencies because your plants are

394
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:35,600
small they may not produce any flowers

395
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,080
and because most things are grown for

396
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,600
their blossoms their blooms their

397
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:42,280
flowers their produce it's very

398
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:46,000
important to replace that

399
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:48,720
phosphorus okay our time is up and our

400
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,039
tests have settled it is now time to

401
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:55,919
determine the makeup in our plants and

402
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:57,919
we have the color along the left side is

403
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:01,520
going to match with the ones along the

404
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:03,159
right and wherever that color is that

405
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,480
looks the most like the one on the other

406
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:11,080
side that is it so it looks like our

407
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:15,080
acid is just about perfect and our pot

408
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:18,159
ash is in the sufficient range it looks

409
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:20,960
like we have plenty of phosphorus in

410
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:23,159
this Garden so it looks like we have a

411
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,640
lot of good nutrition going on now it's

412
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:27,679
really important to document your

413
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,640
findings because you think you might

414
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:32,159
remember but you won't

415
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:34,559
and I'm doing three different tests here

416
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:36,360
so I want to be sure to document them so

417
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:40,000
I can come back later and know exactly

418
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:42,840
what I need to do I really like how well

419
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,120
this kit cleans up because we're going

420
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,320
to do another test we're going to go

421
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:49,120
ahead and wash everything and get it

422
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:51,640
ready for the next test these little

423
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,480
plastic ID cards that are on the front

424
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:56,280
come right out their plastic so they're

425
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:58,360
not going to get ruined when you wash it

426
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,720
when you're ready to dry it just to make

427
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:02,960
sure sure that it is really dry on the

428
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,799
inside you don't want any other residue

429
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:08,640
go ahead and use a Q-tip now we're going

430
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:12,960
to move on and we're going to test the

431
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:15,200
soil from the compost and just see what

432
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,760
kind of nutrients are in the compost

433
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:21,039
that I've already added to the raised

434
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:23,080
beds and that I want to add to the big

435
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,960
Garden we're going to go ahead and start

436
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:27,559
with our pH and again with the pH test

437
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:30,240
you add a little bit of soil in the

438
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:32,600
bottom you're distilled water and you

439
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,520
give it a good Shake uh of course you

440
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:37,240
add your little green tablet in there

441
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:39,200
and that's going to tell you your

442
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,520
overall composure if you have a swimming

443
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,200
pool you probably do these very similar

444
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,520
tests to test your pH and other things

445
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,799
that are in your swimming pool so you

446
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,640
may be used to these kind of tests or

447
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:53,520
you may use them for something else next

448
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:57,440
we're going to test

449
00:20:53,520 --> 00:21:00,919
our acidity in the soil and again we

450
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:04,480
want that sweet spot right around

451
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:07,760
6.5 and we're going to do the pot ash as

452
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:11,000
well and you can increase the pot ash in

453
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:14,120
your soil by adding

454
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,039
wood Ashes to your fire now you want

455
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,960
good wood ashes here you don't want to

456
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:19,679
use treated lumber or anything that

457
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:22,000
you've burnt like that but if you have a

458
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:24,159
fire pit at home and you burn and have

459
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,960
fires or you have a fireplace or a woodb

460
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:30,440
burning stove empty in your ashes in

461
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,559
your garden is a great way to improve

462
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,279
that overall potash and then tillin in

463
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,559
the

464
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:37,279
spring so next we're testing our

465
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:39,960
phosphorus we're going to give that a

466
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:42,480
quick shake and we're going to wait our

467
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:46,640
10 minutes and see what our results

468
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:51,120
are well it looks like we have a lot of

469
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:54,159
alkaline in the soil but it's not too

470
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,720
acid so I think it's going to be okay

471
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,840
there is plenty of nitrogen now remember

472
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,320
this is a compost so it's it's going to

473
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:04,799
be higher in nitrogen and good

474
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:07,600
fertilizer so that is a plus now the pot

475
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:11,919
ash here looks like we're kind of a

476
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:13,799
little below adequate and the phosphorus

477
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:18,039
is the same it's kind of between

478
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:20,520
adequate and uh sufficient so this is

479
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:22,120
the makeup of the compost and adding

480
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:25,320
that to the test results that we've

481
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:27,120
already gotten in the big Garden I think

482
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:29,000
I can safely add this without having to

483
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,480
make any adjustments to any anything I

484
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,880
think we're totally fine to add these

485
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,720
and it won't affect our outcome uh

486
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:38,320
adding a little more nitrogen will be

487
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:40,440
fine and

488
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,360
um yeah I think it's going to be great

489
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,640
to add to the big garden now another

490
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,799
wash and now we're going to test the

491
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,320
raised bed now I'm really excited to get

492
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:51,400
the results of the raised bed because

493
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:55,159
like I said I've controlled the soil I

494
00:22:51,400 --> 00:23:01,679
have added really expensive organic

495
00:22:55,159 --> 00:23:04,520
soils and composts to this bed so I know

496
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:08,120
that it's had a lot of good things go

497
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:11,120
into it but because they are a small

498
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:15,159
area my raised beds are 3T by 5T and I

499
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:17,720
plant them every year again the

500
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:20,600
soil

501
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:22,799
is taken up with those things that we

502
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:25,080
use the most and and so our plants have

503
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,760
already used up a lot of those things

504
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:29,799
but I add in every year so I think I

505
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:31,720
should be really good

506
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:34,960
as so like I said I know things get used

507
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:37,120
up I've put a lot in and I have control

508
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,520
of this way more than the great big

509
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:43,279
Garden so I'm anxious to see where we

510
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:46,200
are and if I should feed this year or

511
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:48,799
what I should do to make sure that I'm

512
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:51,120
getting great cops and I usually do my

513
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:54,960
kitchen Garden where the raised beds are

514
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:58,240
usually provides great produce healthy

515
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,679
plants uh it's a beautiful garden when

516
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,320
it's in full bloom so I think we should

517
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:03,320
be just

518
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:09,440
fine I will have for you in the

519
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:11,720
description box ways that you can amend

520
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:15,919
your soil if your pH is too high or too

521
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:18,039
low if you need more poach if you need

522
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:21,080
more nitrogen I will give some good

523
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:23,960
ideas down in the description box below

524
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:26,760
now I'm ready and look my soil is

525
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:28,799
completely alkaline my veggies are not

526
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:32,080
going to like that at all I'm really

527
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:34,799
glad I have it planted yet nitrogen

528
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,600
really low here isn't it wow I'm really

529
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,640
surpris I have to say I'm really

530
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,880
surprised I thought that this would be

531
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:46,480
really good

532
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:50,279
my pot ash is not too bad and my

533
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:53,440
phosphorus could use a little bit

534
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:55,600
more I'm very surprised I have to say

535
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,320
this garden needs some work now that I'm

536
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,240
done I'm getting everything a really

537
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:02,760
good wash this stores back in this

538
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:06,120
package really easily guys I'm going to

539
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:08,480
give this a festar review I so happy to

540
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:10,840
have this test I loved everything about

541
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,320
it thanks so much for coming along today

542
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:15,200
and learning all about testing soil and

543
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:18,960
learning the makeup and the nutrient

544
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:21,960
value in your soil I sure learned a lot

545
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:24,320
today some things I wasn't surprised but

546
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:26,919
a couple things I was really surprised

547
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:29,520
so I learned the fix for the big garden

548
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:32,120
and this particular make make up is to

549
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,399
add that compost mixture in before I

550
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:37,799
plant it's going to really help this

551
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:40,600
Middle Line the silt and really help

552
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:43,799
keep moisture in my garden and not drain

553
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:46,520
fast because it's Sandy and also it's

554
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:49,679
not going to change any of the nutrients

555
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:52,679
but even though I used that same compost

556
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:55,760
in my raised beds and added a good

557
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:59,480
organic soil in there I was really

558
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:01,760
shocked to see how depleted most of the

559
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:04,080
nutrients were in those raised beds so

560
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:06,399
now I have my work cut out for me I'm

561
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:09,159
going to up that nitrogen content of the

562
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:11,720
raised beds and do a couple other little

563
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:13,880
twists before I plant them and I'm so

564
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,320
glad I learned this because I'm planting

565
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:18,600
I'm planting in just a couple of days

566
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,760
here so I'm really glad I learned this

567
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:23,720
information I hope it inspired you to

568
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:26,600
take that extra step and learn a little

569
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:29,000
bit more about what is in your soil so

570
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:31,679
that your garden will be a success your

571
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,520
plants will grow strong healthy roots

572
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:35,960
and produce an abundance of fruit so

573
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:38,720
