1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,480
one of the most popular ways to

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,720
cultivate mushrooms indoors is in a

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,040
modified plastic bin often referred to

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,639
as a monotube in the mushroom community

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,719
professional growers will inoculate

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,560
their grain spawn using a liquid culture

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,680
solution or colonized agar these are

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,439
more advanced techniques that we're

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,039
going to talk about in a different video

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,800
but since i just grow for fun and as a

11
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,720
hobby i've only ever really worked with

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,640
spore syringes working with a live

13
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,240
mycelium is going to be a more foolproof

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,519
method but that shouldn't intimidate you

15
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,519
from giving this a shot with a spore

16
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,040
syringe as with everything in nature

17
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,040
there's a chance that your spores won't

18
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,120
germinate or successfully colonize the

19
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,559
most crucial part is finding a reliable

20
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,000
spore vendor as well as working with

21
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,920
spawn and substrate that you know is

22
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,440
clean and sterilized

23
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,200
so the spawn of the substrate that i'm

24
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,039
working with is from midwest grow kits

25
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,879
um they do all of the sterilization and

26
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,559
the pasteurization for you so it's

27
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,719
really easy and convenient for me and

28
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,160
i've had great results with their stuff

29
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,559
the spores that i'm working with are

30
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,440
from premiumspores.com but i've also

31
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,960
used spoilerworks.commushrooms.com

32
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,960
and a few different vendors off of

33
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,199
reddit and etsy as well if you need any

34
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,320
recommendations for best chances of

35
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,720
success you are going to need your

36
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,479
inoculation area to be as sterile as

37
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,520
possible there are a few different ways

38
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,360
that you could do this like you could

39
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,000
build a still air box or use the oven

40
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,560
door method i am just using

41
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,200
open air in this video which is not the

42
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,479
best way to do it um but

43
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,040
i

44
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:27,360
locked out all my pets and any people 24

45
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,400
hours before i wanted to start doing

46
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,040
this um i also closed all the vents all

47
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,799
the windows and picked an area that has

48
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,320
just very little foot traffic in there

49
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,720
to begin with

50
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,119
and then before i started i wiped down

51
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,439
all of my working surfaces with 70

52
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,280
isopropyl alcohol about five to ten

53
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,640
minutes beforehand all right so now that

54
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,159
we got all of that out of the way it's

55
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,840
time to get started so get out your

56
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,399
spawn bags and your sports syringe

57
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,159
you're also going to want a mask gloves

58
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,399
and plenty of alcohol wipes as well as a

59
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,240
lighter for a little later on each spawn

60
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,840
bag is sealed with a clear piece of tape

61
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,840
a few inches above the white filter

62
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,840
patch so very carefully you're going to

63
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,920
try to separate the tape from the bottom

64
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,160
of the bag and make a little cut it

65
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,759
should be pretty easy to come undone

66
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,840
after this we might also have to make a

67
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,200
little cut on the other side as well so

68
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,120
after you get it unrolled you want to

69
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,360
try to get a little bit of space between

70
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,800
the grains in the bag so that you don't

71
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,800
pierce through the plastic when you

72
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,560
inoculate next i'm going to wipe down my

73
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,959
gloves with the alcohol wipes before i

74
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,319
start handling my spore syringe

75
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,920
once those are dry you can grab your

76
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,520
spore syringe and shake it around to

77
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,640
break up any clumps that may be in there

78
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,680
and distribute it throughout the

79
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,800
solution

80
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,160
once that looks good you're going to

81
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,160
open up the needle

82
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,000
set that to the side and then twist the

83
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,360
cap off of the syringe and then you're

84
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,319
going to twist the needle on in its

85
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,319
place

86
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,080
grab another alcohol wipe and wipe down

87
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,640
the black injection port on the spawn

88
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,640
bag and let it dry for about 15 seconds

89
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,720
so take the plastic covering off of the

90
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,200
needle grab the side of the spawn bag

91
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,120
for some stability and then insert the

92
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,640
syringe through the injection port

93
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,200
you're going to inoculate three to five

94
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,280
cc's in total per bag you want to try to

95
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,120
disperse the spores evenly across the

96
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,040
top of the bag before moving along to

97
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,879
the sides in the center of the grains

98
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,720
when you do this you're exposing more

99
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,720
grains to the spore solution which will

100
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,159
help prevent any excess moisture from

101
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,239
pooling at the bottom

102
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,480
which in turn will make colonization a

103
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,680
lot easier kind of hard to film and

104
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,200
inoculate simultaneously so i did inject

105
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,120
a little bit more spore solution than i

106
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,599
was supposed to but it's all right

107
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,440
everything is fine before you inoculate

108
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,280
the second bag be sure to sterilize the

109
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,400
needle with the flame for a few seconds

110
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,920
then wipe down the needle with an

111
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,959
alcohol wipe again and follow the same

112
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,959
steps as you did before

113
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,000
if you're using the green jars it's

114
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,200
basically the same process as the bags

115
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,840
but you're going to be using three to

116
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,440
four cc's of spore solution instead

117
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,040
the same applies to the jars just make

118
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,319
sure to disperse the spore solution

119
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,480
throughout the top of the greens before

120
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,680
you move along to the sides

121
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,599
so you're going to need to incubate

122
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,840
these in a warm area for about four to

123
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,400
six weeks ideal temperatures to prevent

124
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,799
any contamination would be between 74

125
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,799
and 78 degrees fahrenheit i've always

126
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,200
stored them in a sealed container like

127
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,879
it's just a random plastic bin but

128
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,400
you can always store them just on a

129
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:12,000
shelf maybe above the fridge or

130
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,159
in a closet

131
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,120
just any area that's undisturbed and

132
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,560
warm

133
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,239
if you are keeping them in a sealed

134
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,560
container you can maintain the co2

135
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,600
levels by opening up the lid every week

136
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,880
or so

137
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,520
and here's a little look at my grain

138
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,880
spawn over a course of five weeks

139
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,199
here's a classic example of

140
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,360
contamination in a spawn bag right away

141
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,199
you can notice the bright discoloration

142
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,759
as well as the difference in texture it

143
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,840
looks more chalky and almost dusty like

144
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,919
this is exactly why sterile environment

145
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,880
is so important i was just inoculating

146
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,720
these bags in an open air large room

147
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,520
and i forgot to close the vent that day

148
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,040
so

149
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,880
oopsies

150
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,639
all right so that wraps up part one stay

151
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,479
tuned for part two which is coming soon

152
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,680
and also be sure to like and subscribe

153
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,360
as well as comment on some other

154
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,759
mushroom teams you'd like me to cover

155
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,759
thanks for watching
