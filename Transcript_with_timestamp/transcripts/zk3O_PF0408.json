  "text": "buster's top ram so he's let all the boys out finn bar and my three ram lambs hello it's a beautiful sunny day i'm setting up the electric fence for the horses so they're gonna have this field i'm gonna bail graze them through this field through the winter you can see the electric fence there so i'm gonna let them through gate one of my primitive gates that are right there hey alfie you got left behind yeah everybody else is gone for arthritic alfie except he has a good life here his shoulders are arthritic so he walks with a funny gait now hey you alfie brindle leaving me you good boy he's an old man now all your buddies have gone up over the hill yeah i know you're gonna go join them you've chosen a lovely sunny spot cozy and warm now to let the horses through who are anticipating it you can see they're waiting they've figured out i'm gonna be letting them through here this little gate you can see there's the owl box up in the oak tree one of them okay girls and boy i'm gonna let you out okay now it's very slippy oh gosh i don't want to fall underneath galloping horse's hooves they're not going far because they only they can only graze a bit of grass at a time and that makes it last through the winter so they're already coming back so they've got a good length of grazing they're annoyed that they don't have as far to gallop maya come here come on you two come on good girls come on there's the rams in the same field but they get to free range because the horses are heavier beasts so we'll cut up the soil so that's why they're only given sections snorting good girl come on leave it leave it leave it good girl maya leave it you're so thrilled with the new place to graze cutting it all up now ladies inca no leave them be so they'll only get a section at a time just so they don't tear the whole field up piece by piece also having the horses out gives the dug dung beetles winter feeding oh she's very frustrated she didn't get more inca leave it come back here come here you bold pup come on come here you're bold no lee inca leave them good girl come on look at that gala rearing definitely frustrated they can't get more of a gallop in but i also don't want them to burst their lungs because they haven't had the space for a real gallop and a horse can burst their lungs if they suddenly are given too much space when they've been confined for so long in small spaces the weather's been miserable so it's really been really really mucky out which is why they've been confined in small spaces come down to your side in a minute okay big fella this is one of my more primitive homemade gates we're above the large trees and the line of beech trees this is the top field or what we call the wind charger field because there used to be a wind charger right there that's how my mother grew up with electricity and it used to flicker if the wind was not consistent so they still had gas lights or kerosene lights so here's the first bale for the horses and i'm gonna let them through and hopefully they've had a little bit of a gallop hopefully they won't do a huge secondary gallop um actually no you know what i'm gonna wait till later today to let them down to this section no no i'm going to let them through now i'm going to let them through now because where they're grazing now will over the winter months will become one of the muckiest areas so may as well let them into this green there's plenty of grass for them to eat in amongst the leaves and then out there around the bale so when the grass is gone they graze the bale then i put another bale and then that next section and then when that's gone i put another bale here then there then there and the next section there there there and that's how so that this end of the field will be growing grass again and will be green by the time the horses are in this section so that's a form of bale grazing it makes it so the dung beetles have food through the winter those that are flying about the winter dung beetles as sally anne mentioned there are and it also keeps the horses outside and healthy and fed so yeah i'm gonna let the horses through now come on come on [Music] inca maya no come on inca leave it maya oh my lips are so cold and dry they can't whistle at a girl good girl good maya clever pup never yes you clever girl so that's the beginning of winter bale grazing for the horses and how they help the farm they'll manure that area the hay will fertilize the area and seed the area and i'll throw seed out there as well to add to the diversity and they're lovely and calm which is good so no lungs will get blown out that's the scary thing with horses is if they've been confined to barracks due to the really mucky wet weather and you let them out into a big space they could gallop for glee and burst their lungs or burst along so it's always better to let them out slowly yep here we go no she's not going to jump the fence maybe i spoke too soon maya maya no maya good girl well settle down no burst lungs today",
