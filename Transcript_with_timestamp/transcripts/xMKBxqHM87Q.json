for more than half of america's cane sugar is produced and it looks like we have enough folks on now so let's go ahead and get started again if you're just joining my name is rocio ortega and i'm pro-publica's events associate welcome to today's session how one country sought to combat the harm of burning sugarcane thanks to mckinsey and company for their support of today's event this event is being held in partnership with the palm beach post and wlrn today we'll be testing out a couple new exciting features for accessibility i'll share some of the notes that i shared at the start of the session closed captioning of the program is available and can be enabled by clicking on the closed caption option on the bar towards the bottom of your screen this program is also being broadcasted in

you don't miss any of the conversation you should either select english or portuguese and be sure the option is not set to off for those new to us propublica is a non-profit newsroom dedicated to investigative journalism last year reporters at the palm beach post and propublica investigated the impact of sugar cane boring in florida the harvesting practice helps reduce more than half of america's cane sugar but it sends smoke and ash into largely low-income communities of color in the state's heartland in their reporting the journalists learned that other countries have found ways to harvest their crops without those burns they traveled to brazil the world's largest producer of sugarcane to learn how and why they switched to another method i'd now like to invite our panelists to join us on screen thank you so much for being here today dr christopher holmes is an associate professor of meteorology at florida state university his research examines the global cycles of air pollutants and greenhouse gases and the interactions both with climate change is a technical advisor in the presidency of state of sao paulo environmental agency his work includes analyzing environmental licenses and permits as well as developing policies and procedures on pollution prevention and control permits dr elena kibero is a professor of environmental health at university of south paolo her work focuses on the subjects of environmental health health geography and air pollution dr rafaela josetto is a scientific researcher at agronomic institute of campinas she did a post doctorate at the university of florida in belle glade where she worked with crop options for bioenergy her work focuses on soil fertility and fertilization as well as use of waste in the cultivation of sugarcane our moderators today are propublica video journalist nadia sussman and seattle times reporter lulu ramadan as an additional note the session is being recorded and a link to the video will be emailed to everyone who registered thank you all so much again for being here today and i hope you enjoy the conversation i'll let nadine lulu take it from here thank you so much racio we are so pleased to welcome this panel of experts including two that you saw in the video and we wanted to start off by talking a bit about what happened in brazil health concerns were one of the factors that led lawmakers to phase out the practice of burning before harvesting so this first question is for dotora elena i think your camera is still turned off dr elena are you saying here i cannot start my video because you close at me ah well let's see if we can work this out oh there you are thank you so much for joining us dr helen sorry about that um so dr elena giber you studied the health effects of sugarcane burning in several cities in sao paulo state what were your major findings especially with regard to disease hospitalizations and mortality well i had started studying air pollution effects on health in the city of sao paulo in the late 80s but then around 2000 the year 2000 i started to study the effects of biomass fire especially because of the great expansion of sugarcane plantation in the state of sao paulo due to the development of the flex fuel engine for cars at that time mainly small cities had this problem of receiving the effects of the burning of sugarcane and so we selected some municipalities in the state of sao paulo the first one was the spirit center the turvo in the west part of the state and we started mainly direct effects because sugarcane burning can have also indirect health effects as climate change uh caused by greenhouse greenhouse gases in car accidents due to the reduced visibility but our studies focus on direct effects and mainly respiratory diseases i also advise that around eight dissertations and teases on the team on this team of and i had two large projects financed by the ministry of health of brazil and minister of science education the first one was undertaken in 2004 and 2005 in a municipality where 100 percent of sugarcane plantations were still burned in spite of the law in 2002 because the plantations were not adapted to receive the machinery at that time we met we installed air pollution monitoring equipment at the school at the city school and we study uh air pollution during hazard harvest time and non-harvest time and we also study respiratory symptoms in children from 10 to 13 years old and our findings indicated that in spite of the the level of pollutants they were not over what brazilian legislation allowed at that time now brazilian legislation is more strict but at that time it was permitted the prevalence of respiratory symptoms in children was very high among 28 symptoms that we studied 22 of them were higher than we had found in this metropolitan regions of sao paulo and those symptoms were mainly cough most days cough without cold wheezing bronchitis asthma ear infections and allergies those neighborhoods were usually low-income neighborhoods where population lived in simple houses without much protection for air pollution and also sugarcane harvest occurs in winter where you have the problem of more virus because of the cold that starts and also temperature inversions which difficult turns it difficult to dispersion of air pollution after that first studies we undertook other studies in araraquara which is the north part of the state and we studied children uh until four years old from zero to four years old and old people uh 65 years old and older and we studied using a job processing techniques geographical information systems with data on sugarcane area number of fires by satellite image or by set asb data which register the fires hospital admissions by age and by by classification of disease and also the social uh data on the population affected and and we found that in most of the studies that there was an association with sugar cane fires and respiratory symptoms and a hospital admiss higher levels of hospital admission during sugarcane harvest and especially in uh during or a few days after the fires were allowed by ceteste which allowed agriculture to to put the fire on sugarcane before harvesting the other finding was that the population was affected was mainly low-income population which had more difficulties in getting to a basic health system so they save more days before getting to the hospital and they would get a worse health situation uh and the problem was also worse for children and for old people that were those were the main findings but uh since those projects they lasted for a while we could see that after 2008 which was five years after the law when part of the the sugarcane plantation could not be burnt anymore and from then on there was a reduction in the number of fires in the state of sao paulo and there was also reduction in the admissions of respiratory due to respiratory diseases in the population we could see that year by year this reduction so it was important to see uh how it happened uh i told about arara kwara but we started in presidential prudenti region and we study in the northwest region of the state where 25 municipalities had large areas in sugar cane and in all those areas we noticed this reduction in fires and reduction in respiratory this is admission in hospitals with using data from soos the brazilian unified health system uh we also at inara aquari we had studied uh airborne polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to see the the cancer the risk of cancer due to the pollutants of the sugarcane uh fires and we identified that there was a tolerable tolerable tolerable risk of cancer in the areas where sugarcane was burned and but this risk also uh decreases along the time the data with the the the when we measure pollutant in 2002 was higher than in 2010 so in the meantime the law brought benefits for the population thank you so much that was very helpful similar to what you've just described dr elena residents in florida's gleeds region have raised concerns about negative health impacts from cane burning that was the driving factor behind the lawsuit that was referenced in the documentary and now that lawsuit was recently dropped at the agreement of all parties and the major sugar companies in the region say that the air is good and meets federal clean air standards but as we've reported the epa is currently considering whether those clean air standards are adequate to protect public health uh now dr christopher holmes thank you for being here your research examines the global cycles of air pollutants and greenhouse gases what kinds of pollution does sugar cane burning produce in florida and what are some of the challenges in tracking it my research group has spent some time looking at data collected from surface monitoring sites in south florida and also from satellites which orbit the earth and observe south florida as well as the rest of the world and the first thing we looked at was uh respirable uh particulate matter which is also called pm 2.5 and this particulate matter can reach deep into the lungs and cause a variety of health problems there are dozens of monitoring stations in florida because it's well known that pm 2.5 causes disease and we looked particularly at several sites that were close to the sugar cane fires and at two sites near the sugar cane fires we found that the concentrations of this pm 2.5 were higher during the harvest burn season than they were in the rest of the year and this was unlike any other sites in south florida showing that that the concentrations were higher closer to the fires this corroborated what other studies have found in the past some researchers at florida international university measured concentrations of uh pahs which uh dr ribeiro just discussed and uh those were uh characteristic of emissions from burning vegetation and those were many times higher in the uh sugarcane burning region than elsewhere in south florida it's now established from many other studies that these small particles and pahs cause quite a few different health impacts and dr ribeiro listed several of them but i would emphasize that they are associated with cases of asthma bronchitis emphysema other respiratory infections heart disease heart attacks lung cancer obviously this list goes on but also things like um premature birth of and low birth weight of of babies um several of these can be fatal and um using these past studies in other regions that relate the concentrations of particulate matter to uh mortality and health outcomes we estimate that there's probably about one to six deaths per year uh as a result of the sugarcane burning emissions in south florida for the scale of these emissions i think it's interesting to compare them to something like motor vehicle emissions from the area of sugar cane that's burned each year we think there's about 5 000 tons of particulate matter produced in these fires and that's pretty close to the emissions from all of the motor vehicles across the state of florida but the sugar cane fires of course unlike the vehicles are tightly concentrated in just one small part of the state surrounding a few different communities thank you so much that was really illuminating environmental concerns also played an important role in the decision in sao paulo state to transition away from burning and to harvesting raw cane nearly all the cane in the state in sao paulo is now harvested without burning so uh dr rafael joseto what were the agricultural challenges and the benefits of switching to raw cane in brazil can you tell us what that period of learning and adaptation was like opportunity the first challenge was that we have no machinery to harvest sugar cane especially the moment the government decided that we had to change things we have no machinery for this reason we have decided to create a timeline and use a 10-year period to help us adapt to the law and while we were purchasing that machinery we have learned how to do the work in the new system first we just thought that we would no longer hire people and just use the machines so we we were faced with new solutions and lots of learning so the first challenge was machinery and the second was hiring people because we knew that we would no longer hire so many people because the machines were there luckily the sugarcane sector was expanding and we have hired people to do work in other areas with sugarcane expansion later on the next challenge was that sugarcane productivity lowered because raw cane has lower productivity than burnt cane later on we understood that the machine would stamp on the cane or even the machine would cut some part of the plant so we have improved quality of the machinery in the process also we have resorted to gps and we no longer have the machinery go on top of the sugar cane line later on we had other other challenges linked to pests the only advantage of burning is that burning kills off pests and as time goes by the past are faced with their uh natural killers basically we need to be patient we need to learn and try to calibrate the system also we have developed some pesticides that we used in the beginning and nowadays we are phasing out the use of pesticides we currently we only use pesticides where we have problems with certain pests also we have changed some plants that were harmful to sugar cane we have developed new techniques to fight those plants also we have changed fertilization because the straw is really nurturing for the soil we need to be careful when adapting and using new types of fertilizers we've learned so much over the first 10 years and i dare say that now the system is still a work in progress we're still improving our techniques we're still using new machines i've told you about the challenges but now i'll tell you about the benefits the benefits are we have more protection for the soil we have better soil humidity now we have better soil conservation and better physical qualities for the soil as well as biological life for the soil a large number of micro organisms have developed because of the straw and all of this has brought more organic material and more life to the soil and i can tell you that the biggest advantage is to raise environmental awareness in the sugar industry i think that in brazil there's nobody who thinks that sugarcane burning is the best technique nobody agrees with that anymore our grown agronomic engineers they have shown us how good it is to use the new techniques and whenever we're faced with challenges they they help us see that the new method is much better thank you thank you for listening to me thank you that was really informative um so brazil's sugar companies seem to have embraced that transition to not burning as you mentioned throughout the course of our reporting florida sugar companies have denied that pre-harvest burns have a significant impact on air quality or public health now prior to this event propublica asked florida crystals and u.s sugar the largest sugar producers in the region for their perspectives on brazil and alternative harvesting methods florida crystals did not respond and us sugar provided a statement but it did not address our questions the company said u.s sugar proudly stands behind the safety and integrity of its farming and processing practices in addition the men and women of u.s sugar are also employee owners of our company with jobs that meet the world's highest standards for worker safety environmental stewardship sustainability and technological innovation antonio queros this question is for you you work with the state environmental agency in sao paulo that regulates agricultural burning in brazil what was the reaction of the industry when regulators first announced that they were going to end sugarcane burning and how did that change over time the question is that sugarcane industry was having a lot of claims of the population nearby due to the all the health problems in this city so the problem due to the burning of the sugarcane leaves so it was not a new question satisby is the state company in charge of control pollution sources of course a big burning is a pollution source so when satellite has a question of the justice of the population about a large burning causing very big problems so the company needs to take action and please do not burn now because we have a very low umt in air we have a very low content of humanity below 20 percent you cannot burn now justice also start actions against these farmers just asking you cannot burn it you are causing a big health problem so it was not a new question to these companies when in 2002 we got a state law um just trying to ban the fires this law was as raphaela said really well done because it gives to the companies time to make these adoptions we got a period of time of 20 years to burn the fire and the places where harvest could be made by mike mcqueen and 30 years where the harvest should be manual due to the inflammation of the land so companies start to burn the fire and in the beginning it was a big mess because we were working on paper just try to imagine large companies bringing maps on paper saying fear is the 20 of my area that i'm not going to burn this year it was almost impossible to to monetize to give to communicate and the company developed uh a way to make everything by the internet and a system that we got all the maps of the the farms and the farmer just put this is the area the 20 of the era that i am not going to burn in this five first years of the law so what happened was that when the companies start having this machinery they start improving this mechanical harvesting and just talk with the environmental agency and talk hey we are expected to end this burning in uh 2020. let's see what if i just make it earlier so the the companies just talked with the agency and we got a environmental protocol to anticipate the end of burning because when they start to buy this this machinery when they start just you need you need to to make big changes in the way you plant if you are going to use machinery harvesting you cannot have level curves you need to make everything flat so the machinery machinery can pass through the cane just making the harvest a better way so why do not accelerate this process and also these companies just uh and the problem that they had with the municipalities nearby and the population always claiming about this fires in the burning especially in the dry season in brazil that is our winter so the sugarcane sector did not try not to to to ban the files they just had to have their time to make this the patient and it was really a success meanwhile in one of the regimes of the state in jawa there was a action as this election and it went to the supreme court of brazil that said that it was forbidden to burn in all that region right but a lot before the date that the law stipulated so it was very important for the sector to say hey wait a little i am doing my job i am banning gradually and i'm making it enough in a way that i can maintain my economic creativity and we will have the same result in 2017 for us the last year that we got big fires and the bigger farms today we have only very very very little burning in the the properties where it's impossible to make the mechanical harvest so it was a process it was not very hard it took a lot of work but it is done yeah well yes you mentioned a lot of work and um in the united states similarly we often have conversations about that balance between regulation and the economy and in florida many people are concerned about the economic impact of making that harvesting transition how did you as a state regulator evaluate that dynamic in brazil balancing health and safety with jobs let's see it in two ways in two different ways well you have an industry and then you buy a very very new machinery and you need to dismiss 200 employees oh i'm so sad but i importantly you lose your job all right what's the problem no okay why because i just need to have my profit okay it's a way to see it if i say to you well now you have a new regulation i need you to have a better pollution air pollution control and you say whoa but i will need to to to spend a lot of money to do it yes but it's for the help of everybody so i'd like to understand why one can just sneeze people in name of a better profit and one cannot have a less profit in behalf of all the population and it's not a new problem you see here in brazil we have a licensing process that has a previous license an installation license and operation license so the first one says well what you want to do is possible in this place the second one says well you can build your factory you can build your plan and the third one well start operating but you need to renew your operation license in three five years or two years it depends upon how dangerous is your your activity for an environment well here in brazil there is no such a thing like a acquired right to pollute because when you come to renew your life your operation licensee i can say to you well you know your air pollution controls are not so good in this last three years we have another technology much better and i want you to improve your your control your your air pollution control so the review of the operation license can ask for the the the industry to buy different operations to buy new equipments and to attend to a high street standards because in brazilian constitution they it's granted to all brazilians the right to a healthy environment so i need to grant it that's my that's why my duty as a government agency and health is one of the most important things that we must look when we are licensing an activity so of course in some activities you will have some sound pollution some water pollution some air pollution but you cannot compare any pollution from an industrial activity to a burning of hundreds and hundreds of thousands of acres of sugarcane in the free space so for us it's really a question of a health environmental event thank you so much antonio quiroz in florida uh the agency so somewhat analogous to the agency that you work for but in florida the agency that regulates sugar harvesting practices is the state department of agriculture and consumer services we invited florida's agricultural commissioner nikki freed and her staff to participate in the panel today they declined saying they were short staffed in the middle of a legislative session in the past commissioner freed has says she believes it's possible for quote unquote green harvesting or the harvesting of raw unburnt sugarcane to be feasible in florida but they still need to examine quote pest and plant diseases worker safety florida's ecosystem and soil composition and industrial demand for green harvesting dr rafaela joseto you spent a year working in florida's glades region and given these concerns pests worker safety the soil etc do you think a transition to harvesting raw unburnt cane would be possible in florida i know agronomists in florida i think they are as good or even better than brazilian professionals and if brazilians have managed to overcome the technical problems i'm sure american agronomic engineers are also going to make it i think that you have to start you don't need to start with 100 of the areas you could start with 20 of the areas you could um you know learn from the process maybe in five six years ten years then you overcome the burning and not having problems with past or infestation you need to take action now you need to take action and do you work little by little and you're going to overcome the challenges as they come and you can learn from us here in brazil we know that issues are regionals but you know we offer a case study for florida in any way i think that it's important to take the first step and then you tackle the problems the problems are not that hard because the hardest problems are offering people work and we know that in the u.s you have machine harvesting already so what's the problem of stop burning maybe the machinery is going to be slower to do the harvesting you know it's going to take some hours more to harvest raw cane than it would with burnt cane there will be some past but it's something temporary that you can overcome in some years natural natural enemies are gonna come up but i think that you have to get started florida can lead the way and show people clean techniques and eco-friendly practices here in brazil one thing that was really good is that the plants are proud of saying they have modern ecologic practices that they do socially responsible work environmentally right work and they use this to showcase their success it's so good that the largest industries the largest plants in brazil they have embraced it and they like to show they protect nature thank you so much for that perspective dr rafaela that was really insightful we are coming up on the 20th anniversary of sao paulo's original law to phase out the burns meanwhile in the u.s we've never had any laws banning sugarcane burning lawmakers have taken an interest in air quality however last month three u.s representatives introduced a bill that would create a pilot program for air monitoring and low-income communities and communities of color among the sponsors of the bill is florida representative kathy castor in florida's sugar growing region there is only one government-run air monitor dr holmes as an expert in air monitoring and modeling you've said that the government should take a closer look at the air in florida's sugar growing region what should additional government monitoring look like given the short duration of those burns and what might that monitoring tell us right so in urban areas across the us uh we have typically an urban area will have multiple monitors and that allows you to map out the concentrations of particulate matter and other pollutants in various neighborhoods the area of florida where sugarcane is burned has multiple different communities and the one official monitor there is not in the center of any of those communities um and so i think if you want to know what the concentrations of these pollutants are obviously you want to have a measurement in in the center of of each of the communities or somewhere within the the general population area um there is a rising availability of low-cost sensors which i know the pro-publica worked on deploying several of those in in the area and those are a tool that can be used to supplement uh the regulatory monitors they aren't as accurate but they um our they are um or they can be reliable so uh they have to be checked carefully but but they can be used for mapping things out and uh that's being used routinely in in a variety of other states and and cities to map out air pollution on fine spatial scales we also use satellites because satellites are peering down from space all the time and what we've seen from space uh re reinforces what we saw from just the the couple of monitors that are in the in the area where sugar cane is burned uh the thing that i mentioned earlier was that the concentrations of particulate matter are higher at the two sites that are near the sugar cane fires and the satellites further showed that the area of that elevated particulate matter coincides very closely with the boundaries of the sugarcane fields so the satellites are providing spatial information uh that we can't get from current sensors on the ground but it really does again support the conclusion that there is a source of particulate matter in the sugarcane burning region thank you so much for that i'm not in lulu for beginning to take us through that discussion um we're now going to turn it over to our audience q a but before doing that i'd like to just share a quick link to our event survey in the chat box that i am dropping in now we really appreciate your feedback again if you'd like to ask a question click that q a icon at the bottom of your screen to submit it to us we already have a few in so i'm going to go ahead and pass it back to nada to deliver that first question thank you so much to all of our panelists thank you racio and thanks to everybody who asked questions um so i'm going to start with one it's a bit of a double question is the reluctance of the florida sugar industry to invest in machinery thus costing them money a part of the problem and did the price of brazil's sugar increase after the burns stopped and so for the first question about the machinery i just want to say that florida's sugar is already harvested by machine so in brazil you saw the manual cutters in the video that practice has been replaced by machine cutting in florida already antonio queras maybe you can answer the question about the price of brazil's sugar and if it went up after the burns stopped i i don't know if if you have a rise in the price with the stop of the bernies but the truth is that the industry sugarcane industry in brazil look forward a green protocol just to be able to sell to markets where these worries with environmental subjects were really important just to close man just to to open markets and not to close down so when we talk about the green protocol that industry just assigned with the environmental uh departments of sao paulo state this brought a very a very good marketing for these companies so these companies could say i am a green company i have my sugar without burning i have my sugar in a very very strict law observance so that was the uh the improvement in the to the company profile i don't know exactly about the the compartment of the prices but i i heard it of many of these big planters that they say no i want to have a green seal on my sugar because europe wants it because all the markets won't see i want to be a green product and it's a good way thank you and thank you to all of the attendees for the excellent questions um we got one here for you dr holmes um uh the attendee asks uh any time that health outcomes and the relationship between burning and negative health uh health outcomes are mentioned uh they're told that the data does not support a negative health outcome you mentioned this when you were speaking earlier can you speak a little bit more about that link between mortality and morbidity and burning cycles right we know from lots of studies in urban areas across especially in the us but also in europe and many other countries that um inhaling particulate matter is harmful to your health and dr rivero has done some of those studies and she spoke directly about that you can think of this as analogous to smoking cigarettes which are also sources of um particles and um tobacco is of course a plant and so there's some not a not a tight analogy but there's some analogy to burning it to uh inhaling smoke from a cigarette which is well known to be uh toxic and um inhaling smoke from other burning vegetation whether that be a wildfire or an agricultural fire and so we know that the injuries that come from that depend on how much of that smoke you burn we have now established or the scientific community has now established that that the there are harmful effects of burning excuse me of inhaling particle particulate matter down to very low concentrations at least concentrations of five micrograms per cubic meter and uh i bring up that specific number because the the way that air quality is generally regulated in the us is based on a threshold system called the national ambient air quality standards and um that's set by the us epa and they pick a threshold above which uh there are consequences and below which um there there are not and there's a lot of um factors that go into setting those standards but the current standard is that um the air quality should have concentrations of 12 micrograms per cubic meter or less of pm 2.5 so the scientific literature shows that there are harmful effects of inhaling particulate matter at concentrations that are below what the ambient air quality standards allow so when i have said that you know we expect that there are uh impacts of inhaling smoke from sugar cane and from other burning sources even though the concentrations in the sugarcane burning region are indeed below 12 micrograms per cubic meter we still do effect expect that there are going to be um uh health impacts from those thank you and and just to throw that question to dr hibero as well um you mentioned that that threshold for what's healthy and what's allowed under the law in brazil also changed over the course of the discussions so what does that look like what did that transition look like when research and new information emerged in brazil well brazil now is in the process of adopting world health organization thresholds which is slower a little lower than the american apa standards and uh but we we have a time like we did for the sugarcane harvesting in and using fire we have a period of adaptation for the cities especially and for car engines to adapt to the new standards the state of sao paulo has a progressive [Music] process with intermediate phase and phase intermediate phase one two and three until we get to the world health organization uh thresholds for controlling air pollution [Music] but but as i said it's not only the the pollution at the ground level it's also the greenhouse gases that the burning produces and this is not being discussed the forest fires in the amazon are so much discussed and around the world and and why a volunteer fire like that is not discussed because it produces methane co2 seo and ozone which are greenhouse gases and this may affect uh climate and increased temperatures around the world so i i guess we we need to have a more encompassing discussion regarding the indirect effects also dr elena hibero thank you so much for that um so you know in the short time we have we probably won't get to the fully encompassing discussion that you're talking about but it's definitely something we should continue to discuss in the future we have a question that i think would be good for dr rafael joseto have the transformation processes away from burning been published in english and is it available so what resources are out there based on the experience of brazilian agronomists engineers and others who work in the sugar cane industry about transitioning from using prescribed burns to having a no burning harvest yes most of um scholar work is written in portuguese but we have plenty of material in english too especially as regards to straw you know nutrient cycles based on straw the changes in terms of fertilization all of those agronomic processes are documented in technical journals you know if you google information lots of um scholar work is going to show up for you we have plenty of scientific material on that thank you um there are a couple questions here about employment and some of the repercussions of making that transition in brazil um perhaps this question is best for you antonio queras um what happened what was the feedback like from those who potentially lost jobs because of that transition and what did the employment trends look like overall with the sugar industry when they made that transition away from burning as i said it was a slow transition so we have something like 15 years before the total ban of big fires in sao paulo state and this job of cutting raw con the the sugar cane it was not a good job right people came from northeast brazil the poorest region in brazil came to sao paulo state and to the southwest just to cut sugarcane and then can go back to northeast brazil this job requires people to stay in a very reclined position and making this this sharp too to cut the sugar cane and it was expected from one person to cut something like eight or ten tons of can per per day not a good job not a healthy job so this transition was not of a good job to a no job it was from a a a not so good job a job that only provides you some money as uh as rafaela said some of these people were employed in sugarcane industry from this this and this 2002 to 2007. we got a big growth of sugarcane industry in sao paulo state so we got sugarcane uh going over the west of the state so some of these people went to these activities and the others were just absorbed by the market all right it was the question of do it in uh in the time to to give time for people to find jobs but it's completely different from the situation you have in florida you do not have people you are going to lose no jobs if you stop burning sugarcane then you will have only the good part you will have the aeronautical benefits that rafaela said and we will you will not have this health risks that elena said so i i see no problem in this in this question of jobs for florida right i would if you if you permit me i i looked in the chat and i saw a question about uh somebody asked uh if uh there is in our constitution the protection of the help of the people yes this we have a very very large constitution and then his 220 225 article we have this protection of environment if you allow me i will read it to you everyone has the right to an ecological balanced environmental a good for common use by the people and essential to a healthy quality of life imposing on the public power and the community the dirty to defend and preserve it for the present and to true generations so this is a constitutional command right environment is a good of common use and we need to protect and we need to grant a health environment so article two to of our constitution thank you so much antonia i saw that there was a question have there been health studies in florida and how large is the exposed population so i wanted to ask dr christopher holmes about that and then i wanted to follow up afterwards for some of our brazilian panelists to learn a little bit more about how their studies came about so let's start with dr holmes please so my research group has done some of that and we have um articles that are in peer review at a journal so i uh yes the studies have been done but they haven't been published yet um so i will be able to share more about that hopefully soon um in terms of the population that's exposed the most heavily exposed population are the people that live in the in the cities of mel glade and clewiston and pahokee and uh i believe there are about 40 000 people that altogether live in those communities um the smoke however is not confined to those communities and it does drift both east and and west and so um we do expect that even though the concentrations of smoke are low over the coastal cities and uh further to the west into uh glades in hendry county we do expect that there would be some health impacts in those regions and um i noticed reading through the questions that you know some people are interested in having more specific details and um i i expect that within the next uh few weeks i would be able to share some figures that that would address some of those uh questions that i'm noticing in the chat thank you so much dr holmes and dr helena gibero you mentioned this a little bit but you did a number of studies related to sugarcane burning and health effects specifically and i think you had mentioned that some uh had done in partnership with or funded by government agencies so i just wanted to ask at the state level or the federal level to what extent is this something that government is trying to pursue as a research matter in brazil well i had mainly funding from federal agencies like the the ministry of health has a health surveillance secretary with it has a secretary it's called vigiar the air surveillance and in this program uh it has it open beads for studies regarding air quality and i enter in one of those bids for financing part of the study other parts of this area were financed by cnp which is the research brazilian institute which belongs to the ministry of technology of brazil and some of the the students the phd or massage students they got financing from the ministry of education campus or from fapezp which is the state agency but during this time we have partnership with cetasb sometimes which allow gave us the data or with even the the sugar industry which allowed us to put a monitoring equipment in in the sugarcane plantations and we had all the freedom to publish the results and one thing i wanted to mention is regarding the labor we had one of our research we interviewed la uh workers from the sugarcane plantation because there are many small towns in the state of sao paulo that have like a rural population that work in sugar cane plantations and and we we did study in one of these villages and we interviewed them and and they were at the same time relieved that the the uh manual harvest and was finishing because that was a very stressful labor but they were anxious about finding new jobs and what we we found was that the unions of sugarcane growers provided courses for them at night on weekends they could learn to use computers or they could learn agriculture practices so they were prepared for other jobs when they were expecting to lose their jobs and many of them got employed as antonio said in sugarcane plantations in other parts of the state for planting sugarcane or uh they went to soybean plantations or to work in uh tree planting you know reforestation areas in the state of sao paulo and those who came from the northeast of brazil i guess they stayed there because tourism was developed during those years also in the northeast so it was easier to find jobs in the northeast area of the country so we don't see in the the cities of the state of sao paulo a process of impoverishment because of lack of jobs of formation of favelas or things like that on the contrary we we see that there is a increased dynamism in those cities middle-sized cities that have suggest meals around them thank you thank you so much for that um so we have one last question we'll try to keep it brief if you can um but several questions have been posed that mention the um political donations and sort of the power of the sugar industry and their opposition to shifting away from burning and perhaps antonio you can speak to this but was there a large-scale um resistance to cain burning being phased out in brazil and how did you counteract any difficulties that you did that you were confronted with and if you could keep that short we're closing out here but there was no such resistance just no resistance at all because industry had time to do it it was something that everybody knows it should have an end everybody was seeing the problem you you cannot have an idea of the area what sugar came in sao paulo state we're talking about a large a really large area so when you were traveling in the countryside in june or may it was possible for you to just drive in a cloud of smoke in the road it was a big problem apart is everywhere you went in the countryside you could see the ashes in the house in the swimming pools in the gardens in the whole city and everybody could think well these ashes that are in the ground maybe part of them are in my lungs too it was so obvious that this was not a good thing to be done that there was no opposition the question was other how do you make a good monitoring on meat how can i prove that this sugar cane that burnt was not born by my fault someone just threw a cigarette from the car and it start burning and you see this is a sugar cane planted in a place able to receive the harvest the mechanical harvest for me it's not good that it burns now i do not have equipment to wash this this stalks before milling them so this was these were the big problems the the planters said well you are charging me with a penalty because i i burned in a place that i was not authorized to burn but it was not me i could say this was the biggest problem so we started a question of this this uh this fact my sugarcane burnt but it was not me that was the biggest problem we have also we got some problems as to how each one give us to the agency the place as well here is my twenty percent i will not burn here are my thirty percent here my fifty percent how we make it in the maps it was a little hard to do but it went but never we had an opposition i want to to continue burning we have no judicial plane i want to to burn because i have the right to burn it was almost impossible for one to win a civil erection with this but we have no head no so we got no opposition it was a case of success all this is i believe some power statement must be very proud uh so the agency as the the sugarcane sector that we do the right thing like this what a note and um that is our time for today and i want to thank our panelists we are so honored by your president by your presence such incredible insight just knowledge that you've shared here today and of course our moderators nadia sussman and lulu ramadan thank you so much for navigating us through this complex uh discussion i'd like to give a special thank you to mckinsey and company for support of today's event and of course to our partners the palm beach post and wlrn thank you to our audience for joining us and all of
