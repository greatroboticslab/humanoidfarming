1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,380
one of the most important things we've

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,839
done to make our operations succeed is

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,480
learning the different species of grass

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:11,760
and learning to rotate to favor those

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,920
species that are desirable to you one of

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:17,039
the things that people misunderstand

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,260
about rotational grazing is they think

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,480
it's going to take a big investment in

9
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,340
fencing and time and labor and that's

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,840
not the case the thing that surprised me

11
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,880
most when we changed the way we were

12
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,640
grazing is how much more carrying

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,880
capacity our Ranch had compared to

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,880
before
