00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:04,520
farm animals play crucial roles in

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:06,879
agriculture and food production as well

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:10,000
as in various other aspects of human

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:12,719
life here are some additional aspects to

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,559
consider breeds and varieties farm

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,440
animals come in a wide range of breeds

7
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,199
and varieties each with its own

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,680
characteristics suited to specific

9
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:22,320
purposes and

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,000
environments for example there are dairy

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,240
cattle breeds known for high milk

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,599
production meat cattle breeds bred for

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,279
beef production and Dual Purpose breeds

14
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:32,520
that can be raised for both milk and

15
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:34,480
meat housing and management proper

16
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,120
housing and management practices are

17
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,120
essential for the health and well-being

18
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,520
of farm

19
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,719
animals depending on the species and

20
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,559
production system farm animals may be

21
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:46,520
housed in Barns pens pastures or

22
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,640
specialized facilities designed to meet

23
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,480
their needs for shelter space

24
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,120
ventilation and

25
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,440
sanitation health and Veterinary Care

26
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,559
farm animals require regular Veterinary

27
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,879
Care to prevent and treat illnesses

28
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:03,800
injuries and diseases this may include

29
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,600
vaccinations deworming Hoof Trimming and

30
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,320
other preventive measures to maintain

31
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,360
their health and productivity

32
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,520
veterinarians play a crucial role in

33
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:15,040
ensuring the welfare of farm animals and

34
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,040
promoting biocurity on farms nutrition

35
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,400
and feeding proper nutrition is

36
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,520
essential for the growth development and

00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,600
productivity of farm animals Farmers

38
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,720
carefully formulate diets based on the

39
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,040
nutritional requirements of each species

40
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:33,119
