  "text": "so Rebecca and I we operate fair share farm this is the farm we're in Northeast Clay County Missouri North Kansas City so that's our house we got a bar in our new fermenting facility high tunnel two different fields that we operate one we tend to use more in the spring when it because it dries out quicker we have an irrigation pond here and a solar panel the irrigation system is solar-powered we started in 2003 and first CSA season was 2004 this year we had 130 members our members work on the farm that's part of the CSA operation Rebecca is a fourth generation farmer we also have some hens at this point and so there's our CSA like I said we're a participatory CSA that's kind of the traditional model our members are required to help 2 to 3 times a year to come out with the harvest it's one of the things and our survey they say they actually like almost the most about the farm we grow 40 different types of vegetables like most CSA farms our approach we're not certified organic and we consider ourselves a biological farm you know we tell people that do what we do so we think of the soil as the plant stomach you know you're gonna feed the soil you grow cover crop you turned it under the biology of the soil digests and decomposes that matter and that's what you feed the plant with just like yourself you get a piece of broccoli it goes into your body it gets digested by the by the probiotics in your body and we also like to say you are what you eat so you are what your plants eat and we feel all the cover cropping and biological methods that we've used over the years really helps improve the nutrition and the flavor of the crops we do what we feed the soyal a balanced meal we try every year to either give us cover crops compost or hay mulch straw organic fertilizer and we cover crop pretty much all year long so we did a lot of mulching we buy composters organization called Missouri organics in Kansas City we can get that's enough for about 20 beds of 20,000 foot beds about half acre we use a fur trail super n as a organic fertilizer that we can apply it's easy to put down we have a one we actually now have two moveable hen houses we like to move them into areas where we have cover crops growing and how to have them use that as a food source as well as their ration they say we grow a lot of cover crops this is protal area and suntanned circumstan and grass here buckwheat we have a electric tractor so it's an allis-chalmers ji there's a sare grant from a while back that from a farmer in New York State Ron Klose he converted it to from gas to electric you can see the batteries on the back there it essentially runs like a golf cart this was our field day that we had this year so another thing they said we've been farming 13 years using biological practices last year I decided to compile all of our soil data so back in 2003 we actually got a grant from the state of Missouri a sustainable AG demonstration award Joan familiar with that she signed off on that and we were able to get money for soil testing we got a manure spreader and money to buy cover crop seeds and so that kind of got us starting started and just want to kind of point out here you know the whole point of organic or biological farming is to improve soil quality if you do that then the plants are gonna grow so we have this first sample there's only one I don't think it it's really as a baseline as much assists arted out with about 2.6 percent organic matter on our farm and for a while every year and then we skipped and we we just kept taking soil samples and you can see as time went on here we went from our ranges being less than three in the twos to where we get down here towards 2013 15 our ranges have gone up so you can see we've basically raised our soil organic matter by almost one and a half percent and that's one thing that we're really proud of and we like to show this this is it a graph that this is what organic farming can do I don't think it's talked about enough if you look at from like 2008 until now with the acreage that we've grown calculated that we've added about 250,000 pounds of organic matter to our soil which relates to about 350,000 pounds of carbon dioxide that we've sequestered so that's something that is in agriculture you can do just kind of a matter of course we think that's important you can see that it kind of bounced around and went down and then up for a while we were took awhile a lot of years for us to really get our cover cropping going but once we did you can see the improvements so they said the the biology the soil is important and we've always kind of wanted to do value-added but didn't really want to slave over a stove and make tomato sauce for people and what we've decided to do is to do fermenting so we like how that kind of ties the biology of the soil to the biology to the food to the biology of your of our digestive systems because they're all really the same thing so sauerkraut obviously one fermented food most people are familiar with there's a Rebecca it's a little blurry fill them some jars with kimchi in our new kitchen and there's a facility built on like a hundred-year-old tobacco barn and there was a couple of our products so that was part of the genesis for this project we do grow some things that are more fruiting vegetables like cucumbers to make pickles and jalapenos to make pickled jalapenos but the idea was going to grow a lot of cabbage so we want to do it the simplest way possible the least amount of labor and so the Rolly roller crimper and planting into roll-down beds is something that we wanted to work on so it's been quite a long project so you see here 2013 first step was to plan triage in the winter or in the fall so that the following spring we'd have a crop to roll down the idea was that we would sew crimp these down we also trialing tomatoes in the roll down cover crops and then in July late July plant the fall brassicas into into that and then in September seed the rive at for the next year so we'll go through all that so 2014 no-till Brassica you can see here this is a flail mower that we had and part of the project also was to get us a better flail mower that one's a little lightweight there weren't a lot of safety guards on it but one thing it did show is that in talking to Ron Morris also who's our technical adviser dr. Morris is from Virginia Tech so you don't need to buy a roller crimper we had that in there originally and then we took it out to roll down to cover crop the the flail mowers have a very very large roller on the backhoe very very heavy so all you really need to do to drag the flail mower through a bed with out the mower going to roll down the crops and this is what it looks like so 2014 I'll start it out really well we had a really nice rich crop we rolled it down a looked like this looked really good the vetch came back up which isn't unusual it's more veiny it doesn't really have the stem like rye does it'll just break we mowed that off at the same time we were doing a trial so we we did the roll down beds and then we used our Spader and we tilled in beds and the idea was to compare roll down production versus tilled production mode off the right edge but then as you can see behind our farm crew here the bindweed started coming in we had other areas where the grasses started coming in so you know we're trying Cynthia got out here I think was maybe 75 foot I don't know if it was even that far and it's like okay let's just see how long it's gonna take so it took like five hours of personnel time to hand weed this area and then it just came back anyway so we tried another thing we had this organic herbicide called Ground Force which is it's just like a citric or acetic acid and so we tried spraying that and then we sprayed the whole thing and didn't matter it just all came back it's not a systemic herbicide it just kind of tilts kills the top growth so the main focus of this whole project the first year we just had to abandon the thought of even planting into this we did I'll show you with the no-till planting that we did try to run the machinery but we didn't plant into it so no-till planting aid it's basically a furrow er and as a system that dr. Moore's developed and so he helped us in building the till planting AIDS so it's a way that just pull furrows in the rolled down cover crop and then you can plant into that area so you can just look he has a lot of literature on this you know you can go online you can buy a toolbar you can buy this and that and you just kind of build it but we have this equipment laying around the farm so it was like well we're gonna kind of farm hack the whole thing so we had this tool bar which looks like it's a square of tool bar and after I bought the clamps found out it's actually a diamond tool bar and then the shanks you know ones longer than the other you saying these Coulter's they were really too small to use so I kind of roughed it up so these are one of the things we bought were these Coulter's you really need them to be big if you have a lot of roll down cover crop it has to be able to cut through it this shank wasn't gonna there just wasn't enough space there so we really we had to get a piece of steel and drop this straight down and then it turned out that they're still kind of too close we had a bolt and extension onto that you can kind of see where this is a square on a diamond and then you got this little bit here and we had we didn't cut that off the first year so it worked it worked well just like he said it would it dragged through you just had a furrow going there we have a waterwheel transplanter the idea was weed spaced the waterwheels at that distance and pull it through and be able to plant but showing you those pictures before you can see that already all this vine weed had grown back in so last year we couldn't do it I'll go into that this year I kind of fixed it up a little bit you can see here I cut that off that was really catching on the cover crop and and causing a problem and you can see here the steel that's the extension we spent money and bought a diamond clamp so it worked worked really well pulls right through there you can kind of see it it cuts down maybe eight inches into the soil and so the no-till planting aid worked fine our you know conclusions are you can farm hack it and maybe save a little bit of money or it's not that hard to find the parts you need for a toolbar and everything else to to make it with new parts it's a great tool it does what it says and we still may use it there may be times when it's really wet out and we don't want to till an area and we can use this to create a planting furrow without causing a lot of problems so there's a Rebecca this is one of our other field days we had a field day each year that same year 2014 we did the same thing for tomatoes so the idea with the tomatoes we only in the summer we do a second planting two tomatoes in there we call them our summer Tomatoes we use a hybrid we'll cage them and so we took this 200 foot bed that's our standard bed length and rolled down a hundred foot of it and then the other hundred feet we spayed it in and planted into that to mulch here's the tomatoes that we hand planted in here unfortunately we I'm still searching for the data from this one but it was really wet I mean when we dug the holes and put these tomato plants in there was water at the bottom it was it was a really wet year so I don't know that the data from this necessarily would have been that good and we did the same test this year and I have much better information from that but you can kind of see it we did hand weed this once and for the tomatoes that didn't work out too bad the thing with the tomatoes are you you roll it down most of this happens in late May that's when the Rye has reached the stage where you gonna down and the tomatoes are summer Tomatoes will plant maybe second week of June so it will have died back and we can plant right into it whereas with the Brassica as you roll it down you know before May is over and then you're not going to plant until the middle of July your cabbage or something and it just sitting there all this time and weeds have more of a chance to grow just wanted to go through this real quick just to kind of show you we've done a lot of a lot of cover cropping this is an example we do cover crops in the spring summer and fall there's like a summer cover crop of looks like mung bean or beans and and sorghum Sudan grass so we'll let it grow will flail mow it down that's what it looks like when it flailed Mose is all nice and chopped and then this is our Spader I know if you guys ever seen a Spader it's one of the first pieces of equipment that we got they had one at the farm in New York where we were it it's a really nice piece of equipment you can see these shovels in here so there's like a half dozen shovels and they actually dig the soil you can actually go through bed say you had potatoes in and you harvested them all and go through and Spade and you can find potatoes that are you know haven't even been damaged when you're all done spading so it's a it's not as pulverizing as a garden type tiller that's what it looks like on a good day we have a silk clay soil so it's really difficult to always find the exact perfect soil moisture to to Spade but that looks nice like that you know we consider cover cropping kind of composting in place we also have in the past have taken the plastic off our high tunnel and cover crop tower high tunnel so 2015 was going to be our second year's gonna be a two-year project but we suspended the project because of rain so I don't know if you can read all this data but you can see down here at the bottom it was I don't this first year I ever decided to keep like rainfall records and just had a little log and I kept in the notes and it was really interesting to have done it this year over the course of 74 days we had almost 36 inches of rain with your crates to almost a half an inch of rain every day for 74 days right in here this is about the time that you would normally be rolling and crimping and up till the end of May we had 10 inches and then the first week of June we had 10 inches just in in those couple days we also had hail so this you can kind of see this is a total precipitation for that day and we're right in the middle of the worst of it so this is what strawberries look like after they've been pummeled by hail like Rebecca said it looks like little tiny fairy punches on them and and when you count on your strawberries and they're just ripening and you get hail it's no fun and so we're trying to keep the project going too but like you could see there was really no time period when this was ready to be rolled down that we could get in there and I was doing everything I could work on this project and keep the rest of the farm going and there are a few times when I probably went out went out there when I shouldn't have so that was a lesson all in and of itself this is more of the rain that we had so we skipped 2015 and got into 2016 so one of the other parts of this project was to evaluate our cover cropping method we had always just done broadcast seeding and harrowing that's how we would do our cover cropping and you've seen some of those pictures things worked out fine but it's pretty labor-intensive so the idea was to get a cedar and I spent almost two years looking for a used grain drill like six foot wide and I had absolutely no luck finding one so eventually decided to go to getting a vegetable cedar so our allis-chalmers G we have a tool bar and we have three planet junior cedars and we concede with that just off the electric tractor so the thought was if I can get four new planet juniors I could put that on the allis-chalmers and we could use our electric tractor to do our cover cropping but turns out once the cedars came that these are newer ones and they're like twice the weight of the other ones so that didn't really work out so we had to get a tool bar so that we could just pull it behind our our farm all so these are vegetable cedars and we're trying to see cover crops but you know for the most part seeds or seeds so we've started looking at well you know what's the seed plate for a rye or vetch or whatever and so one way to do it was simply to measure the circumference of the front wheel which would be the ground tracking on it open up the cedar and just spin the wheel for so many feet and count how many pounds fell out and then we could calculate okay well this wheel will get you so many pounds per acre or per bed whatever we wanted so I did that and every like this hopper it looks like these both had like vets in them and those two might have had rye these were offset so we wanted eight rows so I had to kind of turn around and go back down the other way and try and have the cedar go in between the other rows so that didn't work out all that great it worked out okay and then the other thing was having two different seeds and two different seed holes and trying to keep all that perfect really was kind of a pain so when I went to just mixing the seed and you just use the largest seed hole and you calibrate it that way so you mix the Ryan batch or the oats and peas or the Sudan grass and crota larrya together whatever it is you need and you find the seed where you get we're trying to get about about two pounds or so per thousand foot bed so that you can see here OOP we got one two three four five like six rows here this is a bed so you really want like eight so it wasn't too bad grew pretty well the the peas were supposed to be separate inside there and some of those work some didn't so for the next time I did it I tried putting it all to one side figuring at least I'd make sure everything was on one side or on each side this was this summer and some of that didn't turn out that well because it got very dry for a while and the seeds just sat there and so the wheats started to take over but this is part of the trial where this area here was broadcast and Harrow it in and these were with the cedar and it pretty much looked like that we'd cut areas and way um and so we did this two different times and so you can see from the top one the first time we did it and a spring crop the cedar had a little bit better weight and then when we measured in the fall from one of the summer plantings the broadcast had a better weight we took like a four by four area just cut it down and weight it we kept using it it does the cedar it does give you a pretty good stand that doesn't always look like it at the start these are peas and oats and this just interesting is so warm this year this is actually a sunhemp flower which we'd never seen before because it's just been growing all year all winter long or fall along so we feel vegetable cedar can be used to seed cover crops it's a multi-use cedar then if you have more than one use for it if your vegetable farmer we would advise combining two C types into the and use the larger cedar hole the one for the larger seed and then you can just have all your cedars at the same cedar hole we had a little difficult to get like eight perfectly spaced rows and harrowing can be just as effective as the cedar it just takes a lot more effort so this is our second try at the no-till Brassica that was this this is this year so last September we put down rive at that was a really really wet year and for some reason you can see there's hardly any rye that came up but we had a lot of edge so that's what it looked like in May we rolled down the veg we that's a picture of the new flail mower you can kind of see that roller there that just helps roll stuff down and this is one of the trial beds and pretty much the same thing happened you know the where we are I mean I'll out here it's a lot of grassland and like between the end of May and then you have all of June and going into July that's when grasses really really want to grow this area we'd never put down hay or anything it was a relatively new area that we were like the second year we used it but when you have to wait around that long before you plant at least for us you just get too much weed pressure especially from the grasses so it's easy to roll down with the flail mower there's a problem because of the weed pressure from the grasses in the heat of the summer you saw the wet periods we had it's really hard to implement the roller crimper and planting in it during the wet periods and we tried doing like hand weeding and everything and that really is not an effective way to kind of make up for any any problems that you might have this is more rain so this year at the end of August we had 10 inches over a couple days and four inches a couple weeks later so there was still a lot of this this year so these are the summer tomatoes so this is the same thing as showing you before we grew a cover crop one area we mowed it and spaded it in the other one we rolled it this is what it looked like right after we were done with that you can see there's hay on the Left we we mainly use hay we're able to get hay off of Rebecca's family land next door the one on the right is the rolled down so things started out pretty good both of them these are Delarosa I believe or the tomato type they're summer tomato this is once they really started going I don't know if you can really tell but this the the hay mulched ones were really a deeper green they're a better stand then over here we weeded these once but after that it was like well they're kind of on their own that's the point we don't want to be spending a lot of time weeding no it's like what type of question was what you know what type of hay and it was like a lot of broom there's some clover in there but yeah it wasn't native we may be able to get native soon her father just seeded a lot of switchgrass all over the farm so maybe in the future so this year we had a lot of you know the fruit was really great there was a problem when they weave first started going out to harvest our irrigation had kind of we had some complications with it for awhile and the kind of the first fruits that we were picking had a lot of blossom end rot got the irrigation working we watered a lot and that kind of went away and this is the data from this year so you can see here that once with the hay mulch had three times the yield that the rolled ones did they both had a decent amount of fruit set but the hay mulched ones had had a lot more first this is mainly first at least first trying to come out the field so both of the roller crimper like I said they keep down the weeds because you're going to plant in them right pretty much right away so it's a much better situation we are maybe considering trying this for the summer tomatoes a different year and then mulching rolled down areas right away and that might really eliminate weeds and maybe then rolled down crops they'll get a little more digested you know that top growth if you don't spayed it in it doesn't really get digested you don't get as much nutrient release so part of it is there just wasn't as much in the soil but spaded in hay mulch beds if you can get a good spading seem to work as well as anything so these are some of the costs so the no-till planting aid with us you already having a tool bar and a few things was about eleven hundred bucks a flail mower I was able to find online actually came out here to Kansas somewhere to pick it up and then the coal cedar with the hitch was a little over four thousand dollars so sorry there's not more data about what we planted but it did demonstrate to us that you know we tried and try it it's not necessarily a system that's gonna work in our area in our soils for us did you ever get rid of the bindweed no well it's funny the wet year we hardly saw any bindweed on the farm and we didn't really have as much this year as we had two years ago went when I shown you that we applied Rebecca applied for a permit from USDA to buy these buying weed mites have you heard about them at all so there's supposedly there are these mites that only attack buying weed and somewhere out in Colorado you can buy them so she had like go through this whole process and you know it's like if you know same type of paperwork if you're gonna transfer smallpox across state lines you know and so she applied for it and we were gonna do it the next year but because of all the rain we didn't do it I had bindweed problem and cattles worked wonderful yeah I mean they cleaned it out my only concern was were they gonna carry seed elsewhere but they digest the seed I had no spreading so hanging it would be an option if you can find somebody that's willing to buy hay with fine weed in it mm-hmm yeah we're hoping maybe the chickens might do something to it too but we don't know yet have you guys ever tried anything with like on your cover crop having an edible mixed in with the cover crop for us oh yeah like as a cash crop no well I guess I shouldn't say that we kind of we're growing daikons so we until each radishes and we're doing the fermenting and right now we're kind of trying there's some varieties from Johnny and other places that are really more culinary and I've tried the till eat radishes but right now the batch that we did is really has a lot of bitterness to it and I suppose if we I mean it if you plant a whole bed of them you can pull up you know hundred pounds and you're not gonna lose a lot but the whole idea the cyllage radishes to leave it in the ground and then otherwise we don't have a combine you know if we did we'd probably ever get a lot of buckwheat because buckwheat like seeds it you know almost right away you",
