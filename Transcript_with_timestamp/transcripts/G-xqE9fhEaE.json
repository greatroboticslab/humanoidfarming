  "text": "my name is Ed Sakura I'm an extension plant pathologist with the Auburn University my email in case you want to contact me later is s-i-k-o-r-e-j at auburn.edu I also post a lot on Twitter and my Twitter handles Alabama Ed but post a lot of pictures of sick plants start off with some healthy looking strawberries this is down at uh slide on the left is Burrs Farms down in Baldwin County or in Foley Alabama many of you probably know his operation he's been doing it for 30 years does a great job um walked through that field and could not find any disease that day which I guess I was happy to see on the right is a nice basket of fresh strawberries picked a Dempsey Farm which is just North of Auburn near uh south of Lafayette that's pretty much what you're you're aiming for to produce as a grower unfortunately you get problems like this and Leaf plates on the left you get a root rots and Crown rots in the center and also fruit grass on the right which are showing up right about now and all these can be cost a significant amount of money and in some cases devastate the crop I like to start off with just this simple definition of what a plant disease is and I Define it as any disturbance of a plant that interferes with its normal growth and development talk about biotic diseases which are caused by living agents such as bacteria fungi nematodes viruses and then abiotic diseases caused by non-living agents often uh related of Mother Nature maybe flooding of uh cold weather and so forth Frost injury just a couple of examples of abiotic diseases uh this poor pollination I saw up in Edgar's area up in Clanton uh possibly this poor pollination leading to this disfigured fruit kind of looks like a bird a ride with sun scald some fruit on a black plastic malishes years ago but it went from relatively cold or warm those fruit were exposed and he had damage that so abiotic problems are out there insect problems are out there like Ashley just talked about we're going to talk about strawberry diseases um broke these down into a a few Leaf spots both fungal and bacterial uh two Crown rots root rots and anthracnose and phytopra then we'll talk more more heavily on the fruit rots which are probably the most obvious ones especially this time of year during harvest season so botrytus and threctnose fruit rod new disease that Dr Connor in our Diagnostic lab detected uh not long ago this year and also rise of this route which oftentimes shows up post Harvest many times in your in your kitchen in your refrigerator or on your uh encounter as far as the least spots are concerned we do have a couple fungal leaf spot problems that are are common in backyard gardens more than in commercial Fields I'd say this is strawberry leaf spot or common leaf spot uh caused by a fungal pathogen oftentimes you see these uh tan the brown lesions surrounded by a darker margin these could be red to purple and color you can see on the left many of these lesions start to emerge and you get blighting of the foliage and eventually fall off and typically these show up on the older leaves of the plant and it's look if you're not on a fungicide spray program uh these These are going to probably pop up this is a strawberry Leaf blight another disease sometimes you see both those diseases on the same plant uh oftentimes you get these tannish lesions in the center you can see some target-like patterns developing on the right you can see where these lesions start to merge and many times you'll see almost like a U or a v-shaped lesion extending out to the leaf Edge and that leaf eventually uh turns brown and dies both of these diseases are are pretty easily controlled with uh fungicides so with common it's a it first appears a small round purplish red spots on the upper Leaf surface uh Leaf death can occur when numerous spots merge and many of these this is often introduced into fields on Infected transplants and I highlight infected transplants because I think with just about every disease I talk about today one of the ways the disease gets started is coming in on Infected material a commonly spot is spread within a field by splashing water High rainfall warm temperatures will favor rapid disease development as far as Leaf blight the spots become target-like and only have a purple or yellow or even a yellow margin to them older lesions are as I mentioned I usually v-shape at the leaf Edge leading to a blight of the entire leaf and similar weather conditions favor uh Leaf blight as Leaf spots so that's why I say oftentimes you might see these together in the same field I mentioned resistant varieties I believe there are a few that have resistance to these pathogens disease-free transplants when you do get your transplants in clean up some of the dead tissue on them and then applying a protective fungicide so a product like Captain applied before these diseases show up control them well caftan some of the other protective materials that are used by commercial Growers do do a great job on keeping these in check and more times than not I see it late in the season when the budget side programs have been abandoned or in a home Garden situations next disease is angular leaf spot and this is a bacterial disease it's only bacterial disease we'll talk about today but it gets its name from the very sharp angles to the lesions caused by the pathogen the bacteria get inside the leaf tissue but they have a hard time Crossing some of those major veins so you get these these sharp angular lesions so it's fairly easy to pick up in the field once you get used to seeing it typically it's a cooler weather disease likes it wet like most of these diseases but a cooler weather pathogen So It Begins as small water silk yellow lesions on the lower leaf yellow flesh will develop on the upper surface and they'll eventually turn that reddish brown color and the elysians will enlarge to become these angular spots uh short and merge more or less and they're limited by the lead veins symptoms could also be visible on the calyx of the fruit and I'll show you a Sly of this but the bacterium does not actually go to the fruit but that calyx damage that does reduce marketability of that infected fruit now the bacterium can't survive on dead leaves in the field so it can be there from one year to the next it could also be introduced on transplants and then plant the plant movement uh within the field is by splashing water and I mentioned cooler temperatures favor angular Leaf Spa so with management we're looking at disease-free planting stock purchasing from a reputable dealer I do recommend copper fungicides when this disease shows up as they can be effective in reducing bacterial problems and also help you with some of your fungal response you got to watch with coppers and sulfur products some of these products because they can cause a foliar burn if they're overused or if temperatures suddenly you know in Alabama they might be 90 degrees tomorrow some of these products can't be more can cause actual Burns in a plant and cause more damage than the pathogen itself so be careful with them read the label before using any product so a couple early uh development of angularly spot on the left and Center if you were to cut one of those lesions with a razor blade stick it on a die set or a micro a compound scope in the lab which you would see would be bacterial ooze coming out and that's that gray and a slide on the right the uh that gray mass of spores coming out there's probably thousands of bacterials whereas oozing from one single lesion and that's why these diseases really take off these bacterial problems under the right conditions so with angular leaf spot uh we mentioned water silky and an example of that is on the left on the lower half of that leaf you can see kind of a just a dark almost like a water droplet that's drying off that's water soaking and that'd be the initial symptom for angular leaf spot you could hold those leaves up to the Sun as I did on the right and then you can see those yellow flecks where the pathogen causes initial affection site and then eventually that'll turn reddish from the bacterium moving and reproduce rapidly rip and there's damage on the calyx I mentioned and this I I noticed uh years ago now but uh I was able to get bacteria loose from the calyx uh that dries down making that that fruit a little bit less likely to be picked by a you picker in your operation um it doesn't go to the fruit but damage has already been done when that fruit looks unedible so angular leaf spot not a problem this year at least I haven't seen it in a couple years to be honest with you but uh it's out there along with your other Leaf puts wanted to move down into the soil into the crown of the plant a couple crown and root rot diseases namely uh interact nose Crown rot and then phytopter a root and Crown rot and uh phytopus we had that probably the most common problem coming through the Diagnostic lab according to Dr Connor our our fine diagnostician uh attract nose Crown Rod oftentimes if it comes in on transplants it could be a significant problem to Growers on the left what happens is they they'll plant their plants and then in in a short time many of these plants will start to die off you see a plant in the center that has uh both phytopter and spider mites uh Ash had a nice slide it almost looks identical to that one on the right is uh what I believe is vital for Dr Connor noticed this field in uh Brewton a few a couple months ago diagnosed by top or in the field and the grower lost plants but with vitopter sometimes those plants will revive themselves basically but they'll be show that stunting that you see on the right side of that bed so with anthracnose what you're going to see is uh well it may attack the crowns direct no says there's three different species of them correct those and some are more common as one is more common for the crown Rod phase and I'll talk about interact notes fruit Rod later which is typically a different species so you get different phases of the same disease but plants may die after being transferred to the field infected plants the wilted plants will have a reddish brown uh Crown so if you you cut the crown open longitudely and I'll show you a slide of this you'll see a this discoloration on the inside it'll be a firm Rod of the crown um can be hard to ID based on Crown symptoms of dying plants because the crowns typically turn brown in short order so um which the same thing happens with frost injury uh flooding of a plant dies the crown is going to turn brown in in a short period of time but infected transplants seem to be the main source of the disease in Alabama so with management you want to plant the Z Street material when possible hard to pick up this disease by looking at the transplants as they come in Scout the field early on and remove dying plants as soon as possible so even in the fall after after planting or in early winter period look for plants that are dying check to see if they might have symptoms of anthracnose and then discard those as quickly as possible so it doesn't spread then as the season progresses you want to follow protect the fungicide program early in the season to try and keep that disease in check on the left you can see it on the upper Leafs upper left corner that plant starting to die down if you what you want to do is uh sacrifice one of those plants that is still green but obviously on its way out and cut the stem open the crown open and that's when you're going to see this reddish brown discoloration you wait for the plant to be completely Brown it's just going to be about and you see uh just symptoms of anthracnose on the left from a healthy Crown to one that is uh completely been destroyed by it basically as a firm or out remember picture on the right is what I just showed you earlier so dracnose Crown wrap uh significant disease when it does show up now if I top through a root in Crown rot uh we used to call these water mold fungi um guess that name from the the wet conditions that this pathogen prefers and you'll often see plants like the one on the left that just suddenly Wilt and die you don't see a progression of the disease it just it goes down quickly slice the stem open on that again you'll look for maybe a pinkish rose color but it can also be reddish brown to Brown in the crown usually on the upper part of the crown some pictures from Dr Connor to share with me from the lab from earlier this year I believe but you can see uh phytop there or crown rot and some of the symptoms inside of those crowns so this disease really likes it wet that's that's the main thing with these water mold pathogens so symptoms begin in the upper part of the crown uh young Lisa will suddenly and you'll get complete collapse excuse me of the plant uh within days and the plan sometimes will break at the upper part of the crown when you try and lift it from the soil uh quickly cut that Crown longitudally you may see a rose pink discoloration usually in the upper part of the crown or it can be brown and eventually that'll just disintegrate now when the disease is not bad and when conditions dry out maybe you get some warm temperatures some of these plants will recover but they're usually going to be stunted and not produce as much as a healthy plant during the season warm wet conditions poorly drained soils favor infection so management especially in a commercial field because phytopter can't survive in the soil is as clusters of resistant type spores fumigation would be an option if you have a limited space for planting or if you have a heavy infection there are resistant varieties available and you want to provide good soil drainage when choosing a site and you want to avoid low wet fields or fields that have a history of this disease because it can be quite devastating when it gets going left you could see a plant that eventually uh was infected with phytopper on the right is a slide I showed you earlier but you see those plants appeared to recover from phytother but they're what about one one-fifth the size of those healthy plants in the left oftentimes you might see them in a row or a few plants together where the disease is spread from one plant to the next office okay let's get to the cool diseases the fruit rots and these this is what you're seeing now if you if you're uh taking your crop or if you have if you're you picking yourself gray mold detritus gray mold on the left and on the right you could see anthracnose fruit rod and gray mole of course gets his name from the so here's just different different uh levels of infection on strawberry fruit from left to right but that gray stuff you see there is fungal mycelium the body of the fungus along with spores on the right it almost looks of that fruit is mummified by the path this this stands out pretty much in the field I'm sure any of you who've walked through strawberries or grow strawberries have seen this problem it's an annual problem in Alabama a little more common when we have uh wet conditions like we had last year especially in in some cases in some parts this year this is just a close-up of what the that mycelium looks like these individual Haifa and the blue and then off the hyphy you get these clusters of botrytus spores on the left hand side of the screen looks like a somebody's bringing over some flowers and then under in that star you can see a couple individual spores and if you see botritus in the field and if you just see that gray Mass on this on the fruit just flick it with your finger sometime if it's dry and you'll just see these four clouds come off and that's individual spores being released one of those spores laying on a neighboring fruit and that can infect the fruit directly so uh gives you some idea how rapid this packaging or how aggressive it can be this was in an organic field last year in our region but you can see that growing mold for me again if you just flick that with your finger you would see a massive spores blown off typically these fruit might show some darkening first but the mold comes off fairly quickly I mentioned it comes in on transplants now this is a garden store in uh Lee County that I when I when I go to a garden store I look for diseases I mean most of you are probably picking out nice strawberry fruit or healthy flowers I look for problems this was just from a basket of strawberries being sold these were probably the last six plants left on the star shelf but they had a fruit on them which was interesting but it also had gray mold on them so this is something you wouldn't want to bring into your home Garden say and definitely obviously with a commercial grower you'd want to avoid this but it was just sort of interesting on a at least in the garden center made for a nice picture so would betrayed as gray mold it's it's widespread has numerous hosts survives and dead plant material free water cool temperatures favorite development so right now it's ideal uh with the rain we had in recent days green berries appear to be more resistant to infection than red berries uh management is to avoid disease transplants which is hard to do and avoid allowing over ripened fruit to sit in the field that's probably the biggest problem where Growers have extended themselves uh more Acres than they needed they can't pick them fast enough in these fruits just start to rot in the field so what you'd like to do is remove and destroy the diseased fruit and uh Ash earlier talked about removing fruit with damage from insects and the same thing with botrytus you would like to get take those fruit off the plant and then get them out of the field bury them um I know a number of Growers that they have time to remove the fruit throw them in the center of the road but then they they leave them there they don't they can't pick them up because they don't have enough time throwing enough people power and that's still a source of inoculum this disease can be controlled with with fungicides on a strict schedule uh you need to get ahead of it caftan is always a nice product to to add to your mix but there's a number of other products of different chemistries that are available uh Dr Connor Dr Vincent and myself have been doing uh we've been doing some resistant profiling of fields over the last year and a half looking for uh populations of botrytus that are resisted to different fungicide classes working with a professor over the University of Georgia we're continuing this project but we but we found about 80 percent of the fields that um many that many of the botrytus populations were resistant to uh class one I believe was class 11 fungicide so products like top semam would be uh people spraying it were were not having any benefits from it and uh I think I think class 11 was the other one we were having problems with uh things like abound just not effective any longer and that's problem throughout the southeast it's not in Alabama now with direct nose fruit Rod is also occurring we saw it in about 25 percent of the fields last year also seeing resistance to this fellow in a in some of the products but we don't see it as common as botrytus but it was out there last year and I did see it this year has that Telltale kind of a sunken area on the fruit uh they could range from tan to Brown to uh black on the right there was a field down brooding that had five or six fruit on one plant uh you have to just just move from plant to plant just different examples of anthracnose I think the one in the upper left-hand corner you can see the initial symptom and it almost looks like a thumb print on these in that one but that might be the initial symptom and then you start getting more darkening of the tissue and the spores are then produced off that tissue as well so the source of the pathogen is also from Nursery stock but it's hard to detect coming on in disease itself is favored by rain high humidity warm temperatures all common situations in Alabama rain and wind can spread the disease across the field fairly quickly and then the dark lesions can form on green fruit but also on mature fruit as well then management is to buy plants from a repeal Nursery one that you or your colleagues have had luck with in the past uh plant anthracnose resisting cultivars I I threw sweet Charlie up here as one and I Edgar I hope that's that's the correct variety but there are some available for resistance to anthraktos and you want to monitor fields for hot spots of interactives and then remove infected plants not just the fruit but whole affected plants you might be able to limit the amount of damage you've seen a feel from this disease or amount of spread so the grower I talked to who had anthracnose on his fruit a couple weeks ago I told him remove that plant and a couple plants next to it and he might be able to compartmentalize that disease and a keep it from spreading rapidly another disease when you take those fruit off you also want to get them out of the field Sanitation so management there is a pre-planned dip that uh doctor uh Edgar discussed in a publication a couple years ago so certain fungicides uh one we use is switch can be used as dips on your transplants to reduce incidence of anaphorectos and gray mole before planting and typically when your transplants come in you you mix up the solution of the Fungicide and then submerge the transplants in the dip for at least or dip them in in the solution for at least two minutes and then plant and that can reduce to your initial and oxygen load uh if you have problems you want to begin fungicide program early and follow the guidelines and I would I would follow the guidelines outline in the Southeast Regional strawberry IPM guide 2022. uh I'm not going to go through all the chemicals because it gets complicated very quickly but the website's down in the bottom but if you just get your go to your Google machine and type in southeast strawberry IPM guide 2022 and it'll take you to that link and then uh there's great information I think Ash mentioned uh on uh insect control weed control uh variety selection and also on Disease Control I think on pages 45 to 50 they outline disease resistance management promote them threat no sound bertritis but it's very complicated to try and explain it in a short webinar would be would be two more diseases I wanted I want to mention one is Rise of this Fruita this is one that have you ever left a carton of strawberries on your counter for any length of time or even in the refrigerator this is what you might have seen looks like your your strawberries have grown a beard this is also known as old old gray man's beard we have a white to gray tint to it sometimes rise of this which is a fungal disease is joined by another pathogen name known as mucer um both together or sometimes they can be confused I confuse them the blackberries on the right I found those in my refrigerator a couple weeks ago after a short vacation so made for a good picture and for this seminar but uh so rise was fruit Roth It's a fungal pathogen lives on decaying organic matter the initial affection appears as discolored water soaked spot on the fruit sometimes tannish looking and somewhat soft fruit appears to be wounded or where you wounded the fruit that's where this fungus will attack um under conditions of high relative humidity barriers will become covered with this coat of white mycelium that's it's fungal growth that that hair you're seeing and that uh management is removed plant debris this organic matter remove ripe berries as soon as possible for Harvest don't let them sit out in the field and then maybe be gentle when you're picking avoid bruise in the fruit which can increase incidence of Horizons that wound that you cause then a rapid post-harvest schooling I think Ash mentioned that as far as insect control as well uh cooling them down it's not going to stop the disease but it will slow it down we don't recommend fungicides for rhizopus it's mainly a cultural cultural practices will reduce this problem last disease I wanted to talk about is a new disease for Alabama neopestal lab neopestalo lociopsis such a terrible name Dr Connor found this down in Bruton back in it was March Mr degree down air new grower for the state this is a disease it's a fungal disease that was detected in Florida about three years ago uh more recently detected in Georgia also in Michigan Texas and a few other places but Dr Connor was able to First find it in Alabama down in South Alabama and this is the disease that appears to be coming in on transplants but once it gets into the field it can survive in the soil and on debris and be a an annual problem and it can be a severe problem and you can see some of the significant least spots on that plan on the left and then I took the pictures in the center and the right but you can see the least spot there but then going and going to the fruit and you get a lesion that looks a little bit like uh like anthracnose fruit rot but it's it's much I would say massive compared comparison to interactive I should have had them side by side for a year but then you get that black fruiting structures growing in that lesion itself here's more pictures from what I collected a few weeks ago so uh really a nasty disease so it can cause extreme yield loss it can destroy entire Fields it's happening in Florida you can't spread quickly to other fields or within a within a field into other fields nearby once it is introduced rain events definitely uh aggravated or I should say uh help it out and spread it causes a leaf and fruit spot as I showed you initially but eventually it can infect the roots and the crowns of plants causing plant death and that's where we're really getting concerned with so with management you want to limit operations when uh when plants are wet to avoid movement of this disease if you do see the disease you want to remove those infected plants as soon as possible and where practical because you can't stop it from spreading and of course you want to get those plants out of the field so it doesn't establish in the soil itself so there's been work done at Florida where they've had the disease for a few years they've been doing fungicide trials and I think with one year data they saw that usually something like thyram and switch rotated with thyram or thyram cap tan rhyme tilt or Inspire May reduce incidence on the fruit so they're still working on this to see how effective these fungicide programs are uh Florida's also was evaluating our our current varieties that are available for see if any had resistance to disease and a couple had some I don't say called tolerance but it appeared to have a slight level of resistance but nothing to write home about and there are programs now trying to develop resistant varieties to the to this pathogen though the pathogens is so new that these programs are just getting started as I said we've found that just in one field in Alabama came in on transplants probably coming from Illinois We Believe or the Midwest and um and it was just on one variety coming from that Nursery out of five that the grower planted which was interest so we uh we recommend in his case to destroy those plants as soon as possible so with that I will stop uh that is me after a long day of picking diseases with a Virgin uh strawberry daiquiri I believe but again my name is Ed Sakura with the Auburn University Cooperative Extension system you can email me directly at s-i-k-o-r-e-j at auburn.edu I'll be happy to talk to you there and then follow me on Twitter uh if you're interested in diseases or agriculture in general I also work with tree fruits small fruit vegetables corn and soybeans so and hops in heaven okay so if you have any interest in those crops and you're on Twitter please follow me and then uh again for Disease Control you really want to look at the southeast guide uh again the 2022 strawberry IPM guide uh and look at the Z section look at the fungicides and look at resistance management that's all very important so with that I'll stop",
