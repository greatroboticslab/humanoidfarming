00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,119
hi welcome to the making life changes

3
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,199
urban gardening channel my name is

4
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,119
harold helm and i'm out here today to

5
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,000
give you some great gardening tips

6
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,880
on how you can have continual sea of

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,160
green

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,000
when it comes to harvesting your green

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,280
leafy vegetables some people like to

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,320
come out here and just pull your

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,760
vegetables up

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,760
the whole plant and then you got to

13
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,280
plant new seeds now that works great if

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,960
you have lots of land

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,039
but if you're like us and you live in

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,120
the city or suburb or you have

17
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,559
just a small area where you're doing

18
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,320
what we call square foot

19
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,600
urban gardening you're going to be a

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,360
little bit more

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,280
surgically precise when it comes to

22
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,920
harvesting so you can continue to reap

23
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,320
harvesters week after week after week

24
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,960
and so today we have several types of

25
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,720
plants here this is a siberian kale

26
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,080
beautiful you see how large it is the

27
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,880
leaf's very healthy

28
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,360
we also have dinosaur kale and then we

29
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,000
have

30
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,520
red leaf lettuce and we have some

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,320
spinach that we're going to be

32
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,360
harvesting as well and so today what

33
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,520
we're going to do

34
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,880
is we're going to harvest just the

35
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,520
leaves that we want to take off the

36
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,200
plant

37
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,119
we're going to leave enough leaf and

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,960
foliage on the plant so the plant will

39
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,320
grow back if you do this

40
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,600
every two to three weeks you can come

41
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,840
out here and harvest and you can

42
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,320
continue to have a perpetual sea

43
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,520
of green and you're going to get so much

44
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,479
greens that you won't be able to eat at

45
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,000
all so you're going to have to learn how

46
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,680
to freeze it preserve it maybe

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
you can it there's a lot of interesting

48
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,360
ways that you can do it so what we do is

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,200
we just go around the plant i'm going to

50
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,840
look for the big leafs the leaves that i

51
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,360
know

52
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,280
that i need to go ahead and take off and

53
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,000
give me a good pair of scissors or some

54
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,360
shears

55
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,439
you want to go right down here to the

56
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,079
base you can see this the base of the

57
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,000
plant

58
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,159
and i'm just going to cut right there at

59
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,439
the bottom take this whole leaf off just

60
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,360
like this

61
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,040
i'm going to collect it later i'm going

62
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,880
to clean these i've got a great video

63
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,800
shows you how to clean these leaves and

64
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,280
get everything off and get them ready so

65
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,040
i'm just going to go around the plant

66
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,360
and i'm going to take off all these

67
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,879
bottom leaves

68
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,080
even some of these don't look real great

69
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,040
because we want to remove them from the

70
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,840
plant anyway

71
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,840
because it's going to encourage new

72
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,840
growth

73
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,319
and just work your way around the plant

74
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,760
don't take the little leaves off because

75
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,959
you want something to grow back

76
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,560
you can have some of these leaves that

77
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,920
are going to be a little yellow these

78
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,920
are leaves you can throw into your

79
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,319
compost bin and recycle them they're no

80
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,599
good

81
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,440
but you want to get them off the plant

82
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,480
to encourage new growth

83
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,120
so i'm going to go around here and take

84
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,120
these off

85
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,800
and this one here i can take off too

86
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,120
it's pretty good

87
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,120
size

88
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,680
and there you go and actually i can take

89
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,120
this one other one off it's kind of

90
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,159
medium i could have left it on but i'm

91
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,200
going to go ahead and pull it

92
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,640
and what i'm going to do is i'm going to

93
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,440
encourage i'm going to leave three four

94
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,519
leads on

95
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,120
and i'm going to encourage new growth in

96
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,480
just two to three weeks the plant's

97
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,319
going to be that same size

98
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,760
and it'll be time to harvest again and

99
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,840
you can do the same thing with all your

100
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,000
different green leafy vegetables

101
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,959
with this dinosaur kale dinosaur kale

102
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,959
doesn't quite get as big

103
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,959
it's okay they're going to be smaller

104
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,000
these are really tasty especially if you

105
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,040
put them in

106
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,400
a recipe like some white beans and rice

107
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,879
and cook them in kale is just wonderful

108
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,959
it's rich and all kind of vitamins

109
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:40,159
especially vitamin a

110
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,599
high in fiber very nutritious and it's a

111
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,920
super food

112
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,599
and there's one leaf down here that's

113
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,799
kind of going bad a little bit

114
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,720
starting to get the yellow you just

115
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,440
throw that into the compost bin so i'm

116
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,920
going to take this

117
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:55,439
kale and clip it all the way off

118
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,400
so i'm going to work it all the way to

119
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,400
the top of the plant

120
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,280
until i get to the small leaves once i

121
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,799
get to the small leaves

122
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,480
i am not going to mess with the small

123
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,760
leaves i'm going to leave the very very

124
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,879
small leaves

125
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,879
on the plant to encourage new growth so

126
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,720
the new leaves can grow back

127
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,079
so i'm going to leave that on there all

128
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,199
this is it's going to grow back and

129
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,479
continue to get up

130
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,000
and this kale will continue to grow

131
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,440
taller and taller and eventually will go

132
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,440
through its lifespan

133
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,120
now red leafy vegetables green leaf

134
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,040
vegetables whatever type of lettuce you

135
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,520
like it's the exact same thing

136
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,280
you just work your way around the bottom

137
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,040
of the plant

138
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,400
and you really got to get in here it's

139
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,400
good to kind of leave yourself some

140
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,639
space when you're working in your garden

141
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,160
that's why we put one plant per square

142
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,840
foot so you can get in your garden

143
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,280
without stepping on your plants and

144
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,360
they're not too overcrowded

145
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,160
i definitely want to remove this bad

146
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,160
leaves down here

147
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,199
and throw them into the compost bin get

148
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,560
all that out because it will encourage

149
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:59,360
new growth then you just want to go

150
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,880
around your plant

151
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,720
and this is one plant all these plants

152
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,600
that were taken from today they actually

153
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,880
survived

154
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,199
the winter storm down here in the

155
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,680
houston area down here in texas

156
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,639
and we were very fortunate we covered

157
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,479
our plants

158
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,560
these are green hearty uh winter

159
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,080
tolerant plants and so they survived we

160
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,840
did lose a few plants

161
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,360
but most of the plants survived and this

162
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,160
is what's left and look they're grown

163
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,080
back

164
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,759
and we're getting amazing harvesters

165
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,039
from them

166
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,160
so we're going to continue to work

167
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:33,680
around the plant

168
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,360
and take off all these green leaves

169
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,840
and don't take them all off you want to

170
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,840
leave some so they grow back

171
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,800
and i'll show you what it looks like

172
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,800
when we get through

173
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,479
these are great for sandwiches salads

174
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,080
and grow really fast so you want to come

175
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,280
out here you want to trim them but if

176
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,479
you don't take the whole plant up

177
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,800
they'll grow back

178
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,319
that's the beautiful thing about it so

179
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,639
there's one more leaf on the side i'll

180
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,000
take this one

181
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,080
and you just want to look to see how big

182
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,280
they are see this one these are small

183
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,199
these are small i'm going to leave them

184
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,160
this is small this is still growing

185
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,080
there's one back over here i'll take and

186
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,199
this one right here and that's it

187
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,199
and i'm going to leave that on there and

188
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,720
it's going to grow back and a couple

189
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,280
weeks it's going to be another big plant

190
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,440
again

191
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,919
so i have a perpetual sea of green

192
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,360
constantly harvesting from my garden

193
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,360
and one thing you want to do too when

194
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,120
you take your plants in and you clean

195
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,120
them up and you take the stems out make

196
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,440
sure that before you use them

197
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,280
that you soak them in some water about a

198
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,919
gallon half gallon of water fill your

199
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,039
bowl up

200
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:47,280
and put you about a capful of vinegar

201
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,360
regular white vinegar and let it set for

202
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,720
15-20 minutes at least that'll kill all

203
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,080
the germs that are on the plant so if

204
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,560
there's any bacteria

205
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,319
on the plant they're not contaminated

206
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,319
let me show you the spinach

207
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,000
now you can see we're filling this bowl

208
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,479
up we're gonna come back out here we're

209
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,199
gonna get

210
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,479
several more bowls of these filled up

211
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,520
here as we harvest

212
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,759
and we're going to have to end up

213
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,759
freezing a lot of our kale not the

214
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,280
lettuce but the kale freezes very well

215
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,319
and so we'll put it in storage bags and

216
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,039
put it in the freezer

217
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,039
and continue to have kale throughout the

218
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,880
the year and same with spinach get in

219
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,400
here so you can see this

220
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,840
here's the spinach plant some people

221
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,360
just go and they pull this whole plant

222
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,720
up but then you kill the plant

223
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,120
so what we're going to do is we're going

224
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:31,840
to clip just right around the outside

225
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,840
edge and take all these big leaves off

226
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,120
and by doing this we're encouraging new

227
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,120
growth

228
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,560
and we're reusing the same plant we're

229
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,840
not having to wait

230
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,840
a long time

231
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,360
for these plants to produce a new

232
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,400
spinach plant

233
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,080
we're going to continue to clean

234
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,479
everything up and take all the leaves

235
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,240
off

236
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,680
and eventually we're going to be left

237
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,440
with just some plants that

238
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,479
have a few leaves on them in a few weeks

239
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,039
they're going to grow back and we're

240
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,199
going to have

241
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,280
more great greens it's going to be a

242
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,160
perpetual sea of harvest protection sea

243
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,520
of green

244
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,599
