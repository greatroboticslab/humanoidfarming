  "text": "in the Alabama Cooperative Extension system we are in the business of helping people the animal waste and nutrient management team can help producers effectively use the mineral and nutrients within it Alabama Cooperative Extension is my number one go-to and resource from our farming operation our team consists of extension specialists regional agents and agency partners who want to help producers use animal waste in a way which is beneficial both to their farms and the environment our mission is truly to talk about environmental stewardship and what nutrient management should be how nutrient management is a part of environmental stewardship we have a lot of soils in this state that are degraded Souls we've got to figure out those ways that we can be more productive and one of the best ways to do that is to increase soil health and we can do that through wise use of animal manures soil and Mineo testing has great benefits it is important to know not only what you have eaten your soles but also what you are applying to them really common testing on a regular basis by sending samples to a small testing lab like the one here at Auburn University soil testing grip sample is one of the best things you can do you need to know what's going on in your soul and what your needs are we can give you information on efficient use of manure such as when and how much to apply I definitely would say here and on any cropland acres we certainly don't over ply we try to apply enough to get what we need to get as far as yields and and get to the pasture where we need to get it and by using soil tests to try to see if we should or shouldn't apply overflying fertilizer it's not throwing money away but it's not helping the environment you really have to pay attention to your nutrient management there's much to be lost from over-application as there is under application you have to do it wisely we can't start not what we know is being sound environmental stewardship practices and so we can do that we're not here selling anything we have nothing but pre advice to give and so that's what we're all about is helping growers to help themselves and to help the land also there's time certainly that I've called our Regional Extension agent up those are great resources to to help us it helps clear the mind up and answer the question so we've got to produce much more with less we're all working together towards the same goal and we'll get the job done but it's a partnership in between the farmer and extension it's going to help us to get there call or email us and we will help you find the answers you need for more information check out our website or our Facebook page [Music]",
