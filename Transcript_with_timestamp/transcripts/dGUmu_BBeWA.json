  "text": "so supplemental winter feeding uh with uh primarily with hay um one of the things that we do is um it's a lot easier to feed hay this time of year september october early november because we're not as wet so in the barn behind me over here are our fall cows and so they're they're actively calving at this point in time and so we've brought them off of our pastures and we're feeding them hay right now and letting our pastures regrow so that we can stockpile that grass and then once it gets a frost on it it increases the sugar content so whenever these cows are done calving and the first of november we're going to kick them back out of this of this area and they're going to go back out on the fescue pastures which have been stockpiled they've had a frost on them the sugar content is almost through the roof and so they're going to have better nutrition on those fields then when it's wet and it's harder to feed hay in a conservation friendly way so we're feeding the hay here in the barn on concrete we're collecting that manure we're distributing that manure where it needs to go primarily back on hay fields where the hay came from originally and then in the winter time we're not out rutting our fields up by packing hay out into the fields uh we do always have to feed some hay out in the fields and when we do that we use hay rings or we also use uh unrolling so we'll unroll the hay out on the pasture and it depends upon the scenario if it's really soupy and wet if you unroll the hay in our experience you're going to have a tremendous amount of waste and you want to unroll hay basically you want to give them one day's allotment at a time if the ground is not frozen um and so if the ground is not frozen and it's really wet and soupy then you've got to pack hay out every single day to keep it to where you're not losing a bunch of hay so when is when conditions are like that uh we hope to be grazing stockpile uh but if we're not able to graze stock power for whatever reason then we're going to feed hay in rings and so then we can feed maybe a week's amount of hay on one day we can get out there while the ground is frozen early one morning or something but if conditions are right we really like to unroll hay because it spreads those nutrients out in those pastures so much more effectively and i think we get when the conditions are right we get much better utilization of the hay and less waste",
