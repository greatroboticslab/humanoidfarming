2
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,160
right we're here at the hubmer family

3
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:30,480
farm in blue arth County just south of

4
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,280
Mano the hubmer is participate in the

5
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,320
USDA conservation stewardship program

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,280
which promotes sustainable farming

7
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,840
practices they produce non-GMO crops

8
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,320
which they feed to their birkshire Hogs

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,840
and their Freer range chickens I'm Joel

10
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,680
Jones with spnn and in this episode of

11
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,960
Market we're going to find out what

12
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,920
sustainable farming practices mean to

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,920
the land the crops and the

14
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,800
livestock hey

15
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,760
Roger hello first we're going to look at

16
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,400
our new building that we just put up

17
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,920
this spring right on many years in the

18
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,799
making this is a truck she takes to the

19
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,040
farmers

20
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:14,360
market nice big

21
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,880
freezer got everything all indexed where

22
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:20,000
the location of all the meat and

23
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:23,439
everything is right now this is running

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,280
5 below zero in there so it's cold I

25
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:28,560
guess so come on

26
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,000
in these are the chickens here that we

27
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,159
raise different

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,280
sausages all brand new components so

29
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,240
we're pretty happy should last for a

30
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,680
long

31
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,439
time looks pretty state-of-the-art I

32
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,560
mean you're taking your fresh product

33
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:45,040
and it's coming straight from the

34
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,240
butcher into here and then we're getting

35
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,719
it at the St Paul Farmers Market how

36
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,200
about you show us some of the crops

37
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:53,600
outside

38
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:55,880
sure well we were losing quite a lot of

39
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,640
money just selling pigs on the open

40
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:02,560
market so we switched to the direct

41
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:05,560
marketing this is so much more rewarding

42
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,959
to sell to customers that can really

43
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:12,040
appreciate the product that you

44
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,239
have so Roger what is this Ridge tilling

45
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,640
that you keep talking about well Ridge

46
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:19,160
tilling is a type of tillage we use we

47
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,640
don't use the mboard plow chisel plow

48
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:24,879
field culator all we do is is we come in

49
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,440
here I planted these soybeans I actually

50
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,280
planted these soybeans right into

51
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:32,239
standing residue if you can see here

52
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,680
right here is where the old cornrow was

53
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,840
a year ago and I planted it right into

54
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,319
there well you look at all this residue

55
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,879
now what's wrong with that residue why

56
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,519
do we have to get rid of that residue

57
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:44,920
and plow it under no need to run a big

58
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:47,840
300 horsepower tractor to to bury a

59
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,720
residue I got it right there on top hols

60
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,519
down the weeds keeps the moisture in

61
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,640
which is real important in during this

62
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,879
drought season here and eliminates

63
00:02:53,640 --> 00:03:00,400
erosion too because as the raindrops hit

64
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,319
it it doesn't uh wash the soil away

65
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,200
this

66
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:07,360
ground this ground is so soft and mellow

67
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,000
and uh we got it's full of earthworms in

68
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,440
here they do all the ariation for me

69
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,159
makes it very

70
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:17,200
porous and absorbent for water I

71
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:20,480
experimented with it the first year I

72
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:23,239
did it the beans that I had on ridges

73
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,959
yielded four bushel better than the

74
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:29,280
conventionally uh raised beans does it

75
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:31,720
take more expensive equipment less less

76
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,840
less equipment here's here's my Ridge

77
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:39,200
steel cator right here this is an Orman

78
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:41,519
cator and uh here's our cator shovels

79
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,680
that is kind of sunk in the ground and

80
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,840
as you go through it it it cuts the

81
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,439
weeds off plus as the dirts coming these

82
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,840
ridges ridgers here throw the dirt

83
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:54,720
across and that's that healing effect

84
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,439
that I was telling you about and this

85
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,400
this cter here cuts through that that

86
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,720
trash

87
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,280
residue as is going through there so it

88
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,040
doesn't plug up these things here

89
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,599
nobody's Cates anymore with all the

90
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:11,560
Roundup chemicals that are available so

91
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:14,079
I found this for basically the cost of

92
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:17,840
scrap iron I paid $1,500 for this

93
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:20,320
machine new I bet you it would be 25 to

94
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,840
30,000 so do you have to fertilize as

95
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,000
much because of the way you're doing the

96
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,960
ridge till no that's another nice thing

97
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,400
about it too because we do what you call

98
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:31,240
strip till or banding fertilizer we're

99
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,320
going to come in there this fall and

100
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,840
we're going to put our strip of

101
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:38,120
fertilizer right where the corn is going

102
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:40,199
to be planted next year and so that root

103
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:43,080
is going to be right in the fertilizer

104
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:45,039
instead of broadcasting it over the top

105
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:48,240
and we can get by with about 50% of the

106
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:50,240
fertilizer that way I also laid on a

107
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,400
cover crop you can see some of this this

108
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,080
was part of my cover crop this is vetch

109
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:58,520
I planted rye and vet I spread a bunch

110
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,360
of rye and vetch seed out here and then

111
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:03,600
this spring I killed it it and planted

112
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,280
these beans right into it and I don't

113
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,280
think these beans look too bad

114
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,199
considering we're going through one of

115
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,440
the worst droughts we've ever been in

116
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,759
good

117
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:16,240
deal now this here this is our uh manure

118
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,759
storage right here this is some of the

119
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,319
manure that we scrape out of those

120
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,440
gutters in there and it goes down the

121
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,160
gutter and it comes out that tube there

122
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,400
and now when we get our soybean crop off

123
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,360
of here this will all go back in there

124
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:31,479
so if the way I figure it out if I feed

125
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:34,319
150 bushels the corn to the Hogs that

126
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:36,199
much manure goes back on the ground so

127
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,240
whatever we take off the ground we put

128
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:40,440
back on the ground farmers are the

129
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,960
original recyclers Right comes out of

130
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:46,120
the field goes into the bin goes through

131
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,360
the Hogs goes into the pit goes back in

132
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,680
the field that's a that's a recycling

133
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,400
that's what we

134
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,720
do so to get to where you are today it

135
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,440
seems like you've had to do a lot of

136
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,319
adapting and evolving yeah it's

137
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:01,280
something new every day just dreaming

138
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,720
things up uh um up in the yard I got a

139
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,840
picture of the farm the way it used to

140
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,120
look when it was first built in 1920 no

141
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,919
trees no

142
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:13,560
nothing and uh this was originally what

143
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:16,039
it is and we've added to it in the last

144
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,759
92 years looks like you've maintained

145
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:19,440
the foundation of the family farm but

146
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,840
you've added so much more to it and

147
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,240
involved and we really appreciate you

148
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,400
letting us come out here and giving us

149
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:28,400
an inside view of your land stewardship

150
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,360
thank you so much Roger oh you're

151
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:57,749
welcome

152
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:57,749
[Music]

153
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,400
what
