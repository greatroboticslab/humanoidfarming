3
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,780
thanks for everyone for attendance going

4
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:26,300
to talk a little bit about some cover

5
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:29,300
crops today and some things that we've

6
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:31,700
incorporated up on our operation in

7
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:34,610
north central Kansas and a lot of this

8
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:37,550
started really from back in my extension

9
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:39,260
days after out there would go to a lot

10
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,870
of different field days see a lot of

11
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:45,350
presentations on the benefits of cover

12
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:47,960
crops and solve them working in people's

13
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:50,960
rotations for grazing for hanging or

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:53,870
just for increasing soil fertility

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,410
getting more use out of the out of the

16
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:59,780
soil and the moisture especially here in

17
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:02,059
eastern Kansas but I was seeing very

18
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:04,910
little data if any on the economic

19
00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:06,140
returns that was coming from these cover

20
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:08,660
crops because I was seeing a lot of

21
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:11,810
costs that we're incurring from that and

22
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:16,250
so a couple years ago applied for a ser

23
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:19,100
producer grant to kind of look at some

24
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:22,460
different treatments of applications for

25
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:25,159
cover crops there so chose a location on

26
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:27,920
the farm and this is on part of my dad's

27
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:30,619
land through that that you really had

28
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,890
good access obviously to water and pens

29
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:35,299
for grazing because for the grazing

30
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:38,390
component they're just a little bit

31
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:41,600
about the field that I chose it's a

32
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:45,290
continuous we're all kind of farm wide

33
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,509
we were in between 15 that some of our

34
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:51,290
land has been a continuous no-till for

35
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:54,350
20 disobey I just ending the 22nd year

36
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:56,930
through there this particular field had

37
00:01:54,350 --> 00:02:00,409
been in continuous no-till for 15 years

38
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:02,920
I had been in had seen alfalfa and then

39
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:05,570
our typical corn soybeans and wheat

40
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,989
dryland rotation there some slight

41
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:11,780
variation in the field there so we chose

42
00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:15,410
this was this is a 61 acre plot through

43
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:17,329
there and I'd just kind of divided it in

44
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:20,989
thirds a plot for that we were gonna

45
00:02:17,329 --> 00:02:23,299
graze a plot for hanging and then just

46
00:02:20,989 --> 00:02:26,780
apart for you know leaving on the ground

47
00:02:23,299 --> 00:02:31,030
to look at the look at the other piece

48
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:34,870
there so ended up with to differ

49
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:37,450
mixes of cover crop seeds they're very

50
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:40,240
very fortunate to have a neighbor good

51
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:42,910
friend and that by the name of Dale

52
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:46,360
Strickler how works for star seeds he's

53
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:48,880
just down the road from me so I you know

54
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,200
I went to him and said hey what should I

55
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,180
plant here and he gave me all these

56
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:55,720
options and I was like Dale just tell me

57
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:57,250
what to plant and he's a he knows what

58
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:01,569
he's doing when it comes to this stuff

59
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:03,700
so I I I just went with his thing so

60
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:06,400
over the parts for living alone and

61
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:09,310
grazing we went with the mix of 30

62
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,040
pounds of oats 20 pounds of Springfield

63
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:14,470
piece 3 pounds of radishes couple pounds

64
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,870
of turnips and a pound of a forage

65
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:19,180
sorghum through that something we kind

66
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:23,350
of threw in at the end and then for the

67
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:25,630
hade for the hade portion which this

68
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:28,690
makes perfect sense we kept everything

69
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:30,610
the same except we eliminated the radish

70
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:33,370
and the turnips from there because as

71
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:35,470
Dale had experience you know when you're

72
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:37,989
going through if you're swapping your

73
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:40,090
swath or will kick up one of them turn

74
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:42,459
issues or radishes or the baler could

75
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,650
into the win row and if that gets into

76
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:47,049
the Bale that is not good it's gonna rot

77
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:50,079
and probably ruin a good chunk of the

78
00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:54,190
bale so in that in that third I did not

79
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:56,739
have the radishes and the turnips so we

80
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:59,739
planted it into wheat stubble on August

81
00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:02,769
the 6th was kind of a that would have

82
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:06,070
been about three weeks after harvest

83
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:08,530
that year and then in non-typical north

84
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:10,060
central Kansas weather you know you

85
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:12,430
gotta love this you plant something on

86
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:14,980
August 6 thinking this is crazy what's

87
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:18,100
gonna grow on August the 6th and within

88
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:21,010
2 weeks we got 8 inches of rain very not

89
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:23,169
typical for north central Kansas and so

90
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:25,539
you want to talk about optimal rainfall

91
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:28,740
through there and you see that samples

92
00:04:25,539 --> 00:04:31,690
taken i pulled samples on october 14th

93
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:34,479
and this was in this this was in the

94
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:38,890
this was an average of the forage in non

95
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:41,979
forage 18.1 five tons per acre of wet

96
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:43,420
weight through that so we produced a lot

97
00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:45,730
of forage and a very

98
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:47,800
amount of time which is which is just

99
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:49,780
perfect so as you'll see a lot of my

100
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,360
results here I have a few disclaimers in

101
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:54,130
that because actually this past year

102
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,500
would have worked Fri just as well from

103
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:58,240
that but maybe can't think of that as

104
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,190
being your typical results so you're

105
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,040
gonna plant something like this and

106
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:06,700
Kansas in mid-august and get 18 tons of

107
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:10,210
product on acre so let's look at some of

108
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:12,310
our costs here now you see what I have

109
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:14,110
the establishment costs were just the

110
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:16,360
leaving the loan so this is just what it

111
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:19,840
costs to put the crop in the ground I

112
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:22,540
had 15 dollars and 59 cents in

113
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,450
additional chemical application so I did

114
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:27,730
an extra we did an extra roundup burn

115
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:29,230
down on the wheat stubble there so

116
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:32,440
that's the cost of the chemical and

117
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:34,810
application and then as you noticed you

118
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,640
know from that seed mix if you know much

119
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:39,160
about it you're talking about a lot of

120
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:42,880
different sizes of seeds there a lot of

121
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:45,520
different mix and I just felt the most

122
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,460
comfortable our coop up there Aurora

123
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,710
co-op has a really good custom drilling

124
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:52,360
program with the right equipment so I

125
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:54,910
thought that was a good investment so I

126
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:57,070
went ahead and spent the 17 almost 17

127
00:05:54,910 --> 00:06:00,430
and a half bucks an acre to have it

128
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:03,850
custom drilled and then the seed was

129
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:06,820
close to 40 bucks an acre 33 dollars and

130
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:09,460
79 cents for the mix that had the

131
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:11,380
turnips and the radish is there you know

132
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,100
you see the results see the size of my

133
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,830
hand

134
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:16,750
there was tillage radish is much larger

135
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:19,690
than that out there but that what I

136
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:22,480
would call as a pretty typical tillage

137
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:26,430
radish sizes you know more than half of

138
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:29,230
the the width of my hand and went down a

139
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:30,940
substantial amount into the ground a

140
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:33,820
couple of the guys that work for my dad

141
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:35,740
swore as they were going out moving the

142
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:38,380
the fences around in that they're like

143
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:40,270
there's turnips besides volleyballs out

144
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,530
there and I said why don't you bring one

145
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:43,660
back I want to see one of these

146
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:45,820
volleyball sized turnips and one of

147
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:47,890
those never came to fruition in reality

148
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:50,070
but we did have quite a few turnips

149
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:53,260
larger than softballs

150
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:56,949
through that so on the head portion

151
00:06:53,260 --> 00:07:00,310
again so we planted this August the 6th

152
00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:05,439
October the 14th we hate it so this was

153
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:07,419
roughly a 20 1 acre plot got 38 bales

154
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:11,860
just we just put it in round bales

155
00:07:07,419 --> 00:07:15,039
averaging 1,750 pounds each had it

156
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:17,860
tested crude protein value right 16

157
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:20,499
percent relative feed value 150 so I'd

158
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,120
put this right at medium grade alfalfa

159
00:07:20,499 --> 00:07:25,090
there you see pretty pretty

160
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:28,090
healthy-looking wind rose through there

161
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:30,370
no we raked them in that knot we did hit

162
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:33,370
hit it right with getting it put up

163
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:35,080
right before there was too much rain I

164
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:37,659
don't know how much you can see from

165
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:39,939
there we had it froze a lot earlier than

166
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:42,969
it did this year then you see at that

167
00:07:39,939 --> 00:07:45,250
point forage sorghum had already you

168
00:07:42,969 --> 00:07:48,370
know it had gotten burned pretty good by

169
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:50,830
the frost at that point through that and

170
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:53,259
so what did that what does that yield

171
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:56,589
right at one point five nine tons per

172
00:07:53,259 --> 00:08:01,120
acre is what that came out and so at the

173
00:07:56,589 --> 00:08:05,050
time of the that this that this was

174
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:07,810
taken the going price for that grade 150

175
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:11,500
relative feed value alfalfa was right at

176
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:13,659
90 bucks per ton in our area so I assume

177
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:16,120
if you were looking at this as an income

178
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:18,969
per ton type of thing that feeds worth

179
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:21,279
$90 a ton sitting there in that shed and

180
00:08:18,969 --> 00:08:24,789
then I had seventy three dollars and

181
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:29,680
forty cents worth of expenses in that

182
00:08:24,789 --> 00:08:31,689
for net income per ton 1666 and so what

183
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,500
does that do kind of the sensitivity a

184
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:38,919
price is there so again you know we're

185
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:42,010
right here right here in this level from

186
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:44,890
there and if you're just comparing this

187
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:47,350
and taking out any of the soil quality

188
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:49,600
benefits and just looking at paying for

189
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:52,300
the price of your seed the planning and

190
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,959
putting the hay up seeing if you could

191
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:59,019
see them where that would come from you

192
00:08:55,959 --> 00:09:00,910
can afford at that price about seventy

193
00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:03,279
three dollars per ton is what how far

194
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:05,500
down the hay price could be now

195
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,350
unfortunately where we at today up in

196
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:10,240
our area we're here in this 55 maybe

197
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:12,730
sixty dollars per ton REE

198
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,769
as what as what hey would be I think

199
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:17,649
you'd probably be pretty happy if

200
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:20,410
someone came and offered you $60 a ton

201
00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:23,199
for hey right now so maybe you're in 50

202
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:25,600
range and so at this price you know is

203
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:27,939
just kind of take note that you know

204
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:32,350
even given the high yields and some of

205
00:09:27,939 --> 00:09:34,209
this through that you kind of the bottom

206
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:37,389
line would be you can find some cheaper

207
00:09:34,209 --> 00:09:39,160
hey then then what we produced on the

208
00:09:37,389 --> 00:09:41,259
field but that's not and so you need to

209
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,990
weigh in if you're thinking about this

210
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:47,730
for your own operation if that thirty

211
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:52,089
dollars of quote-unquote cost per ton is

212
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:54,069
is really worth as is if you're getting

213
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:56,589
enough benefits from the cover crops

214
00:09:54,069 --> 00:09:58,480
from from that so and you'll see kind of

215
00:09:56,589 --> 00:10:00,100
some slides some subsequent things that

216
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,670
have happened on that form that I think

217
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:05,980
are worth quite quite a good amount and

218
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:08,769
so just kind of the same thing here's

219
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:11,230
where I was at one point five nine tons

220
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:13,720
per acre and then you could substantiate

221
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:16,689
about a twenty percent decrease in yield

222
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:20,679
to still kind of breakeven given those

223
00:10:16,689 --> 00:10:23,709
given those prices that were that were

224
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:28,420
there through that the grazing portion

225
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:33,339
we turned out the first package of

226
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:35,619
steers 58 head they're weighed 858 for

227
00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:39,519
26 days and just the way with my family

228
00:10:35,619 --> 00:10:41,529
we have a background in feedlot up there

229
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,049
and it just kind of how it worked for

230
00:10:41,529 --> 00:10:48,610
the timing of our ranch we ended up

231
00:10:44,049 --> 00:10:50,649
putting two sets of a cattle two on this

232
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:52,869
grazing system just the way things were

233
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:56,319
time so the first package was on there

234
00:10:52,869 --> 00:11:01,740
for 26 days the second package was on

235
00:10:56,319 --> 00:11:04,660
there for 60 days so 86 days of grazing

236
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:07,149
terminated the grazing on January the

237
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:09,879
17th is when those the last day they

238
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:11,649
were out there and then we do supplement

239
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:14,319
you know the the steers were brought

240
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:16,860
into it pen that's where the water was

241
00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:19,839
and everything and they were

242
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:21,759
supplemented with seven pounds of corn

243
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,340
gluten pellets per day every day

244
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:25,770
regardless

245
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:28,520
forage during wet conditions we had some

246
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:31,470
wet days there and you know that is a a

247
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:33,390
working crop field out there that we

248
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:36,630
didn't there was several times I think

249
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:39,210
about eleven days throughout this time

250
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:41,310
period that we did not turn the cattle

251
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:43,410
out and so we provided forage as a

252
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:45,210
supplement feed during that time and

253
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:47,490
then something I never even thought of

254
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:49,950
when I was designing this grant or

255
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:52,020
looking at this project is what did we

256
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:53,910
end up feeding for forage was the hay

257
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:56,280
that we put up in the shed there you

258
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:57,930
know I just it's kind of simple now when

259
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,640
you think about it like of course you

260
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:01,590
would do that but it was just one of

261
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:04,860
those steps I never quite closed that

262
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:06,270
loop until you know we were thinking

263
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,220
this through and hey we can't turn the

264
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:10,050
cattle out well there is a shed full of

265
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:13,020
hay that's that same crop that's up

266
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:15,150
there so it really it worked out at just

267
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:17,540
that really worked out neat to have that

268
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:21,180
that portion of the of the hade part

269
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:25,830
through that so so that's the piece

270
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:28,890
there so you look at 58 head total over

271
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:32,610
86 days of grazing and the average daily

272
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:35,700
gain on these cattle 2.13 pounds per day

273
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:39,090
so so it was really there and if we just

274
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:42,120
kind of normalize that put it on over

275
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:43,820
across the 58 head there was pounds of

276
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:48,540
gain per head right over a little over

277
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:52,710
183 pounds of gain we got during this 86

278
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:55,080
day time period there and so the total

279
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:58,320
cost this doesn't obviously include the

280
00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:01,590
cost of livestock but the cost of the

281
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:04,410
you know the cover crops valuing the

282
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:07,560
forage that we did there the the pellets

283
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:10,380
we even calculated some some yardage

284
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:13,350
costs and then even some I calculated

285
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:16,680
what the labor was for to to put up the

286
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:19,950
electric fence and to move it I costed

287
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:23,190
everything out on that had about a cost

288
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:26,820
per head for this 86 days right under

289
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:29,430
124 bucks a head put that down to how

290
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:32,250
many pounds we gained cost per pound of

291
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:35,340
gain 68 cents per pound there and that

292
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:36,329
stood up against any any package of

293
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:38,189
cattle we had

294
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:42,059
year you know as being the most

295
00:13:38,189 --> 00:13:44,819
economical way to put gain on cattle now

296
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:46,529
you'll notice I've just I chose just for

297
00:13:44,819 --> 00:13:49,619
a lot of reasons there's a lot of things

298
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:51,959
if you remember what cattle prices were

299
00:13:49,619 --> 00:13:54,749
a year ago they were they're in a lot

300
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:57,329
better situation than then now a lot of

301
00:13:54,749 --> 00:13:59,939
things have changed in since so just for

302
00:13:57,329 --> 00:14:01,860
as a fairness and to just go out there

303
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:04,799
I've just decided to kind of report from

304
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:07,399
this cost per pounds of gain because you

305
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:10,319
can imagine what we were what we were

306
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:13,999
selling cattle for then this this was a

307
00:14:10,319 --> 00:14:17,220
pretty profitable type of operation

308
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:19,379
through that and so but I really just

309
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:21,269
chose to focus on this is the bottom

310
00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:24,480
line is a pretty efficient way to put

311
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:27,389
that and again I want to put some

312
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:30,509
caution out there we had really optimal

313
00:14:27,389 --> 00:14:32,579
rainfall and high cattle prices that

314
00:14:30,509 --> 00:14:36,449
year because this worked very well was a

315
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:38,429
great was a great Innes pretty large

316
00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:40,619
scale experiment and report and I've

317
00:14:38,429 --> 00:14:43,350
enjoyed learning a lot and reporting it

318
00:14:40,619 --> 00:14:46,499
and enjoyed continuing this you know

319
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:48,989
without the help of the grant on other

320
00:14:46,499 --> 00:14:50,790
parts of our operation but but there's

321
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:52,679
always just some caution I want to lay

322
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:55,470
out there with that and then some

323
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:59,129
lessons learned so the following May

324
00:14:55,470 --> 00:15:01,860
received nine inches of rain I an about

325
00:14:59,129 --> 00:15:06,600
the course of four hours on that field

326
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:09,689
and that was it was something else a lot

327
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:12,059
of people a lot of people lost a lot of

328
00:15:09,689 --> 00:15:14,579
ground there was some significant gully

329
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:17,639
erosion in portions of that field but

330
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:20,040
compared to you saw you know how good of

331
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:21,029
a how good so it's tough to see this

332
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,009
picture I'm sorry

333
00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:25,439
but this is a portion that's hade so

334
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:27,749
it's pretty far down this is after the

335
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:29,519
grazing had done and the steers that had

336
00:15:27,749 --> 00:15:31,799
good run of it and it was still pretty

337
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,850
still had quite a bit of growth there

338
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:38,879
there was so much there holding the soil

339
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:40,230
there it's pretty tough for - it's

340
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:42,600
pretty hard to imagine what would have

341
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:44,939
happened without that and then there's

342
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,889
surprisingly little regrowth after the

343
00:15:44,939 --> 00:15:49,559
hang you know we hade that stuff in

344
00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:49,800
October and you know it's waft it we

345
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:51,420
didn't

346
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:55,529
soif it down as low as you would like

347
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:57,930
alfalfa or that regular we we we've had

348
00:15:55,529 --> 00:16:00,060
the header of the swather up a bit but I

349
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:01,620
figured there'd be some regrowth in that

350
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:03,080
because it wasn't like in the dead of

351
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:05,790
winter yet you know obviously

352
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:09,990
mid-october so is interesting they're

353
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:11,790
surprising little regrowth and very very

354
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:13,500
little to know that's always the

355
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:16,110
thousand dollar question people with

356
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:19,920
cover crops hey can you attribute any

357
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:22,560
you know decline increase in the

358
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:25,589
following year's crops we planted corn

359
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,690
on that next year and there was no there

360
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:30,470
was no impact on corn yield but then

361
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:33,959
again had did have adequate rainfall and

362
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:36,329
I will say what was interesting about

363
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:39,420
this is it's my farm that's across the

364
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:41,670
road from this tract of land and we were

365
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:43,980
always on the same rotation schedule of

366
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:47,670
that and then obvious on my farm across

367
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:49,890
the road when the combine left my farm

368
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:52,890
there was not a single bit of activity

369
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:55,200
on that farm until the following April

370
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:57,089
when the corn planter went in and you

371
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,130
see all what we got off of the field

372
00:16:57,089 --> 00:17:02,399
across the road because of this cover

373
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:06,120
crop activity which is really neat I

374
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:09,800
think use of the resources of course

375
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:12,569
this is a year especially where the

376
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:15,059
wonderful my technical term the pigweed

377
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:17,429
Palmer amaranth is very present up in

378
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:20,370
north central Kansas and people have

379
00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:22,319
asked about that because you know it is

380
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:25,500
worth especially if you're gonna follow

381
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:27,329
a cover crop after wheat you know

382
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,580
there's you have to watch your herbicide

383
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:31,800
program in your wheat because a lot of

384
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:34,830
the herbicides have a residual effect

385
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:36,870
will impact the the crops the next year

386
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:38,880
and so so you can't you have to use a

387
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:42,300
different herbicide program on that

388
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,460
wheat and I can't say that there were

389
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:47,100
any additional we had any additional

390
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:49,320
weed pressure or any last weed pressure

391
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:52,230
ice but you know I never went out and

392
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:54,690
did an official account that's just

393
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:58,530
pretty much a it's very unofficial serv

394
00:17:54,690 --> 00:18:01,080
way there so so no impacts on on weeds

395
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:03,100
on either side of that but you know I do

396
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:06,280
know and I've heard of people look

397
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:08,679
at cover crop mix this is specifically

398
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:11,320
for weed suppression that just wasn't

399
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:12,880
really the goal of this and so that's

400
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:17,410
kind of I think that's the last slide I

401
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:19,720
had I had there like I said was this was

402
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:21,850
a great appreciated the opportunity for

403
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,070
the sare grant to kind of get our foot

404
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:27,549
in the door pay for a little bit of the

405
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:29,890
seeding costs and that and and we're

406
00:18:27,549 --> 00:18:33,820
gonna continue to use them we had the

407
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:36,820
chance to have have a field day with

408
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:39,580
about 75 people on site the day we were

409
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:42,070
swapping the cover crop and then I've

410
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:43,240
just had the opportunity throughout my

411
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:45,580
travels to give this presentation

412
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,640
several times sit down with different

413
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:50,200
producer groups so it's been it's been a

414
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:53,309
neat learning experience and look

415
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,309
forward to looking somewhere

416
00:18:54,980 --> 00:19:01,940
so the question was obviously we fed the

417
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:05,060
steer seven pounds of of corn gluten per

418
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:08,410
day and like any typical economist here

419
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:18,740
I will just give you a quick calculation

420
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:21,980
off of what that was so I would say

421
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:24,500
about fourteen cents fourteen cents -

422
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:28,610
that would be so that is that's not even

423
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:30,710
hardly 25% of that so that was given

424
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:32,990
corn gluten prices then which I'm sure I

425
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:35,690
know they've went down since there so

426
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:36,920
about 14 cents of that so that's just

427
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:40,490
part of our operation

428
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:41,900
I do give my grandfather and my dad some

429
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:43,790
grief I asked them if they're in the

430
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:46,370
catering business or in the cattle

431
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:48,770
feeding business because they do we do

432
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:50,450
tend to have some good forage some good

433
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:52,790
products like that in north central

434
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:55,220
Kansas but they're firm believer and

435
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:58,190
some supplemental feed and it's I know

436
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:59,870
it's not necessary but I I know where to

437
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,440
pick my battles and I'm not gonna win

438
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:03,350
that one

439
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:06,740
and the question was really quantifying

440
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:08,600
that value of the soil health and if I

441
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:11,540
could think of a way especially in a

442
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:13,910
one-year time frame like this to put on

443
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:15,920
some specific value I would have I would

444
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:19,610
have included it I love crunching

445
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:21,380
numbers and and and things like that

446
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:24,590
and so we're just kind of looking

447
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:27,470
long-term seeing what those you know we

448
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:30,410
grid and have you know you know utilize

449
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:32,510
precision AG and that and then have new

450
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:34,550
regular soil samples so I'm just keeping

451
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:38,450
track of these fields that have this

452
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:41,480
have additional have a cover crop

453
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:43,280
rotation worked into that to see to see

454
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,290
where we're at there but I think a lot

455
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:49,640
of the I think a lot of the values are

456
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:52,910
that you know especially and all systems

457
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:54,770
because even the cattle didn't the

458
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:57,680
cattle didn't capture all of those

459
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:59,450
turnips and radishes but that was you go

460
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:01,070
out there and the you know the next

461
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:03,350
spring and that's something like another

462
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:05,360
question I get at a pretty harsh winter

463
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:07,640
that year didn't have any problems with

464
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,580
regrowth that just all natural

465
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,420
winter killed everything everything I

466
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,370
did

467
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:15,890
but you up there in the spring when it

468
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:18,830
was heating up and it it smells pretty

469
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:21,290
strong out there it smells like cattle

470
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:23,690
taking off a turnips you ever had the

471
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:25,520
joy of experiencing that smell and

472
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:28,250
that's what it smelled with no cattle

473
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,740
out there and then let alone the the

474
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:33,710
wonderful nutrients the cattle were

475
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:36,290
spreading throughout there and there's

476
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:40,310
definitely there's definitely a value to

477
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:43,250
that and even if it would come up to you

478
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:45,740
know 10% of your overall nutritional or

479
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:47,480
you know soil soul requirements through

480
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:50,060
there it would be it would be pretty

481
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:51,920
significant but verdicts still out I

482
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:53,810
wish I could put a number that this is

483
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,400
how much fertilizer was saved through

484
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:57,860
that and it's just not that not that

485
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:00,150
simple of a I can't give you an answer I

486
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:04,029
feel comfortable enough on that so
