00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,400
We brought you a brand new tractor. No

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,240
way. Now, instead of people doing manual

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,240
work like this, they can instead just

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,880
use this tractor. What previously took

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,960
45 minutes will now just take 45

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,799

programs doesn't mean food just

11
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,519
magically spawns out of thin air. The

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,720
food has to come from somewhere. And in

13
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,720
this case, it's coming from the

14
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,359
increased yield on this tractor across
