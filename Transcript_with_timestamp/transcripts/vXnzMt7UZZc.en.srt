1
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:20,199
more good couldn't go much further back

2
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,720
without opening the garage so I've been

3
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:25,560
dealing with this flat

4
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:28,800
tire for too long and um took my own

5
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,880
advice got some flat out so we showed

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,279
the uh the multi-seal version this is

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,600
like the small little gallons for

8
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:38,360
smaller tires but um multi-seal we had

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,800
Rick out about a year ago I guess it was

10
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,399
and he brought a whole test tire that he

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,719
takes to all of his shows and uh just

12
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,000
traveling around the country and doing

13
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:47,640
things with and it's just mounted to

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,039
like a receiver on the back of his on

15
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,320
the back of his truck and he takes like

16
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,640
a railroad spike or something a big old

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,879
Spike and just hammers it in the tire

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,719
like he's got hundreds and hundreds of

19
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,559
punctures in there and it just doesn't

20
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,440
leak it holds air it's just crazy and so

21
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:04,720
we finally got some of this stuff I need

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,520
to use it I've actually had my my arrows

23
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,400
out here just refilling it on the random

24
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,280
times that I I come use it and just fill

25
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,920
it back up and then it goes flat by the

26
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,400
next day every time so we're going to do

27
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:18,400
something about that today I Boston flat

28
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:21,119
out you can save 5% with code GWT on

29
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,360
that we'll put a link to their website

30
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,400
um comes with the stuff you need to do

31
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,640
and

32
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,200
basically if you get a lot of flat tires

33
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,119
like I do I should put this in every

34
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,600
single thing machine that I have I just

35
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,560
haven't

36
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,360
yet they've got a version on the

37
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,759
multi-seal website that actually mixes

38
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,560
with liquid Ballance like rard as well

39
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,720
so you can put it in an air fill Tire or

40
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,759
with a liquid fil

41
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,159
Tire pretty cool

42
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,439
stuff but I sick and tired of dealing

43
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,159
with this

44
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:53,640
flat so

45
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:55,680
hopefully this takes care of

46
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,520
it comes with everything you see here

47
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,840
you can buy it in different sizes for

48
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,280
different

49
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,680
tires this I think would fill if I

50
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,719
remember right would fill all four of

51
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:08,160
these tires on this uh

52
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:09,640
UTV if I filled all four but right now

53
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,160
we're going to do one and then um I'll

54
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,520
feel the paint again next time I get a

55
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,920
flat although we've been using that mini

56
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,000
dump primarily so what I'm doing well

57
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,760
let me tell you the instructions there

58
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,360
only five steps I think it was rotate

59
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,160
the tire so the valve stem is near the

60
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,440
top that's what we just got done doing

61
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,519
remove the valve core with the tool

62
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,200
provided and allow the tire to deflate

63
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:30,840
fully I think we're already at that

64
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,840
point but we'll we got to get the valve

65
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:38,040
core out of there so we can fill it up

66
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:39,879
then you attach this um pump fill it up

67
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,640
remove the hose replace the valve core

68
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:46,239
inflate to the recommended pressure and

69
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,440
re re uh re put the the

70
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,959
valve cap back on let me put that

71
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:54,239
somewhere I'm not going to lose

72
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,599
it it just has little grooves it's got

73
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,560
two sizes or two add two sizes and two

74
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:02,560
sides with a Groove in

75
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,560
there just just put the right one in

76
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:09,720
there a little bit of air but not much

77
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:12,640
left okay so that's our valve

78
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:15,120
core all right don't want to lose that

79
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,760
we'll put that in the same bag put our

80
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,760
tool back in

81
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,159
there put that on there I don't think we

82
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,159
need that though do

83
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:31,680
we I'll leave it down there sure why

84
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,680
not

85
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,680
there put that in

86
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:54,599
there okay so it says um one pump equals

87
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,599
1

88
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,840
o and in a a tire 27 in are smaller use

89
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,079
32

90
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,760
oz I guess I should double check that I

91
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:09,720
think I did before but I should double

92
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,439
check cuz 32 o 64 then double 128 I feel

93
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:15,560
like that's what it was going to be for

94
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:17,959
this this whole thing so anyway um 1 o

95
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,759
per stroke so 32

96
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:23,160
Strokes for 32

97
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:26,240
ounces the difference between flat out

98
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,199
and the competition up to a/ in seals

99
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,639
punctures up to a/ in compared to a/ qu

100
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:32,000
inch from the competition single

101
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:34,199
treatment works for 10 plus years versus

102
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,600
up to a couple years clean up stays

103
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:38,680
liquid easy clean up with water versus

104
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,320
latex or adhesive base becomes a sticky

105
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,680
mess so it's got some advantages there

106
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,000
let's do

107
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,880
it so I got to put this on here like

108
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,280
this and it's not going to spill all out

109
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,280
I guess this fits right on doesn't

110
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:58,120
it let's get that right on there all the

111
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:00,199
way that's as far as that can go

112
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,199
huh make sure that that sound there that

113
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:05,000
part already came on you ready see if

114
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,120
this works watch it fill up the

115
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,960
tube oh we got to wait I'm not going to

116
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,160
count so it's not there it's almost

117
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:24,919
there I'll count okay so there it's

118
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:32,639
there now one two 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

119
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:34,280
13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 that's 20 wow it

120
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:44,360
does see I mean that's just 1 o per pump

121
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:46,560
huh 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31

122
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,919
32

123
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,919
okay so I got to take that out and then

124
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:51,919
replace the valve

125
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:05,560
core here can you can you show them that

126
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:07,720
see how that that uh the end is you know

127
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,039
it's not round so this can fit right

128
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,120
around there you see how that works so I

129
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:13,440
can grab

130
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:17,280
it

131
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,280
spin is that how I

132
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:23,240
uh that must be the end that went in

133
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:25,319
though oh yeah okay that goes this part

134
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,960
goes this part goes all the way into the

135
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:30,120
tire on the

136
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:33,560
inside and then I'm just fitting those

137
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,560
RS right in

138
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:40,280
there

139
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,280
okay is this going to make a big

140
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:53,280
mess not a big mess that's

141
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,280
nice

142
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,960
okay get this on

143
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:04,440
here

144
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:10,160
see if we can get that to twist back

145
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:13,919
in okay so far this has been pretty

146
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:16,639
easy okay that's on there nice and

147
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:21,039
tight put my oh we don't want to put the

148
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:23,400
cap on yet um next up we got a filler

149
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,400
full of

150
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
air

151
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:55,560
okay well that's it okay so this part's

152
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:57,120
the easy part right I'll know by this

153
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,759
time tomorrow I'd know when I wake up

154
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,599
tomorrow if it actually works or not it

155
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,759
didn't say anything about driving around

156
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:07,560
like to you know like get it

157
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,800
to fill out or anything like that which

158
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,120
I still feel like I might do that

159
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,280
anyways just because it seems like it

160
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,800
would make sense even if it even if they

161
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,080
don't talk about it the other thing I

162
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,759
don't know about is we did add 32 liquid

163
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,360
ounces in there so that is more weight

164
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:22,479
that's in this side versus the other

165
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:25,520
side now almost feel like it would be a

166
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,800
smart move to put it in the other side

167
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,599
so it's balanced out maybe that only

168
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,440
matters at higher speed applications I'm

169
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,919
not sure cuz this is I think they have

170
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,279
low speed and high speed applications

171
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:36,560
you'll see on their website um it'll

172
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,399
it'll go through all that so we don't

173
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,039
sell this stuff but you can go to uh the

174
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,159
Flatout website and the multi-seal

175
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:45,600
website and and get a pump that's super

176
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,920
handy like really that wasn't very hard

177
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,560
so as long as this works which we'll

178
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,120
find out here um because otherwise it'll

179
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,399
be flat it fixes most types of punctures

180
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,920
right I mean I don't know what type of

181
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,680
issue I have that's leaking out right

182
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,720
now there are certain things that it I
