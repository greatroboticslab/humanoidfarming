  "text": "Farmers need to provide nutrients like nitrogen for their crops to grow. However, farmers often struggle to determine the right amount of nitrogen for optimal plant growth. And too much nitrogen may have unwanted side-effects How can they be avoided? Generally, nitrogen provided to plants falls into two broad categories: Organic and inorganic. Inorganic nitrogen, also called mineral nitrogen, consists of small molecules, whereas organic nitrogen is made up of larger and more complex molecules found in things like compost, plant residues, or the soil itself. When you supply inorganic nitrogen to soil, it is easily available to plants - so the plants can use them fast. Organic nitrogen, however, needs time to break down into forms that plants can use. Not all inorganic nitrogen gets used by plants immediately. Since it is very mobile, inorganic nitrogen that was not taken up can leave the soil ...and cause problems. For example, too much nitrogen can cause excessive algae growth, which can harm fish. It can also lead to release of powerful \u200bgreenhouse gases called nitrous oxide or amonia. Monitoring excessive nitrogen can prevent over-fertilization, help farmers use fertilizers more effectively and reduce pollution while still ensuring high yield.",
