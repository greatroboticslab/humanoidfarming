3
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:18,450
a gross weight and welcome everyone to a

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,420
great backyard garden with me

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:23,070
Michel junus waist thank you for those

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,360
of you who have congratulated me on

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,830
becoming the chairman of the collar

8
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,930
village council thank you very very much

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,400
if you watch in Perm to choose the video

10
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,920
you would have seen that I uploaded a

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,900
video where someone sent me a video to

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,850
react to and I reacted to where someone

13
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:38,670
actually wear nifty odd does I believe

14
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,140
they took bottles and they cut off the

15
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,090
top of the bottle so what they did they

16
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,940
took bottles I cut off the top of one

17
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:47,129
bottle they drilled a hole in the cover

18
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,719
of another and let's imagine that is not

19
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:50,910
here and they put it in this like that

20
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,340
we for Fred or string or rope come out

21
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,559
from this bottle of water going up to

22
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,110
this model to be plants this was a self

23
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:00,390
watering technique and I thought it was

24
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:02,370
very very innovative and I thought to

25
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,840
myself perhaps I can do this but in a

26
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,550
different way let me just tell you why

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,039
this happens or why this can work

28
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:10,470
whether you use the water the rope up or

29
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:13,649
down the things that once there's a way

30
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:17,569
for water to travel or to go through it

31
00:01:13,649 --> 00:01:19,140
will pass when you have the soil on top

32
00:01:17,569 --> 00:01:20,580
it will dry out

33
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,009
eventually I plan to take up the

34
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,380
moisture or Sun or point is it a gel on

35
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,030
top and there's water below and there's

36
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,429
a medium a way for the waters to work

37
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,319
now water will move from an area of high

38
00:01:29,429 --> 00:01:32,729
concentration to low concentration as

39
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:35,490
long as there's a way for it to go

40
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:36,979
through so even if we population this

41
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,910
technique kurosu without the work

42
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:41,490
evaporation will happen and water will

43
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:43,890
go up rise even if the water do not rise

44
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:45,630
because of the whoop do because this is

45
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,250
filled water and the top will be drying

46
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,209
out constantly because the plants be

47
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,580
taken in moisture

48
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:52,920
now water will move from the high

49
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,720
concentration up the rope to the low

50
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,399
concentration and this is how to work

51
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,410
and simply happening with this technique

52
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,759
so I'm just gonna show you exactly what

53
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,500
I did I'll show you the result because

54
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,039
it did work and I will tell you more

55
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,810
about it

56
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:07,110
let's go ahead I fill this up of water

57
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:09,300
and then I use a cotton cloth or batsto

58
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:12,060
wheel drive a lot of cotton I think this

59
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:15,900
is mini cotton I roll it up and then I

60
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:17,849
put piece another soil here and then

61
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,500
this part here now what happened is

62
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:20,790
because what I'll move from an area of

63
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,580
high concentration to low concentration

64
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:25,740
as I told you meaning there is extremely

65
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,270
wet moist and that was dry so the water

66
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,790
came up

67
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:30,590
dry cloth when done the dry cloth and

68
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:33,860
will work faster because of gravity and

69
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:37,730
went in here now as you can see this

70
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:39,350
part is dry and this part is wet so this

71
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:41,600
goes to show that the water is moving

72
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:44,390
constantly from an area of high

73
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,970
concentration down the cloth which is

74
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:50,210
like a medium this is what it used to go

75
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:53,600
down or what I was doing I had a stick

76
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:55,340
on the hill hold on because what

77
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,920
happened is a limb just see if I can

78
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:59,600
find a way right I had to use this stick

79
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,630
to keep the cloth off of the peel

80
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:04,460
because similar to domina the water was

81
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:07,100
going on on sub-wavelength is going in

82
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:08,720
the instead right so this is an idea I

83
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,280
can walk off pretty well I'm quite sure

84
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,960
just by watching that you might because

85
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,670
for me to be in the Old Market Garden I

86
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:16,790
let me just show you already a tomato

87
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:18,710
here right here started to sprout so as

88
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:21,680
you can see this dry let's your idea is

89
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:23,390
now if you notice the top is dry but the

90
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,770
bottom is wet what has happen is that

91
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:27,110
the water is slowly moving from an area

92
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:28,760
of higher concentration which is here to

93
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:30,800
lower concentration obviously to start

94
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,600
from the bottom and adventure the top

95
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,860
will become the top here which is dry

96
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,050
will eventually look like this here

97
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:37,880
which is moist but this idea can work

98
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,440
pretty well as I told you I saw this on

99
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,330
even to Tuesday when I reacted to the

100
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,680
video and I thought to myself I can try

101
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:44,810
this or know what I'm going to do I'm

102
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,150
going to try it out in my plan to stand

103
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:50,209
right here I'm gonna try it out right

104
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:53,690
here so I'm gonna try to find a way to

105
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:55,520
put in a pail of water here I'm on the

106
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:59,240
next end over there and then have a

107
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:01,880
cloth right here lying down or maybe I

108
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:05,030
might put it from here to here so that

109
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:07,459
the water and coming from the peel up

110
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:09,080
here come down on here and I have

111
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:11,540
another peels over here so this area

112
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,340
because the moist and obviously like I

113
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,110
will put the cloth to pass between hand

114
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,549
here so no matter what moisture mantle

115
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:19,130
good I could to the plant but because

116
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:21,470
they'll be moist the water be passing so

117
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:23,840
this is an idea I think that can pretty

118
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:26,840
well and it's very comical because you

119
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,340
can feel a continent water and you don't

120
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,840
need to come and watch it every two days

121
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,250
or three days if you have enough if you

122
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,440
have a big enough peel either to only

123
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:35,810
this lasted about what three to four

124
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,610
days and it's extremely hot in the green

125
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:40,050
ah so I think we should also take into

126
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,819
consideration that evaporation

127
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:43,620
been happening but it's not as constant

128
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:45,810
of course because we can see that it

129
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,430
worked if that was dry then we can say

130
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:49,830
okay the water here disappeared from

131
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:53,490
evaporation in the atmosphere but here

132
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:55,050
is extremely moist its moist it's more

133
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:56,550
sense working so I wanna encourage you

134
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,629
of course obviously there isn't too long

135
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,280
and I'm talking too much

136
00:04:57,629 --> 00:05:01,409
but please be encouraged that you should

137
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,409
try out this idea find a way with your

138
00:05:01,409 --> 00:05:07,710
bucket garden to try this idea and being

139
00:05:04,409 --> 00:05:10,199
innovative be very creative in using out

140
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:11,580
this idea because of course guys I hope

141
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:12,780

144
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:17,069
choose the easier the video that you

145
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:18,780
