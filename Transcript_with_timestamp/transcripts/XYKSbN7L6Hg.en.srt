summer Gardens farmers markets and

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,460
closer to the food that we're eating

4
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:10,080
knowing exactly where the beef in our

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,340
magic to something we have a tendency to

8
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,199
take for granted but is it possible for

9
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,670
personal Gardens and local producers to

no matter how you get the food you eat

one thing is for certain that process

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,440
looks immensely different than anything

20
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:52,200
we could have predicted 10 000 years ago

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,239
or even a hundred years ago imagine with

22
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,100
me living in a time where the only real

23
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,320
access to food was whatever the family

24
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,360
had growing in the yard could trade with

25
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,820
close neighbors or relatives or had

26
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:05,519
storage from previous seasons and what

27
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,740
about a time where you had no home or no

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,540
crop to harvest where everything you ate

29
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,880
came from hunting and Gathering

30
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,040
today an ever-changing web of food

31
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,260
products ensures that there is a near

32
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,720
constant supply of easily accessible

33
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:20,640
food this was removed most of the

34
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,820
regionality dependence on growing season

35
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,979
and unpredictability that was for a very

36
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,140
long time associated with food

37
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:29,759
availability after Decades of

38
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,280
infrastructure and development our food

39
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,280
supply chain has morphed from local

40
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,560
operations to a global Enterprise

41
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,659
according to USDA reports the United

42
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,880
States is the world's second largest

43
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,020
agriculture Trader behind the European

Union

45
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:49,560
in 2022 agriculture products accounted

46
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:53,040
for 196 billion dollars in exports more

47
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,020
than triple the 62.8 billion from 1997.

48
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,420
a large portion of exports are what the

49
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:00,600
USDA considers high value products or

50
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:03,420
hpvs these include dairy products Meats

51
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,219
fruits and vegetables these massive

52
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,439
increases in agriculture exports have

53
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:09,899
been made possible by increasing demand

54
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,580
and elimination of trade barriers trade

55
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,140
barriers to Canada and Mexico were

56
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,300
eliminated by the North American Free

57
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:18,360
Trade Agreement or NAFTA which made it

58
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,580
possible to quadruple exports to both of

59
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,379
those countries even the products that

60
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,480
stay in the U.S are destined for travel

61
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:27,120
for example let's think about a fan

62
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,459
favorite chicken whether it's nuggets

63
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,319
wings or whole Birds if you're eating

64
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:32,940
chicken grown in America there's a

65
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,920
strong possibility that it was grown

66
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:37,319
right here in Georgia where we produce

67
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,099
the most meat chickens in any state in

68
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:40,440
the country

69
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:42,180
this enhanced international market for

70
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,280
agriculture products has offered

71
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,920
American farmers a new outlet to impact

72
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,480
food supply globally as well as a

73
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,760
stronger sense of security and their

74
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,760
ability to sell their end products but

75
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,560
it's not without its own problems from

76
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,540
Transportation shortages to trade

77
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,400
agreements producers are impacted by

78
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,440
issues that arise at all levels of this

79
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,420
intricate supply chain along with the

80
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,000
normal risks associated with producing

81
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:09,000
High volumes of crops or livestock like

82
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,040
disease and natural disasters this

83
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,200
doesn't begin to cover the social and

84
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,860
cultural challenges producers are facing

85
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,239
as consumer Intrigue and backlash grows

86
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:19,800
recently the agriculture industry has

87
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,959
been facing a new question from

88
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,540
consumers how do we know that our food

89
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:26,400
is safe and nutritious although This

90
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,680
Global Food Market has opened new doors

91
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,239
for producers consumers have begun to

92
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,739
question whether or not they can trust

93
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,140
the food that they're buying at the

94
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:36,840
grocery store due to high volumes being

95
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:39,360
produced the many stops it makes between

96
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,680
the farm and the kitchen tables and the

97
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,500
environmental impact from commercial

98
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,180
production these concerns have paved the

99
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,159
way for what some may consider a

100
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,080
revolution of local eaters and

101
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:51,239
homesteaders who believe that growing

102
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,980
your own food or buying from a trusted

103
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:55,080
local producer can provide an

104
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,760
alternative this way you know not only

105
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:59,640
where your food came from but also

106
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,680
exactly who grew it and how as this

107
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:04,019
demand for presumably higher quality

108
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,019
food source has grown dedicated Facebook

109
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:09,659
groups farmers markets on-farm stores

110
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:12,180
and roadside stands have steadily

111
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:13,920
increased in number now instead of going

112
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,620
to the grocery store and buying a steak

113
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,660
that came from somewhere in the U.S

114
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,120
there's an option to buy beef from a

115
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:23,820
producer 20 miles away and know exactly

116
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,340
what the animal was fed it's breed and

117
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:29,520
where it was raised and consumers are

118
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:31,440
loving it in fact more than nine billion

119
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,199
dollars in agriculture Revenue could be

120
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,940
attributed to local cells a fresh and

121
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:38,400
value-added products like butter and

122
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,560
cheese in 2020. within this movement

123
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,660
there are some with more drastic beliefs

124
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,820
that locally grown food is the only

125
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:48,540
option to ensure safety sustainability

126
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:50,520
and nourishment but is that an option if

127
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,800
we wanted to could we go back to a time

128
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,139
where Global Enterprise didn't determine

129
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,900
our food supply could we feed ourselves

130
00:04:55,139 --> 00:05:00,240
solely through local sales and trade

131
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:01,860
let's take a closer look estimations can

132
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,800
be made for the amount of land needed to

133
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,180
provide food for a single person based

134
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,400
on nutritional need

135
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,320
conservative estimates say that one

136
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,860
person can produce enough fruits and

137
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:17,040
vegetables for a year on about 3.25

138
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,660
Acres now before we go any further let's

139
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,880
remember that this number doesn't take

140
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:23,039
into account any crop losses or

141
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,740
inopportune weather conditions which is

142
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:28,560
not uncommon when growing food in the

143
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:32,840
United States alone the 2022 census

144
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:35,840
reported 333 million 287

145
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:39,539
557 people but for Simplicity we'll use

146
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,340
333 million if each person needs 3.25

147
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:43,860
Acres that would mean a grand total of

148
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:45,660
over a billion acres of land at first

149
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,160
glance that seems like it wouldn't be a

150
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,800
problem since the United States covers

151
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,479
more than 2.3 billion Acres the

152
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,039
complicated part of the equation is when

153
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:56,340
you start to consider space already

154
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:58,560
covered by cities bodies of water homes

155
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:01,259
and land that's not suitable for growing

156
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,539
food like mountains deserts and marshes

157
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:05,220
taking all this into account you start

158
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:07,620
to realize that the land mass we have

159
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:10,139
available to us is simple simply not

160
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,539
enough for us to grow substantial enough

161
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:13,919
food supply for us all to feed ourselves

162
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:16,199
without some form of commercial

163
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:19,259
Agriculture and this is a theme that's

164
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:21,780
echoed globally the truth is there's not

165
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:23,639
a simple or a single answer for some

166
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:26,639
growing their own food is a way of life

167
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:28,860
a passion and a sustainable practice but

168
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,080
for others this may not ever be an

169
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:33,120
option because of time space and

170
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,819
physical ability there are even folks

171
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,680
like me that lie somewhere in between I

172
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:39,720
grow a summer garden and love every bit

173
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,240
of food it provides for me my family and

174
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,220
my friends I never shy away from an

175
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,039
opportunity to support a local producer

176
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:48,900
but I also value the ability to walk

177
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,819
into a grocery store and purchase the

178
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,780
things I wouldn't otherwise be able to

179
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:53,759
enjoy

180
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:55,680
we live at a time where food has become

181
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,780
incredibly more accessible than it was

182
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,520
for Generations before us we're

183
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,560
connected to Global Market simply

184
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,180
through the food that we eat and we're

185
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,220
lucky to have the opportunity to make a

186
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,020
choice between growing our own foods and

187
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,360
buying the food provided for us by

188
