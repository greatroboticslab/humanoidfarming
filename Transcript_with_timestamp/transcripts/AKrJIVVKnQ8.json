  "text": "Oh [Music] in two villages in Zimbabwe school attendance in recent years has been steadily improving thanks to an IAEA FAO project drought made it difficult for farmers to generate enough income to send their children to school for about three consecutive years we get the poor rains and do poor harvests so the impoverished parents could not afford school fees quite some time to support farmers the IAEA helped the government introduced a drip irrigation pilot project that reduces water use by half using isotopic techniques scientists calculated the exact amount of water and fertilizer needed for tomatoes and other vegetables this allows farmers to save both of these precious resources in a routine or says result or film from tank recovery Rio family pipe Yadira Numa Numa pipe imitating bamboo yoga yoga grinding is separation de pombal drip irrigation is also more efficient leading to more crops adding fertilizer to the soil also increases the harvest the situation with food security is quite greatly improved like for instance where the farmers used to have a yield of says 5 tonnes per hectare or a 6 tonnes per hectare now it is almost trebled that means more food for the children and more money for their school I can now manage to pay the school fees of my children from the money I got from the drip irrigation system I also improved my my household and I can also now buy food for my children I feel happy because my parents bought complete school uniform and stationery for me and I expect to pass with flying colours at the end of the a with more crop per drop the education of children in these areas is safe for now this is a supported project is also helping farmers elsewhere in Africa [Music]",
