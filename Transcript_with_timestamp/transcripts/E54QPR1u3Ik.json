  "text": "[Music] all right well hello everyone um I'm here with my colleague Dylan and uh we're going to kind of discuss spring cover crop forage options you know spring times upon us we're at mid-march here uh temperatures are warming up and just wanted to kind of talk through some options so Dylan Could you um maybe walk us through some of the different cover crop mixes that you're putting together for guys right now yeah absolutely Nathan I'd be happy to do that so I'll walk you guys I'll walk everybody through um kind of what I like to put together for a pretty General uh forage mix spring Forge mix you know there's certainly different Uh custom mixes we can do depending on your situation but this is a general mix and I like to put together um I would start uh if you want you can get you can get on our smart mix calculator at smartmix.greencoverseat.com I actually utilize this daily because it's a really great quote tool for me to put put together quotes just even as a sales rep yeah I have an account already but it'll ask you to start an account and then you want to go into to start a mix and from here we'll name our mix for this one we'll we'll call it Grandpa's uh East 40 for kind of a fun day and uh we'll call it 40 acres worth we're gonna have no irrigation this is my this is my hometown zip code you can put whatever zip code is your hometown and from there it'll kind of calculate average rainfall for all states and give you a better idea of what what species may work better in your area and we'll go to bagging option for this we'll put in a tote bag we are not certified organic but if you are you can certainly click yes you have three different options for seating drilled broadcast and broadcast with incorporation and incorporation could mean tillage maybe you're you're spreading it for cattle to trample in but for this example we're going to do a drilled cover and I think probably the next cash crop would be wheat generally that's what most guys are going to be getting to after spring forage mix there's just not enough time to get a spring cash crop in generally behind one of these mixes especially if you're grazing it so we'll leave it at seating today and just be out there for about two months there's three different goals you can select you're only required to select one and that's what we'll do for now and we'll just call it supplemental crazy a lot of these species will will take care of a lot of goals um just by even focusing on on one goal um from there uh you'll there you have the smart mix auto adjust button if this is your first time I would leave that on I leave it on until I get my species selected and then I shut it off and and kind of adjust my my pounds from there from there you're going to want to add your species you've got an excellent good marginal and risky categories uh most generally if you're probably staying in the excellent to good that's probably where you need to be as we're looking at legumes my two favorite legumes for a a grazing mix it's going to be spring Forge peas because they're a great protein highly mycorrhizal very good for the soil really brings those mycorrhizal colonies together and then crimson clover nice Crimson nice Clover that will put on pretty big leaves and a lot of tons out there for you when I look at grasses I look at probably your most common spring spring grass and that's going to be spring oats again highly hyporizable good tonnage high quality feed and then to kind of fill in um I like to find some annual rye grass small seed but very leafy very leafy uh texture again high quality forage can can really bring some tons into that mix and then when I'm selecting brassicas my go-to is going to be kale and collards and that's just mainly for their for their Leaf texture very palatable Leaf big leaf a lot of a lot of forage there for those cattle and probably the two broad leaves that you could select would be flax or facilia flax cattle aren't really going to touch which is okay um it leaves some it leaves some residue out there for that next cash crop again another product nice puts on a nice blue flower that can contract beneficial pollinators the facilia will do that as well if this is going to be a haying option I would not select flax I would go with facilia flax you may have some issues with with hay in that product but with this being a grazing product we're going to select flax so yeah with auto mix adjust button on it it just Auto adjusts and divides these out evenly to to get close to 125 of a full rate so you can see the full rate percentage here if each one is at 18 and that's that number is that number is taking this number here divided by the full rate of if this was planted as a mono so three pounds of crimson clover is 18 and then you can look over here this gives you the details of the mix um Acres Acres area what it's going to be bagged in how you're going to be drilling it or planting it next cash crop in your growing period and down here to pounds and pounds per acre I don't really when I'm making mixes I don't look at this too much I look at the seeds per acre in the seeds per square foot it gives me a better idea of it helps me visualize better what we're doing and I try to stick around a million million and a half seeds per acre and I think that puts you around oh somewhere around 20 25 seeds per square foot and this would be your mix density of of the of the mix and it can walk you through the full rate of legumes grasses brassicas the weight and the percentage of the seeds so if I'm going to really customize this mix this is generally a mix that I I put together two pounds of clover about eight pounds of spring forged peas I'll do two pounds of rye grass and probably anywhere from 30 to 35 pounds of Hayden oats you know just depending on on where you're at and your rainfall environment when it comes to Nebraska's I like a pound and a half of total brassicas so I do about a pound of collards and a half pound of kale by flax since it's not much of a grazer just more of a soil soil beneficiary I I put it about three pounds and as you can see that puts us at about a million and a half seats per acre so probably in a more rain-fed environment irrigated situation this is where I'd be um I may I may knock some of these down a little bit just to get that seating rate down a little bit in a drier area but that's Nathan that's generally the mix I like to put together any thoughts or comments yeah I think that's really good like you said what guys need to consider on those seeding rates you know their fertility their soils the the moisture situation um I think that million to million and a half's kind of that sweet spot you you uh you know the more seeds you put out there likely the more tonnage you're gonna get so but also the more of the seed mix is going to cost so there's going to be a trade-off there um you know a couple other species I think a lot of guys could or should consider this time of year you know spring barley spring triticale those other cereal options but I think this is good this is an opportunity to build some soil you know improve organic matter you know provide that protection um but also like you said we're providing forage guys should should consider you know potential hay mixes you know hay inventories are at some record lows in a lot of States so we're coming out of this drought of last year we have some moisture now you know guys should look at opportunities to take advantage of some of um some of that moisture and maybe beef up some hay inventories so yeah I think that's that's really good and hopefully that's helpful to uh to our customers out there so thanks for thanks for walking us through that all right thanks Nathan yeah we'll see you later thanks everyone bye",
