00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,750
hey folks this josh starting rich farmer

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,220
welcome to the farm vlog today today is

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,830
going to be pretty fun we're gonna be

4
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,120
installing more solar lights and I know

5
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,309
what you're thinking do you really need

6
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,139
more solar lights on the farm well yes

7
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:14,610
we do so we have a little bit of a

8
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:15,150
predator problem down at the chicken

9
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,470
coop

10
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,119
something's been digging and scratching

11
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,380
around and trying to get in the chicken

12
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:21,960
coop at night I've got some pretty

13
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,420
heavy-duty wire on there but I want to

14
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,900
deter those predators from coming and

15
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,340
what deters a predator more than being

16
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:32,610
discovered ok so we're going to be

17
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,860
installing these 100 whip LED light

18
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,620
fixtures on the outside of the chicken

19
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,120
coop they're all solar panel

20
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:41,250
self-contained very very simple design

21
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,870
they have a hundred LED lights and we'll

22
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,059
go into more detail about what they do

23
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,410
and how they do but the first thing we

24
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:47,850
got to do is we're gonna set them out

25
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,379
here in the sunlight and let them charge

26
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,239
for about five hours guys and we'll see

27
00:00:49,379 --> 00:01:02,969
you in just a minute we'll install these

28
00:00:51,239 --> 00:01:04,379
new solar lights all right so folks the

29
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:06,180
first thing you need to know is this

30
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:07,890
thing comes with a little pin this

31
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,900
little pin I guess they call it the key

32
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,760
the instruction manual which I'm not

33
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,500
really good about reading tells you what

34
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,060
you have to do with this pin so first

35
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,740
thing you do is unbag it and it has a

36
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,840
protective layer here you peel that

37
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,880
protective layer off of that solar panel

38
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,580
look how pretty that solar panel is then

39
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,890
there's a little power switch right in

40
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,900
there and you take your little pin stick

41
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:31,829
it in there and you push the power

42
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,369
button and it clicks and it's on pretty

43
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:35,310
cool

44
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:36,990
now what I've learned is it has two

45
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,280
positions it's an up position that

46
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,490
sticks out a little more and a down

47
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,020
position down is on it needs to be on in

48
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,250
order to receive a charge and we're

49
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,200
gonna sit them in the bright sunlight

50
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,759
right here right in the driveway right

51
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,649
where it's gonna get plenty of sunlight

52
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,420
okay and we're gonna let them charge for

53
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:53,159
I don't know two three hours so things

54
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,439
says five hours should get about four or

55
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,990
five hours of direct sunlight but we'll

56
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,880
see I hope this will be the solution to

57
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,520
keep the critters away from our garden

58
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,990
and away from our chicken coop now our

59
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,280
chicken coop is right beside our garden

60
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,049
down there so we can use them and you

61
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,110
were on the garden will see this company

62
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:12,450
sent me a huge huge discount code for

63
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,770
this thing it's like 50% off so guys if

64
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,850
you're interested in getting a

65
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,650
solar light if you're ever thinking

66
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:18,090
about getting one of these for outside

67
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,800
your house or for an area that doesn't

68
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:22,860
have electricity like your barn or

69
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,170
something like that this is the time to

70
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,300
get it 50 percent off of this thing and

71
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:28,950
it was pretty cheap to start with so

72
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:32,160
some of the specs on it it says it's

73
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:35,370
2000 lumens 4.8 watts and it's about 10

74
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,070
inches by 7 inches fairly small fits

75
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:39,930
right on my t-shirt and covers up that

76
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:41,700
keeping it Dutch shirt right there just

77
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,140
a little shout-out for my buddy Dutch so

78
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,670
we've got five or six of these things

79
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,050
all over the farm we've got them on our

80
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,550
farm gate we've got them on the house

81
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:49,500
we've got them all over in places that

82
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:51,930
we don't want to run wires for light and

83
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,430
they're just handy and it's half off so

84
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,170
the deal was with the company I said you

85
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:57,060
can send me these lights but you've got

86
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:59,250
to pass on some sort of savings to my

87
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,110
subscribers so they knock 50 percent off

88
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,700
that's all I have for you now something

89
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,530
I've learned about being a youtuber for

90
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,720
the past two years here is that people

91
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:08,370
don't like brand placement they don't

92
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,650
like product placement they don't like

93
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:12,870
it when you show things like wd-40 they

94
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:14,310
don't like that stuff like wd-40 I don't

95
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:19,110
like to do a lot of product placements

96
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:21,540
in my videos part of being a youtuber

97
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:23,670
sometimes is doing stuff like this and

98
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,140
passing on savings to my subscribers so

99
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:29,340
I hope you appreciate it and don't think

100
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:31,520
it's something stupid by the way guys

101
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:35,190
this light will not serve as a

102
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:39,270
substitute for the most sold rifle in

103
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:41,010
America the pain it will not serve as a

104
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:42,570
substitute for that just so you know the

105
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,550
thought process here is to take this

106
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:46,500
thing as high as I possibly can but I

107
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:48,660
don't want the eaves to be hanging over

108
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,270
top of the solar panel okay and I've

109
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:53,640
charged these for about 30 minutes or so

110
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:55,860
right now and then they're lighting up

111
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,690
just fine so I'm pretty impressed I

112
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,240
think I'll be very happy with these all

113
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:02,700
right so we went up to the barn and we

114
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,020
got the ladder now you might notice my

115
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,030
ladder is a little different than your

116
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,410
ladder might be I have towels wrapped

117
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,240
around the end of the ladder right here

118
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:11,070
and that's so I don't scratch up the

119
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,600
paint on the house or scratch up the

120
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,950
paint on the building just take some

121
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,750
towels and duct tape them around there

122
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:17,070
they last you about six or eight months

123
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,870
as long as you keep it dry to last

124
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,730
forever and that way you don't beat up

125
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:23,490
your building we brought our level and

126
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:25,800
we brought our light now we're going to

127
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:27,300
take our light and down it up make sure

128
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,620
it's nice and level

129
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,530
pretty close to the center right here

130
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:34,979
okay pretty simple just gonna kind of

131
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:37,770
mount it up right there it's gonna drive

132
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:39,740
me crazy but I'm gonna do it off-center

133
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:44,159
[Music]

134
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:51,000
take my level make sure I'm nice and

135
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:52,919
level come down just a hair all right

136
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,720
they're two sided tape trick worked

137
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:57,300
pretty good we've got some self-tapping

138
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,360
screws we'll go ahead and zip to self

139
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,129
tappers in here now the kit does not

140
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,229
come with self tapping screws it comes

141
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:06,419
with wood screws or screws where you can

142
00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:08,699
mount it into like the siding or

143
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:11,940
something like that but it's right here

144
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:13,229
it's good enough for us cool so folks

145
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,940
Mountain this thing couldn't be any

146
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:16,620
simpler basically you just have two

147
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,449
screw holes one screw hole here one

148
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,190
screw hole here it comes with some

149
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:21,840
hardware and a kit with little tiny

150
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:23,370
screws I want to use some bigger

151
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,259
heavy-duty screws because that's just

152
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:26,909
the kind of person I am so we're gonna

153
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:28,800
go ahead and we're gonna install this

154
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:30,810
guy I don't want to install it right

155
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,060
here I was gonna put it up high but I'm

156
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:35,279
afraid that the rain water dripping off

157
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,319
on it constantly will run down in here

158
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:39,659
and cause damage so we're gonna put it

159
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:41,639
right here now you're wondering are we

160
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:43,529
gonna get enough sunlight right here you

161
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:47,130
get the morning Sun right here it'll be

162
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:49,289
just perfect so very very simple all I'm

163
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:51,000
gonna do is mount it up here easily

164
00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:54,810
enough I'm gonna put one screw in first

165
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,550
okay and that will hold it in place once

166
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:57,900
I get that first screw in then we'll put

167
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,289
the level on the top and make sure it's

168
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,879
level

169
00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:01,620
I'll show you guys you're gonna love my

170
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:04,110
rooster here in a second he is a movie

171
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,879
star he loves the crow when the cameras

172
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,710
on it's pretty funny we're gonna go

173
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:09,000
ahead and raise this up and after I put

174
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,379
this up I'll give you a little quick

175
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,729
tour of the chicken coop it's kind of a

176
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:14,719
mess right now but I'll show you how

177
00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:17,610
it's built anyhow I'll put this up here

178
00:06:14,719 --> 00:06:21,810
slide our level up make sure we're right

179
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:24,659
on the money okay hold it in place and

180
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:26,580
then we'll zip our screw in now it's

181
00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:28,229
mounted up nice and sturdy if it doesn't

182
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,819
get enough sunlight right here which I

183
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:32,460
don't see a problem but if it doesn't

184
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:34,259
get enough sunlight it's okay I can

185
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,699
always move it it takes two seconds to

186
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:37,139
move we're going to go ahead and put the

187
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:38,669
next one over here on the other side of

188
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:40,409
the coop I'll show you so the next one

189
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:40,760
is going to go right up there okay we're

190
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:44,480
going to

191
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:46,760
it right on the eaves alright so we'll

192
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,830
back right up here with the Gator and

193
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:52,540
that way we can just hop right up on the

194
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:52,540
Gator right here and get the job done

195
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,440
there we go

196
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:02,150
that's simple that's simple to install

197
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,410
guys let me walk you around the chicken

198
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,970
coop and tell you a little bit about it

199
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,260
case you want some ideas for your own

200
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,970
chicken coop so we were thinking

201
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,800
predators the whole time when we built

202
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:11,480
this coop this right here is another

203
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,550
solar panel it's got a little dust on

204
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,890
the top of it but these little lights

205
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:18,260
light up on all four corners of the coop

206
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:20,240
and also they light up the outside of

207
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:22,430
the coop right here too so these little

208
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,980
solar panels little lights this is a

209
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:28,010
eight by eight enclosure there's about

210
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:31,700
fifteen chickens in there and basically

211
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:33,230
we used heavy-duty wire so that nothing

212
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,450
could get through it in the inside we

213
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:38,000
have two bolts and it's a mess in here

214
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:39,140
guys I just want to let you know but in

215
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
here we have the place where the

216
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:43,790
chickens can roost and we have our

217
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,230
nesting boxes and we have our food which

218
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:47,600
is supported by a chain up in the

219
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:49,730
ceiling and that's poop now the design

220
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,950
of the coop is such that I can pull this

221
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:53,600
board straight up and pull my

222
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:55,580
wheelbarrow which is stored under here

223
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,320
right up underneath it and rake out the

224
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,910
poop into the wheelbarrow and take it to

225
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,380
the garden so here on the outside are my

226
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:02,570
nesting boxes I think they're eight

227
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:04,910
nesting boxes maybe more have a little

228
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:07,580
hook here we unhook the hook we raise it

229
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:09,590
up and inside our little laying boxes

230
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:11,780
okay and then we've mounted a light

231
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:13,550
right here a little push button light so

232
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:15,260
if we get eggs up in the dark we've got

233
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:17,540
light and here's our outside chicken run

234
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:19,640
you can also see I have lots of lights

235
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:21,380
around here to help deter predators from

236
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,090
getting in the chicken coop and really I

237
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:25,310
haven't had any troubles hardly at all

238
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:27,170
except for the last little bit and I'm

239
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:28,640
not so sure that one of the neighbors

240
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:32,540
critters might be trying to get in there

241
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:33,919
like a dog that's it it's a pretty fun

242
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,690
little chicken coop there's an eight by

243
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,950
eight outside run for the chickens will

244
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:38,120
open the door and let them run through

245
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:40,820
the garden run through the yard

246
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:43,340
sometimes and we have the laying boxes

247
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:45,350
and we have a four by eight little area

248
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:46,460
for them to hang out and roost well

249
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:48,530
