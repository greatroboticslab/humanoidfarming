00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,120
hi i'm sarah and here on the manager

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,480
farms channel today it's upcycle monday

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,440
which means we're going to be making a

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:13,960
solar powered drip irrigation system

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,960
for free just using recyclables

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,320
the first thing you need for this

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,000
project is a one liter completely free

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,760
of any labels at least as much as

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
possible

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,560
and then you make a cut about at this

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,560
line here

12
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,600
first things first for any project

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,200
especially with little ones around it's

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,559
better to not have them with arms

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,040
reached when you could be cutting

16
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,640
something

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,640
so i'm going to pass them off to his

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,640
uncle

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,399
yes

20
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,640
now you just need a two liter bottle

21
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,800
again as freeze-label as possible can't

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,440
get everything all the time

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,440
cut about here

24
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,799
so now that we have all of our parts cut

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,799
up and ready it's time to install the

26
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,240
watering system into our plants it's

27
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,080
important to note that this is not to

28
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,520
replace your regular watering system but

29
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,479
just to help when it gets hot and your

30
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,920
plants are going to need the extra

31
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,920
moisture

32
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,600
so leave the cap on

33
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,200
so the water does not absorb into the

34
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,240
dirt

35
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,240
that's for the other parts

36
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,439
so i think i want to install it right

37
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,600
about over here i miss the plants but

38
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:32,240
yet not too close to any one particular

39
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,240
root structure

40
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,720
and you're going to want to go a couple

41
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,280
inches down because you want to get some

42
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:41,560
of the base into the dirt so it doesn't

43
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,560
really loosen up too easy

44
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,719
and because we're not forecasted to have

45
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,920
any rain in the next couple days we're

46
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,920
going to add some water into it

47
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,039
i'd say about there

48
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,760
never waste

49
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,520
got some extra water you might as well

50
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,360
just splash it around

51
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,360
any thirsty plants that might be nearby

52
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,680
now the cool thing about this irrigation

53
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,440
system

54
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,120
is that we then place this piece of

55
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,120
plastic over the water

56
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,080
and down a little bit

57
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,160
so as the heat heats up the water

58
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,319
it causes water to evaporate the water

59
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,000
evaporates and condenses and goes down

60
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,239
the sides of the container back into the

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,120
soil watering all the root systems at

62
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,560
once and that extra time of thirst

63
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,690
thank you for joining us and have a

64
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,440
great day

65
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:59,680
[Applause]

66
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,519
now remember if we all gave up our lawns

67
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,519
for gardens there'd be no more hunger in

68
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,519
america

69
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,000
