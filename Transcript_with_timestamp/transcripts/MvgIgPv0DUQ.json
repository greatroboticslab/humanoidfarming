  "text": "Monsoon is not only one of the most challenging problems in atmospheric science it is also a very important subject to study because of the very large impacts it has on the economy and the food grain production agriculture of the monsoonal regions of the world so today I'm going to talk about Indian Summer monsoon GDP and agriculture in fact couple of years back the the opening remarks by our then Finance Minister pranam mukarji in the budget speech to the Indian Parliament said I seek the blessings of Lord Indra to bestow on us timely and bountiful monsoons so this is how important the monsoons to the Finance Minister of India and in fact what was pranab MJ's concern it was about the year-to-year variation of the monsoon interannual variation of the monsoon on the all India scale that is to say Indian Summer monsoon rainfall what we used to call ismr and whether it will be a drought whether it will be an excess monsoon season or what now this is a figure which shows how the ismr or the Indian Summer monsoon rainfall has varied from the time data are available 1876 to now and as I have mentioned before the standard deviation the mean is about 85.4 the standard deviation the mean is given here sorry the standard deviation is about 10% of the mean and because it's about 10% of the mean we Define a drought as a season in which the deficit is larger than 10% or the ismr anomaly is negative and magnitude larger than 10% when the ismr anomaly is positive and magnitude larger than 10% we call it an excess Monsoon year okay it can also be defined by Anomaly normalized by standard deviation ismr Anomaly by normalized by standard deviation to be less than minus one for droughts and greater than one for excess Monsoon seasons now as far as the impact of the monsoon on uh economy is concerned we often read about it in the newspapers although uh we could not find a single systematic study before the one I'm going to present today uh to give quantitative assessment of the impact so for example the impact of monsoon 2002 was felt of course in 2003 and there is a headline in Hindu which says drought conditions curtail economic growth okay that it is now likely to go grow only at 4.4% as opposed to last year's growth of 5.5% because of the drought as you know 2002 was a major drought this is 2002 a very major drought and it had impacts similarly another report from a newspaper saying GDP growth slips to 2.6% in the uh third quarter so this is the way we reach about the impact but it is important to have a quantitative assessment of the impact of the monsoon for various reasons including assessment of the value of forecast benefit of alternative agricultural strategies Etc however the system is complex with several factors beside the monsoon having a significant impact so now I will uh talk today about an attempt of such a at such a quantitative assessment and this this is uh from a paper we published called Indian Monsoon GDP and agriculture in economic and political weekly in 2006 now what are we concerned with we are concerned the data basic data is on variation of of course Indian Monsoon rainfall which are readily available from the iitm website tr. rest food grain production data from Ministry of Agriculture and GDP at Factor cost data from Central statistical organizations EP W Foundation now as I said the index for the Summer monsoon rainfall is all India Summer monsoon rainfall Indian Summer monsoon rainfall ismr so all India average of the Summer monsoon rainfall ismr long-term mean is 85.2 4 cm standard deviation is 10% of the mean and this is a plot showing the actual ASMR what you saw earlier were the anomalies from the mean and what you see is that there are a lot of fluctuations these are the major drought years including 2002 which appears here but there is no Trend okay basically the mean rainfall has remained the same there are epoches in which it is above normal for a long time below normal for a long time and so on but by and large the rainfall has remained the same there are no long period Trends now ASMR anomally we Define as the difference between the actual value of ismr for the year and the long average so ismr anomaly can be considered to be representative of most parts of the country only when there are droughts or excess rainfall Seasons because during normal Monsoon quite a few parts of the country may have above normal substantial part may have below normal so it is only when we have droughts that a very large part of the country actually has deficit uh rainfall and similarly only when we have excess Monsoon excess ismr then we have l large parts of the country having above normal rain so now let us first see we have already seen how ismr has behaved and by and large the mean is uh remain constant and there are wide fluctuations around the mean now this is how GDP has behaved and you can see that it has grown since Independence in a remarkable way very large growth of GDP that you have uh that we have registered this is the Indian economy growth now this is the food grain production all India food grain production of the country that has also increased substantially from the 50s to now the it has the increase has been more than by a factor of four okay so from 50 to about 2010 you have enormous increase in both now what is the relationship between the two so up there is ismr anomally and down here is the same food grain production and what you see is that large dips in ismr in fact give rise to substantial dips in the food grain production that is what you're seeing here including this one year 2002 also gave a substantive dip in the food grain production so fgp is the total of the production over different agroclimatic zones which will depend on Regional rainfall and it's subseasonal distribution only when there are large deficits or excess in ismr most of the country experiences anomaly of the same sign that is drought or excess rain and we expect similar anomalies for food grain production now how do we go about quantitatively assessing the impact of monsoon on food grain production or GDP gross so while the monsoon and the factors that depend are dependent on the monsoon fluctuate from year to year the other factors leading to the change in growth of agricultural production GDP Etc vary on a much longer time scale we have seen right from 50s to now there has been a sustained growth of GDP so this is on a time scale of decades that it is changing food grain production has also has this kind of a long-term Trend okay so we expect deviations from this long-term Trend to be related to the impact of the monsoon of that year okay however it must be noted that other special events which have time scales of about an year such as Wars economic crisis Etc will also contribute to these deviations so what we are doing uh is quantitatively assessing if you wish the impact of the events of a specific year now a major event of a specific year is the monsoon but there can be major events in other years you know such as Wars and crisis financial crisis and so on which can also have an impact and we will come to that now we expect the growth rate of G GDP to be proportional to the value of GDP that is we expect the growth of GDP to be exponential okay because the more GDP you have the better growth you get so it is proportional to GDP now parti who is in fact to be given credit for generating this ismr data uh at Indian Institute of tropical meterology has shown that an exponential function is also a good fit for the trend of the growth of food grain production so approach is that if we fit exponential curves for fgp and GDP with the growth rate assumed to be as simple a function as possible so we do not want to complicate our life we can we will actually fix um we will in fact fit curves which are as simple as possible for the growth rate pairs of lines or quadratic and so on these these curves represent the scenario in the absence of monsoon fluctuation now we try and relate the deviations from these curves to the impact of the monsoon so this is the GDP and you can already see here there are some dips here that occur and these are in fact the impact of the monsoon so since we know that we going to fit an exponential what we have is here is the log of GDP and log of GDP versus ear and that means we can fit straight line This is a line with a certain slope and then we find that after 1980s we have to fit another line with a much sharper slope that is to say the rate at which GDP grew exponential rate is in fact somewhat smaller up to 80 than it is beyond 80 and this is because of the impact of the economic reforms since the 80s now had we continued along the same path we would have gone along the green curve and would not have reached as high as GDP as we have seen so what are the best fits for GDP Now log gdpi this is just the uh the growth rate here and it is about 3.5% per year up to 1950 and Beyond 1950 it has increased to 5.5% per year Okay so this is the actual GDP what we saw in the earlier figure was the log GDP and you can see it is growing exponentially it would have come only up to here had we uh continued along the same path but since the 80s the growth rate has picked up and we have gone on a much steeper slope here okay are the empirically determined Trends consistent with what is known while the GDP has increased at the rate of about 3.5% during 51 to 80 since the 80s it has increased more rapidly at the rate of 5.5% okay now this 3.5% was known as the Hindu rate of growth of GDP and only with the start of liberalization in 1980 we have had a higher growth rate and this has been documented in literature so what we have found by fitting the curves is consistent with what is known this is from a book end of poverty by saxs Jeffrey SA and he has a picture of the GDP of India and you can see this is British Raj Colonial Ila we the GDP didn't grow at all because we were being exploited and now then there is one rate here and another rate here so what we have found is very consistent with what other people have also found now we look at the food grain production again we fit curves but this time what has happened is while the GDP grew faster than the earlier one the food grain production the growth rate has actually dipped since the '90s so had we continued we would have been much better off but actually there has been a dip in the thing so what are the trends from 51 to 94 it has grown about 2.7% a year and notice that the growth is right from 51 even from before the Green Revolution of the' 70s and this is because a large uh investment was made by the free government after the end of the colonial rule in many things which promoted growth of food grain production such as irrigation making fertilizers available and so on and so forth okay now from 94 to 2004 actually the FR rate of growth of food has dipped very much to less than 1% this is very very worrying and you see it here in actual food grain production that you have this kind of a flat you know very slow growth rate in this period as opposed to what you had earlier so the growth rate of fgp has uh the fgp has increased steadily at about 2.7% from the early '90s consistent with the analysis up to the early '90s so this is consistent with the analysis of Kurosaki who also showed this now now the growth rate has decreased to less than 1% in the last decade because of the unsustainable strategies leading to a decrease in growth rates of irrigated land see irrigated land quite a bit of it has fallen out of cultivation due to salinity water logging Etc and decrease of growth rate of yield because of the steady decrease of fertility that is nutrient availability of the land due to intensive agriculture in the previous three decades change in cropping patterns leading to decrease in area under cultivation so because of all this the growth rate has decreased and it is a reflection of what has happened the world over even if you look at the world food production then you find that there is a fatigue of the Green Revolution this is the very fast growth rate that was achieved during the Green Revolution now there is a fatigue and we are also experiencing it so what are we saying now there are long-term trends which are exponential IAL and there are also local growth rates this is what most economists report on this is what we hear on the radio or TV and this is what we see in the newspapers the GDP rate coming down from 5.5 to 4.4 that was in the newspaper cutting that I showed earlier refer to this growth which is called local growth so this local growth rate is simply how much the GDP changed from last year to this one normalized by last year's G GDP multiplied by 100 and similarly we can have a local change of fgp also so when it is negative it means that GDP has decreased when it is positive it means GDP has increased from last year to this year so this local rate looks like this and this is fgp and this is GDP basically it fluctuates a great deal okay now this is the GDP that we had seen in and this is the fitted curve and now what we looking at his deviation from the fitted curve you can see it is higher than the fitted curve here and lower than the fitted curve here and here and so on now this is the fgp and here the deviations are more spectacular okay so now how do we assess the impact on the monsoon for each year the difference between the GDP and the fitted curve representing the long-term trend of GDP is defined as the deviation in the GDP so what do we say GDP deviation is the GDP of that year let's go back here for example we take this point here so it's the GDP of this year minus the fitted curve which is the red one so the GDP deviation is positive for this and it is actually negative for the next Point here okay so that is what how we Define it we say GDP deviation in an year is the GDP of that year minus GDP fitted at that year and similarly fgp deviation is defined as the value minus the fitted value now since the fitted GDP varies considerably over the 50-year period the expected GDP from the fitted curve that is GDP F year is used to normalize the deviation each year and express it as a percentage of GDP so this is a minor point we have to normalize it to express it as a percentage so deviation is expressed as a percentage use using the fitted curve and same thing with fgp but for ismr there are no trends at all so ismr anomally is simply defined as the ismr of that year minus average ismr and it is normalized by the average ismr itself we don't have to worry about special fited values in this case now we expect the observed deviations of GDP and fgp for a specific year which we have just defined to be related Ed to the important events in that year particularly the monsoon rainfall that is to say the ismr anomaly of that year so what are we saying we expect the extent to which the actual fgp of that year food grain production of that year differs from the fitted curve which is the expected food grain production given the long period Trend or how much the GDP of that year differs from the expected GDP which is obtained from that curve that we had of whatever it was 5.5% growth or whatever so we expect these deviations to be related to events in that year and particularly the ismr anomaly however the deviation of GDP from the fitted curve we found depends not only on the events such as the deficit Monsoon of that year but also on the deviation of the previous year this is what made the uh computation a little more complicated we could not simply call deviation of GDP as the impact of the events of that year and to show what the problem is consider the deviations of GDP as well as the local growth rate GDP GR in the period 84 to 96 and that is what is shown here now this is the local growth rate so this just relates to this year minus previous year kind of thing and what you find is that after the drought of 87 the growth rate was positive in 88 the local growth rate and so on and so forth notice that there was a huge dip in 91 and we will see later this dip had nothing to do with the monsoon this had to do with the financial crisis so this is the GDP dip due to the financial crisis which occurred in 91 and notice that after that in fact the GDP has been increasing steadily from year to year okay there is no negative growth but in spite of that that when we look at the actual GDP Visa with the expected long period Trend then we find that this dip that occurred in 91 could not be made up till 5 years later so the curve remained below the fitted curve for several years because of this particular dip that occurred in 91 so we cannot simply blindly now relate this deviation from the fitted curve to impact of that year see subsequent to the major dip in 19 1991 probably in association with the balance of payment crisis although the growth rate GDP gr this is the local growth rate now increased to almost equal the long-term growth rate of 5.5% in 1992 increase further in 1993 and was substantially higher in 1994 the deviation remains negative for 9293 and 94 thus even in 1994 which was a SE excess which was a season with excess Monsoon rainfall and which is considered to be a high point of growth per anom in the period after 1980 the GDP deviation is negative clearly Dev GDP reflects sustained impact of the LGE DP in 91 and cannot be considered to be the effect only of that year so what do we do we actually assume that in the absence of variation of the monsoon GDP would increase at the rate as per the fitted curves hence in a scenario in which there is no impact of the fluctuations of the monsoon the GDP in any year would be related to the GDP in the previous year simply by the equation that uh GDP of that year is equal to GDP year minus 1 into 1 + m where M will have different values for this period 51 to 80 and 81 to 2003 okay so we are saying it is growing with the uh given rate now impact of the monsoon and the GDP of a specific year will then be the difference between GDP and GDP zero see left to itself GDP would grow at the rate M now if it did not grow at the rate M it would be something different from GDP Z and the difference between GDP and GDP zero will be the impact of monsoon or any other event of that year now it can be shown that the impact so defined when normalized by GDP F of that year which is what we had done is given in terms of the normalized anomal as impact of GDP will be deviation of GDP year minus deviation of GDP year minus one this can be shown it's a matter of doing the algebra now impact of the monsoon rainfall and other events in a specific year on the fgp does not appear to be sustained for longer than a year so unlike GDP we don't have to worry too much about fgp and the fgp deviations for successive years are poorly correlated correlation between them is only minus 0.05 okay thus we expect the fgp deviation for any year to be a measure of the impact of the monsoon rainfall of that year okay now here is the final plot that came out from this and what you see here is the impact on GDP and uh on the y axis and the percentage departure of ismr this is the monsoon rainfall on the x-axis um now what you see is this is the zero line on the x-axis so all these years there has been deficit Monsoon and Beyond minus 10 there are all droughts and they are marked with red dots here okay now this this is all positive this means Monsoon rainfall has been above normal for the country as a whole and if when it is more than 10 the ismr normally more than 10% then you have all these excess Monsoon Seasons here okay now what is the impact like first thing that strikes you is that the if you wanted to fit a curve of the Impact versus Monsoon it's a highly nonlinear curve you see as the deficit increases it dips very f fast in other words when you have large severe droughts we get a very very large impact and you know it doesn't matter when it is even 2002 which is after so much progress and as I will show later uh you know the contribution of Agriculture to GDP has decreased from around 50% towards the beginning of this period in 1950 to less than 20% now and so would have thought that the economy would become drought proof but this is this shows a point to the contrary that even in 2002 when agriculture did not contribute so much to the economy still a drought had an impact of more than 2% which is a huge impact so all the droughts have impact between roughly between 2 to 5% and in this part the more the deficit the more the impact you know the impact increases rapidly with the uh magnitude of the deficit in Monsoon rainfall but on this side it hardly increases so we have a very large impact due to negative uh anomalies of ismr we have a bad impact in other words dipping of GDP or negative GDP uh GDP impact associated with negative ismr anomalies but the positive GDP impact associated with positive anomalies is not at all commensurate with the negative impact so this is a highly nonlinear thing and this was most unexpected so what we see is that in fact the negative impact of uh deficit Monsoon is much larger than the positive impact of above normal Monsoon with the same magnitude of the ismr anomaly and for fgp the story is exactly the same again highly nonlinear we get a huge suppression depression in fgp when we have droughts but we don't have any like the increase when we have good rainfall so the same story again now before I go to the impact of the monsoon which I'm going to dwell on of course we have to remember that there are other events which also have an impact we talked of the event of 1991 and what has happened is we can see here now let us see the impact of 1991 and you see it here see this is 91 so that it was not a very large deficit Monsoon as you can see most of the points for this uh kind of a monsoon are around here but we got a very very large dip in GDP because it was a because of other reasons other than the monsoon so the adverse impact of the deficit monsoon in 1991 is much larger than that expected from the corresponding ismr anomaly although the impact on the fgp was near the expected level so in fact impact from fgp is exactly near the expected level you see so what happened is because the monsoon was not that much in deficit the impact on food grain production was not very high okay in magnitude it was commensurate with what we expect but but the impact on uh GDP was very large I mean it was larger than many many droughts that we have seen so clearly a part of the value of minus 5% for the impact on GDP at 91 must be a result of the balance of payment crisis similarly while I fgp that is to say impact on fgp of droughts of 65 and 66 is comparable adverse impact of 65 on GDP is much larger probably because of the war with Pakistan so let us just see here 65 and 66 the impact see 65 and 66 this is the impact on food grain production and you know the anomaly is close to minus 15% and impact of food grain production is very very similar for 65 and 66 but if you see here on GDP 65 is a point which comes way below the expected Year and that is probably this extra is because of the war with Pakistan that we had okay now in 71 the year of the Bangladesh for if GP is positive and near the expected value for the positive is normally but the IG DP is large than negative so uh let us see if we can find this 71 here and uh here it is see 71 actually has an ismr anomaly of 5% positive and for that year we have uh impact on fgp is exactly on the Curve but if you look at 71 you see impact on GDP is almost minus 4% so big impact again and this has to do with the Bangladesh War but by and large you know there are only few years where you see that the impact is uh not of the monsoon but some other events probably some other events okay so values of igdp which are very different from those expected from value of ASMR anomal associated with incidents such as Wars or economic crisis not related with the monsoon but now we don't worry about that now we look at most of the years for which actually we can uh understand the impact understand the deviations in fgp and GDP in terms of impact of the monsoon itself now what are the best fit curves for these that you saw now we are talking about the best fit curves like this one this is the dashine which is the best fit curve here this one and uh the equations for those best fit curves are uh that you have uh 4518 anomal ismr minus this Square you can see how nonlinear it is it is a quadratic form you're getting here and similarly you have a best fit curve for the impact of GDP as well so from these best fit curves we can get a first assessment of how much is the impact of the monsoon on GDP or fgp and impact on GDP is16 times the ismr anomaly impact on fgp is 45 times the ismr anomaly that is to say a moderate drought 15% deficit has an impact of 2.4% on GDP and 6.75% on fgp that is is to say if the impact were according to those fitted lines which I just show you and already you can see that for ismr anomaly of the same magnitude a negative anomaly will have much larger impact than a positive anomaly and we will see that so the impact of the monsoon and fgp and GDP is highly nonlinear with the magnitude of the impact of a negative is anomaly being larger than that of a positive ismr anomaly of the same magnitude so even if the all India Monsoon rainfall does not vary over long period the impact of deficit rainfall years will never be made up by impact of normal or good Monsoon years now this is a very worrisome thing because this means that the integral effect of the impact of the monsoon will be to decrease the food grain production over the years simply because impact of negative anomalies are never made up by impact of positive anomali furthermore this asymmetry in the impact of the monsoon and fgp increased sharply in the last three decades whereas in the earlier era the magnitude of the impacts of a drought and a surplus of fgp were comparable in magnitude after 1980 the impact of surpluses has become almost negligible now this is the same graph this is in the era before 1980 where you have some Surplus but after 1980 there's hardly any surplus at all although you have more Monsoon so if you look at this is the period from 51 to 80 for selected and 81 to uh 2004 then impact of a 15% deficit is- 10% in the earlier era and minus 8.65 now so roughly comparable but positive anomaly of the same magnitude impact earlier used to be 6% which is comparable to 10% but now it is almost just down to one less than 1% so now you're getting hardly any positive impact of positive anomaly so in fact the curve of impact of igp fgp or GDP versus Monsoon ismr is nonlinear but now it is becoming more nonlinear in the later era after 1980s this is an observation so NE negative impact of deficit on fgp is much larger than the positive impact of above average rainfall the asymmetry and impact on fgp is particularly high in the modern era why this problem we have to address if we want sustainable development now an asymmetry in response to rainfall is not surprising in the light of Li's law of the minimum which says that the yield of a crop is determined by the scarcest resource the so-call limiting resource now during a drought one expects that water is the limiting resource but this need not be the case in the case of normal or Surplus rainfall however one can draw a significant conclusion from the observation that the impact of surplus rainfall has diminished with time it is much less after the 80s than it was before this suggests that while in the earlier era water was the primary limiting resource in recent times other factors determine the Yi Y in years of normal or Surplus rainfall identifying these factors can play a crucial role in increasing these yields so we now try and see what these factors could be so look at what has changed over the period changes in cropping patterns with large tracks now under monoculture leading to a high intensity of attack by pests and diseases loss of fertility of land due to intensive cultivation because of these two things application of fertilizer and pesticide is NOW essential for getting high yields even if you have good rainfall you will not get high yields unless you apply fertilizers to make up for the loss of fertility of the soil and unless you apply pesticides to keep the pest under control because now pests have become endemic in many regions so earlier you know for example in semiarid region where we worked near pada they used to be a whole variety of crops grown a large number of millets and so many other s and pigeon p and so on this is the rainfall weekly rainfall in that region and the entire rainfall profile used to be utilize now what they do is use primarily grut and horse G only two crops are now grown so there is much less much less Variety in cropping patterns now so now to understand why is the impact nonlinear we consider the variation which season rainfall of the yields of some important rainfield crops on Farmers fields and that of the same varieties under the same soil climatic conditions at agricultural research station so we are comparing the yields in the same agroclimatic region for the same variety of the crop but grown by the farmer on the one hand and at the agricultural resource station on the other the difference is what is called the current yield Gap and this difference between what is achieved in with the current level of Technology at the agricultural station and the yields at the farmers Fields is the yield Gap and actually scientists at IAT in Hyderabad have carried out a detailed analysis and this is one of the figures from this what you see is this is the grain yield and this is of several crops here Millet sorghum and Maze and this is the seasonal rainfall so seasonal rainfall increases as you go this way red dotts correspond to Farmers Fields blue dots correspond to yields on the research station what you see is that when the rainfall is low there is not too much difference between the two but as rainfall increases then the yield Gap widens and what is achieved at agricultural stations in terms of yield is much much higher than what the farmer gets okay so yield Gap is very large only for above rainfall years and a similar result Creet people have got for ground nut soyab Bean pigeon pea chickpea so many other crops so when the seasonal rainfall is low the yields at agricultural stations are comparable to those on the farmers Fields as the seasonal rainfall increases the yields at agricultural stations increase much more rapidly than those at Farmers field and so the yield Gap increases with rainfall now why does this happen so what is the difference in the agricultural practices in the two uh situations the major difference in the management at agricultural stations and Farms is in the application of fertilizers and pesticides in the recent decades with large tracks of land under monoculture leading to high intensity of attack by Pest and diseases and loss of fertility of land due to intensive cultivation it is not possible to get high yields without application of fertilizers and pesticides however in the absence of a reliable prediction of seasonal rainfall the farmers do not know whether the investment in fertilizers and pesticides will lead to enhan yields that is to say it will be cost effective or not the point is only if the rainfall is normal or above normal it pays to invest in fertilizers or pesticides as you have seen when the rainfall is low even with fertilizers and pesticides agricultural research stations were not able to get much higher yields and Farmers have to pay for the fertilizers and pesticides so they have to calculate what is the enhancement in yield that they would get by the additional expenditure on fertilizers and pesticides and they do not believe it is cost effective that is to say benefit is larger than cost if the rainfall is not high if it is low so since they don't know whether the rainfall will be low or not the farmers do not invest in them although they have the know how and will apply them at irrigated patches on the other hand at agricultural stations Farm economics is irrelevant because they get all their money from the government so liberal doses of fertilizer pesticides can be applied even then the yields are not very much better than the farmers yields in poor rainfall years in normal or good Monsoon years the yield enhancement due to this application is very large hence the yield Gap is in increases with rain so now what is the what are the farmers doing farmers in these rainfed tracks are basically not investing INF fertilizers and pesticides now so they are adopting a strategy which is the same strategy year after year okay which is not using any information that we have on rainfall variability even if we did not have prediction for a specific year say 2013 as to how the rain is going to be over a region we have a lot of data 100 Years of data and with that we should be able to see what is the possibility what is the probability of occurrence of low rainfall low as defined on that yield curve so we want to know see the farmers are really concerned with the case of rainfall lower than around here because after this then application of fertilizer and pesticides does give substantive enhancement in yields here so we want to know what is the probability of rainfall lower than this and that can be easily calculated surely that is never 100% even in small regions it will never exceed 30% or so so uh sorry I think we have Okay so so now hence the farmers do not invest them on the other hand they do huh so the farmers are adopting a strategy which is insensitive to climate variation and is not appropriate for a majority of the years for example ASMR deficit is large meaning uh that you have actually droughts if you consider the period of 58 to 2010 it is large only for 25% of the years so on 75% of the year Farmers could have actually gained so if you think of a long-term average by applying pesticides or and fertilizer they can gain and they can close the yield Gap successfully but what they're doing is adopting the strategy which is appropriate for say 25 30% of the years every year and that is really what is causing this huge yield Gap and also that is what is leading to they're not getting benefits of good Monsoon because they're not giving another very important input to the system fertilizers and they are not controlling pest which can have a very large impact on the thing so our problem that the negative impact of a deficit Monsoon is much higher than the positive impact which will lead on the in the long run to a successive uh decrease in the food Grand production if we want to actually stop that if we want to mitigate about that then it is essential that the farmers appro adopt a strategy which is appropriate to the rainfall variability of the region now if in particular a reliable prediction of a non-occurrence of droughts is possible then it will have a very huge impact on agricultural production that is very clear so if we are to maintain self sufficiency in food production it is essential that the loss of deficit Years be made up in other years now how do we do that price has to be at a level at which these practices of yield enhancement become economically viable because why are farmers not investing in it not because they don't know they invest in it in on irrigated passages where the yield is assured they're not investing it on rainfed patches because their estimate of enhanced benefit due to enhanced yield is not larger than the cost they incur in some of the years now if the price was hi to a level to a higher level than the present then obviously the enhanced benefit due to enhanced yield will be larger and that may make it economically viable for them to actually invest in fertilizers and pesticides so this is something thing that we have to think about and institutional mechanisms need to be set up to allow carry over the profits of the good years to compensate for some loss in poor rainfall years now this is where it is very difficult for marginal farmers and Farmers without any Capital to do but this is where farmers in places like Australia are able to actually tailor their strategies to climate variability and in their case wheat is not irrigated like in ours and in Australia three years large profits can take care of seven years of relatively low profits or even losses and this is because the farmers are able to carry over this so we may need to make up mechanisms to address this so a surprising result of this study which was a straightforward study of impact of monsoon on fgp and GDP made by fitting long period Trends and saying that the deviation of these Trends must be deviation from these Trends long period Trends must be caused by events of the year which include Wars which include balance of payment crisis but most often which incl include vagaries of the monsoon so by saying that the two should be related we assess the impact of the monsoon on both food grain production and on GDP and the most surprising result from here which was was not uh expected from the work uh literature on the subject was the enormous nonlinearity very strong nonlinearity or the market asymmetry in the response to negative versus positive ismr anomalies so there is a marked asymmetry in the response to Monsoon variability with the magnitude of the negative impact of a drought being more than that of the positive impact of a a surplus and in recent times while the impact of a high deficit in ismr which is 15% is 9% that of a surplus of the same magnitude is less than 1% so unless this situation changes it will not be possible to maintain the growth rate of food grain production at an adequate level for ensuring food security the most striking feature we observe is the impact of a severe drought on GDP remains 2 to 5% throughout despite the substantial decrease in the contribution of Agriculture to GDP over the 5D past five decades now this is important and we need to understand why that happens that happens because although agriculture is contributing less and less to GDP the purchasing since 60% of the population depends on agriculture for its living in one way or another they purchasing power depends on the agricultural production so it has a very large impact a deficit Monsoon which has a large negative impact on agricultural production has a large impact on the purchasing power and hence on the GDP in fact we estimate that for a drought of moderate intensity at current levels of economy and production and this is an estimate made in 2006 when the paper was published the impact on GDP at current prices is around 50 ,000 crores so this is 10 times one of our usual scams so it's an order of magnitude larger than that and so the impact on GDP is 50,000 crores or more and an fgp deficit of around 10 million tons in food grain production just let us see for comparison that the Mahatma Gandhi National rural employment scheme budget at that time was 40,000 crores so this will give you an idea of of how large the impact of the monsoon can be and we ought to do more than we do to be prepared for that given the magnitude of the impact it's not surprising that in the wake of the severe drought of 2002 with ismr deficit of 21% the central government mobilized 20,000 crores to finance relief programs including Calamity relief release of food grains free of cost waver of loans Etc in addition to such mitigatory efforts it is essential to identify and adopt strategies that lead to a substantial reduction of the impact of the drought it is also important to identify and adopt strategies which will enable us to reap benefits of normal and good rainfall in the majority of the years which are not droughts so that at least a part of the impact of the droughts can be made up thank you I think this is where I'm going to stop",
