00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:06,060
dear innovators how are you do you ever

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:08,519
think that by a professional holding a

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,980
diploma in agriculture or just to be a

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:13,590
sega culture card Agricultural Extension

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,199
officer but not a professional holding

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:18,330
village is an incredible extension what

7
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:21,300
is an extension what is an extension

8
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:23,340
service what is extension education what

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:27,140
is a negative Israel extension extension

10
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:30,900
research what are these why it is needed

11
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:33,390
to study extension from where it came to

12
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:36,600
our context why we need to study all

13
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,640
these yes all such questions will be

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,250
clarified within 10 minutes in this

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:46,170
video I am dr. Sarah Chandra welcome to

16
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:48,120
the channel agree innovators every

17
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,390
agricultural University in India must

18
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:54,719
perform three important roles education

19
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,370
research and extension education is to

20
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,399
develop and produce agricultural

21
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:02,789
professionals to develop agricultural

22
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:05,610
sector research is to encounter various

23
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:09,659
challenges occurs while agriculture

24
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:11,970
sector development extension is to cue

25
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:14,780
knowledge of Agriculture and its

26
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:19,530
technologies to the people who actually

27
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:21,900
practices agriculture like farmers let

28
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,560
us take the extension dimension of the

29
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,880
university and discuss in detail

30
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,930
extensions in the broader sense it is

31
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:34,110
called extension service this service is

32
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:36,299
an educational intervention Extension

33
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:39,000
Service Providers educates the farmers

34
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:41,640
about new methods of practices new

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,450
approaches for the profit and various

36
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:48,570
useful agricultural information along

37
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,369
with the educating the farmers here the

38
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:53,600
extension service providers can also

39
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:58,890
supply them with various agricultural

40
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:01,170
inputs credits etc look at to the

41
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,509
pictures provided here here some of the

42
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,960
scientists they are supplying farmers

43
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:07,990
with the new technology of poultry

44
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,550
housing

45
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:12,940
and they are supplying to the farmers

46
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:15,040
here one of the scientists is explaining

47
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:17,140
the farmers various diagnostic methods

48
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,260
and identifying the particular pests in

49
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:23,470
a particular crop and here another

50
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:26,760
picture where Agricultural Extension

51
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:29,920
officers they are trying to demonstrate

52
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:34,840
various agriculture technology for the

53
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:39,190
paddy to the farmers but who will do

54
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,930
this Extension Service Agriculture

55
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:43,030
officers aggregate all extension

56
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:45,269
officers rural developmental officers

57
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:48,850
private sector development officers

58
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:51,370
scientists at kvk dart centers sometimes

59
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:53,650
estin professors scientists when they

60
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:57,910
visit adopted villages or any field

61
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:59,650
visits like that and occasionally the

62
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:03,220
students in the reveille program

63
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:05,050
sometimes NSS programs may visit the

64
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:08,620
fields and they can perform this

65
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:10,209
extension service till now we have

66
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,220
covered one of the dimensions of

67
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:14,829
extension that is Extension Service

68
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:17,140
still two more dimensions of extension

69
00:03:14,829 --> 00:03:19,600
are there they are extension research

70
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:22,269
and extension education let us see

71
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,100
extension research in detail what is an

72
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:26,850
extension research and who will do this

73
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:29,980
extension research we are going to see

74
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:32,650
observe the list of focus areas of

75
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:35,410
research of extension with the help of

76
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:37,900
extension research we can identify the

77
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:40,329
best methods of transfer of Technology

78
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,579
and we can study the adoption behavior

79
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:44,829
of the farmers and we can identify the

80
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:47,380
farmers interests so these suggestions

81
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:49,360
and their requirements and we can

82
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:51,150
identify the suitability of a particular

83
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,560
technology to the farming community

84
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:56,340
feasibility any of any particular

85
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,870
technology and we can identify the

86
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:01,090
different case studies and we can report

87
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:03,190
success and failure stories the most

88
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:05,320
important thing is that we can forecast

89
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:07,810
the technology and we can forecast the

90
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:10,209
research requirements from the farmer

91
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:11,470
side as well as from the state for

92
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:15,010
different stakeholders of the

93
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:17,859
agriculture sectors and we can give that

94
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:21,840
particular information to the

95
00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:24,400
and who will do this extension research

96
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,860
they are extension specialized

97
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,740
scientists at receiving me and kandra's

98
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,300
and dart centers regional agricultural

99
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:34,780
research stations agriculture of

100
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:38,889
colleges and PG and PhD students of

101
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:40,930
Agricultural Extension let us consider

102
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:43,629
another dimension of an extension that

103
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:46,000
is extension education here again two

104
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:48,849
things are there one one thing is there

105
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,789
the extension expert is equipping the

106
00:04:48,849 --> 00:04:53,949
agricultural professionals to perform as

107
00:04:51,789 --> 00:04:57,909
extension service providers in the

108
00:04:53,949 --> 00:05:01,319
future again those extension service

109
00:04:57,909 --> 00:05:04,090
providers are involving farmers for the

110
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:06,389
transfer of Technology these two things

111
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:12,310
are comes under Agricultural Extension

112
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:13,479
education so teaching of extension

113
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:15,879
science to the agricultural

114
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:19,150
professionals as well as agricultural

115
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:22,630
science to the farmers both things comes

116
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:25,750
under extension education now tell me

117
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:28,300
which subject is more important economy

118
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:30,789
it is targeting the plants how to grow

119
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:34,199
the crops entomology is targeting on the

120
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:37,090
pests pathology is targeting on the

121
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:39,430
pathogens and breeding see technology

122
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:43,300
these are targeting about the seeds

123
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:45,639
plants like that but extension is

124
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,590
targeting the farmers and their

125
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:50,500
prosperity

126
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:54,400
I'm not saying extension is the only

127
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:56,159
subject is meant for the farmers with

128
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,500
the along with all the subjects

129
00:05:56,159 --> 00:06:03,009
extension is also playing a very crucial

130
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:05,949
role to the development of agricultural

131
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:08,979
sector actually we should not compare

132
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:10,840
subjects like these one should have its

133
00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:12,969
own role for the development of

134
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,889
agricultural sector we have to consider

135
00:06:12,969 --> 00:06:18,279
each and every subject is very much

136
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:21,849
important for the farming community so

137
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:23,009
how can we define extension education it

138
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:25,199
has n number of

139
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:28,020
nation's because it has a very wide

140
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,770
range of dimensions out of all

141
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:33,599
definitions I have picked up a common

142
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:35,969
simple definition for extension

143
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:38,159
education look at that extension

144
00:06:35,969 --> 00:06:41,039
education is a professional method of

145
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:43,680
non-formal education to bring desirable

146
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:46,979
changes in knowledge skills attitudes

147
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,529
and understanding of the rural people to

148
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:52,680
improve their social economical and

149
00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:55,080
psychological status we need to

150
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:58,080
understand it is a non-formal education

151
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:02,309
and it is an educational intervention

152
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:04,620
and here we are focusing on the socio

153
00:07:02,309 --> 00:07:09,089
economic and psychological standards of

154
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:12,120
the people the term extension we have

155
00:07:09,089 --> 00:07:16,050
given meaning for the term extension in

156
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:18,120
India is transfer of Technology but here

157
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:21,330
we can observe different meanings of an

158
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:24,990
extension in Dutch it is called go

159
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:29,839
reaching in Malaysia it is called short

160
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:33,629
arch UK it is an advisory work Germany

161
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:36,629
enlightenment USA education Austria

162
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:39,629
furthering Korea rural guidance France

163
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:42,659
vulgarize ation spain capacities ation

164
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:45,330
so we have we can give different

165
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:48,029
meanings for the term extension but in

166
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:51,029
india we have given a meaning for the

167
00:07:48,029 --> 00:07:53,399
extension is transfer of technology so

168
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:55,229
that we are mostly concentrating on the

169
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:58,680
transfer of agricultural technologies to

170
00:07:55,229 --> 00:08:00,149
the farmers through extension let us

171
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:05,279
speak about some of the facts about

172
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:07,529
extension it has started not from the

173
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:10,620
agriculture universities like this it

174
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:14,819
has started in as a university extension

175
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:16,439
during 1867 actually availability of the

176
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:18,330
knowledge and generation of new

177
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:20,550
knowledge with the help of research is

178
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:24,899
only consumed within the university

179
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:27,870
vicinity but during 87 it has felt that

180
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:29,849
what is the fate of outside university

181
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:31,469
people so they should also get

182
00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:33,510
benefitted with the university knowledge

183
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:35,580
so their first time

184
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:37,200
steps towards extending the university

185
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:40,830
knowledge to the rural community has

186
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:43,770
started from there the concept extension

187
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:46,530
has came into the picture nowadays we

188
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:48,960
are adopting this extension subject for

189
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:51,990
the agriculture horticulture veterinary

190
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:56,550
fisheries forestry daily home sales etc

191
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:59,630
in India so first time in Britain the

192
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:03,510
