1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:13,950
so session two from technology transfer

2
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:16,350
to agricultural innovation systems its

3
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,539
objectives are to introduce the

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,910
agricultural innovation system and cover

5
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:23,910
its main features some of it was covered

6
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,980
by Bernie this morning already and look

7
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:29,250
at an overview at the various

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:33,989
participatory tools that you that one

9
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:39,449
should look at so the technology

10
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:42,510
transfer approach looked at a linear

11
00:00:39,449 --> 00:00:45,210
approach where on the one hand you had

12
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,010
experts who produce knowledge and then

13
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:51,269
they worked on how to transfer that

14
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:54,300
knowledge to its end users it assumes

15
00:00:51,269 --> 00:00:57,059
that by taking expert knowledge and

16
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:00,479
pushing it down the chain and end users

17
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:04,769
one can get good adoption and increased

18
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:07,740
productivity so essentially this is how

19
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,540
it looked it starts at one end with the

20
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:12,509
researchers it goes through the

21
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,700
extension system to the farmers from the

22
00:01:12,509 --> 00:01:16,950
farmers to the marketers and from the

23
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,229
marketers to the consumers that's how

24
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:22,049
the farming system approach looked like

25
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:25,079
under a linear technology transfer

26
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:26,939
approach the emphasis here is on

27
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:28,439
developing the capacity of research

28
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:30,680
through investment in scientific

29
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:33,840
infrastructure and human capital and

30
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:36,840
research is not linked to technology

31
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,329
users or other sources or other actors

32
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,780
in the sector does anyone recognize this

33
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:46,140
slide because we went over it this

34
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:49,079
morning so it basically looks how from

35
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,359
the 1960 we started with the technology

36
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,960
transfer the famous Green Revolution and

37
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:56,189
so on

38
00:01:51,960 --> 00:02:00,420
moved into our farming systems analysis

39
00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:01,979
and fs our approach then in the 90s to

40
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:06,329
agricultural knowledge information

41
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:08,940
system and finally in this century the

42
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:11,190
agricultural innovation system so the

43
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,260
approach in each case was covered I

44
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:16,340
won't repeat it because Bernie went over

45
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:19,220
it this morning but you clearly see that

46
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:22,310
main headings in terms of the approach

47
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:25,160
and then for each approach there is a

48
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:28,370
distinct role for farmers role for

49
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:30,739
research and researchers and what are

50
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:33,140
its intended outcomes key intervention

51
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:36,680
areas and what weaknesses do they have

52
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:44,299
so it's the same clarity I'll study from

53
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:46,910
2012 that map this typology so again it

54
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:49,130
moves from the approaches throughout the

55
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:51,680
year until we get to where we are today

56
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:54,290
and today we speak of agricultural

57
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,170
innovation systems and here's one

58
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:59,900
depiction of how the innovation system

59
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:02,150
can look like it's composed of primary

60
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:04,970
actors so those would be our farmers

61
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:07,280
traders and so on into the full value

62
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:09,459
chain from processors wholesaler

63
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,470
retailer and all the way to the consumer

64
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:14,840
what it also depicts is that you know

65
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:17,540
you have the macroeconomic conditions or

66
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,400
your weather climate economy as well as

67
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:22,310
you have the enabling environments or

68
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,799
your government laws policies and the

69
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:27,410
context in which it support these

70
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:30,370
support systems and so on we talked this

71
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:32,930
morning quite in-depth about how the

72
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:35,599
agricultural innovation system is a

73
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:38,569
really complex phenomenon in a complex

74
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:41,090
system part of that part of that is

75
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:43,400
looking at identifying what would be the

76
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:46,579
right entry points for innovation to

77
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:50,329
address those complex problems so for

78
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:53,569
example you would not go in and say I

79
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:56,870
want to tackle problems in agricultural

80
00:03:53,569 --> 00:04:01,280
general you would go in and say I want

81
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:04,099
to try to trial how can I remove striker

82
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,680
weeds in maize or how can I look at crop

83
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:09,380
protection looking at specific points of

84
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,480
entries in order to address that so we

85
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:14,959
start with a current situation remember

86
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:17,630
this morning's roleplay we're looking at

87
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:21,169
from international to national to

88
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:23,260
sub-national remember the levels and the

89
00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:26,060
various actors that are involved

90
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:28,580
together we bring them through this

91
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,689
Fennell of this change and innovation

92
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,189
action

93
00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:35,239
to bring us closer to the desired

94
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:39,639
solution in your case ecotourism with

95
00:04:35,239 --> 00:04:42,079
sustained rubber in our idyllic township

96
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:44,539
the agricultural innovation system

97
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:49,999
closes the loop by bringing that back

98
00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:53,989
into the stakeholders and the cycle goes

99
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:59,839
on so it's a much more cyclical approach

100
00:04:53,989 --> 00:05:03,139
as opposed to a linear approach so what

101
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:05,749
are some of the attributes when we look

102
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:08,679
at the keywords of the linear approach

103
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:11,899
we hear things like planning transfer

104
00:05:08,679 --> 00:05:13,669
when we look at the keywords of

105
00:05:11,899 --> 00:05:16,849
agricultural innovation system you're

106
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:20,629
here word like participation empowerment

107
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:24,709
community yeah so sometimes just by

108
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:27,579
reading the document or listening to the

109
00:05:24,709 --> 00:05:32,119
policy you can actually see in which

110
00:05:27,579 --> 00:05:34,369
ideology it is nested the same thing in

111
00:05:32,119 --> 00:05:36,349
terms of the decision making the

112
00:05:34,369 --> 00:05:39,379
decision making in the linear was much

113
00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:41,749
more centralized a decision was taken

114
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:44,659
this technology was developed and now it

115
00:05:41,749 --> 00:05:47,059
will be rolled out the decision making

116
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:49,399
in an agricultural innovation system is

117
00:05:47,059 --> 00:05:53,989
much more decentralized it's much more

118
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:56,419
participatory and therefore it will be

119
00:05:53,989 --> 00:05:58,969
more active at the local level as well

120
00:05:56,419 --> 00:06:01,869
as opposed to being more Universal

121
00:05:58,969 --> 00:06:01,869
whether nationally or internationally

122
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:09,019
the local population would be seen in

123
00:06:07,219 --> 00:06:11,989
the linear approaches beneficiaries

124
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:15,429
which assumes a certain passiveness to

125
00:06:11,989 --> 00:06:17,869
it receiving a particular intervention

126
00:06:15,429 --> 00:06:20,329
whereas in an agricultural innovation

127
00:06:17,869 --> 00:06:23,659
system it is looked at more as partners

128
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:27,289
or actors within the system so it's

129
00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:30,259
quite a different mindset with regards

130
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:34,399
to the approaches and that comes through

131
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:36,979
in the terminology as well so what are

132
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:42,669
some of the limitations of the linear

133
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:42,669
approach what would you say

134
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:55,390
yes please use your mic for one it

135
00:06:52,690 --> 00:07:00,850
follows the classic transmission model

136
00:06:55,390 --> 00:07:02,650
yes it's unidirectional one way if you

137
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:04,240
need directional one way Direction one

138
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:07,360
way communication and what is the

139
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,430
limitation with that then only the voice

140
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,040
of the source of technology for example

141
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:13,840
is heard okay fine so we don't we don't

142
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:21,160
get all the voices the diversity of

143
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:25,660
voices anyone else well there are a

144
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:29,580
number of issues one is oftentimes we

145
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:29,580
fail to actually meet our users needs

146
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,520
okay I'm going to break the mold because

147
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:39,550
I don't like just reading slide so I'm

148
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:44,170
going to tell your story so you go to a

149
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:45,820
farmer with this blue sweater and you

150
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:49,030
give the farmer the blue sweater and say

151
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:52,570
do you like this sweater so yes I like

152
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:54,640
this weather I'll take it you ask the

153
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:56,919
farmer would you buy this sweater no I

154
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,300
would never buy this sweater what's

155
00:07:56,919 --> 00:07:59,290
wrong with it you just told me a minute

156
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,900
ago that you like it

157
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:03,370
hey we're giving it away for free if I

158
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,390
have to pay for it it should be black

159
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:06,280
and it should be from a different

160
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:08,590
material and you should look differently

161
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,940
so often time when we come with an

162
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:13,030
intervention we just want to give it

163
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:15,340
away we're missing a lot of very

164
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:17,169
critical feedback from our partners as

165
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:19,330
to what it is really that they want and

166
00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:23,520
the consequences that we might be

167
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:26,590
meeting failing to meet their user needs

168
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:29,320
we also don't have a focus on continuous

169
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:31,229
learning and innovation process which

170
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:34,419
leaves the communities

171
00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:37,750
incapable of being resilient and

172
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:41,530
grappling with the future changes and

173
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:43,659
that's important why it's important

174
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:47,080
because the future is uncertain as we

175
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:48,910
said and unpredictable so we might have

176
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,130
given someone a solution for something

177
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:53,860
that will not be the problem they need

178
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:55,120
to face in five years time but unless

179
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,310
we've given them the skill

180
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,120
said to deal with that they'll always be

181
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:00,120
dependent on us

182
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:12,850
it also doesn't take into account local

183
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:15,310
and indigenous knowledge it creates very

184
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:17,200
little opportunities for interactions

185
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:20,350
between different sources of knowledge

186
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,540
so things innovation is created

187
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:25,750
separately but this morning when we

188
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:28,140
watched a whiteboard animation and an

189
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:30,960
hypothesis was made there it's the

190
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:35,110
interconnectedness that Spurs innovation

191
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:37,390
not a single person in this room raised

192
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:40,480
their hand to say they disagree so

193
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:44,890
there's some inherent faults here with

194
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:48,160
with this old system in terms of what it

195
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:51,070
can achieve innovation has now become

196
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,920
the focus of many development projects

197
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:56,820
and innovation systems are now put in

198
00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:01,089
the center of many development projects

199
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:03,700
that could be a good thing if you agree

200
00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:06,850
with what's being said here but it can

201
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:08,470
also be a big dangerous thing it can

202
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:10,839
also be a dangerous thing when you

203
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:12,760
believe in this that this is good in its

204
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:15,160
own sake that this doesn't become a

205
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:17,529
means to an end but a goal in and of

206
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,870
itself yeah we have to always remain

207
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:22,450
very critical about all of these things

208
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:24,779
and see whether they are really helping

209
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:27,970
us achieve what we set out to achieve

210
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:30,910
the other thing with the technology

211
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:34,810
transfer approach is that it assumed

212
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:37,270
that farmers did not know anything so

213
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:42,700
I've developed a brand new technology

214
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:44,650
and now farmers need to adopt it and if

215
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:46,300
farmers are not adopting it it's because

216
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:49,660
they haven't understood it well enough

217
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:52,320
so we have to explain it again it's very

218
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:56,440
hard sometimes for researchers to accept

219
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:58,450
that the reason people don't adopt their

220
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,670
practices is because their practices

221
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:03,610
aren't so good and that people actually

222
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:07,620
know best what's right for their context

223
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:09,150
yeah but this is something that was very

224
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:12,930
prevalent in the technology transfer

225
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:14,850
approach in fairness if you don't do the

226
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:17,460
agricultural innovation system approach

227
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:21,210
well you can very quickly find yourself

228
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:23,580
in the same pitfalls yeah so if I come

229
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:25,830
to you and I I decided what the solution

230
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:28,140
should be but then we have a nice

231
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:31,020
discussion about it but that at the end

232
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:33,120
it has to come to that conclusion that

233
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:36,060
might be more participatory but you know

234
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:39,630
it doesn't change the fundamentals but

235
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:42,029
maybe the salient feature is that today

236
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:43,800
the researcher and the extension workers

237
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:47,279
are learning first from the farmers

238
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:50,339
before coming up with with findings and

239
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:53,339
recommendations so the needs based

240
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:56,910
identification is a very key part of

241
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:59,640
this system as well and that's

242
00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:01,380
associated with that it used to be that

243
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:03,839
a lot of the research was done on

244
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:06,350
research stations you know that's where

245
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:10,860
research gets done today more and more

246
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:13,020
research is being done and tested at the

247
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:16,740
farm and with the farmers and that's

248
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:20,339
very important because the conditions

249
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:24,209
that you get in a research station might

250
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:26,850
never be exactly like they are in the

251
00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:31,110
various locations where farmers actually

252
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:34,110
work so it's more systematic it's more

253
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:36,240
interactive and more emphasis is placed

254
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:40,290
on the interactions between the various

255
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:42,300
stakeholders so a lot of it's been said

256
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:45,500
and you'll hear more on that the more

257
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:48,839
you get involved with the system is

258
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:52,980
capacity to innovate it's something that

259
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:56,370
gets said a lot but it's not that easy

260
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:58,709
to define how would you define capacity

261
00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:03,650
to innovate would somebody like to

262
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:03,650
venture a definition or an explanation

263
00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:10,380
if you went on a capacity to innovate

264
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:14,250
training workshop what would you expect

265
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:16,920
the subject matter to be not that easy

266
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:19,170
to define and yet a lot of the system is

267
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,570
anchored around capacity to innovate so

268
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:23,300
it's important to think

269
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:25,520
about what that actually means and often

270
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:27,680
what the literature tells us is that

271
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:31,400
capacity to innovate is the capacity to

272
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:33,980
adapt to the different constraints and

273
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:36,500
challenges with which our face and to

274
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:40,790
autonomously come up with solutions that

275
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:42,410
would help overcome that yeah

276
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:45,020
but of course that can look very

277
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:46,940
differently depending on the context of

278
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:51,890
where you live the sector of where you

279
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:54,290
work and so on potentially in the

280
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:55,760
agricultural innovation system all the

281
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:58,640
actors in both the public and private

282
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:01,670
sectors are involved throughout the

283
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:04,550
chain so in creating diffusing adapting

284
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:07,910
and using all types of knowledge so

285
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:09,590
that's a very big change and often the

286
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:12,890
innovation arises through a dynamic

287
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:14,450
interaction amongst most of the actors

288
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:16,220
so like you were sitting in your groups

289
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:18,320
earlier you had the different

290
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,850
stakeholders interacting that's

291
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,220
essentially the premise of an

292
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:24,230
agricultural innovation system bring the

293
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:26,510
stakeholders together and have these

294
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:30,110
kinds of interactions and for these

295
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:33,290
enter interactions to occur they need to

296
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:35,150
be open and draw about the best sources

297
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:37,430
of information wherever they might come

298
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:40,160
from not just from a designated source

299
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:42,110
that is designated the best source but

300
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:46,850
really what the group feels is the best

301
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:52,180
source ok let's check if you're awake

302
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:58,760
after lunch in the linear model of

303
00:14:52,180 --> 00:15:01,550
Agricultural Extension agricultural

304
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:03,650
leader research through technology

305
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:05,150
transfer leads to technology adoption

306
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:07,550
and increase productivity

307
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:18,580
what is the name commonly given to this

308
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:18,580
approach a B C or D only for replies

309
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:39,690
only 14 replies okay

310
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:43,430
17 18 20 I'll buy 20 yes so this is the

311
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:43,430
technology transfer approach

312
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:54,960
what role did researchers not have under

313
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:57,410
agricultural knowledge and information

314
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,410
systems

315
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:32,910
interesting yes so they were not

316
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,910
facilitators of learning

317
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:53,660
okay which of the following is not

318
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:56,780
considered a failure of the linear

319
00:16:53,660 --> 00:17:00,170
technology transfer approach a failure

320
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:01,940
to achieve development impacts B failure

321
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:05,390
to appreciate local and indigenous

322
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:08,000
knowledge C failure to promote a culture

323
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:12,910
of continuous learning and innovation or

324
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,910
D failure to scale out new technologies

325
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:33,609
yes the majority of room of the room got

326
00:17:30,009 --> 00:17:36,419
it right but still there's a big chunk

327
00:17:33,609 --> 00:17:40,049
of the room that didn't get it right

328
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:43,359
scaling is actually the one thing that

329
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:45,039
the technology transfer approach did

330
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:48,279
very effectively think of the Green

331
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:51,009
Revolution and so on yeah the other

332
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:54,749
areas are all areas where we just

333
00:17:51,009 --> 00:17:54,749
discussed it falls a bit short on
