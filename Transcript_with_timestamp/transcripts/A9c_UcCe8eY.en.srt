guava cultivation this fruit is widely

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,759
grown and valued for its nutritional

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,360
value in sweet flavor this video will

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,960
give you an in-depth understanding of

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:20,000
how these guavas are grown with great

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:23,480
care and precision ensuring that each

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,920
fruit is of the highest quality We Begin

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:29,320
our journey in the guava and guava

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:32,119
orchards in changua County Taiwan Mark

11
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:35,320
the beginning of guava cultivation the

12
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:38,120
cultivation of pearl guavas begins with

13
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:41,440
selecting healthy guava Sprouts these

14
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:44,600
Sprouts are carefully planted to ensure

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,239
they are completely attached to the soil

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,360
which is critical for their initial

17
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:52,239
growth and development when the guava

18
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:55,399
plants are about a month old you can

19
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:58,680
move them into the farm in the field

20
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:00,840
each Sprout is planted with Precision

21
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:05,080
maintaining a recommended a distance of

22
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:08,320
1 to 1.5 M between each tree this

23
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:11,280
spacing allows each tree to grow and

24
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:14,720
receive nutrients without competing with

25
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,119
neighboring trees once seed planted the

26
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,640
guava trees are provided with a drip

27
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:23,360
irrigation system which is crucial for

28
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:26,240
their growth drip irrigation is a highly

29
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,880
efficient method that delivers water

30
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,520
directly to the roots of trees

31
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,600
conserving water

32
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:35,680
and providing necessary hydration water

33
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,880
for the irrigation system is sourced

34
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,439
from nearby pumps and before it is used

35
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,680
it undergo filtration to remove any

36
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:47,200
impurities this ensures that the water

37
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,799
is clean as and free of contaminants

38
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,600
that could potentially harm the plants

39
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:55,079
if needed nutrients are also added to

40
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,799
the water to support the Healthy Growth

41
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:00,719
of the trees ensuring that they receive

42
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:04,039
everything they need to thrive

43
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:06,640
as the guava trees grow regularly and

44
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:09,520
trimming trees especially when they

45
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,080
reach 4 months of age is crucial for

46
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,280
promoting Healthy Growth and focusing

47
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:18,680
nutrients on fruit development removing

48
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,319
excess branches improves air circulation

49
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,879
reduces disease risk and promotes

50
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:26,280
Healthy Growth regularly trimming grass

51
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:29,200
around trees prevents competition for

52
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:33,280
nutrients and maintains the plantation

53
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:36,680
clean and free of pests one of the most

54
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:40,239
important stages in guava cultivation is

55
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:42,840
the preparation for fringing when the

56
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:46,080
trees are ready to bear fruit before

57
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,080
wrapping the guaves farmers cut the tops

58
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,239
of the branches to direct the trees

59
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:56,040
nutrients toward the fruit this practice

60
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:59,480
is crucial for producing large and sweet

61
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:03,239
guavas a Hallmark of high quality Pearl

62
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:07,200
guava s it's worth noting that only one

63
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:10,599
fruit is allowed to grow per Branch a

64
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,400
selective process commonly used in Japan

65
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:16,480
to produce higher quality fruit the

66
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:19,400
guavas are then wrapped in nylon bags

67
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,360
that serve several purposes the bags

68
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,120
create a controlled environment for

69
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,040
guavas protecting them from Birds

70
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,760
insects rain and sun exposure this

71
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,239
results in a more consistent and high qu

72
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,519
quity product The Waiting King period

73
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:38,439
for the fruit to ripen is about 1.5

74
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,360
months depending on the season during

75
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:45,319
the summer when rainfall is abundant

76
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:48,879
guavas are particularly susceptible to

77
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:51,480
perishing if not properly cared for so

78
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:54,480
the wrapping of the fruit becomes even

79
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,319
more important during this period

80
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,480
additionally while waiting for the

81
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:02,239
guavas to ripen the branches are pruned

82
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:05,439
per periodically to maintain the trees

83
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:08,920
health and promote better fruit and

84
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:11,840
production pruning is an important part

85
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:14,720
of the maintenance routine because it

86
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,919
helps manage the trees growth and

87
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,519
ensures that nutrients are focused on

88
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,960
the developing fruits as the fruits

89
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,840
approach their harvesting stage the

90
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,880
sweetness of the guavas is checked to

91
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,240
determine if they are ready to be picked

92
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,320
farmers use specific techniques to

93
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:38,000
ensure that only the sweetest and most

94
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:41,240
mature fruits are harvested this careful

95
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,759
selection process is critical because it

96
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:47,199
ensures that the guavas reach taste and

97
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:50,039
texture once the guavas reach the

98
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,840
desired level of sweetness it is time

99
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:55,919
for the much anticipated harvest the

100
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:59,199
harvesting process is carried out with

101
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:02,680
great care to avoid damaging the fruits

102
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:05,280
farmers Harvest guavas using scissors

103
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:08,199
and place them in trays to avoid

104
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,600
bruising after harvesting remove the

105
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:13,720
stems and thoroughly wash the fruits in

106
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:16,600
clean water this step is is important to

107
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:20,039
ensure the fruit is clean and free of

108
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:23,160
any residue that has accumulated during

109
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:26,160
the production process guavas are then

110
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,919
neatly arranged in trays before being

111
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:32,319
wrapped in a layer of shock absorbing

112
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:35,479
foam guavas are carefully packaged and

113
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:38,240
transported to Distribution Centers

114
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:40,800
before being sold to Consumers this

115
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,120
marks the end of the fruits Journey from
