  "text": "thanks Amanda really appreciate being in Seattle and enjoying this cool and wet weather um I uh um want to discuss a concept today and right off the bat when I looked at the title and I saw the word new in there I thought wow there is nothing new I don't know if anybody listens to Ted Talks they were talking a few weeks ago on an episode about how there's really nothing new in the world and that we just sort of reinvent stuff and so this is not new uh this is taken whole cloth from uh the new zealanders and from the the uh British aisles and so with that if you're you know if you have to have new you need to go somewhere else but um it it is a good concept of what we have some preliminary data but it's a m mature technology and it used successfully um in different parts of the world where it does this where it rains um frequently and it uh uh during the winter feeding period so I'm going to talk about three sets of uh issues to just set the stage with what the soil and water effects are from feeding cattle um on pastures during the dormant period uh that we have in in the Mid-Atlantic uh part of the United States and then I'll talk about um wood chip uh design and that's an a engineering component and I I I failed to mention that I have collaborators from uh University of Vermont a biosystems engineer Joshua Faulkner and a wood scientist from Duck West Virginia University who worked with uh wood chip issues on these uh um feeding areas and I'll I'll go into a little bit biomass um preliminary data that that we've come up with on on what's suitable to use so anyway within the midatlantic we have uh uh about 1.1 million uh beef brood cows and that's minuscule when you look at you know the Plains and and or or Texas you know it's like one County in Texas could have um you know a third of a third of this uh population so it's it's not big but it's our main uh activity um and our our herd sizes have have increased you know we're we've we've gone from in the last 30 40 years from 15 to 20 head up to now 200 head and so that puts pressure on our on our pastoral systems and and we uh you know initially we we fed square bales and we had Barn kept animals and we we moved to round bales and everything went outside and there's some serious impacts with that so what's a wintering site it's an area where cattle are fed during the dormant period um sites includes you know stored feed um you you you have to tram across to feed concentrates with a tractor um sheltered area if if you need it calf Hutches and a winterized uh uh you know watering system to to uh um complete the uh the system and this is what we get you know I I I do this talk to to Farmers all the time and you know they just nod their head they see this they're the they're the brown Donuts in our pastures at the end of the winter um and you know here's a beautiful spring picture and you see a a pasture on the other side that has not been used as a uh dormant feeding uh winter area and then one on on on this this Paddock and uh the differences are tremendous you know it's uh they all say that they don't do tillage but they really do this is this is a pretty severe tillage in a saturated condition um so what you know I go back and it's like the thing is it recovers fast and Farmers forget like that they you know they get ground cover again and they're like hey everything's okay and they go on and then they're back in the same situation so I like to to use this classic study um that Owens at Al I met these guys right before they retired they're from uh kakon Ohio uh they had a a wonderful ARS station there that was uh closed down uh recently uh in The Last 5 Years but they had monitored watersheds across the place and and what they did was they they uh did long-term studies which we don't we can't afford to do and which we don't do anymore but they had a period of from 74 to 886 where they continuously used a pasture they summer grazed and then they winter fed on it and then they pulled the cows out and they only grazed during the summer for another period of years and then the final period they only harvested hay and the results um they had 60% of their sediment loss occurring during the dormant period um not surprising but the greatest losses um were during March to June um you know and they had 40% of their loss during April and that's when our hydrologic cycle is really letting go we have a lot of spring rains and and uh uh a lot of uh tillage by the cows so this is just a uh you know it kind of gives you an idea of precipitation precipitation was even across all these years from 74 to 94 there's some there's some some uh um fuzziness to it but look at the the runoff events during this uh um 24 or 12 month use period of the pasture where they where they uh had cows on it they had compaction and they increased uh runoff during that period and as soon as they pulled the cows off and only had them grazing those runoff events even with the same sort of rainfall uh activity dropped off you know uh significantly and then during the hay only again there was a a huge reduction so we know that um you know it's a just a nice um quantification of the impacts of winter feeding on pasture and then here's the the uh corresponding sediment loss numbers and as soon as you pull them off you know all your sediment losses are during that winter feeding period and are caused from from that on in a pasture system the kicker for me and this is what I try to tell Farmers is that you're you're killing your production you you you know you've got um here's here's June 1 and here's percent here's here here's when you're getting back to 100% ground cover and and Through the Years there were times when they were well into the growing period and they only had 60% ground um ground cover so you know using your your your your money crop as a winter feeding area does you know it's a it's a huge conservation effect to move those cows off of that pasture land in our neck of the woods and so this is what what we stole from the the uh new zealanders and and the Brits and the Scots and the Irish um it's a it's an engineered uh heavy use area they call them out wintering p ads so if you want to learn about how it's done and what the the Deep research that's been done go go look at the British work and and and do a search on out wintering pads so what you do is we have um really good clay soils uh subsoils or B Horizon we just create these these humps and we put in drainage and we added uh uh 57 aggregate Stone a good size um gravel uh at a at a foot deep and then we um added our our wood chip base uh to that and you know we do have local materials uh and that's that's an advantage we have a lot of uh uh Eastern Hardwoods and a lot of scrap trees that are not um uh valuable uh for the timber industry so we can chip those up it's an environmental benefit but there's some cost and management to it and and uh French over in England they just wanted to compare cattle performance on inhouse versus keeping these cows out on a wood chip pad and and basically they found um that the wood chip pad from feed intake and and uh you know carcass weight uh live weight we all similar or better than than these other Management Systems of keeping cow in and so there was there's no sort of physical detriment to having cows outside in the weather so here's a picture of of the one that we put in it was a a very low budget we had a Conservation District that helped us uh establish this uh you will notice that it's next to a uh nrcs heavy um uh roofed winter feeding area so we combined a out wintering loafing pad with feeding area and they do recommend not to feed on these out wintering pads because you'll create too much concentration of manure around the feeding area so you feed somewhere else so there's there's the drainage um uh uh pits and there's the gravel there was a drain pipe that went into those low spots um you can see our our deep soils with uh um and and this was the the out pipe and so you do have to manage process water and that scares our Farmers because for them EPA looks at a pastoral system as being benign and so they say oh well if we pull cows onto a pad we're creating a point source but I mean the the economics have to come into play how much damage are you doing to your resource so we put in a standard septic tank and uh um within that septic tank we had a a pretty nifty little uh device that was on a pivot and what it did was it allowed accumulation of effluent um into the septic T tank the the flout would come up to the to to a horizontal position and then it would fill the pipe and it would flop over and empty that that tank all at once and that would dose our vegetative Treatment Center um and there's our there's our uh um vegetative uh our dispersal pipe for our vegetative Treatment Center we set up we set up another one um at our animal at our Dairy science uh uh Farm in Morgantown and we just uh tapped it into the Lagoon so those are your choices you can either have a uh a treatment center or put it in a tank where you can spread it cows are very happy um they uh they had about 50 head and they they uh kept these cows um on this pad for about a 65 day period during the the highest peak of our hydrologic cycle so costs everybody wants to know what what do these things cost and and a wood chip pad and this is a dollars per cow uh it's it's reasonably priced um in England I I think that they probably cut all their trees down so there's a little higher cost um and roof winter this is the standard roof winter uh feeding barn and manure storage is considerably higher um pouring a concrete pad or gravel pad is uh gravel pad's about um uh the same price or a little bit higher uh stocking density uh is is uh you do have to give the the cows about 110 ft because you want them to be able to lay down you want them to be have comfortable and have have space um to to uh not be crowded um and and so these are these are comparables these are our nrcs uh standards that we that we compared this to because we don't have a lot of uh um um Alternatives so we we uh we had a very preliminary uh uh sampling protocol we we uh look we we did grab samples at 12 storm events um you know we'd run up you know hour and a half whenever whenever it looked like we were going to have a runoff event and go grab a sample um or the county agent would help us do that and we had a pressure pressure transducer in the in the septic tank so that we could count how many many times that flout raised and so we knew what what our um amount of of of outflow was for the for the system and we had reasonable numbers you know we it again we compared this with uh um an earn uh uh pad or a concrete pad and we were comparable to a concrete pad and we were much less than an earth and um you know dry lot um for for numbers and uh you know the the the Brits have found that uh uh you know their estimation is that 90 to 90% of the nitrogen and phosphorus is is in the manure that's sort of held in this uh in this filter bed um that that uh uh the cows uh loaf on again and with uh um looking at uh um runoff coefficients uh again we were we were uh um comparable with um concrete and we were much better than than earn um and you can see uh you know our non- winter periods what happened was we had rain events that stretched out to longer times um uh between the rain events and so the the wood chip pad acts as a sponge and so the nice thing is that you don't get an immediate runoff you get some some capacity to hold a rainfall event and then in the the warm weather it'll actually evaporate back out so this kind of shows that with uh these are these are individual rain events uh the bigger the the uh the circle the the the the higher the amount of of rain and and you can see that um as as the duration of dry period as you as you have periods of dry between your events uh less runoff occurs so there's that again that sponge effect to where um you only after you get like repeated rains day in day out then you'll that the system starts to get leaky so it's it's it's kind of a nice um system to to moderate runoff um nutrients cycling what do you do well um you you the recommendations are to have um a layer of chips that are the filter bed chips in the lower area that are fist size okay and those are difficult to find for us because most American uh chippers uh chip a very small chip and so we're still struggling at finding that that English style large chip for the base but on the top you want a much more comfortable finer chip for the animals comfort and that gets pulled and spread and and uh the English have found that soiled wood chips um or composted um you know if you if you apply those you can get equal uh yields at the same um you know application of 54 lbs of synthetic n so you can see there's there's quite a tie up of of nitrogen that would be slow release over time which is kind of nice with a with a woody product and like I'll go back the uh the the big chips there's no degradation so you have to sort of sit and and pull those off after the end of their life which is about five to seven years and then it's like what do we do with those I'm I'm still I'm really curious what the Brits do with their their big large uh chips that you can't spread on the on the uh pasture of haand so this is just sort of a a pictorial of uh um application rates and and response over time to that top P top portion that has to be managed routinely on the on the pad so you know there are disadvantages you have to have uh um um you know repeat applications of a of a thin layer um and and uh you do have to deal with affluent management uh prolonged freezing is an issue or is it not an issue to me um if I've got frozen ground I'll move my cows out onto frozen ground where they can't destructively tear it up um so to me it's like get them off the pad and use it strategically in the wet sloppy weather um and sourcing wood chips I think that that's uh a real issue and and I am down to about a minute um so I'm not going to talk about uh wood chip um Quality or uh but you can come and talk to me about some of our treatments there's our latest uh um pad at the dairy farm and we are uh in the process of asking for an enter and practice standard uh for our state and we just need to continue uh the work and uh the forestry equipment piece is huge getting the right chip for this technology with that I appreciate your time one quick question yes so if the sized wood shift after 5 years is still fist sized what determines that it's exceeded its lifespan the the the permeability or the functionality of the pad is no is so clogged with manure at that point that you have to pull it out and and you have to have a flowthrough system it once it clogs up it'll just start ponding so every five years you have to refresh that entire bedus the pip that's right yeah",
