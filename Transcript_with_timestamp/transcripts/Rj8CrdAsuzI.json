  "text": "[Music] a few foresters Amy here and today we are going to harvest our Virginia jumbo peanuts that we got from ehsan's family gardener or aka the sapper gardener sorry if I messed up Rob yes so we planted peanuts through this whole raised bed here now unbeknownst to us some of our yellow Mexican sunflower seeds happen to get spread in here and so these will will transplant these somewhere else but I'm not gonna worry about bringing them pulling them up right now but for the peanuts that takes about 90 to 110 days and what you want to do is when the leaves start to start turning yellow here that's when you want to harvest them so I've got my basket and we're gonna go ahead and pull a couple out and then also to when we get done picking the peanuts off left over all right when we get done picking the peanuts off of the roots what we're gonna do is we're gonna take these tops and we're going to go ahead and give them to our animals as a treat so let's get started okay so as you can tell these are very tall because this bed is a little low but I'm going to buy one here oh wow here we go I don't know if you can see this there's some peanuts just pop one open and see if it's well let me pull I just broke it off the root you should be we should be using a fork I'll have to get one a little large tool but look well let's see if the being inside is if the peanut is fully formed crunchy crunchy is good yep yeah it looks like it's filled up that's good yeah it's good hold on let me get my gloves off so I can peel these I want to see and sure one of course I know it's gonna be all natural it's probably chocolate tastes like a roasted peanut we have a little bit of green I'll have a little dirt with it dirt don't hurt alright so there's the peanut out of the shell all right here goes definitely has the peanut taste it's like um it does it's not really an earthy taste though but it's good it's different it's more like a um like an unsalted peanut basically not boiled not cooked not roasted we're gonna boil these up and probably freeze some eat some and probably freeze them but let me try that one you want to try that one here let me get your reaction that's about eating a green peanut Bo but not bad no not bad at all it's up salt tastes like a big raw harder green bean or something yeah not bad not bad at all all right so let's uh pull out some more here you know what um in our little tool shed here I think down at the bottom is one of those fork things and a shovel you want to go grab it that's jalapeno but this one is got the peanuts in it yeah peanuts in it I mean they are come it is coming up really good loosely off the dirt didn't think no no in the food oh you get so excited you dumping dirt everywhere everywhere alright let me pick so this basket ain't gonna be big enough we might have to pick them out of here yeah nikka balls let me um hold on cuz there was some that fell off so I just wanna make sure cuz it went older that nice big warm all right guys we're gonna start picking them yeah I'll just start separating them and putting them in here but we may need a smaller basket cuz this baskets got a lot of holes in it so we may have to grab something else okay all right we'll see it a little bit what you doing a me pick a pea nuts [Laughter] so now just so you know it's July today's supposed to get up to 104 with the heat and the humidity so sweating and breathing heavy not a good combination if he's not outside alright so as you could tell this is our pile so far this is what we're gonna be giving a duck's and in the turkeys and the chickens some nice little treats Donald's been pulling this up in sections we got one small section left but as you could tell now you can cure these by hanging them to dry but we're going to be roasting them right away and also we're going to be boiling them so we're not going to bother with curing them we're gonna go right to cooking them now just for you guys to know what we're gonna do is we're gonna let this bed rest for a week we're gonna add some nice topsoil to it once I'm able to get the rest of this stuff cleaned out because you can tell we got dollar weed in here and I went crazy and then we are going to go ahead and plant another crop of these jumbo peanuts we still have some left over and then that way come near the fall we'll have another harvest of the peanuts that's one good thing about Florida we have a very long growing season long and hot so we should so we're attempting to get a second season out of the you ain't guarantee and we can but it's a good experiment to see if we can and they did so well in this bed we just got to replenish it and I think what I may do is I may take one of these Mexican sunflowers do the chop and drop that's gonna add in that nitrogen back into the soil I don't know we want to do with all these seed pods on these I'd rather chop and drop them someplace else I don't want more I don't want to end up with the same thing with Mexican Sun well to be honest this is the first year we've been able to grow them I've planted these all over the place before and just got a little itty spindly I mean they're everywhere and look oh look at all the butterflies yeah butterflies love them yeah look at the butterfly you see they don't all right sorry I don't take camera directions very well no you don't take directions period very well do I you try that's why I always here yes dear see even the turkeys are laughing action oh here's a flower what's left of one the flower just a yellow leaf no it's a petal of a flower ah all right and all I do is I just double check before I lay it down just make sure we got all the good ones cuz Donald likes these little itty bitty was they have a little tiny shells on them I eat them whole I don't even husk him when I boil those I'll just eat those shell and all okay yep one more small row I'll show you how he does it you just come right out yeah you just pull gently these little runners that's what these are these will have them yep - well that's how they that's how the flowers fall yeah because the stem of the flower that's got a lot yeah I just double-check in the soil yeah sure miss any and that one didn't have a bunch that's okay somethings better than nothing one more plant and we oh yeah the weeds hold the plants in pretty good just double-check that make sure there's no throw that in the ditch peanut more what's these dollar weeds get into a bed yeah it's almost impossible to get them out all right all right smooth that out and then uh you want to smooth that's that corner over there out that hole over there yes you can see downer weeds are pretty easy to pull out it's almost like they're what they're just roots and literally you pull on one and almost the whole thing comes out so throw that over the fence all right guys so we're going to go ahead and finish harvesting this and then we're gonna take it inside hey guys if you liked that video hit that like button remember that Belle and subscribe and if you want see any of the other videos check out everything over here [Music]",
