2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:12,240
to get healthy plants a serial farmer

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:17,130
must protect his plants from pests and

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,779
disease especially the leaves so that

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:24,630
there can for to synthesize at the

6
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:32,550
maximum rate not only can these pests

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:34,530
and disease destroyed the crops but they

8
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:36,390
can also contaminate the crops and

9
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,770
harvested produce making them unsuitable

10
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:42,239
or even dangerous for human consumption

11
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:44,579
whilst poppies may look picturesque

12
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,620
among yellow rose seed red flowers their

13
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:49,050
seed is very similar to oil seed rape

14
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,180
seed so cannot be separated during

15
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:55,789
harvest meaning when crushed for their

16
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,789
oil poppy seeds will also be crushed

17
00:00:56,329 --> 00:01:00,930
contaminating the oil with poppy oil not

18
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,379
what you expect to buy in a bottle oil

19
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:06,150
bottle of own seed rare pile farmers

20
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,490
protect their crops using an integrated

21
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:11,490
approach which involves a combination of

22
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:14,700
methods crop rotation cultivations

23
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:16,890
and chemicals crop rotation a farmer

24
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,799
will rotate or change the crop seed

25
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,570
growers in a field each year he will aim

26
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:27,060
to grow different types of crops each

27
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:29,610
year or every few years crops like

28
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:35,610
cereals potatoes oil seed rape and peas

29
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:40,189
are not attacked by the same pests and

30
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:40,189
diseases so by rotating their crops

31
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:45,780
farmers avoid the build-up of pests and

32
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:49,890
disease in the soil and hedges around

33
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:52,939
the field which would then attack the

34
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,939
crops in the field

35
00:01:54,140 --> 00:02:01,010
a father they also try to reduce pests

36
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:03,880
by carrying out cultivations that will

37
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,880
reduce the pest

38
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,330
if these methods don't control the pests

39
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:24,170
or disease then farmers will have to use

40
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:31,340
chemical sprays the chemical sprays are

41
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:33,470
applied using crops prayers that are

42
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:39,410
controlled by a computer in the tractor

43
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:41,150
cab and linked to GPS and sat-nav this

44
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:43,250
means that the chemical can be applied

45
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:48,680
with precision just where the disease

46
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:50,840
pests are we DS this saves on the amount

47
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:56,000
of chemical needed but also means that

48
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:58,280
only infected areas are sprayed the use

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,590
of chemicals on food crops is also

50
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:05,150
subject to tight regulations farmers

51
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:11,720
have to pass a test before they are

52
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:13,100
allowed to do this job farm assurance

53
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:19,519
schemes such as the red tractor

54
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:21,829
assurance cream also set out lots of

55
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,570
safety and environmental rules farmers

56
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:26,590
will speak before they can sell their

57
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,590
cereals for food
