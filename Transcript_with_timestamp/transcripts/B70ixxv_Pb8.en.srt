series this one on one health the

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,000
critical crossroads of animal human and

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,320
environmental environment health how do

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,400
we really scale up one health my name's

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,400
michael victor i'm the head of

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,080
communications and knowledge management

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,960
at uh at dillary uh and just wanted to

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,559
mention that this is the second in the

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,399
series the first one

13
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:39,360
i was focused on uh

14
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,920
uh was focused on leveraging livestock

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,399
to combat malnutrition and i did put the

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,200
link to the webinar in the

17
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,440
chat so you can view it there so just as

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,120
we get started it'd be great to if

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,840
everyone could put their full name and

20
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,039
organization uh on their name so you

21
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,399
just

22
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,520
go to your name

23
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,280
click on more and you can then uh click

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,120
on rename so you should be able to

25
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,000
rename and put your full name and your

26
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,159
organization helps everyone identify who

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,200
is here you can also add your country if

28
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,240
you want

29
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,000
uh we will be enabling uh closed

30
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,400
captioning which seems to help a little

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,479
bit but there's always often mistakes so

32
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,640
but it does sometimes help

33
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,479
remember to keep your microphones off

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,720
when not speaking i think most of the

35
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,720
people we we have is a webinar so you

36
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,520
won't have to worry about that

37
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,000
uh

38
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,000
if you can't see or hear uh please close

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,600
and restart the zoom sometimes things

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,360
get stuck

41
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,759
again we we are going to be using the

42
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:41,040
chat a lot so it'd be great if everybody

43
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:43,759
could uh post questions or comments into

44
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,399
the chat we'll have a moderator who will

45
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,640
be able to feed questions uh to the

46
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,960
panel when we have that and if you have

47
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,799
questions to each of the speakers please

48
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,799
put them into the chat and they can

49
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,479
answer directly uh during the webinar uh

50
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,600
and just remember that the session is

51
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,560
recorded

52
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,280
uh and any private chats are often also

53
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:09,360

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,480
which helps a lot maybe susan can put

60
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,720

director of livestock and dairy

67
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,239
activities with venture 37 and we're

68
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,720
going to set the context for today's

69
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:45,120
discussion with this short film it

70
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,840
concerns land use policies

71
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,680
um and how at times they can be

72
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:54,560
unacquainted unintended consequences

73
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,800
often at the expense of the ecosystems

74
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,720
this video is on the privatization of

75
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:03,120
land and around the uh mara serengeti in

76
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,840
kenya in tanzania and demonstrates how

77
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,400
diseases can spread when

78
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,599
wildlife livestock and humans

79
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,560
cross over into each other's spaces

80
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:18,200
it's an integrated approach and we

81
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,200
take it away please

[Music]

86
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,600
in kenya is a classic example of what

87
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,320
happens when landscape policies are

88
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,160
developed without a one-held approach

89
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,800
this is because one health supports

90
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,720
integrated management of landscapes that

91
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,880
enhance sustainable coexistence of

92
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,000
agriculture and wildlife

93
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,560
many experts such as ecologists vets

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,479
public health professionals and others

95
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,919
need to be involved in government and

96
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,800
private sector decision making and

97
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,800
planning processes

the choices we make about ecosystems

105
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,599
have important consequences

106
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,440
sometimes unintended ones on human and

animal health

108
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,360
a one health approach helps reduce

109
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,960
further destruction and fragmentation of

110
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,360
wild habitats

111
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,360
incorporating biodiversity values while

112
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:39,400
at the same time considering the health

127
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,519
which we'll hear about more in our panel

128
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,959
discussion

129
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,440
her particular interests include

130
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,839
research on the epidemiology of diseases

131
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,399
in the interface of livestock wildlife

132
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,800
and human health

133
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:47,040
parasitology working with students well

134
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,480
in the north south and the south south

135
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,560
technology

136
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,839
and the knowledge transfer

137
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:56,480
and we welcome you here today christina

138
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,279
thank you thank you for the introduction

139
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,240
and

140
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,360
uh

141
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:04,800
sorry to everyone who expected delia

142
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,080
here today i am stepping in for her

143
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,519
today

144
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,279
and um

145
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,040
yes i want to talk about the role of

146
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,360
livestock research at the one health

147
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,080
interface today uh just to set the scene

148
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:19,120
for the following panelists

149
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:22,160
and um coming from hillary of course our

150
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,800
core business is livestock research and

151
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,720
we are working based on a number of

152
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,200
opportunities and challenges that have

153
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,839
been identified over the years and one

154
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,839
of the biggest challenges probably

155
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:37,920
how to feed the global population in the

156
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:41,279
future um because population growth is

157
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,600
one of the biggest issues pressuring um

158
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,839
our planet and

159
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,279
we see that there's big disparity

160
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,200
between

161
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:52,240
current meat or animal source food

162
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,959
consumption between high income and low

163
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,120
and middle income countries and a

164
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:59,839
majority of the population growth will

165
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,920
happen in the global south in the future

166
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:05,120
that's also where a lot of the potential

167
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:08,560
is for growth of the sector for

168
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:11,760
opportunities to reduce poverty um

169
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:14,800
increase equity and livelihoods however

170
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,320
all these things come with a lot of

171
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,480
challenges

172
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,399
and not only at a local level but also

173
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,040
regional and global level

174
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,440
that is of course the emergence of

175
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,920
zoonotic diseases we know that more than

176
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,720
two-thirds of the pathogens they

177
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,600
originate in in animals and at some

178
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,120
point in time um have a spillover event

179
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,480
to humans

180
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:41,440
also uh increased livestock production

181
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,600
comes with an increase of

182
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,160
ox antimicrobials

183
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,440
or the livestock healthy which comes

184
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,839
with a lot of pressure on the

185
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,399
environment and

186
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,720
microbes and increasing the risk for

187
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,600
antimicrobial resistance

188
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,000
more livestock also means more methane

189
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,480
contributing to greenhouse gas emissions

190
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,320
and of course global warming which needs

191
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,000
to be

192
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:10,480
limited and of course the more mammals

193
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,480
for food or for eating that food to live

194
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,440
on this planet

195
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:18,000
the more we have environmental pollution

196
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:21,440
land and water degradation which again

197
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,160
increases um the risk for spillover

198
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,519
so

199
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:29,600
some of the key one health elements um

200
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:32,880
that we focus on are to be prepared to

201
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:35,360
detect and to respond and all of them

202
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,560
just like in the one health venn diagram

203
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,519
where all these

204
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:42,399
three different circles uh overlap also

205
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:46,000
these three components preparedness

206
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:49,040
detection and response they also overlap

207
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,920
and they cannot see independently and

208
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,600
i'll give a few examples today and i

209
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,560
think the following speakers they will

210
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:59,920
then go more into the details and give

211
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,200
more examples from their work

212
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,200
so

213
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,800
to be prepared we need to know where to

214
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:09,120
put our money uh that's always a a big

215
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,440
question by investors

216
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,800
we want to solve all problems at the

217
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,240
same time we don't know where to target

218
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,200
investments

219
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:22,560
often we come too late and try and solve

220
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:25,519
problems when they're already there so

221
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,519
data is one of the biggest issues we

222
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:30,399
face in the global south

223
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,560
we don't have data to prioritize we

224
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,839
don't have data for surveillance and

225
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:38,399
monitoring and therefore we also lack

226
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:41,200
data to target our interventions and

227
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:44,079
limited resources so that is one of the

228
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,240
major contributions that um livestock

229
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,760
research can make

230
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,079
on top of that

231
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:53,760
we have to utilize what we have and that

232
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:55,279
is a lot of local capacity we don't have

233
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,959
to take

234
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,519
interventions that have worked in the

235
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,600
north and implement them in the south

236
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,720
and expect the same results

237
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:07,920
we have to utilize local knowledge

238
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,200
we have to localize you uh yeah local

239
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,480
resources

240
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:15,440
local capacity and try and build this

241
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,160
capacity improve this capacity instead

242
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,480
of trying to reinvent the wheel and i

243
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:24,320
think bernard will talk more about this

244
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:26,480
later and by being um prepared and

245
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,760
investing early enough in data

246
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:32,320
generation and building local capacity

247
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:35,440
we can actually save a lot of money as

248
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,720
these two examples show investment in

249
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,870
yellow

250
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,120
in the um

251
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:41,920
[Music]

252
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:45,279
in the right figure investment in

253
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:48,639
keeping poultry uh vaccinating poultry

254
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:51,440
uh against avian influenza can really

255
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,440
reduce the economic

256
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,880
burden on

257
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,880
on affected countries

258
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,920
the second component is detection

259
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,000
and that's where biomedical sciences

260
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,639
come in of course but also social

261
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,240
sciences and of course we need to

262
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,519
understand these different zoonotic

263
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,360
pathogens

264
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,839
we need to understand where they come

265
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,279
from where they live how they survive in

266
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,440
the environment

267
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,440
is it mosquitoes is it waters is it

268
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,120
wildlife reservoirs is it livestock

269
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,959
reservoirs we need to understand the

270
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,959
process from infection

271
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:30,240
uh of humans uh and animals uh to the

272
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:32,480
host immune response so we can also be

273
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,360
able to develop diagnostic tools and

274
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:38,160
vaccines and then we need to consolidate

275
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,320
all this information that we have and

276
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:43,360
develop strategies to target those and

277
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,959
one example is shown here on the right

278
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,800
that work is

279
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:51,839
mostly generated by bernard and tim

280
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:54,880
we look at data on rift valley fever we

281
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:57,680
do entomological studies we know animal

282
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,920
reservoirs for rift valley fever we know

283
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:03,040
precipitation patterns

284
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:05,199
we know uh altitudes we have all this

285
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:08,000
data it's out there and we're trying to

286
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,600
fill data gaps with our field surveys

287
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,399
but then this data needs to be

288
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,560
consolidated so that decision makers

289
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:17,120
know okay we have a vaccine for

290
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,279
livestock let's go to the high risk

291
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,199
areas and these are the ones in red and

292
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,720
we need this for many of the health

293
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,279
subjects

294
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,480
and this is a good transition to the

295
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,440
response

296
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,639
and

297
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:33,920
the response is not just about having a

298
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,920
vaccine ready it's also about getting to

299
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,639
the vaccine to those people who need it

300
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,399
and kovid is one of these examples in a

301
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,279
in a global effort

302
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,920
and

303
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:46,240
miracle we have a vaccine already

304
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,720
but in east africa and other parts of

305
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:51,759
africa and southeast asia many people

306
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,800
have not yet benefited from the vaccine

307
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:57,360
it's very difficult to get it to people

308
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,680
to have people accept the vaccine to

309
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:03,120
have access to it governments are

310
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,800
struggling with buying vaccines and

311
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,040
therefore yeah the vaccine is not

312
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,680
available and which leads again to a

313
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,240
global problem of not having hurt

314
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,880
immunity through vaccination

315
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,959
kovit is just one example this happens

316
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,600
with a number of the health

317
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,320
interventions we are researching

318
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,279
so

319
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,399
these

320
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:27,279
components acceptability accessibility

321
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:30,399
affordability availability and

322
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:33,519
incentives are quite crucial in getting

323
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:36,399
interventions or research into use and

324
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:38,560
that is also just as the way we're

325
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,160
trying to generate data getting

326
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,680
interventions out

327
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:46,320
requires participation by uh the end

328
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:49,600
users communities and i guess we'll hear

329
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:52,240
a bit more about this about rangeland

330
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,800
land management in a bit

331
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,480
and finally i wanted to uh

332
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,759
highlight again two of the recent

333
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:02,959
publications that

334
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:05,120
give very constructive advice to

335
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,120
investors on

336
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,280
where to invest

337
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,839
what research gaps do we still have

338
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:14,160
where are the data needs and how we can

339
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:18,319
intervene in preventing not only the

340
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,679
next pandemic but also preventing other

341
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,039
uh

342
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:24,799
health

343
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:27,520
problems at the human animal environment

344
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:30,400
interface these are also the neglected

345
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,960
zoonotic diseases such as tapeworms

346
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,799
brucellosis

347
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,720
sleeping sickness

348
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,880
diseases that usually affect low and

349
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,880
middle income countries

350
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,520
we also have a silent pandemic

351
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:46,799
antimicrobial resistance so we're not

352
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,080
just talking about the big scares um we

353
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:51,200
give um

354
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:53,679
yeah an investment advice for challenged

355
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,160
these major anthropogenic drivers of

356
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,039
synonyms

357
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,360
so

358
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:02,480
this is my little

359
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,559
presentation to set the scene and now to

360
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,280
i can take questions if that is in the

361
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,320
agenda mark and otherwise i'll hand back

362
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,160
to you

363
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:15,039
all right thank you ma'am

364
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:17,600
we're gonna switch quickly to um uh

365
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:19,600
let's see bernard and i'm gonna skip

366
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,760
through this quickly so that bernard

367
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,080
gains a little time back and if you are

368
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:27,520
ready to go bernard you can start

369
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:29,600
talking to us about the policy

370
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:32,000
process and the scaling out at your

371
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,760
level thank you thanks mark my name is

372
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,880
bernard beth i work with hillary as a

373
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:39,440
senior scientist currently heading

374
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,840
the one health center which christina

375
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,480
[Music]

376
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:46,720
mentioned so um i'm presenting this for

377
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,679
focusing on how we are planning to scale

378
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:52,160
up scale out one health

379
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,559
practices and policies in sub-saharan

380
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,559
africa and i'm working with a big team

381
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,760
of people including leon christina

382
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,760
ashley

383
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,520
delia and hung

384
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,320
this is a project which is funded

385
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:08,600
currently by bmz

386
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,600
so let's go to the next slide

387
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:19,760
yes so this is first of all to to

388
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,120
clarify or to set up the terminologies

389
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,960
that we are using

390
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,760
when we talk about scaling we really

391
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,000
mean an ambitious process to expand the

392
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,799
coverage of one health

393
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
either through institute

394
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:33,760
institutionalization that's making sure

395
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,320
that policy makers

396
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:39,200
right at the national subnational levels

397
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:41,919
are able to apply one health

398
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,400
principles but also there's a component

399
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,799
on horizontal expansion this is

400
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,280
involving many other players

401
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,720
within the same levels of

402
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,360
application

403
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,039
but in the process of scaling up we are

404
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,720
not just thinking of

405
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,160
spreading out we only thinking of

406
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,520
refining

407
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,960
these institutions these practices

408
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,559
realizing that you know we are not

409
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,039
really here

410
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,640
to start off from the beginning but many

411
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,320
other players have

412
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,840
originally set up

413
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,640
platforms

414
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,640
and and and processes much earlier so

415
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,080
we're just helping to improve on the

416
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,720
quality

417
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,960
the main uh issue though is to really

418
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,400
identify what's that scalable units

419
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,880
because we know one health is quite

420
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,280
proud we really need to identify what's

421
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:32,320
the key component of one health that can

422
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:35,280
be scaled so let's go to the next slide

423
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:37,120
and i give examples of vertical scaling

424
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,760
and this again that's what i meant

425
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,600
institutionalization

426
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,440
and currently we are looking at the

427
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,960
platforms which were developed by

428
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,520
countries

429
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,919
regional economic blocks the tripartite

430
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,919
and many other players in the region and

431
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,320
trying to ask ourselves

432
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,960
what are the competencies how are these

433
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,280
platforms working so we are using an

434
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,440
evaluation tool that's called network

435
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,880
for evaluation of one health which is

436
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,039
classical

437
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,159
published and it's being used in many

438
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,799
places

439
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:11,919
to identify those gaps in planning

440
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:14,559
thinking working sharing

441
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,960
one health activities

442
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:20,880
and the main aim here is to identify

443
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:22,960
what which areas can we specifically

444
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,760
implement interventions to make these

445
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,120
platforms work much more

446
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,960
effectively

447
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,559
the second issue though would be

448
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,400
research for development and this is

449
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:35,120
where we're thinking of

450
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,200
we want to demonstrate how new evidence

451
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:41,120
can be used to inform

452
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:43,200
decision making but also to inform

453
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,880
networking partnerships

454
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,440
so that it can really come out so

455
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,000
clearly on which areas would those

456
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,280
partnerships work better for disease

457
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,919
control

458
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:56,000
so on the next slide i give a small

459
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,600
example on

460
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,280
horizontal

461
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,600
scaling

462
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,240
what we do here is basically about

463
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,400
building graduate fellowship programs so

464
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,919
that we can get more leaders more

465
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,240
students

466
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,400
more technical expertise

467
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,960
being used in the region

468
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,440
and it involves training students within

469
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:20,400
here at hillary but also helping local

470
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,880
universities in developing new curricula

471
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,799
uh on one health

472
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:28,240
through our research partnerships also

473
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:30,400
with governments ngos private sectors

474
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,559
we hope that in the process of us

475
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,720
implementing research with them

476
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,640
those

477
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:40,159
one health competencies come out

478
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,919
strongly and they get recognized as ways

479
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,840
of doing business

480
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:46,640
but lastly also is we are really

481
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,960
launching community outreach activities

482
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,200
which aim to build um

483
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,280
capacities at the local levels but also

484
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,200
there's a frontline staff here including

485
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:58,080
you know community based animal health

486
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,480
workers or community health volunteers

487
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,919
who work in the public public health

488
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,960
sector so all those people are brought

489
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,799
on board

490
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:09,280
to work together in the local levels

491
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:10,080
i think i have the second last slide

492
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,159
which

493
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,799
talks about the opportunities that we

494
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,320
have to build all these um activities

495
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:19,039
and one of them is um

496
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:21,200
they say huge interests locally on

497
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:23,280
building one health platforms and i

498
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,320
think that interest would really help us

499
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,679
to to move on from there there's also

500
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,679
one health platforms which have been

501
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:32,799
developed as i said earlier on and

502
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:35,120
there's a huge um skilled manpower in

503
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,799
mainstream government departments which

504
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,679
can be brought on board

505
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:40,880
in building all these initiatives but of

506
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,039
course as you know there are many

507
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:46,159
challenges and main the main one of

508
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:47,840
course is being funding levels are low

509
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,159
the other thing is

510
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,480
conceptualization of one health you know

511
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,559
one health is quite broad and many

512
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,480
people may not really define what we

513
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,799
mean by a scalable unit

514
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,960
that needs to be determined for us to

515
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:04,240
know where we begin from and where we

516
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,080
reach in terms of taking it forward uh

517
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,640
the the one thing that i also find it

518
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,720
very useful is to identify

519
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,480
reliable tools for assessment you know

520
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,600
we keep doing

521
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,919
there are many tools which are being

522
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,080
used currently for assessing scaling in

523
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,080
many interventions in veterinary even

524
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,080
public health but those ones have not

525
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,919
really been fine-tuned to capture one

526
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,480
health and those are the limitations

527
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:29,039
that we still face up to now

528
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,919
lastly of course one health as we know

529
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,200
it

530
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,720
is very much on prevention of diseases

531
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,640
of course it can be used for management

532
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,559
of diseases but most of the time we want

533
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,960
to use them for prevention

534
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,720
but we know communities and many people

535
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,640
in the on the ground

536
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,440
are really very much tailored towards

537
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,919
using curative services and not prevent

538
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,080
preventive services and that's this this

539
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,000
need for a mind mind

540
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,240
changing mindset in terms of how those

541
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,240
services are used

542
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,120
so i think i have only the two slides

543
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,360
one is on acknowledging partners and we

544
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,120
have many partners in this region

545
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:08,080
but the last one which i want to

546
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:11,120
emphasize is

547
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:13,840
we have had huge support from

548
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,480
a cgir research program called fonh

549
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,080
which was led by ifpri for the last 10

550
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,799
years they have been helping us to do

551
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,679
one health and it's coming to an end

552
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:25,360
in december this year so very much

553
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,039
like to acknowledge the support that we

554
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,039
have gotten from them

555
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,320
so thanks mark that's the end of my

556
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,799
presentation

557
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,720
okay thank you bernard uh we're gonna

558
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:38,400
quickly switch over to

559
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,720
uh a usda-funded project and hear from

560
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,760
uh lasha and the situation they're

561
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,279
facing in georgia please lasha

562
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,480
thank you mark

563
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,240
greetings

564
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,799
let me present safety and quality

565
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,480
investment livestock or simply skill

566
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,840
activities under the one health

567
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,080
principles

568
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,640
skillfully project is financed by the

569
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:01,440
usda is and implemented by the orlando

570
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,120
lakes venture 37 in georgia with our

571
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,720
local partner georgian farmers

572
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,960
association

573
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,600
following farm to four principles

574
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,760
project times to to

575
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,159
food safety and quality improvement

576
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,559
increase productivity and trade within

577
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:20,000
the georgian dairy and beef market

578
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:22,400
systems value chain next slide please

579
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,799
as i mentioned scale major task is to

580
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,200
support market systems development so i

581
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:28,960
would like to focus on how the skill

582
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,360
operates in the

583
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,159
strengthening one health approach in a

584
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,840
market systems development context

585
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,240
system includes

586
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:41,440
value interests starting from the input

587
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:43,840
suppliers farmers processors

588
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,120
distributors all the way to the finance

589
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,600
consumers

590
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:50,000
but also on top of it the market systems

591
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,640
donated we say we have a

592
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,720
role to develop supporting functions

593
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,840
such as strengthening education centers

594
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:00,240
sectoral trainers service providers etc

595
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,960
and let me give example here recently

596
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,880
skill trained call center operators of

597
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,880
the ministry of environmental protection

598
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,760
and agriculture of georgia

599
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:12,080
in animal health and food safety matters

600
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,760
and was first for them ever such

601
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,159
technical training

602
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:18,159
on the other hand we try to strengthen

603
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,480
local rules and regulations through

604
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,960
capacity building of the related state

605
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,919
authorities developing market led safety

606
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,320
quality

607
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:27,520
systems and mediating public private

608
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,600
partnership

609
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:32,399
as an additional example we conducted

610
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,760
the workshop regarding newly adopted

611
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:35,679
regulation and

612
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:39,360
animal byproducts

613
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:42,960
their use and disposal next slide please

614
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,679
so what are their tools in a toolbox

615
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,600
as

616
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,559
knowledge and awareness of the local

617
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:51,120
sector actors was identified as one of

618
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,960
the biggest challenges we uh conducted

619
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,840
set of the trainings in different wild

620
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,919
house related topics and let me give you

621
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,240
some examples from this list

622
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:02,399
food safety and hygiene principles that

623
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,760
included hazop system for deity and

624
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:06,240
preprocessors

625
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,159
we also trained all state and private

626
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,520
slaughterhouse veterinarians in meet

627
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,039
inspection

628
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,640
and as you see on the right in the

629
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,720
pictures the environment of the

630
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,039
trainings varies from the actual

631
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,679
practice in the processing plant

632
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:23,840
or more in kind of community based

633
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,840
interactions next slide please

634
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,440
also we

635
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,679
tried to to

636
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:33,200
cover gaps of

637
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:35,600
developing education materials

638
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,159
such as for our case manuals and

639
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,679
booklets and guidebooks

640
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,320
for that

641
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:45,440
activity we had a small motivator like

642
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:47,200
120 nanometers small motivator it's

643
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,600
basically all kind of people large

644
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:52,159
gatherings is still restricted for more

645
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,080
than a year now so we have to adapt

646
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,919
materials will print in the distributed

647
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,840
through our partners as well as

648
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,840
electronic versions are uploaded in the

649
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,880
local farmer's platform

650
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,880
one our

651
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,720
partners let's say

652
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,360
was the national food agency and they

653
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,679
disseminated these manuals to cattle

654
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,600
farmers through their state animal

655
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,360
vaccination campaigns

656
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,279
and here on the right you can see

657
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,039
example of one of our education

658
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:20,399
materials regarding veterinary medicine

659
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:23,200
products which explains the the health

660
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:25,440
one health and general health principles

661
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,440
as well as veterinary medicines residues

662
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,559
flow from animals to humans to

663
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,320
environment

664
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,159
this manual also contains the

665
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,640
information regarding antimicrobial

666
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,880
resistance but one more like a simple

667
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:39,600
farmer's understandable language

668
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,760
next slide please and here i have a list

669
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,159
of the other materials

670
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,080
as you can see in the content of them

671
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,679
and i would highlight

672
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,399
practical manuals for the slaughterhouse

673
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:53,520
veterinarians how to protect farm from

674
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:56,559
the chronic disease as well as manual a

675
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:58,000
vector board disease prevention is also

676
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:01,520
ending

677
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,520
next place slide please

678
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,679
in order to promote those education

679
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,080
materials skill developed animated

680
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:10,720
videos that you can see this videos are

681
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,720
simple way reflecting the key messages

682
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,399
of the education materials

683
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,159
these videos were designated through the

684
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:18,000
social media and popular original

685
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,840
televisions

686
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,760
and i believe that strength of this

687
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,760
concept was to provide the awareness

688
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,679
regarding the main highlights of that

689
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,760
very subject

690
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,919
but also at the same time aware target

691
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,880
groups regarding existence of these very

692
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:35,360
materials to be either downloaded from

693
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,480
the web platform or gained through their

694
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,760
skill

695
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,760
partners

696
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,760
so with this approach we are able to

697
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,360
educate target beneficiaries through the

698
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,600
combined method of the

699
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,480
videos plus manuals

700
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,640
that

701
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,480
do not actually require the gathering of

702
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,840
other people and it's also a

703
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,080
cost-effective

704
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,240
as a challenge that we identified in a

705
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,880
process access of the electronic

706
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,799
platform by the farmers is quite limited

707
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,039
but on the other hand on the opportunity

708
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:05,120
side we think and we're planning to

709
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:07,360
translate those education materials into

710
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:10,559
english which are currently georgian to

711
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:13,279
share amongst other venture 37 projects

712
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,799
next slide please

713
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:18,399
and basically that's

714
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:20,720
the final slide so we try to adopt to

715
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:22,159
the to the existing uh pandemic

716
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,720
situation by

717
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,559
uh providing and disseminating knowledge

718
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,799
regarding one health principles and

719
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:31,120
related actions in livestock sector

720
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:32,720
market systems and that's the way it is

721
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,480
thank you very much

722
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,039
okay thank you elisha

and the last of our speed talks here it

724
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,960
will come from madessa and the hillary

725
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,120
hill program

726
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:46,120
if you could uh please start that

727
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,120
discussion

728
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:50,399
uh my name is badass i work for

729
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:52,720
international lifestyle research

730
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:54,960
institute i'm regular scientist the

731
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,399
topic i'm going to talk on is linking

732
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,880
green line management to one health in

733
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,880
utopia

734
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:04,960
rangeland is important for one health

735
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:08,080
because this rangeland is a vast

736
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:10,799
land area that cover the world service

737
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:13,039
and also it is support millions of

738
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:15,360
people's pastoralists who are depending

739
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:17,519
on the rangeland rating of livestock

740
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,799
production and also it is good for

741
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:22,960
ecosystem service functioning when

742
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:25,039
so that one health

743
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,519
brings these three components by

744
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:30,240
including rangeland health to improve

745
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:33,600
the livelihood and ecosystem service for

746
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,600
the company who are living there

747
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:37,039
[Music]

748
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:40,240
one of the project which is integrating

749
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:43,039
the environmental aspect is heat

750
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:46,960
this project is uh actually the constant

751
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:49,679
rule led by vcfsu's along with ccm and

752
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:53,039
italy as with the objective of to

753
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:56,600

that the project is conducted in three

757
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:06,240
and three countries topia kenya somalia

758
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,640
with an approach of

759
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,840
bringing three these three components

760
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:14,320
animal human environmentalists to have a

761
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,640
good delivery service of one health

762
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:20,799
service at the ground level for the

763
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:23,440
pastoralist and this project also

764
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:26,880
engaged different community levels

765
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:30,080
including women men to have

766
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:32,159
to accommodate their need that

767
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:34,640
that to have a one health service

768
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:37,279
delivery and also to have a cost

769
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:39,279
effective approach for this this one

770
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:41,840
service delivery and doesn't it at the

771
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:45,440
end of the day this should be a model or

772
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:47,120
a solution of still silver and silver

773
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,720
service delivery

774
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:51,200
that should be recognized by different

775
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:54,399
tokens like a policy maker for the

776
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,399
pastoralist as a whole

777
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:00,480
most of the initiative of one health is

778
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:03,039
lacking this environmental health so

779
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,519
he'll make unique because of including

780
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:07,440
this one health

781
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:09,599
environmental health through an approach

782
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,520
of past battery range land management

783
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,280
this perspective land management have

784
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,280
three stage

785
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,480
and a different

786
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,520
state of

787
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,879
different steps so this actually a

788
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,119
process

789
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,119
that

790
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:29,440
maintains the community management plan

791
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:30,560
and improving uh the institution of this

792
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,000
community

793
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,359
rangeland management regulated

794
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,800
management

795
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,599
from this

796
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,240
uh

797
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:40,240
from rangeland there is a livestock

798
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:42,639
disease distribution and also there are

799
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:45,280
different regular conditions

800
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:48,240
so the disease and the regular condition

801
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:52,000
are highly integrated or correlated they

802
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:54,399
are functioning together so this prm is

803
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,119
bringing into the process of animal

804
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:59,920
disease to be integrated well from for

805
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:01,680
example if we take from our

806
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,200
one side or download land which is found

807
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:06,240
in moya red street

808
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:09,520
how one health and the grazings are

809
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:11,599
really linked together show us movement

810
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:14,640
through concentration of livestock and

811
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:17,359
high degradation of rangeland shows us

812
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:20,000
our wine health and grazing are

813
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:20,000
integrated

814
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:27,200
from this

815
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:30,000
institutional role

816
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:32,800
to bring to bring together a different

817
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,320
institution which are

818
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:40,160
to act for one health center

819
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:43,599
to learn from each other he developed

820
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,640
msip for stakeholders to discuss

821
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:47,200
learning

822
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,200
because of

823
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:52,640
environmental health is a broader so

824
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:55,920
that to understand what rangeland health

825
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:59,280
mean so msrb is a muslim style

826
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:01,040
stakeholder innovation platform where

827
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,680
many stakeholders are really from each

828
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,359
other or to avoid the challenges of not

829
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:08,000
understanding the

830
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:11,280
whole environment from this rangeland

831
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,040
heritage so the service delivery is to

832
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,160
improve the rangeland which are highly

833
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:19,359
degraded or to minimize to

834
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:22,400
maintain the rangeland size as it is so

835
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:25,520
to have an educated posture

836
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,200
as a sum up randyland health is a key

837
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,520
improving

838
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,680
the whole system of the ecosystem and

839
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:34,400
the productivity of

840
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:37,119
the whole area that improve the

841
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:40,720
livelihood and the

842
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:42,400
community as well so that bringing of

843
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,960
animal human

844
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:48,160
rangeland health is a good

845
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:50,400
to link to regular management to have a

846
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:53,359
wider impact of

847
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,400
the livelihood of communities so thank

848
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:57,920
you

849
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,920
if you have questions welcome

850
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,520
thank you

851
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,720
vadessa

852
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,560
um

853
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,560
we've now heard from

854
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,880
three different programs

855
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,240
and how they are scaling one health in

856
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,079
policy

857
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:15,280
uh training

858
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:18,000
public and private sector activities

859
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,760
and environmental pathways

860
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,240
and we're going to change over to some

861
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,720
questions now and i'd like to lead off

862
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:27,280
by asking bernard

863
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,960
how they've been able to reconcile the

864
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,200
differing interests between their

865
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,040
stakeholder holders

866
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,040
we naturally find that there's a little

867
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,800
bit of difference between what donors

868
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:39,839
want what local governments want and

869
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:44,400
what livestock owners want and i'd like

870
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:44,400
to hear your views on this process

871
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,839
thanks

872
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:51,599
mark for that question so

873
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:53,280
um yes you are right i mean most of the

874
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,640
donors or most of the development

875
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,480
agencies

876
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,359
usually fund

877
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,920
those

878
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:02,480
challenges or those those issues which

879
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:05,119
address epidemics pandemics with

880
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,160
international concern usually they look

881
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:08,960
at

882
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,320
risks which transcend countries and and

883
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,599
and regions

884
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:15,359
but we we find that

885
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,359
the stakeholders of the the people we

886
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:19,359
deal with at the community level

887
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:21,200
are very much interested in managing

888
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:22,800
day-to-day challenges in terms of

889
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:26,160
endemic diseases

890
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:29,839
or things which we call production

891
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:30,960
which may not really attract external

892
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:36,240
interest

893
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,240
so but i think there is a win-win um

894
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,599
there's a room for win-win situation

895
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,400
there because

896
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:44,000
the support we get from external

897
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,119
development partners which address

898
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,560
pandemics and epidemics can still help

899
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:51,599
in building

900
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,800
universal surveillance systems or build

901
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:55,599
capacity

902
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,359
which might be used to manage multiple

903
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:00,480
challenges at the same time

904
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:03,440
so in that way i think

905
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,320
you can still find a common ground

906
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,480
where

907
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,680
that external support

908
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,760
can still

909
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:12,960
be used to build capacity events to

910
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,960
manage local problems

911
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:17,839
thank you sir um last time i'm going to

912
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:20,079
turn to you next to kind of follow the

913
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:22,560
order of the speakers there

914
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:25,119
and what curious how you're building

915
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:28,079
capacity at the farm level to prevent

916
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:30,640
the spread of zoodonic disease what what

917
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:33,119
are producers the livestock owners

918
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:37,599
knowledge and awareness of one health

919
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:37,599
challenges how are they facing this

920
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,480
well mark

921
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:45,119
as i mentioned during my presentation uh

922
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,720
one of the skill developed education

923
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:49,599
material was

924
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:50,560
manual for main chronic diseases of

925
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,880
cattle

926
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:55,040
and for georgia that would be resilience

927
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:57,359
tuberculosis and glucoses

928
00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:00,000
so we developed a manual that contains

929
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:02,320
the practical examples of the clinical

930
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,720
science disease prevention also

931
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:07,760
diagnostic practices

932
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:10,079
manual also explains kind of existing

933
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,160
regulations and also explains that this

934
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,760
is very important the primary actions to

935
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,520
be taken in case of the disease

936
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,000
suspicious before even the

937
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:20,480
veterinarian's engagement

938
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,560
also we put like sticky posters of the

939
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:25,359
disease clinical science

940
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:29,520
and also k messages that uh are attached

941
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:31,280
to the manual and these um owners of the

942
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,359
farms that that have been

943
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,440
delivered could stick them on the walls

944
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:37,520
or the employees hang around

945
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,440
so they will have always the major

946
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:42,160
information in front of them the

947
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:44,160
abortion and other clinical science and

948
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,480
also highlight and also clinical science

949
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:49,280
in humans as well so they would you know

950
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:51,440
understand that they might be exposed

951
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:54,720
so in my opinion that's the practical

952
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:57,520
example how to aware kind of farmers on

953
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:00,160
one health issues and try to get them on

954
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,160
our las

955
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,800
thank you

956
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:07,359
and bethesda

957
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:10,960
we're looking at the environmental part

958
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:12,480
of our tripartite and and we diagram one

959
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,560
health

960
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,400
why is it is it challenging to

961
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:19,599
incorporate one health into the

962
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:22,640
environmental issues

963
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:24,400
thank you mark uh

964
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:26,720
yes it is uh

965
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:29,119
if you see many of the

966
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:31,520
finance initiatives the environmental

967
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:33,440
health is lacking

968
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:36,720
uh it is neglected

969
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:40,560
many initiative this may may be because

970
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:41,760
of this environmental research

971
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,720
list

972
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,720
funding to have

973
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:49,839
to integrate this and also it is not

974
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:52,800
taken as like

975
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:55,359
seriously as uh other discipline like

976
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,400
medical and also even through the

977
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:58,640
issue

978
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,640
and

979
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:05,520
there also this environmental ha also

980
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:09,040
have different theories uh which is not

981
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:11,960
contextual to different uh areas like if

982
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:13,520
you take a series of indigenous

983
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:15,359
pastoralists

984
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,400
which is sometimes

985
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:18,640
they are

986
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,680
conflict each other

987
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:23,359
in some areas so that this is the main

988
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,680
point why

989
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:28,160
environment is not as

990
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,160
others

991
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:32,800
okay thank you for that interesting bit

992
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:34,960
of information

993
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,280
you know we we've labeled this as a hard

994
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,839
talk session and so the hardest question

995
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:43,040
i'm gonna pose back to uh christina

996
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:46,319
where she she led us off today

997
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:48,960
and as a thought leader in this field

998
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:53,200
where does the focus on one health and

999
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:54,160
livestock provide the greatest impact um

1000
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,319
well

1001
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,720
there's not a silver bullet answer to

1002
00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:01,119
that because the context of any health

1003
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,800
problem is different in each country

1004
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:04,560
right so i

1005
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:08,000
i think uh

1006
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:10,720
the focus should be on um

1007
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:14,720
yeah the local context actually in which

1008
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:17,839
the the animal diseases um yeah navigate

1009
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:19,359
and the pathogens navigate and that

1010
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:21,119
the reason why i'm saying this in

1011
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:23,680
southeast asia for example where you

1012
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:24,960
have a much higher pig population

1013
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:27,359
you know

1014
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:30,880
pigs as a livestock species would be of

1015
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:33,599
much of more importance than um cattle

1016
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,560
and small ruminants in east africa for

1017
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:36,720
example

1018
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:39,119
and maybe i would like to pass this on

1019
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:41,040
to to my colleague bernard

1020
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:43,760
who is more of a

1021
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:45,839
a local leader in one health

1022
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,640
than i am thanks

1023
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:48,400
uh

1024
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:50,800
sure bernard if you would like to follow

1025
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,480
up please

1026
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,800
no i think christina managed to dwell by

1027
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:57,520
saying you know it change it it varies

1028
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:59,280
from one place to another maybe what one

1029
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:01,440
thing that jumped into mind because i

1030
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,200
can see in your question is uh there's a

1031
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,839
labeling of livestock

1032
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:08,000
and since we are thinking of one health

1033
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:08,960
you know livestock usually is considered

1034
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,599
to be

1035
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,800
and resourced in many places

1036
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:15,040
and so

1037
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:18,319
i guess bringing in one health

1038
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:20,960
in that perspective might actually help

1039
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:23,839
to enhance service delivery not just

1040
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,839
looking at

1041
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:28,560
disease per se but also managing

1042
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:31,839
multiple

1043
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:34,000
facets of livestock service delivery

1044
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:37,440
in this region for example you know

1045
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:40,000
many many remote locations

1046
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:42,960
there's a big challenge on that and so i

1047
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,680
see one health can really help us to

1048
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,680
reach into the

1049
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:53,359
those people who are considered to be

1050
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:53,359
left behind by previous interventions

1051
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,839
okay thank you

1052
00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:00,480
we we have

1053
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:03,359
a couple of extra minutes is uh there

1054
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:05,520
are specific questions from the chat box

1055
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:07,839
that anyone would like to draw my

1056
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:10,000
attention to

1057
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:12,720
um

1058
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,280
otherwise i'm gonna jump to one of our

1059
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:17,680
other questions here what i'd like to

1060
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:20,880
ask is each of you just quickly to give

1061
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:22,240
me um a quick answer to say

1062
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,280
if

1063
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,200
which

1064
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:27,839
part of one health

1065
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:29,920
changes or the program implementation

1066
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:32,319
that you've dealt with has been the most

1067
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:34,960
difficult has it been with the local

1068
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:36,400
governments the private sector

1069
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,240
the veterinarians of the community

1070
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:41,040
animal health workers or the farmers

1071
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:43,700
themselves and bernard if i could start

1072
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:44,880
with you which which of those

1073
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:48,319
[Music]

1074
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:52,160
partners in all of this has been the the

1075
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:52,160
the slowest to make change

1076
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,880
that's a difficult question i would say

1077
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:58,800
government because um you know if you

1078
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:02,560
look at the other actors which you have

1079
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:04,240
in the list if an intervention is really

1080
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,560
beneficial to them

1081
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:08,800
they will adjust immediately you know

1082
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:10,319
private sector farmers but for

1083
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:13,200
government you know you really need to

1084
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:14,400
put in place policies rules

1085
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,880
before

1086
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,880
everybody else come to the same table so

1087
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:22,319
i think for me it will be government

1088
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:25,520
okay and lasha how would you uh talk

1089
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:28,240
about this that question

1090
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:30,960
that's tough mark but probably for us

1091
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:33,440
it's the engagement of the farmers

1092
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:36,000
um because to let them understand that

1093
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,680
something which is not always linked to

1094
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,480
their income

1095
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:42,319
and sometimes opposite that matters for

1096
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,079
instance an antimicrobial resistance or

1097
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:46,720
proper use of the veterinary medicine

1098
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:50,079
products proposed waste of uh

1099
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:52,480
by-products etc that could i mean this

1100
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:55,200
process is a slow process and it's more

1101
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:57,119
and more engagement for all the partners

1102
00:46:55,200 --> 00:47:00,079
okay and

1103
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:01,520
the same question to you uh vadessa what

1104
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:03,119
uh

1105
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:05,920
part of the partnership has been

1106
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:05,920
difficult for you

1107
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,040
he's heard actually

1108
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:15,280
it is from uh

1109
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:18,079
perspective of like because i've seen

1110
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:19,280
this environmentalist because

1111
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:22,079
this

1112
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:24,480
an understanding of uh

1113
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:26,480
health aspect is somewhat is different

1114
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,839
from rangeland because it is a

1115
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:30,960
government and

1116
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:33,119
if you are like we see from a

1117
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,440
pastoralist point of view different

1118
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:38,960
organizations are there so

1119
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:40,720
and some of them also say government

1120
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,960
okay thank you

1121
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:45,440
and we have one question that's come in

1122
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:47,040
uh from

1123
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,240
abdel fatha

1124
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,240
and

1125
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:52,240
what are your thoughts on selecting for

1126
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:54,960
poultry or livestock that are

1127
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,960
genetically

1128
00:47:56,319 --> 00:48:02,640
predisposed or

1129
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:04,400
resistant to any of the avian influenzas

1130
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:07,280
or other diseases

1131
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:10,319
and what's work is being done on the

1132
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:13,520
crossbreds uh for that process

1133
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:15,440
i'm not quite sure who who is

1134
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:19,319
best to answer that question if you'd

1135
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,319
like to speak up

1136
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:27,440
do we do we have someone who's been

1137
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:29,440
handling uh the selection of poultry and

1138
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,839
livestock for genetic and avian

1139
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:34,319
influenza

1140
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:36,880
um we already had a discussion on that

1141
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:37,760
in the chat this is christina

1142
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,079
and

1143
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:43,680
i mean uh i'm not speaking for hillary

1144
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:46,240
we are not uh working on on um selecting

1145
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:50,240
breeds uh resistant to avian influenza

1146
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:53,040
we do that kind of work um

1147
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:55,280
feeding and cross-breeding um disease

1148
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:59,200
resistant animals even genetic

1149
00:48:55,280 --> 00:49:02,640
engineering um yeah to generate um

1150
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:03,760
disease resistant animals but

1151
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:06,319
yeah

1152
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:08,240
it can work in the lab you still need to

1153
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:11,280
get it to the community so one of the

1154
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:13,200
examples i i brought up was the

1155
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,599
gamma kettle from west africa which is

1156
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:18,240
very small but resistant to trypanosoma

1157
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:19,440
infections and the masai herders in east

1158
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,680
africa

1159
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:25,040
really didn't like it because it was too

1160
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:27,440
small not considered a real cow so even

1161
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:29,920
though that that cattle breed was

1162
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,960
resistance to disease they opted for the

1163
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:33,920
disease

1164
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:36,480
so uh and and we have other examples

1165
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:38,960
where we are trying to crossbreed um

1166
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:42,319
cheap that are resistant to uh worm

1167
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:45,520
infections uh and it's definitely a good

1168
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:47,680
bio a medical or genetical approach to

1169
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:50,720
disease control and but it's others

1170
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:53,599
working on avian influenza

1171
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:55,040
reading thanks i hope that helps a bit

1172
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:57,599
yeah thank you

1173
00:49:55,040 --> 00:50:00,880
uh it looks like a good question has

1174
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:02,720
come up for um

1175
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:05,119
looks like bernard or

1176
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:07,520
vadessa and the question is zoonotic

1177
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:09,599
infections form the bulk of re-emerging

1178
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:11,359
or emerging disease burden that could

1179
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:12,960
benefit the attention of one health and

1180
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:15,520
management

1181
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:19,760
what is being done to actually manage

1182
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:23,680
the introductions from wildlife

1183
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:26,160
so i think uh that might be closer to uh

1184
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:27,520
bedessa

1185
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:30,880
yeah

1186
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:32,880
i'm in my perspective view

1187
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,720
because that's why

1188
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:37,119
we put a participatory rangeland

1189
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:39,280
management bring to this

1190
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:40,400
one health approach today this rain land

1191
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,559
management

1192
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,160
if we have an integrated integrator

1193
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:46,319
management plan

1194
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:49,440
these all things should be at minimized

1195
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:51,359
to absorb this as the issue of health

1196
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:54,800
else for management actually the

1197
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:57,280
wildfire so now we are like if we take

1198
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:59,680
the pastoral area there is a wildlife

1199
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,520
there is a climate climate change

1200
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:04,160
there is a land health

1201
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:06,160
uh so this is under the umbrella of

1202
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:09,040
environment so we are doing

1203
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:10,800
this project by compiling together

1204
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,920
having a

1205
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,400
strong

1206
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:17,680
integrated management plan to be

1207
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,680
integrated into one health

1208
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:22,960
um and i've noticed that

1209
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:25,520
last year would like to speak on that as

1210
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:27,839
well as we think through

1211
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:31,280
uh the question on this crossover from

1212
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:34,319
uh from wildlife elijah please thank you

1213
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:36,960
mark so actually one of the uh materials

1214
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:39,599
that we also developed is regarding

1215
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:42,160
how to build the cattle farm and that

1216
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:45,200
also includes how to select the place a

1217
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:47,040
lot of about biosecurity measures

1218
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:50,880
and all the threats that come to the

1219
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:53,680
farm from the wildlife from the imported

1220
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:55,440
animals and other sources but and that's

1221
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:57,680
i believe is part of the answer as well

1222
00:51:55,440 --> 00:52:01,680
how to separate or how to protect the

1223
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:01,680
livestock and therefore humans later

1224
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,119
okay we're going to squeeze in one last

1225
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:08,000
question and um

1226
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:10,880
um

1227
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,880
anyone can pop in on this answer okay

1228
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:15,599
what is the one thing that we could do

1229
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:18,400
today that would improve or motivate

1230
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:19,520
buy-in from one health around the world

1231
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,280
is it

1232
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:23,839
you know the livestock the livestock

1233
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:26,160
owners the funding the people were

1234
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:28,480
involved or is it the markets that we

1235
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:30,400
need to put pressure on how how would

1236
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:32,720
you guys um

1237
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:35,440
discuss this topic

1238
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:37,599
who would like to go first how about

1239
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:40,319
um bernard you've been quick on the

1240
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:40,319
answers today

1241
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:48,800
oh well yeah that's that's really a big

1242
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:48,800
question so

1243
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:54,720
i would

1244
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:58,559
i would say i think if we get a stronger

1245
00:52:54,720 --> 00:53:00,880
consumer demand on on on

1246
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:03,200
healthy and

1247
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,640
you know healthy landscapes and healthy

1248
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:07,200
food

1249
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:10,160
i think they can drive much more than

1250
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:13,119
just you know a supply side of things

1251
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:16,960
so i think the demand can really shape

1252
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:18,400
how more healthy value chains can be

1253
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:21,119
developed

1254
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,880
and i'm hoping that would really

1255
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:26,839
also force the private sector to come

1256
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:29,599
into in into into the picture much more

1257
00:53:26,839 --> 00:53:32,240
okay well i should let's build on that

1258
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:35,359
private sector notion what how would you

1259
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:37,920
uh answer the question

1260
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:40,319
well actually mark now we're on the way

1261
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:42,640
of developing the market like

1262
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:44,880
the food safety and quality standard on

1263
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:46,559
the primary production level

1264
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:49,440
and i agree with

1265
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:51,920
bernard that yes indeed

1266
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:54,319
consumers awareness demand from the

1267
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:56,800
consumers needs to be there but also we

1268
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:58,800
should support the the production and

1269
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:00,960
primary production processing level to

1270
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:03,520
to meet up the standards the standards

1271
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:06,319
that sets the government but also

1272
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:09,119
especially the market-led standards that

1273
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:10,400
motivates the the processors to to move

1274
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:12,240
on

1275
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,599
thank you sir

1276
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:15,680
well

1277
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:18,160
we've heard from our panelists now and i

1278
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:21,520
want to give time for a wrap up here

1279
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:24,000
from uh christine yost she's the global

1280
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:27,119
health security initiative a senior

1281
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:30,480
livestock advisor with usaid's bureau of

1282
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:30,480
humanitarian assistance

1283
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:36,000
she provides technical support on saving

1284
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:39,280
lives and livelihoods of livestock

1285
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,480
keepers and fisher folk she lies with

1286
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:42,720
global

1287
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:45,200
humanitarian and resilience

1288
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:48,640
communities on issues regarding food

1289
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:51,520
security and food systems animal health

1290
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:53,680
emerging and transparent diseases

1291
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:56,960
she has over 30 years of the experience

1292
00:54:53,680 --> 00:55:00,640
and working in over 40 countries and so

1293
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:03,920
we'd like to use her expertise to

1294
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:07,119
put a final note on today's webinar

1295
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:09,040
christine please thank you mark and

1296
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:11,280
thank you to all the speakers today i've

1297
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:13,280
really learned a lot i want to highlight

1298
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:15,359
a few things i liked how

1299
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:17,280
the speakers were kind of organized in

1300
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:19,920
research policy and then really looking

1301
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:21,920
at practice from christina we learned

1302
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,920
about the importance of preparing

1303
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:26,160
detecting and responding

1304
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:27,520
in one health approaches preparing in

1305
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:30,720
terms of

1306
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:32,960
particularly focusing on localization

1307
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:35,119
detection and both both the importance

1308
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,799
of the biomedical and the social

1309
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:38,240
sciences

1310
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:40,480
you know it's important to remember that

1311
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:43,040
disease isn't simply a biological

1312
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:45,760
problem it's a socio-economic problem

1313
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:47,760
requiring one health approaches and then

1314
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:50,240
responding in terms of coordination and

1315
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:51,839
targeting at all levels one of our main

1316
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:53,760
lessons from responding to the ebola

1317
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:55,680
outbreak in west africa that ended in

1318
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:57,920
2016 was the need for improved

1319
00:55:55,680 --> 00:56:01,280
coordination and it's a lesson we are

1320
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:03,359
learning again in the covid19 pandemic

1321
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:05,200
from bernard we were introduced to the

1322
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:08,000
one health regional center for africa

1323
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:09,280
with its focusing on policy and scaling

1324
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,079
and it was good

1325
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,240
to

1326
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:14,480
to hear bernard recognize the challenge

1327
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:17,280
of conceptualizing

1328
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:20,799
one health um and the need to integrate

1329
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:23,599
that into scaling approaches um both at

1330
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:26,160
uh the in in public efforts such as the

1331
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:28,960
national one health platforms as well as

1332
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:31,599
graduate programs and community outreach

1333
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:34,000
and then from lasha and badassa we we

1334
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:36,000
really had a nice look into

1335
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,000
examples of putting one health into

1336
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,960
practice both in

1337
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:44,160
market systems as well as in terms of

1338
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:46,559
linking rangeland health to one health

1339
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:48,559
what came out from the discussion and

1340
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:50,880
the contribution of the participants for

1341
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:52,880
me is that one health is not just an

1342
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:55,200
approach to research it's also an

1343
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:57,920
approach to practice policy capacity

1344
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:59,760
building that recognizes and supports

1345
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:02,559
the inextricable linkages between

1346
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:04,480
environmental animal and human health

1347
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:06,400
as livestock experts we need to

1348
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:08,319
continually challenge ourselves to think

1349
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:10,079
about and address what livestock

1350
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:12,319
research and development means for the

1351
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:14,559
health and well-being of people and the

1352
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:17,040
environments in which we live and how

1353
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:19,520
often we should be asking ourselves are

1354
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:21,359
we collaborating with the ecological and

1355
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:23,920
