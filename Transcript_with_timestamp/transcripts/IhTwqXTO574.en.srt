1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,640
imagine this it's a bright sunny morning

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,520
and the fields are glistening with

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:10,320
promise today is the day your hard work

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:13,000
finally pays off you're ready to harvest

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,320
the fruits of months of dedication but

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,760
as you walk to your tractor The Familiar

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:21,720
hum you count on isn't there instead

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:24,840
silence your tractor the very Lifeline

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,279
of your farm has broken down you rush to

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,640
troubleshoot checking everything you can

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,920
but it's no use the fix isn't something

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,320
you can handle because the real problem

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,840
isn't the engine it's the system maybe

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,160
it was something in the fuel system I

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,399
changed the fuel filter but it kept

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,399
doing

17
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:46,039
it so then I finally called our John

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,640
Deere mechanic and uh he said really the

19
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:50,239
only way we can figure this out is we

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,760
got to hook up a computer and download

21
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,640
the air codes imagine owning a piece of

22
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,000
equipment worth hundreds of thousands of

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,039
dollars only to discover you don't have

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,039
the right to repair it instead your

25
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:04,879
forced to rely on the very company that

26
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:07,280
sold it to you waiting days or even

27
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,000
weeks for an authorized technician to

28
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,759
show up all the while your crops are at

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,439
risk your season hangs in the balance

30
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:17,880
and the clock is ticking this isn't just

31
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,880
an inconvenience it's a battle that's

32
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,320
costing Farmers billions of dollars

33
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,840
every year and it's a fight that goes

34
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,400
beyond broken Machinery it's about

35
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,799
challenging the monopolies that are

36
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,640
stripping consumers of control not just

37
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,439
in farming but across every industry

38
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,560
welcome to the front lines of the right

39
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,640
to repair movement a story of resilience

40
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,799
corporate power and the struggle to

41
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,840
reclaim ownership in a world where what

42
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,759
you buy isn't really yours let's dig

43
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,360
into how this impacts Farmers Industries

44
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:51,600
and the Very Foundation of fairness this

45
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,560
is the culprit it was just randomly

46
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,960
shutting down first thing we did was

47
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,719
change the fuel filters in it and it

48
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,680
didn't really resolve the problem so I

49
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,200
was stymied at that point that's the

50
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,960
only thing that you basically have the

51
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,520
ability to do without the John Deere

52
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,800
software that's exactly right the

53
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,319
reality of farmers held hostage in the

54
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,760
heart of America's farmlands tractors

55
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:16,920
aren't just tools they're lifelines yet

56
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,519
when they break down farmers face a

57
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:22,080
sobering truth they don't actually have

58
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:24,440
the power to fix what they own packed

59
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,879
with proprietary software today's

60
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:29,280
tractors require specialized tools and

61
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:32,560
diagnostic codes that only authorize

62
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,160
dealership can access this Monopoly

63
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,959
forces Farmers to wait for technicians

64
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:41,040
pay Skyhigh repair fees and worst of all

65
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:44,319
lose precious time during critical

66
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,959
farming periods take Joe a fourth

67
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:49,760
generation farmer from Iowa when his

68
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,440
John Deere tractor broke down midseason

69
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,640
the nearest service center was over 50 m

70
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,159
away and it would take a week for a

71
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,599
technician to show up every day his

72
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:00,760
tractor sat idle Joe lost thousands of

73
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,480
dollars

74
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,280
and even when he tried a local repair

75
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:08,519
shop they couldn't help John Deere's

76
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,040
software locks kept them out for Joe

77
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:14,080
this wasn't just an inconvenience it was

78
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:17,080
Financial ruin staring him in the face

79
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,080
the problem Monopoly on repairs John

80
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,599
Deere one of the world's largest

81
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,720
agricultural equipment manufacturers has

82
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,599
strategically locked Farmers into their

83
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,760
ecosystem their machines once mechanical

84
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:31,040
Marvels are now rolling

85
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,280
computers this shift means that even

86
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,000
minor repairs often require expensive

87
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,879
diagnostic tools or software only John

88
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,239
Deere can provide this isn't just about

89
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:44,080
broken tractors it's about control

90
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,280
farmers are at the mercy of a single

91
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,879
company unable to repair their equipment

92
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,439
access their own data or even decide how

93
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:55,239
to manage their Farms independently and

94
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:57,040
it's costing them billions annually the

95
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:59,920
first couple tractors I learned to drive

96
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,760
on didn't have any electric controls it

97
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:06,040
was all mechanical controls but you know

98
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:09,040
those old tractors were pretty easy to

99
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:13,120
diagnose if there was a problem and

100
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:15,519
pretty easy to fix those problems the

101
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,199
fight for change but Farmers aren't

102
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,000
backing down across the country a

103
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:22,960
movement is building to challenge repair

104
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,120
monopolies and restore ownership rights

105
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,080
here's how the fight is shaping up

106
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,360
antitrust lawsuits farmers are suing

107
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,520
John Deere arguing that its repair

108
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,199
Monopoly violates the Sherman Act backed

109
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,320
by the Department of Justice and the

110
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,039
Federal Trade Commission FTC these

111
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,680
lawsuits aim to dismantle deer's

112
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:45,800
strangle hold on repairs I'm just

113
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:48,479
notifying John Deere right now if you do

114
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,919
that we're putting a 200% tariff on

115
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,320
everything that you want to sell into

116
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,600
the United States the FTC has already

117
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,160
forced companies like harleydavidson and

118
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,039
Weber to loosen their grip proving

119
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,479
change is possible when the government

120
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:03,320
steps in

121
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,240
right to repair legislation over 30

122
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,240
states are considering laws to give

123
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,840
consumers the right to fix their own

124
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:13,800
devices from tractors to smartphones

125
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,880
Colorado made headlines in 2023 as the

126
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,840
first state to pass a law targeting

127
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:21,000
agricultural equipment under this law

128
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,160
manufacturers must provide farmers and

129
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,840
independent repair shops with the tools

130
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,000
and software needed to fix Machinery

131
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,960
other states like Minnesota and New York

132
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,479
are following suit signaling a

133
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:35,319
nationwide shift Federal action the

134
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:39,280
Biden Administration has called for

135
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:42,000
sweeping reforms in 2021 an executive

136
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,880
order urged the FTC to crack down on

137
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,360
repair monopolies including those in

138
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,600
agriculture while Federal action faces

139
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,360
intense lobbying from corporations the

140
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,800
momentum is

141
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,199
undeniable I know America can't succeed

142
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:59,160
unless American Business succeeds but

143
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:00,360
let me be very clear capitalism without

144
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,120
competition

145
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:06,080
isn't capitalism it's exploitation the

146
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,000
stakes more than just repairs the

147
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,240
implications of this battle go far

148
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,599
beyond fixing tractors at its core the

149
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,080
right to repair is about data and

150
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:18,840
whoever controls it controls the

151
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,400
future modern tractors collect vast

152
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,639
amounts of data on soil conditions crop

153
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,639
yields and Machinery

154
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:28,000
performance this information is

155
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:30,960
invaluable to Farmers but is owned by

156
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,160
John Deere farmers can view their data

157
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,120
but can't transfer it to other platforms

158
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:38,240
or use it with competing equipment

159
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,440
Brands this Walled Garden approach keeps

160
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,199
Farmers dependent on deer and prevents

161
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:45,199
them from exploring better or more

162
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:48,479
affordable options it's a monopoly not

163
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,520
just on repairs but on Innovation itself

164
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,960
and until this changes farmers will

165
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:55,360
continue to lose billions not just in

166
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,360
repair costs but in missed opportunities

167
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,280
to improve efficiency and

168
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,440
profitability you think it's fair that

169
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:06,280
farmers and ranchers will pay

170
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:09,720
$300,000 or a million dollar to purchase

171
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:12,560
a combine or a tractor to not own it

172
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:15,479
we're not leasing it we're we're buying

173
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,280
that the gadgets that are in it are part

174
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:20,720
of that equipment and the technology

175
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:23,800
that runs that gadgets is part of that

176
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:26,360
equipment we thought when we bought that

177
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,759
tractor that we bought that tractor Lock

178
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,039
Stock and Barrel lessons from the Auto

179
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:31,919
industry

180
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:34,000
the agricultural fight for the right to

181
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:38,080
repair mirrors a similar battle in the

182
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,039
Auto industry in 2012 Massachusetts

183
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,960
passed the first state level right to

184
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:44,680
repair law for cars forcing automakers

185
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,960
to share diagnostic tools with

186
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,720
independent repair shops it was a

187
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,360
GameChanger but as technology advanced

188
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,280
automakers exploited loopholes claiming

189
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,319
cyber security risks to withhold

190
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:59,680
wirelessly transmitted data sound

191
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:01,759
familiar John Deere is playing from the

192
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,080
same Playbook arguing that allowing

193
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,960
third-party repairs could compromise

194
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,759
food security and safety yet cyber

195
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,840
Security Experts have debunked these

196
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:13,039
claims pointing out that independent

197
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,560
shops can implement the same safeguards

198
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:17,080
as dealerships the Auto industry

199
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:20,199
eventually conceded to national

200
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:23,199
agreements in 2014 proving that change

201
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:27,039
is possible when public pressure mounts

202
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:29,560
a path forward so what's next the fight

203
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:32,880
for the right to repair is a marathon

204
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:36,159
not a Sprint Farmers lawmakers and

205
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:39,000
Advocates must work together to push for

206
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,919
federal legislation a nationwide law

207
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,360
would eliminate the patchwork of state

208
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:47,120
regulations ensuring all Farmers have

209
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:49,240
equal rights data ownership Farmers must

210
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,640
have full access to and control over

211
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:54,959
their own data enabling them to make

212
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:57,360
independent decisions consumer

213
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,120
awareness the more people understand the

214
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,320
stakes the harder it becomes for

215
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,079
corporate operations to justify their

216
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:07,000
practices Joe's story is a testament to

217
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:08,959
what's possible with Colorado's new law

218
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,680
he fixed his tractor himself in less

219
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:14,360
than a day saving thousands of dollars

220
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,640
but Joe Knows the fight isn't over true

221
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,000
change requires Federal action and a

222
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,680
united front from everyone who believes

223
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,880
in fairness and competition farmers and

224
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:27,120
ranchers we have the highest suicide

225
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:30,000
rate in the nation and it's because our

226
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,800
occupation is so stressful

227
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,360
equipment breaking down and you are not

228
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,680
able to fix it you can't do

229
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,600
anything that's a whole new level of

230
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:43,440
stress the road ahead the right to

231
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:46,000
repair isn't just about fixing machines

232
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,320
it's about fixing a broken system it's

233
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,519
about restoring dignity to Farmers

234
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,800
empowering consumers and challenging

235
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:55,800
monopolies that stifle Innovation and

236
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,959
choice the battle may be uphill but

237
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:01,120
history shows that Collective action can

238
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:03,920
overcome even the most trenched Powers

239
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,839
so what can you do support local and

240
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:09,680
National initiatives educate others and

241
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:12,600
demand accountability from lawmakers and

242
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,640
corporations this fight affects everyone

243
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,680
not just

244
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:18,720
Farmers today it's about tractors but

245
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,480
tomorrow it could be your smartphone

246
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,800
home appliances or even Healthcare

247
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:26,160
devices together we can break the

248
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:29,320
strangle hold of repair monopolies and

249
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,519
create a fairer more sustainable future

250
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,760
