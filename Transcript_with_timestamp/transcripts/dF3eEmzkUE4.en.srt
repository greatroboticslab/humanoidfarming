00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
hi there i'm matt vandehart pioneer

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:05,759
field agronomist from central iowa

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,440
providing a late season corn update

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,920
now i know each year we tell you to go

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,759
assess stock quality and grain quality

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,960
to set your harvest plans

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,120
this year i want to make sure you are

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,640
assessing late season plant health and

9
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,160
tar spot we didn't have the right

10
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,160
conditions for tar spot this year across

11
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,279
the midwest or even across iowa we

12
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,600
didn't have a lot of cool and wet

13
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,439
conditions at least in southern iowa

14
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,439
certain parts of iowa have seen some tar

15
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,119
spot really get aggressive here through

16
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,760
august and september

17
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,520
i'm in a field here of a susceptible

18
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,600
competitive hybrid that obviously had a

19
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,360
lot of tar spot in it you know got into

20
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,920
even the upper leaves or just completely

21
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,920
covered in tar spots so septal hybrids

22
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,120
can get affected by

23
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,879
tar spots very aggressively very quickly

24
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,399
but this set in this field late enough

25
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,320
you know we're close to being able to

26
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,160
harvest this field so it may not have

27
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,280
had a yield impact at all but we need to

28
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,640
take note of these fields we need to

29
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,480
take note if you do have some tar spot

30
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,480
out there or some bad late season plant

31
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,760
health it may affect stock quality but

32
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,359
also the next time you have a hybrid

33
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,680
there make sure it has a good tar spot

34
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,199
rating working on ratings that pioneer

35
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,880
we have some preliminary scores and some

36
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,640
that are work in progress but if you

37
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,159
need a hybrid that's good got a good tar

38
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,760
spot tolerance we're gonna give you the

39
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,760
best in our lineup and so be asking

40
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,520
those questions be planning that out the

41
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,960
next time you have corn there take note

42
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,640
of those fields i know some of you may

43
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,320
have some drought stress and it's not

44
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,320
tar spot out there but at least check

45
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,159
those fields ahead of harvest tar spot's

46
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,920
something we need to manage holistically

47
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,680
we need to manage with fungicide time

48
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,520
properly but a lot of that fungicide

49
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,040
residual comes off late in the season

50
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,720
when this aggressive disease comes up

51
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,880
and attacks a lot of susceptible hybrids

52
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,240
so just take note of this disease and

53
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,680
take note of any stock quality issues

54
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,360
ahead of harvest if you've got any

55
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,600
questions on tar spot our tar spot

56
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,040
tolerance ratings from pioneer or even

57
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,799
just questions about laces in plant

58
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,720
health let us know pioneer and have a

59
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,280
happy harvest

60
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,960
