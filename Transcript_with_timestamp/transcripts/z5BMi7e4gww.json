  "text": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] what what you want Ruby I was thinking Ruby might have come back into heat this morning but she's not showing any signs now so I guess not she stopped at the buck pan I thought hmm did we not get your bread last dad so I think we have a ton of goats bread starting Valentine's Day on we should have some babies dropping so what about you autumn you're a teen aren't you we're not gonna breed autumn we're not gonna do that to her her little sweetness we just don't want to we just don't want to she's too sweet I don't want to mess up any of her awesome body condition because she looks so healthy now so I guess she's always been a little plump girl like her mama where's-where's time that's hearts hearts is looking pretty plump too so I think we bred hearts I think fern may have had a go fancy girl Mamie shy Dominique time kitty fancy too shady I think that's it oh and truly I'm pretty sure she's bred but time right here right and I've been talking about how she is like the easiest keeper and the whole herd she never has issues and she's always got a thick shiny coat and she's always got a nice plump body and she stays and milk for a long time she's still in milk and it's been a year since autumn was born so it is tempting to grate on them my dad thinks I should he thinks it would be good for her spiritually that she would enjoy being a mom but sorry to add I'm just not ready yet maybe next year I just feel like anytime you breathe in animal you gotta be prayer for any type of pregnancy complications birthing complications that could potentially harm them and I'm just not not prepared for that with my sweet autumn so we'll breed her again and hopefully get another beautiful autumn that that won't end up with the deficiency that harmed her so much while she was developing so look at them goofy that kids eat goats love my goats oh poor fluff another no girlfriend today oh you are disgusting poor fluffer nutters getting no pets from mommy if you guys remember the first two years that we had him in the fall he never really went into rut like he never did the whole stinky buck thing look at his face that is so stinky his ears are white normally his chest is whitening his beard is white he's disgusting he's so gross in the stench is so foul and I'm not pretty okay with a goat buck smell but he's gross well Peter pepper is not as stinky that's the old water by the way the new waters in there I got up I'm just gonna dump that on the grounding rod you stink ooh boy I can't wait until rut season is over and I could pet you again yeah he's been getting rough with Peter not too bad just an occasional random RAM he's still a sweet boy Oh gross II stinky it quit spraying up your nostrils that's gross I guess one of the benefits of having a drought in the middle of the summer in Georgia is that finally we're having a break from major parasite loads the spring weather that was so wet after the winter that had no cold weather to kill off parasites was very rough on us when we went into the spring and into the beginning of the summer we had serious parasite issues in our herd we had a lot of problems and it was very scary and we had some losses and it was very difficult that all happened during the time when I wasn't making videos I wasn't I wasn't doing well with it mentally or physically with my health so it became really hard for me to pick up the camera so just know that every time you get a video from me that it's just a sign of me feeling better and I'm definitely feeling a lot better mentally physically I think once the 90 degree weather cools off I think I'll be feeling a lot better the quail are doing great they just went through a molt so their egg-laying slowed down a little bit but not nearly as much as when a chicken molt's it seems like it's a faster process for them so we've been supplementing with mealworms from our meal worm colony if you're interested in that I'll leave a link to our video showing the easy way to grow mealworms without having all the extra steps of separating out the different stages the mealworms provide extra protein to help with the new feather growth we also make sure that we continue giving them the high-protein game bird feed that's really important to their health and keeping them actively laying and doing well [Music] I have to give another huge thank you to the people who came out for the whole submergence summer soir\u00e9e for all of their help in the weeding of this garden I am so happy to say that these asparagus have been regrowing through this drought and heat because of the weed suppression being taken off of them so it looks like we're gonna have a great asparagus harvest in the spring because the plants are coming back into their healthy strong health it's funny because in New England and other cooler parts of the country people say that asparagus grows wild on the side of the road in in the ditches with the weeds but here in Georgia the slightest amount of weed stress well not the slightest it does okay with chicory there's a winter cover crop but when it gets that creeping Charlie in there and the goldenrod that was growing up in it it really stressed the plants out and made them not produce as much so it's interesting to me that it doesn't do as well in the south as it does the north obviously but that the weeds make a big difference so we're gonna have to really stay on top of it this year and once the winter kills back all of the screen fern foliage on the asparagus we're gonna go through and put a nice thick layer of mulch to protect it from the weeds in the spring our permaculture perennial fruit and berry bed kind of got a hit to it the goats got out somehow they knocked down one of the posts probably because it's so dry out it loosened up in the ground and I looked out here and they were Mallen down they ate down all the leaves off of the raspberries but you can see they're regrowing from the center so they're coming back but they ate down all of those they down all the comfrey they ate down all the strawberries so the strawberries already going back here let me show you one down here where it's like real obvious like this you see these sticks we're all leaves those were all leaves growing and so when the goats ate them off the strawberry started producing new leaves down at the base from the center rosette so it's really bouncing back quite well and I think it's gonna be fine we'll still have plenty of strawberry in the spring of course all it's a tomato a dead dead dead did the basil went to seed it's beautiful still I think but it's dropping its seed left and right I need to harvest some of these seed heads so that I can grow more next year this was a lemon basil I got from Kaylee at the honey said this little volunteer tiny cherry tomato it's probably a current or wild Tom one of those types it's still producing fruit despite the fact that all the other have died the peppers that we're producing at the beginning of the season are dying back probably a lot to do with the drought plus it looks like the goats got to it the pepino melons never did produce fruit so I don't know if it's because of the drought or we didn't have a long enough growing season I'll definitely try planting them again because they showed a lot of potential um these tomato plants have a lot of herbicide curl on them so they haven't ever produced anything really worth speaking my Roselle got knocked over and nibbled on by the goats but it is still producing huge huge buds so we're gonna be harvesting these pretty soon I don't want to do a video on that so hopefully I'll take you along and you can see what we do with these usually they're standing upright like okra but they fell over peppers on this end are doing a great job steal these purple peppers were the first peppers to produce and they I think are going to be the last ones to produce they seem to me to do really well through all temperatures of the season this right here is one of the ones that I was really excited about trying this year I got these seeds from Jess at roots and refuge and this is arroz con pollo and it took forever to start producing blooms so now it's starting to bloom and some fruit is developing so we will definitely get to try it my goes kind of surprised me because they came over here and ate all the horseradish leaf down so I wasn't expecting them to be interested in that but it's okay the plant is regrowing leaves just like everything else goldenrod is just taking off over here all of the plants kind of fell over but they are blooming like crazy and feeding the honeybees and all the other bees and pollinators unfortunately our main stand that we had from that water tank down got cut down during the soiree so we don't have as much as we used to on this side of the garden but we still have some and it does spread quite easily so we'll be fine and just over the garden fence over here by the pond you can see how much the drought has affected us the water line usually comes up to about where that sedges and the edge of the water would be here their water line went down so far early in the season that plants were able to grow all the way out to there and then it got even worse and the water line has receded even more so our pond is the lowest it's ever been since we've lived here but we still have water so it's ok we still are feeding our wildlife and taking care of the environment by allowing plants to grow around the edges of the pond that are official to pollinators in other wildlife we're doing our part to keep the world a little healthier the good news is the forecast is calling for cooling temperatures this weekend and next week so that means we're gonna get out of the 90s to us that's cooling temperatures a lot of people in the country are dealing with snow and freezing already and we are over here going it is 95 degrees it feels like 100 not fun but thankfully it looks like it's going to get into the 80s and possibly even 70s next week with a chance of rain on Monday or Tuesday so if that happens um these beds are gonna be sown so quickly with my carrots beets collards kale and we will have a fall crop and I'm really grateful for all the help getting this ready for fall garden and I'm really glad that I didn't rush to get it planted that week because it all would have died all of my friends that live in the area have all been posting sad sad stories and pictures of what's happened to their fall crops and let me tell you it's not pretty so we got lucky that we didn't do it when we should have as a normal season ghost because this season has been nothing close to normal all right speaking of hot it is getting hot out here I'm gonna go inside if you haven't checked out our amazon links down below you know a while please do Amazon affiliate associates do rely on a slight Commission being earned every month
