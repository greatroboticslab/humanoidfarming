  "text": "hello my name is Hakeem doberman I'm the deputy director-general for research of the international rice research institute or URI and the gentlemen besides me here is Lee while is the head of our experimental station and what we want to do with you in the next few months is actually learn how to grow a crop of rice not just any crop of rice we want to do it in the best possible manner we can think of now we are scientists so we do a lot of research we believe that we know a lot about rice and how to grow it in different part of the world and we have lots of recommendations for farmers and extension workers we often call them best management practices you can find them on the internet and all rights knowledge bank in extension but there's in books and scientific papers but what we really really want to do is try to practice what we preach because often we scientists may come up with things that you know don't really work in practice or sometimes you wonder why aren't people using them so that's why Lee and I have decided well why don't we do it ourselves as much as we can do ourselves because some of the things we may not be really qualified to do but we'll try okay we will we will be qualified not only what qualifies you to grow the scope of rice yes well I'm something of a fraud myself I am a rice farmer in Australia but juda dry conditions and an absence from Australia for the last three years I have a stood my rice crop last rice crop six years ago six years ago now I'm a little rusty as well and you have not really done this in a setting like this one here in the humid tropics with small field and wet environment exactly right I'm out of my comfort zone I suspect you're out of your comfort zone so that's a good place well I've done research on this for 20 years but really you know have I have already done all these things together in a larger field probably not you know I have other people or had other people to do it for me but you know that's probably not the right thing to do so come and join us come back with us pretty much every week in the coming months and learn with us what what we do will also not be shy at all to show you what we might screw up I'm sure we're going to mess up a few things you know but that's it we want to learn and we want to make sure that the things that we recommend the farmers coming out of our research actually work so we'll see where we are four months from now in terms of what crop we have grown what its yield has been we are we are setting a high yield target we're not embarrassed to say that yeah what's the target well normally we would say with best management practices you would like to shoot for a yield of about 80% of yield potential new potential here is for any good dry season it's between nine and ten tonnes nowadays so our goal should be probably let's say a seventh on crop that sounds whether we achieve it we don't know but we'll be no more than four months from now thank you",
