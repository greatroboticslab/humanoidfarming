let's talk about indexing valves

[Music]

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,939
if you're not familiar with this type of

7
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,460
valve let me fill you in indexing valves

8
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:26,340
are a single valve that feeds multiple

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,859
water lines they can run up to four or

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,019
six zones depending on the model its

11
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:33,239
design has few moving Parts which means

12
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:35,579
less maintenance and a longer life span

13
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:38,160
the indexing valve can be installed

14
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,860
above ground in a valve box or directly

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,620
buried typically with irrigation valves

16
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,780
you need one valve for each Zone each

17
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,180
valve would then need to be wired to a

18
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,100
controller with an indexing valve you

19
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,260
will still need a controller and a

20
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,480
control valve or pump to turn the water

21
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,520
on and off but one of the great things

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,199
about the indexing valve is that it runs

23
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,180
on water pressure this means you won't

24
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:02,940
have to worry about running any wires to

25
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:05,280
it you gotta love that it will work with

26
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:09,240
flows as low as 10 gallons per minute

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,159
and at pressures of 25 to 75 PSI this

28
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,659
one's designed for up to four zones you

29
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,540
can tell by the four outlets on the

30
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:18,000
bottom here and here is a sixth Zone by

31
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,340
the way this is a 1 an inch and this is

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,500
a one and a quarter inch if you don't

33
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,960
need all those zones you will need a

34
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,960
replacement cam with the correct number

35
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,240
of zones and you'll need to cap off any

36
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,000
unnecessary Outlets to do that attach a

37
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,240
PVC pipe at least six inches long and

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,520
cap the end if you do decide to do that

39
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,799
at a later date you can always come back

40
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,840
and make that outlet available by the

41
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,720
way you do need to use multi-purpose

42
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,520
glue not PVC glue because this is ABS

43
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,100
plastic not PVC

44
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,320
okay to change out the cam first we're

45
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:56,600
going to remove these retaining screws

46
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,600
right here and this is sped up

47
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,500
we're going to pry out the current cam

48
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:12,420
and this is the cam that I'm going to be

49
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:14,340
putting in now notice when we end

50
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,900
there's this little stem sticking up

51
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:20,840
right here and that's going to have to

52
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,840
match this divot right here see that

53
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:26,700
as you slide it in this stem right here

54
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,280
is going to fit up inside the cam

55
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,900
once you get it in you're going to

56
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,660
rotate

57
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:39,319
counterclockwise that's important

58
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:39,319
until that stem and that divot line up

59
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,900
that

60
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:49,260
and once it's in place it shouldn't try

61
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:52,980
to pop back up on you

62
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:56,540
and then put the two screws back in

63
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,540
and this is sped up

64
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:03,360
once the cam is installed the indexing

65
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:05,940
valve will cycle through all the zones

66
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,160
in order after the water is turned off

67
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,900
the next time it's turned back on it

68
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,920
will start with the next Zone in the

69
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,260
index

70
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,060
