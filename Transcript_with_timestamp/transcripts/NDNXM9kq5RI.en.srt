00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:09,309
I'm Shane Harris with the Alabama

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:11,709
Cooperative Extension system today is

3
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:13,929
the first day of spring a lot of folks

4
00:00:11,709 --> 00:00:16,150
are eager to get outside and do a little

5
00:00:13,929 --> 00:00:18,610
yard work maybe even get those spring

6
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:21,040
gardens ready to go been a long winter

7
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:23,350
been a wet winter but there's lots of

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,480
things to be done one thing is to get

9
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:28,090
rid of the weeds get the garden ready

10
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,760
get it ready to be planted maybe take a

11
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:32,349
saw test things like that let's talk

12
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:35,920
about a few things that you can do this

13
00:00:32,349 --> 00:00:37,840
time of year the traditional method of

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,990
getting the spring garden ready each

15
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,870
year is to get the tractor out and disc

16
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:46,989
and plow the garden I always called this

17
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:48,940
the pop ball method because pawpaw was

18
00:00:46,989 --> 00:00:51,390
always ready to get out and use his

19
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:54,430
tractor for the first time each spring

20
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:57,130
disking and plowing turns the weeds over

21
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:59,260
prepares the seed bed against the garden

22
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:02,020
and feel ready to plant in the spring

23
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:04,149
time be sure to check the moisture

24
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:08,729
content you don't want to disc when it's

25
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:08,729
too wet as it will cause heavy clods

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,870
although labor some ham removal is

27
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:17,680
another method of removing the weeds

28
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:21,040
from the spring garden this can take a

29
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:27,610
lot of time and effort but the chore

30
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:29,619
must be done one common method for of

31
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:32,229
controlling weeds in the garden is use

32
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:33,909
of herbicides purposes containing

33
00:01:32,229 --> 00:01:37,000
glyphosate which is a non-selective

34
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:40,240
herbicide is commonly used to prepare

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,030
the garden as well as control weeds if

36
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:46,030
since herbicides are used it may take

37
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:50,170
two weeks for symptoms to show as well

38
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:52,390
as control to take place also do not

39
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:55,210
plant immediately allow a few weeks

40
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:58,689
after the Keele to plant the seeds point

41
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:59,979
in corporate transplants in addition to

42
00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:01,689
controlling the weeds it's a good idea

43
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:04,270
to take a soil test if you've not done

44
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:06,189
one in the last three years having a

45
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:07,420
soil test little file is a very valuable

46
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:10,090
because it's going to tell you where

47
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:12,520
your pH Sol is where your fertility

48
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:16,300
level is and what nutrients you may need

49
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,769
to add a Soltis will check the peas

50
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,930
level look

51
00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:22,269
and tell you if you need to add lime or

52
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:24,370
not to raise the pH up to six or six and

53
00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:26,409
a half which is ideal for vegetable

54
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:29,260
gardening many summers problems

55
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:32,620
including blossom end rot are related to

56
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:34,900
low pH or high pH so that's one way to

57
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:37,060
correct those but also check to tell you

58
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:39,310
what your fertility level is and what

59
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,530
nutrients you need to add or in case you

60
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:45,849
may not need any at all for that

61
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:47,919
