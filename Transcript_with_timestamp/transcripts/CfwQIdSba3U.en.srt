00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,160
hi i'm zooming with kent vlieger

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,559
south dakota's soil health specialist

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,000
just to talk about a series of videos

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:13,920
that

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,880
kent shot in may 2020 can't we have

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,600
eight videos we'd like for folks to see

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,520
and

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,800
i wondered if you could give us a little

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,039
bit of context of

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,480
why you were in the field shooting these

12
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,840
videos

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:33,120
sure so like you mentioned buzz the

14
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:36,559
2019 really the whole calendar year was

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,399
very wet in in south dakota

16
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,480
most places had twice their annual

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,440
precipitation

18
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,120
a lot of prevent plant and we went into

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,079
winter freeze up really

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,280
still quite wet a lot of rivers were

21
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,000
still in flood stage and

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,399
going into winter so this spring there

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,320
was

24
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,000
quite a bit of anxiety on whether we

25
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,520
were going to

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,800
kind of have the same disaster we did

27
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,600
last year since we had so much moisture

28
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,960
already in the soil profile and so what

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,280
we were looking to do

30
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:11,040
is show some of these fields

31
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,560
and conditions and then we were really

32
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,880
looking to

33
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,240
show producers that have been practicing

34
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,640
soil health practices

35
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:22,400
for uh some for a couple decades and

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,880
some a little shorter term

37
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,080
and just to see how they were handling

38
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,520
um

39
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,200
all that excess moisture from the

40
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,200
previous year and if they were having

41
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,479
any success with planting or what some

42
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,520
of the challenges

43
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:38,159
that they were facing all right thanks

44
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,400
kent that gives us an idea of what to

45
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,439
expect hey i hope these videos are going

46
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,479
to be useful to

47
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:55,280
producers especially as they

48
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:55,280
start thinking about 2021.
