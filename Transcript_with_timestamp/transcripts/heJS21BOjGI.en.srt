[Music]

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,920
well uh al rods i'm an agricultural

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,920
engineer with usda a agricultural

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,000
research service at university park

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,160
pennsylvania and what i'm going to talk

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,880
about today is a little project that

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,359
we've done over the past year looking at

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,439
whole farm assessments of nutrient

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,000
extraction technologies we're developing

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,480
a model that takes a better look at this

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,040
co-authors are colleagues of mine and

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,120
they include clint church who's well the

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,719
mastermind i guess behind the map x

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,559
system and we he had a talk yesterday on

15
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,239
that well as the theme of this

16
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,960
conference goes and every and we all

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,160
know um manure is a beneficial resource

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,719
it has value for the nutrients but even

19
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,280
more now as we look at the soil health

20
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,120
and organic matter carbon sequestration

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,520
it's all kind of tied together that

22
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,079
manure does have value but of course it

23
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,039
has its challenges and and a big one is

24
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,080
just a low concentration of nutrients

25
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,600
and fairly

26
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,600
on uniform often uh distribution of the

27
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,280
nutrients within the material our dairy

28
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,400
farms in particular getting larger and

29
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,560
larger and often that means more animals

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,320
per unit of land more purchase feed

31
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,479
bringing nutrients in

32
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,280
over applying nutrients onto the farm

33
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,720
and and build up of excess nutrients and

34
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,720
and we have nutrients we have to get rid

35
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,400
of so this has led to

36
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,079
the development and

37
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,439
you know there's a lot of work now being

38
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,960
a lot of thought being put into

39
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,799
different types of extraction

40
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,079
technologies that can be used on dairy

41
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,320
farms i've listed a few here i guess our

42
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,079
view of this was that you know it might

43
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,600
be good to have a tool that cannot

44
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,079
really look at

45
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,000
how these technologies will impact the

46
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,320
actual farm how do they interact with

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,840
all the other parts of the farm

48
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,680
and ultimately what are the production

49
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,079
costs in

50
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,680
the impact on profitability uh farm

51
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,680
nutrient losses

52
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,880
the resources particularly fertilizer

53
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,880
that have to be

54
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,640
brought in in conjunction with the use

55
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,479
of the technologies and that sort of

56
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,280
thing and we also want to look at some

57
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,360
life cycle impacts greenhouse gases of

58
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,440
course is a big one that gets a lot of

59
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,120
interest now and fossil energy use was

60
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,120
another one that we looked at so our

61
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,840
objective in this particular study was

62
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,080
to perform a comprehensive assessment of

63
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,080
phosphorus extraction in particular from

64
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,440
from dairy manure and we were using a

65
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,959
decanter centrifuge centrifuge for this

66
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,959
particular study

67
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,879
we're kind of using this as an example

68
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,360
of how we could implement this type of

69
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,280
technology in the model and

70
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,840
and do a whole farm assessment so the

71
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,280
model we're using is the integrated farm

72
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,400
system model

73
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,560
this is a

74
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,640
a tool that's been under development for

75
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,120
an application for many years we've used

76
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,080
it to look at a wide range of

77
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,239
technologies and strategies for

78
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,800
dairy farms and and beef production

79
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,280
systems so what we needed to do here was

80
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,200
just to develop a new component and put

81
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,280
into this model to represent these

82
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,040
extraction technologies

83
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,599
and again we tried to be pretty general

84
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,519
in in the formation of this model

85
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,920
so that it could be applied to

86
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,080
various technologies and then after

87
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,120
doing that then we wanted to look at how

88
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,360
it actually fit in to an actual farm in

89
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,360
pennsylvania and we looked at the farm

90
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,080
in two different ways first is the base

91
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,920
farm the way it is today the the farm's

92
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,920
in a in a long-term nutrient balance

93
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,159
basically there there's

94
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,120
enough land there we're producing enough

95
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,400
feed

96
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,000
to you know recycle all the nutrients

97
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,959
and then we wanted to look at what if we

98
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,120
were reducing that farm area some

99
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,640
and there was excess phosphorus that

100
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,040
they really needed to get rid of how

101
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,920
does that affect things a little more on

102
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,319
the model itself it is a whole farm

103
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,560
process level simulation

104
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,959
so we're simulating as shown indicated

105
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,519
here all the major components

106
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,239
of the farm uh looking at the flow of

107
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,799
nutrients in and out of the farm and and

108
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,239
among the various components

109
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,239
so it really does look at a lot of the

110
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,400
interaction so if you change one part of

111
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,480
the system how does it affect all the

112
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,560
other parts of the system the model does

113
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,319
predict various gaseous emissions

114
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,400
greenhouse gases ammonia hydrogen

115
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:19,440
sulfide and docs

116
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,320
also denitrification losses of

117
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,639
n

118
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:27,280
n2 n2o and no2 nitrate leaching

119
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,199
runoff losses of phosphorus and nitrogen

120
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,360
and so forth it does do

121
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,240
a whole farm balance of each of the

122
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,840
major nutrients as illustrated here with

123
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,000
phosphorus it kind of tracks all the

124
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,400
phosphorus in and out through the system

125
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,479
it also includes a cradle to farmgate

126
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,400
life cycle assessment as illustrated

127
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,639
here we have the greenhouse gases that

128
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,400
are coming directly off the farm

129
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,320
either enteric

130
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,800
from the animal and then the emissions

131
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,040
from the manure and so forth but we also

132
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,520
look at what we call the upstream

133
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,560
emissions those that would occur

134
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,120
as we

135
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,919
develop produce resources that are being

136
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,600
used on the farm uh fuel electricity

137
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,840
fertilizer and that sort of thing so

138
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,680
that's where we get the cradle to farm

139
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,080
gate everything that goes up to the

140
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,280
point where that milk leaves the farm is

141
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,199
accounted for as far as the extraction

142
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,400
component then

143
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,680
the technology can be used to extract or

144
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,479
export

145
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,680
whatever you the user defines as coming

146
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,680
out okay so it can be any combination of

147
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,120
nitrogen phosphorus and potassium again

148
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,440
we're trying to kind of general in the

149
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,880
way we set it up so it could represent

150
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:39,840
a wide variety of applications and by

151
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,280
setting entering the the initial costs

152
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,400
and and

153
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:47,120
labor prices and fuel electricity price

154
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,680
so forth it does do an economic analysis

155
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,520
to look at the the effect on on cost of

156
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,520
the farm and then of course it looks at

157
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,440
all the interactions as you change the

158
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,039
nutrient cycling how does that affect

159
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,120
crop production and various

160
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,720
environmental impacts of the farm so the

161
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,960
base farm that we're working with here

162
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,720
is an actual farm or where it's

163
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,759
representing an actual farm in

164
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,400
pennsylvania we have 2 000

165
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,199
hosting cows and replacements pretty

166
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,479
good

167
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:19,280
milk production rate of 24 600

168
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:19,280
pound per cow we have uh 34th

169
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,319
acres of crop land again that's enough

170
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,960
to produce all the feed essentially for

171
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,639
these animals and with a very major part

172
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,039
all the grain and forage so we're

173
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,560
producing alfalfa grass corn and rye for

174
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,560
the for feeding the animals the

175
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,319
lactating cows are maintained in

176
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,199
freestyle barns with a flush manure

177
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:41,199
system and we have a screw press that's

178
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,960
extracting the manure solids and they're

179
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,919
recycled as bedding something that's

180
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,840
maybe somewhat unique about our region

181
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,400
it's called the ridge and valley region

182
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,479
you can see here this you see the long

183
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,639
ridges and the long narrow valleys

184
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:57,440
between them so the a farmer this size

185
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,440
can really stretch out long distances

186
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,880
so they're hauling this speed for fairly

187
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,400
long distances and then of course

188
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,199
returning that manure

189
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,440
very long distances if they want to

190
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,840
redistribute that uniformly throughout

191
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,680
the farm so as an alternate then we

192
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,520
wanted to look at

193
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,599
something actually that the actual farm

194
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,599
is considering and that's to do away

195
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,560
with the flush system and go to a scrape

196
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,840
system

197
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,919
how does that affect the farm for one

198
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,840
and then the use of the centrifuge the

199
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,479
other was to reduce the crop land down

200
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,960
to 2 700 acres we got rid of any corn

201
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:33,039
grain production we bought and

202
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,680
brought in all the corn grain

203
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:37,840
and this created a a surplus of

204
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,479
phosphorus that had to be removed

205
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,360
so in terms of the the original farm

206
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,479
then

207
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,960
by using the centrifuge we were able to

208
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,639
reduce the hauling distance by about 50

209
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,680
percent and the number of trucks by

210
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:54,720
about 30 percent what we're doing here

211
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,639
instead of hauling all the manure out

212
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,599
to all the fields

213
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,759
we extract a large portion of the

214
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,919
phosphorus into a concentrated material

215
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,960
that can be hauled much more

216
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,960
conveniently to the outside areas

217
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,599
and it also leaves the remaining manure

218
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,960
with a higher end to pee ratio that's

219
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,000
more suitable

220
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,639
for the

221
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,319
areas close by the farm facility so

222
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,039
that's what we're really modeling here

223
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:23,440
and that's the impact so all that is the

224
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,360
annual fuel use in manure handling was

225
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,919
decreased 16

226
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,000
this was offset by 79 percent increase

227
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,759
in electricity to drive the centrifuge

228
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,360
and the pumps and so forth that are

229
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,680
associated with that

230
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,000
so over all the energy costs did

231
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,919
increase the annual cost of owning and

232
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,519
maintaining the equipment increase labor

233
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,800
costs decreased a little

234
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,399
uh

235
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,519
by the reducing the manure hauling time

236
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,000
all total

237
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,880
the manure handling costs increased

238
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,080
you know a little over 27 000 per year

239
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,560
here so wasn't an economic win with this

240
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:02,080
system with the better distribution of

241
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,920
phosphorus we did find a slightly less a

242
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,080
slight decrease in the phosphorus runoff

243
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,800
losses from the farm going to a screw

244
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,880
press then we were working with a more

245
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,200
concentrated manure because we weren't

246
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,200
recycling all that flush water so we got

247
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,880
by with one less screw press so where we

248
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,360
had two in the original farm it went

249
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,600
down to one this reduced the electricity

250
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:26,000
consumption energy costs

251
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,279
were reduced 24 labor costs increased 65

252
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,160
because

253
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,839
we were now using a scrape system where

254
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,120
in this case we were

255
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,720
using a skid steer or tractor to scrape

256
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,959
that manure

257
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,360
which required some labor overall the

258
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,480
manure handling cost did decrease nine

259
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,360
percent

260
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,040
slight increase in soluble p runoff

261
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,720
with this type of

262
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,320
system

263
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,160
while the sediment p runoff decreased

264
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,240
and overall the farmgate life cycle

265
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,560
energy consumption decreased about two

266
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,320
percent no real impact on greenhouse gas

267
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:05,279
emissions then when we put this the

268
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:08,240
extracting the centrifuge in with the

269
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,360
scrape system it was more economical

270
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,680
okay

271
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,839
uh we were able to get more efficient

272
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,920
extraction of the phosphorus for one and

273
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,440
then we were we greatly really reduced

274
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,320
the volume of material that had to go

275
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,399
through the centrifuge so electricity

276
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,560
use increased and fuel consumption

277
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,000
decreased as compared to without the

278
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,279
centrifuge

279
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,880
a little effect really on the

280
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,560
environment other than there was a two

281
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,040
percent increase in the farm gate

282
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,920
intensity of fossil energy use which

283
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,120
kind of offset what we just saw

284
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,680
that they

285
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,760
saved by going to a scrape system

286
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,760
equipment and labor costs reduced and

287
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,920
the centrifuge extraction

288
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,000
reduced the total annual cost by about

289
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,240
two thousand dollars a year so not it's

290
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,399
positive anyhow i guess it's pretty much

291
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,240
break even i i guess when you look at

292
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,240
the long-term in terms of the overall

293
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,279
cost of operating the farm when we went

294
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,399
to the

295
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,200
system that

296
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,800
with a smaller farm with access p that

297
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,279
we wanted to get rid of

298
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,519
uh use of the the

299
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:11,360
centrifuge we had to use it about eight

300
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:14,640
hours per day to extract the excess

301
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,720
surplus p okay the in this case

302
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:20,320
the model calculated that there was

303
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,399
around 16 500 pounds of p

304
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:25,040
that had to be removed from the farming

305
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:27,200
system to maintain a long-term balance

306
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,200
so operating it eight hours per day

307
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,160
increase the equipment electric energy

308
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,160
costs

309
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,160
with some small increases in facility

310
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,640
and labor costs to maintain the

311
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,480
equipment uh increase the annual manure

312
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,959
handling cost by

313
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:44,399
a little over or eighteen thousand

314
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:47,440
dollars a year so looking at what the

315
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,360
cost was to remove that pee

316
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,480
that comes out to a little over a dollar

317
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,480
a pound of pea removed from the farm so

318
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,800
you're ending up with this material that

319
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,279
really does have some pretty high value

320
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,200
as far as a pea fertilizer source and

321
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,600
maybe for other uses as well but

322
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,600
nevertheless the cost for remove for

323
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,720
producing that material is still more

324
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,959
than

325
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,519
the cost of just buying phosphate

326
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:14,399
fertilizers so perhaps for organic

327
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,720
markets and such you know it would be a

328
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,720
little bit more more economical so in

329
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,680
summary i guess use of the centrifuge

330
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,680
for pea extraction on the dairy farm

331
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,720
it really appears less feasible and

332
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,880
pretty

333
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,120
on economical when used with a flush

334
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,959
system just because of the sheer volume

335
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,160
of material that you have to re

336
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:36,880
continually recycle through the system

337
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,800
but with a scraped manure system

338
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,040
the increased extraction costs may be

339
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,040
more than offset by the reduced

340
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,800
transport costs you know we're looking

341
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,880
at these large farms where we have to

342
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:50,160
call it for long distances

343
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:53,040
as we saw it was it was economical to

344
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,760
to extract the peak by extracting

345
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,519
a significant portion of the p from the

346
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,920
from the manure you do end up with a

347
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,959
better end of p ratio in the remaining

348
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,360
manure

349
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:05,279
again it could be used close by where

350
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,000
you have this more concentrated pea that

351
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:10,800
can be transported longer distances more

352
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,040
efficiently and more cost effectively so

353
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,040
if you have excess phosphorus to get off

354
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,800
the farm you know centrifuge

355
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,720
provides a material with a high p

356
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,040
concentration that can be exported for

357
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,480
other uses but the cost of producing

358
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,240
that be if you're comparing it

359
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,560
particularly to fertilizer

360
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,880
you know it's it's not necessarily a win

361
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,600
but i mean again there's the organic

362
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,600
market and there's also more nutrients

363
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,040
left in this than just the phosphorus

364
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,120
too that we haven't really properly

365
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,120
accounted for so it does have more value

366
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,360
than just the phosphorus itself and of

367
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,480
course a cost that's really hard to put

368
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:48,000
a value on is the long-term potential

369
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:50,240
impact i guess of on eutrophication uh

370
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,839
you know so there is this long-term

371
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,639
reducing risk

372
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,639
you know for for eutrophicationary by by

373
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,320
pulling out extracting this phosphorus

374
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,240
and using it more efficiently so there's

375
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,639
a benefit to society there that's really

376
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,839
hard to put a value in so in conclusion

377
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,920
i guess this

378
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,079
this is primarily a research tool but we

379
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,720
feel it's it's it's a good tool that we

380
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,920
can be can be used to evaluate a wide

381
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,480
range of these different types of

382
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,639
technologies that can be used for this

383
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,639
particular study it had it was just

384
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,800
published in applied engineering and

385
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,959
agriculture if you'd like to look it up

386
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,959
and and get more detail on use of the

387
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:28,600
decanter centrifuge on a dairy farm

388
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,600
right thank you

389
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,760
is

390
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,360
the annualized capital cost on it on the

391
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,839
centrifuge and other equipment that was

392
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,839
being used

393
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:04,720
amortizing the the initial costs over

394
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,839
the lifetime of the equipment

395
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,680
and

396
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:11,680
putting that in with the annual cost

397
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:14,060
along with any electricity use and labor

398
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:20,690
total operating costs

399
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:20,690
