basis of pig farming the basis of peak

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,000
farming now uh I'm very much aware that

5

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,039
order to be successful in Peak farming

18
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,559
now I will start by saying this Pak

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:55,199
farming is very profitable if Done Right

20
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:59,399
Pak farming is very very profitable if

21
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,920
Done Right is one of the uh is is is a

22
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,879
business that assure you of that if you

profit massively very well if you do it

25
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,840
very right but uh the only issue is I

26
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,600
have met several Farmers that are not

27
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,439
doing this right and that's why we are

28
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,680

33
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,720
people getting into Pig farming and

34
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,040

story around Peak farming but very few

39
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:48,439
of those videos addresses the challenges

40
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,960

115
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,080

going to be don't feel it's going to be

119
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:52,919
a cake walk where you just uh leave your

00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,919
pigs in a pen and uh voila that's it and

121
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:57,080

123
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,440
that you have to understand about Pig

124
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,560

please the first question the first

128
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:11,120
mindset you have to ask yourself while

129
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,600
you're watching lots of videos on how

130
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,560
much money they made from p and

131
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,840
everything is to ask yourself are you

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,759
ready for this is it meant for you is it

133
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,960
something you are meant to do so that's

134
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:23,080
number one mindset number two is what's

135
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,039
your business plan you have to have a

136
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,080
business plan I think I've told you I've

137
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,800
been saying this in some um previous

138
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:32,160
videos I've been to certain fans and uh

139
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,360
honestly if those were the if those are

140
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,600
the people you look up to you would not

141
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,280
want to get into big fing because uh

142
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,199
they are not in business I can tell you

143
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,520
100% if you do good audit on their Farm

144
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,479
you would discover that these guys are

145
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,919
not in business they just have uh Farm

146
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,240
they just have their Farm they have

147
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,880
animals there but they are not in

148
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,000
business so you have to have a business

149
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,759
plan what's your business plan what do

150
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,680
you him to do now let me just walk you

151
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:58,039
through some certain mindsets around the

152
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,440
business plan you could have for

153
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:02,840
instance do you want to be a breeder

154
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,479
that means do you want to have breeders

155
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,880
on your farm do you want to be the

156
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:11,680
person that brings in uh that um

157
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:13,680
produces the piglet on your alone or do

158
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,039
you want to be a breeder and be a

159
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,560
partner that means do you want to pick

160
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,440
up the piglet also and also grow them to

161
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,319
maturity you have to have a business

162
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,240
plan you have to have a very solid

163
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:28,000
business plan what do you aim to do

164
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,880
don't just get there and just take PS

165
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,400
and just start wearing them yourself

166
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,520
what do you into there are different

167
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,400
aspect of this thing for some people now

168
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,280
all they do is buy the piglet they buy

169
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,240
the Piglet and they fix the piglet

170
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,319
somewhere they R them up in about 6

171
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,360
months after 6 months they dispose them

172
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,400
they get new piglets that's a business

173
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,560
plan so these guys those guys that do

174
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,919
such thing they are not interested in

175
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:55,280
having breeders at all all they

176
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:56,919
interested in is to have uh a reputable

177
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,720
breeder Farm where they will get their

178
00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:02,319
piglets from every uh every time they

179
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,960
they have in U they AA they available

180
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,680
and they interested in having and put

181
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,560
them in a pen get the feet feed them uh

182
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,639
take them to maturity and dispose them

183
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,080
that's a business plan or okay if you

184
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,840
don't want that plan probably you just

185
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,199
want to be a breeder alone that means

186
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,199
your own job is just to give pigl out to

187
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:20,520
other Farmers so all you have to do is

188
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:23,360
to have the Breeders the sa and the bo

189
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:25,440
uh and uh you call for Farmers

190
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,160
neighboring Farmers to pick piglets from

191
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,199
you every now and then there's a woman I

192
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,560
know that's literally what she's major

193
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:35,759
majored in uh recently on this Farm we

194
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:38,639
got Piglet from her from that a farm she

195
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,680
don't keep she hardly keeps any Pig till

196
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,560
6 month or or thereabout but she has

197
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,400
about I don't know how many uh female

198
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,319
pigs she has very great pigs very good

199
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,759
breed and uh she has the she has the T

200
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:52,919
and she has the Afric the South African

201
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,759
large white and she has a good B she

202
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:58,199
just has uh the pen she has is not it's

203
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,800
not a very big farm but at least she has

204
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:02,800
I think probably almost hat um breeder

205
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,000
females so all she do is produce the

206
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,319
piglets people come around pick the

207
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,360
piglets from her and that's great and

208
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:10,720
she's doing well uh we did the estimate

209
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,720
of how much you'll be making every year

210
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,479
she's making solid money there she's not

211
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,560
wearing anything up to 6 month she uh

212
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:20,720
after uh having the winners maybe um 5

213
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,840
weeks 6 weeks she disposes all of them

214
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,479
gets the Breeders ready for uh meeting

215
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:28,319
again and then get them uh bread and

216
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:30,879
then she makes new piglets again that's

217
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,719
a business plan okay and you can do both

218
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,200
you can decide to have your breeders

219
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:38,080
maybe you have four females and then you

220
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,360
decide to uh get piglets out of them

221
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,680
after you get piglets out of them you

222
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:46,320
raise the piglets to 6 months so in that

223
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:48,680
case now everything has to be well plant

224
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,240
don't go into this without having a

225
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:53,240
solid plant if not you would you would

226
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,440
just uh find yourself having lots of

227
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,480
Hard breaks because you will be you you

228
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,120
would be one of the people that would

229
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,279
get into P fing and get out a lot of

230
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,040
people call come in and get out in just

231
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,839
like how almost every other agricultural

232
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,720
Venture is lot of people delve in

233
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:08,160
especially when they watch lot of videos

234
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,160
and later on they get Del out because

235
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,440
they didn't have a plan so they were

236
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,240
they were not able to uh uh to face the

237
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,959
challenges that came with whatever they

238
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:20,040
were working with now I go with the next

239
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:22,160
mindset and that have a good budget uh

240
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,360
have a good budget you see your plan

241
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,720
your business plan must be dependent on

242
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,760
the budget you have you know one of the

243
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,320
reasons why you need to have a good

244
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:33,480
budget is for instance now you need to

245
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:36,880
know that uh Pig farming is capital

246
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,560
intensive these guys don't uh they don't

247
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,200
hit grasses like that you can't feed

248
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,440
them on grass like that just like the gr

249
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,000
grth growth farming where you could

250
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,519
literally get them to Grace on free

251
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,440
grasses and everything these guys you

252
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,560
have to house them housing them after

253
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,120
you're done housing them you have to

254
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,600
feed them in the morning in the

255
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,480
afternoon so it's a capital intensive

256
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:02,000
business so you have to be ready you

257
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:05,240
have to be ready for all these cost you

258
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,920
cannot get the pigs into your farm and

259
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:10,279
malnourish them and expect to be in

260
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,760
business have a good budget make sure

261
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:14,600
before you get into um P farming you

262
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:17,519
know what you are getting into you know

263
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,680
the cost you are getting into how much

264
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,440
will you need to raise a single Piglet

265
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,160
from 1 month to 6 months if you know how

266
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,360
much that is then you understand okay

267
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,480
how much do you have how much are you do

268
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,600
you have how much Capital do you have

269
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,519
available for you do you think you can

270
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,040
raise 10 piglets or do you think you can

271
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:37,560
raise 20 that should be what should be

272
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,240
your driving force your budget don't get

273
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,959
into this and just probably you just see

274
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,440
animals somewhere and they told you that

275
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:45,480
uh the animals are quite cheap and you

276
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,880
just feel oh I saw this opportunity let

277
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,519
me get 20 of them and you get 20 of them

278
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,160
and then you can't raise them and then

279
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,720
you are out of business and then you are

280
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,160
struggling and you're having real issues

281
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,079
and the pigs can't eat and they are

282
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,920
catching diseases and they are not

283
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:03,880
attaining the right kg uh a pig I know

284
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:06,560
of a farmer that sold his pigs after I

285
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:09,200
think over 6 months those pigs did not

286
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:12,880
some of those pigs did not weigh 50 kg

287
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:16,519
after 6 months after over 6 months pigs

288
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,720
did not weigh uh 50 kg I don't know if

289
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:20,639
you of course if you're aspiring people

290
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,959
you may not understand how terrible that

291
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:25,480
is but you see this P you're looking at

292
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:28,480
in this video on this Farm they are less

293
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:30,560
than they uh more like let me just say

294
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,320
about 3 months on this Farm they are

295
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:36,600
weighing some of them will be weighing

296
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:41,040
if not at least probably 40 kg already

297
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:43,600
and somebody had uh pigs for over 6

298
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,880
months and could not attain maybe I

299
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,519
think maybe he got 48 kg or thereabout

300
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,720
in some of them or 46 or there about and

301
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:52,600
he has been keeping these PS for a lot

302
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,760
of time that's exactly what I'm saying I

303
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,240
have a good brother no exactly what

304
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,959
you're getting into because you need to

305
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,800
plan for the right feet you can't plan

306
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:01,000
for wrong feet you can't plan for just

307
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,959
pkc so that's why I'm telling you please

308
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,320
have a right budget so that you won't

309
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:08,920
get out of business soon enough number

310
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:11,839
four start small grow big start small

311
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:15,760
grow big please you need to know this if

312
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:20,120
you have uh a lot of money to raise uh

313
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:22,519
maybe 100 PS I beg you don't go for 100

314
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,720
PS initially if you a new pig farmer

315
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:28,160
please decide to go for a little number

316
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,959
first no matter how much resources you

317
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,000
have available to you please start small

318
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,920
and Grow Big there is a reason for that

319
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,760
it's not it's not money is not the only

320
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,320
issue in pig farming you need to

321
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,760
understand management management is also

322
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,120
very important you need to understand

323
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,680
there are challenges that may come to

324
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,399
heat to to to your farm your location

325
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,399
may have some certain uh challenges that

326
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,800
you may not be aware of some certain

327
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,880
things that you may not be aware of you

328
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,079
may have issues with your workers you

329
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:57,120
you may have issues with your water

330
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,920
supply so it may not just be that oh you

331
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,240
didn't have money that was why your farm

332
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:03,240
had issues it could be some other things

333
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,519
that you have no power over and that's

334
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,279
why I'm saying start small and grow big

335
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,440
if you have the money I would advise you

336
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,399
that no matter how much money you have

337
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,680
make sure you don't start with more than

338
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:15,000
10 females honestly that's even so much

339
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,480
imagine having 10 females on your farm

340
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,560
if those females give B you could

341
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,800
literally have 100 piglets from just one

342
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,800
bet in like uh 4 months in 4 month time

343
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:26,040
if you bring in matur females on your

344
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:29,760
farm you could have you could literally

345
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:32,160
have 100 piglets in 4 months and that's

346
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,720
a lot of money if you if you consider

347
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,079
breeding those guys still 6 months so

348
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,880
you need to be very much ready for

349
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:42,600
whatever you are going into but please

350
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:45,519
start small and grow big number five

351
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,880
focus on your hyals improve structures

352
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,480
later now I understand the importance of

353
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:52,120
structures in Peak farming I want you to

354
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,839
know that I understand it I understand

355
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,560
the importance of a very solid structure

356
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,720
and I'm not saying you should build a

357
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:00,680
less solid structure but be very careful

358
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,920
of not going into of designs and all

359
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,560
these things initially of course when

360
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,440
you make great profit on it you can go

361
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,120
on to making a lot of improvement in

362
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:11,199
your structures you can go on to um

363
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,399
building with using high on and all

364
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,800
those things but if you an intending Pak

365
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:17,040
farmer and your budget is not very large

366
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,880
of course if you have the money you can

367
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,880
go for good structures and of course it

368
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:24,279
would not mean anything to you but if

369
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,880
you are having to if you are having to

370
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:29,399
uh J stose between your animals or your

371
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:32,560
structures I would advise you every time

372
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:36,000
anytime every day that you should focus

373
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:38,079
on your animals focus on their feet

374
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,440
focus on their drugs on their medication

375
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,680
focus on their water supply focus on

376
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,880
those things don't Focus so much on if

377
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,680
you look around this F see some people

378
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,680
use you you could have seen some of our

379
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:53,160
videos where we made use of bamboo

380
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:55,279
sticks to do the uh the partitioning see

381
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:57,079
those animals are doing fine inside of

382
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,199
course that's not the best that's not

383
00:14:57,079 --> 00:15:01,000
the best structure of you if you you

384
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,800
could if you could look at let me try

385
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,560
and show you if you can look at this if

386
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:08,720
you can look over there you would see

387
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:12,480
Woods being used to partition the uh the

388
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:15,000
um pen over there of course if you if

389
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,279
you have money spend the money but I

390
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,480
would advise you if you are if you have

391
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,880
to Jose between what you should spend

392
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,880
your money on your animals or the

393
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,959
structure focus on the animals you can

394
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:28,240
use l you you need to learn how to

395
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:30,639
improvise you need to learn how to be

396
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,600
resourceful do lots of things with uh

397
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,880
materials around you don't Focus too

398
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,560
much on I need to make everything solid

399
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,560
with cement the cement bags are very

400
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,959
expensive so if you can do anything with

401
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,920
whatever resources you have around you

402
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:45,000
please do it and focus on your animal

403
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,680
health focus on them eating properly

404
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,920
focus on them eating the right amount of

405
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,199
protein focus on all those things and

406
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,480
you will never get it wrong in Peak

407
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:54,560
farming so please focus on your animals

408
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,440
improve structures later if need be

409
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,319
number six as I said already just to

410
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:01,079
emphasize on it be resourceful try and

411
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:02,959
on certain things you don't have to

412
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:04,800
always spend money you don't have to

413
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:08,480
always spend money it's not every time

414
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:11,120
you have to look for uh the most modern

415
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:14,959
way of handling something be uh

416
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:17,839
resourceful try and improvise try and uh

417
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:19,720
get uh things around your area try and

418
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:23,199
look for things that would lessen your

419
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:27,319
cost the aim for a good business uh uh

420
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:30,199
activity is for you to have lessened

421
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:32,160
cost so that your your your profit can

422
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:35,800
come out from there you don't have to

423
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,839
spend too much on your business so

424
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,600
instead of you running around looking

425
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,639
for the most modern thing right here you

426
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,399
can see we're using the wallo system I

427
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,759
so much love the nipple Drinker I

428
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:50,160
believe you have seen an improvised uh

429
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,199
way of doing n Drinker that was released

430
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:55,079
uh some some you should have seen it in

431
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:57,279
one of our videos on how to uh improvise

432
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:58,920
the new Drinker using a bucket those are

433
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,639
some of the things I'm talking about you

434
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:03,679
you need to find a way around all these

435
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:06,880
things don't be too focused on spending

436
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:08,520
money uh on just everything you need to

437
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,839
learn how to be resourceful

438
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:13,000
resourcefulness is the ultimate resource

439
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:15,600
resourcefulness is the ultimate resource

440
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,799
so number seven market research cannot

441
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,760
be overemphasized your market research

442
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:20,919
if you are new to PE farming I

443
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,120
understand you may have seen so many

444
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:26,720
things on the media talking about all

445
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:29,200
you need to uh understand about uh uh

446
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,559
Peak farming and how much uh it has good

447
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,280
But please understand your location and

448
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:36,640
understand what your location

449
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:41,280
needs you need to make sure that your

450
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:42,840
location is in demand for this thing

451
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,799
don't be too carried away with what you

452
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,559
see on the internet market research

453
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:48,760
cannot be overemphasized before you get

454
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:51,559
into into Peak farming go around your

455
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:55,480
area and find out what's the demand for

456
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:57,679
paks in your area and what size are they

457
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,480
are they in demand for what do people

458
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,320
need what do people require

459
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,640
are people searching for the piglet so

460
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:05,720
before you think about going into

461
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,840
breeders Farm ask yourself is are people

462
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:10,559
is the demand for piglet in your area is

463
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,440
it very solid you have lots of farmers

464
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,640
looking for piglet before you decide to

465
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,320
be a breeder farmers and ask yourself

466
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,440
also if you want to R till 6 month like

467
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:21,640
what's the number what's the number of

468
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,320
pigs that you think you will be able to

469
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:26,200
dispose in a month so that you don't

470
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:28,960
have 100 Pigs and the demand is 50 so

471
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,720
you I understand that in some places the

472
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,880
has not been met But be sure that that's

473
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,640
the case in your area ask yourself where

474
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,559
are you locating your farm and how long

475
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,000
how what will you what will it take for

476
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:41,600
you to transport your animals from your

477
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,880
farm to wherever the market is you know

478
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,360
obviously markets will be somewhere

479
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,360
somewhere but do you have the right

480
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,720
resources to transport your animals from

481
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,280
where you are if there there are no

482
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,919
markets in your area to where Market is

483
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,400

need to do is just to get pigs and put

490
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,000

cattles all dead I've seen it before you

598
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:58,520

599
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,720
to the to inject the animals and killed

600
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:02,799
several of their goats I that happened

601
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,840
recently in a certain Farm several of

602
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,760
their goats di those are not things that

603
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,520
came because the guys were not expact or

604
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,320
because they did not put everything

605
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:12,760
right it's just some of the things you

606
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:16,159
just need to pray about and uh and trust

607
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:17,159
