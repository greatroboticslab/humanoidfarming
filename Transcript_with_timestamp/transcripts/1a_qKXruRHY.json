name and your CCA we'll make sure that you get recorded well in our presentation today we want to cover three main topics the first will be evaluating plant stands followed by weed identification control by Kirk howt he's uh in the department of plant science NSU and the final speaker will be Blake vandor uh with Ducks Unlimited we'll talk about disease and nitrogen management I think after uh Kirk's um presentation we'll certainly take time for him to answer some questions he'll have to leave um if I finish in good time I might take a few questions on my section but uh please feel free to hold questions to the end as well uh we'll take whatever time needs we do plan to finish in general terms after an hour so I'm Joel Ransom extension Agonist for serial crops my uh part of my presentation I want to talk about evaluating plant stands and as you all know having a good stand in the spring is key to a productive winter wheat crop and I've got a glow graph there that shows the relationship of percent winner survival and yield and so ultimately we want to have a reasonable plant stand so we can work with the question is how much do we really need and what are some of factors that are going to affect survival and I think this is one of the reasons we want to talk about this today is because uh we did make we did start uh our winter wheek crop last fall in pretty poor conditions but the factors that are going to impact the amount of winter survival are going to be the environment um we have little or no control over that temperature at the crown is probably the most definitive of environmental factors that we're going to talk about the second would be the state of hardening uh which is a time of year we'll talk a little more detail about that the briy S and the size and bigger of the plant and the fall so these will be the four main factors that are going to be uh influencing the amount of winter survival that we have and if we look at the the general graph that was indic to what temperatures our plants can tolerate cold you can see this top graph uh is some data from Kansas State we see that we start uh as the plant is emerging it is not able to tolerate cold it's kind of like spring weed in that state and as we go through a period of cold it will harden off and it gets to the point where it will be able to withstand cold temperature down to about 10\u00b0 fah minus 10\u00b0 fah and it will persist in that level of winter hardiness uh until about February and at that point the reserves uh start to diminish and it becomes more susceptible to coal and we see that as we move into to much uh where we are now the ability to withstand cold is is significantly reduced and it's not uncommon to have plant stands that had made it through the winter up to this point actually be lost when you have go through a cycle of treason and thigh and you can see that there's a pretty wide band of of uh of temperatures that can be tolerated it really depends on the of plant the the reserves in the plant the variety of its own and the kinds of fluctuation of temperature so it's pretty hard to predict precisely what kind of you know uh what what the plant is going to be able to to withstand let me just uh review with you some data from last year this was a winter survival model that was put up in Canada just one to they don't actually get to see the mouse come through there okay so if you want that's okay you want in here and and that Arrow will move around all right so last year sorry about that little uh intervention it was a hopefully a use one I was having all kinds of fun with my cointer and you weren't seeing it but last year we did have a winter of wheat survival model was very descriptive in in kind of showing how the winter wheat plant uh tolerates cold and uh and depending on the variety you can see that like Falcon and and seator were able to tolerate just about minus four Fahrenheit and as you get further into the spring uh you can see that there were cases where we actually had winter kill as a result of plant being less winter hardy and and temperature being too cold for it to survive we look briefly at where we're at here this is some data that John nosky has been recording and the top this top graph shows the winter Golden Valley and U if we look at the uh [Music] the soil temperatures under a short stubble we can see that certainly the temperatures are less haven't captured as much snow but in general I would say that those temperatures none of them are below what we would say as a critical Lev level for winter winter kill we go to Cass County the the bottom graph you can see that we have had some uh temperatures so temperatures I think these are about 1 inch depth where our Crown would likely be down 10 degrees but again probably because of the snow cover we've had that our temperatures at least in these areas haven't been excessively low so we have to be too concerned about winter kill yet um I talked about variety being important and this is these are some data I collected in 2003 and four that I haven't been able to replicate it was a perfect year for having some we and uh looking at the soybean residue you can see that our variey coming from More Southern locations we we have a very high level of mortality uh whereas uh with a little bit of snow cover under the seats we residue all of our varieties were able to tolerate winter and so variety choice is really critical and I know we've introduced a lot of Southern kind of winter wheat varieties in into our system and so this might be a year um where we see some of those failing because of the lay planting and other factors where in the last couple years we've had really good survival because of the snow cover and other things I mentioned the size of the plant going into the fall can have an impact on the winter hardiness and here's just an example of uh you know very late planted small plants very few reserves it's going to have less ability to tolerate prolong Cal than this plant up here and and you can actually plant too early and have too big a plant generally we don't have that problem in North Dakota very often because by the time you get in and plant that recommended date you don't get a plant that's much bigger than kind of that what that first one looks like so I think this is one of the issues we're a little concerned about we had very late emergence because we planted late got the rains didn't come until much later than normal and and so um we probably have the plant that just kind of set set there and very where got to start so let's talk about what constitutes a reasonable stand uh you want to go out and count several areas um uh probably I've mentioned two foot length probably 5 foot would be more uh realistic and you want to do it in representative areas of the field you may have some parts of the field where you have big gaps and you w't count those differently than say uh other more normal Fields you want to evaluate for Vigor and we have a kind of a general recommendation that we can tolerate plant stands down to as low as five plants per foot I mean that's probably on our lower end for winter weat if you compare that to Sprint you can see that we can tolerate about half the stand that we can with winter wheat or with spring wheat um here's just some data uh showing you uh that bottom graph would be coming from Mandan that you really start to see a yield reduction when the plant stand is below probably seven or eight but we probably are able to to maintain yield sufficient to make it profitable to keep that stand if even when we're in that CL plants per square foot range um this is some data that I showed you previously showing you the relationship between yield and plant stand and here you know we had down as low as 20% survival this would have been kind of a objective subjective evaluation uh that we were getting up to 60 bushes which would indicate that you'd probably want to hang on to that um some other data this is put together by Steve dorak looking at uh some of the you know a range of of varieties over a number of years uh and you can see that again probably about that 30 to 40% uh stand in the spring is going to be a critical level uh where you want to keep it uh versus where you want to think about uh chilling it up and planning something else I'm G to skip the slide and that slide but basically just showing you the same relationships as you get into that 55 and above is not so problematic but what this is might be what your field will look like in the spring if you're evaluating your plant stand and you can see that in this case the leaves have all burned off and and you know some years we keep green leaves throughout the winter but uh just because leaves have been frosted off doesn't mean plant is dead have a really nice technique for determining uh quickly whether your plants are dead out there you can dig them up nice to wash the dirt off clip back uh The Leaf tips put them in a bag keep it warm and and usually within 24 hours you can you can see something emerging if you don't need by two days then you can be a little bit wored you can see in this case a nice little grein shoot starting to emerge after probably after 24 hours so in summary I think our Optimum for winter wheat would be to have a stand in that 20 to 25 plants per square foot uh but stands between 12 and 15 per square foot or more than adequate most years and stands as low as even five per square foot have yielded well if feel if conditions are conducive to tiller development and you want to consider how uniform the stand is across the fields uh certainly you can have big patches and it's not uncommon to have big patches where you lose stand and other parts that be normal um and you may have to develop a strategy for how to fill in those patches not a good idea to leave patch is just a wheat others have plants and spring wheat but you can imagine the challenges of also harvesting two classes of weed at the same time and so you know you kind of have to have a strategy in place as to how you might handle those patches I think the bag test is really useful for they a little worried about whether they their crop made it or not and it's as simple as going and getting a few plants taking the dirt off soil off the plants cutting back the tissue and and observing any regrowth um this this fall as I mentioned previously we planted late the plants got emerging late and so these small ceilings are very difficult to evaluate um they're going to take some while before they'll start to emerge and Sh green and I think the message here would be we'll probably have to be patient and and see how things get going once we have the snow mes and temperatures uh we don't want to dis up a crop that's that in a week later will show some real uh grein and vigor and I think their question that might have coming our way is the Vernal vernalization take place in this late planted material and I think that most folks that I've talked to would say it's very unusual that we didn't get enough inition and and start the germination process in the fall and maybe even this spring if that's the case we won't we won't have enough accumulated cold weather to do vernalization so I I don't think that's going to be as big a concern as whether we actually have an adequate adequate stand in the spring so with that uh I think I'm kind of probably have time for one question if somebody wants to ask a question then I'll turn it over to for the uh topic on WE control and identification I can't see any hands up there I think KK turn it over thanks Joel good morning everybody this work in here Joel and Blake had asked me to come in and talk a little bit about the wheat control especially the winter annual wheed complex and I had opportunity to stick a few other things in there as well especially towards the end some of you may have been involved with the kosher monitoring the sample collection ctions that we did over the winter and I've got some information there relative to glyphosate as well as the response of the plant samples to floxy here I think we you know thinking about winter wheat and definitely the winter annual grass complex is causes conations for all kinds of people TR sheet being a species that we don't see in North Dakota very often definitely more of a Mont 10 a weed but areas where it is an issue it definitely is occurs in enough population to where it definitely reduces yield and as you can see the the heads there kind of describe those as a an open football shape as opposed to Japanese ver be looking at a little bit relatively little pubescence on the leaf tissue membranous short membran is Lial and if we compare that with Japanese bro Japanese bro does have a very short liil it has a very dense mat of hairs along the the sheath of the leaf as well as airs on Leaf surface itself on the blade still fairly small so it's not easy it's not like yellow fox tail where you see those very long straggly hairs at the base of the leaf blade but it creates a shroud around the plants so you can see plants kind of have a Halo up to them or a gall and as you see this in this next slide that dense mat very very heavily pubescent and the amount of pubescence is related to the temperature regime that it's been exposed to as well as some of the environmental conditions related to moisture so have very densely pubescent you can have fairly sparse pubescent but they tend to be quite long relative to the to relative to the Downey BR surface and then with the seat head there you can see it's more of a compact football shape the Floric individual seeds do not open up nearly as much as as true sheet but Downey bro is really the the one that causes us all of our problems North Dakota it is more difficult to control with herbicides and is able to germinate and emerge in the spring along with Japanese and easily produ seed talked briefly previously about vernalization of winter wheat crop that can have that needs to happen with these plants as well and and even the cooler spring temperatures at in the evenings is enough to initiate seed production for these plants so just because it emerges late in the spring doesn't necessarily you're going to avoid seed production this also has a dense sheath paars but they're quite a bit shorter and I think the entire field of the plant has a lot more of a velvety touch Downey brone tends to be a little bit more prone to the purple coloration that's brought on by the C through the winter and you can see dowy bro in wheat The Tint of purple coloration reddish coloration and then also one of the seeds with the long on that will give the dowy Bro inflorescence a much more feathery appearance as you see on the right as opposed to the tight clusters the football shaped thas of the Japanese bro seed fls dowy bro like I said before is definitely more difficult to controll in Japanese brome and when it establishes in the fall to wait until the spring it can create very difficult control situations it is controlers tends to be more metal in the fall the plants are smaller they haven't initiated as many tillers and there's just not as much tissue to try to get controlled with the herbicide control options before the wi is in the ground of course include glyphosate which has provided very exceptional control and we do have two products LI or prepair that are registered before wheat and both of those can provide some suppression I would not necessarily expect complete full season control but they will help reduce the early season competition so that you have smaller plants later on with postemergence treatment as far as post Emer then if you have clear field wheat Beyond is definitely a good option and I've also found Olympus power Flex to be very good options for control of these winter anual PRS Maverick can provide a very good level of control however in North Dakota with our high soy we definitely have issues with carryover as there probably not a lot of Maverick used except for areas where you know that you're going to be coming back to cereals in The Following season and then Cera for Everest ribf fire Max do provide good suppression and if the plants are small enough will provide adequate control of Downy broom and those are strong enough to they should provide excellent control of the Japanese broom foxtail barley is another plant that's becoming an issue throughout the state and in the seing stage it is very small very thin leaves also has puesd along the leaf sheath but the leaf blades are a bit narrower and at the seeding stage is when you really need to control this because as a perennial once it truly establishes it is difficult to control with anything and when we get to that stage for the Post emergence treatments Olympus uh has provided the best activity can kill some of the plants but more there we're just trying to prevent suction for the following seasons and other products tend to be a little bit weaker on it power Flex I haven't had enough experience to know whether it controls well or not perley lettuce would be one of the broadleaf winter annuals look like dandelion if you turn the leaf over you have the long row of of spiny growths off the mid rib prickle lettuce is a composite species it is controlled very effectively by by many of the growth Regulators but especially poiry type products such as ctail CM o White match horse weed I see my Z fell down below as they moveed from one system to the other but horse weed is comom a larger issue in North Dakota because of the resistance that has developed to glyphosate we have confirmed that in Cass County there are other areas of L more Pierce and Macintosh for samples have come in where we suspect there could be some resistance C been tested yet with the without use of glyphosate really on controlling young rosettes plant growth regulators and ALS Inhibitors at those early growth stages tend to be fairly effective fi Penny Crest we get into the on the mustard side of things recognized by the penny shaped seed pods that enclose the seeds it takes off very early in the spring and ALS Inhibitors are very effective even once this plant starts to Bol another couple of other mustard family Tans and mustard flicks meat and very finely divided leaves and they're also control at the early rosette stages is important for control so that it does not extend to the stage flowers are being produced you may still be able to get control with ALS Inhibitors especially with with combination of a phoxy type herbicide but control definitely starts to get more limited comparing this with a perennial this is false chamomile false chamomile once it is established as a perennial again very difficult to control combinations of ALS products plus a phoxy have done quite well but a lot of the herbicides used in cereals that are based on contact type products will not be very effective on this weed there we see false C meal once it starts to flower you get that typical daisy flower head on it the other thing that I wanted to talk about for a little bit was the kosher monitoring we have several fields that people sent in samples last year this was initiated because we had two specific sites one up in Pierce County and one in the corner of stutzman County that glyphosate resistance was suspected in 2011 through Greenhouse testing we did that both of these locations had very elevated level of resistance where even a gallon more than a gallon of Power Max was not controlling all of the plants and compared with that with 11 ounces that would control every plant in the susceptible check definitely indicated that we had a problem the same seed block was we've treated with Clarity and staran Ultra trying to identify some of the other control options that might be available for cereals and we were not pleased with the response indicating here definite survival and very vigorous growth after full labeled rates of clarity even in corn or the starting rate the high use rate 5.7 fluid ounces was not killing all of the plants so we had several samples coming in from around the state mostly from the eastern half as you can see on the map here we did have a few Coosa samples coming in from the Far Western I95 Corridor and these were seated into two pots in the greenhouse we had a susceptible check in the upper right hand corner and resistance check in the lower leftand corner and spraying these pot with glyphosate a typical response and more than 50% of the populations were controlled easily with that standard rate of Power Max the Green in the corner there of course with the or the resistant check from Pierce County but we did have several of the flats that had different amounts of regrowth depending on if it was a 1x or essentially a 3X rate in some of those pots the control was almost non-existent we also sprayed all of the with for ox up here and typical response before Ox appear would not be complete plant death but these plants that are very injured however can start to recover after a couple of weeks and start to produce growth this is a serious concern for our late season weed management because those plant that remain down to the canopy all season long once you remove the wheat canopy they can start to produce new choots and produce several thousand seeds per plant even after harvest so on the kosa side of things what are some of the other options we do have very effective use of glyphosate or thox appear still in much of the state however we do have thox Pier looking as well as it should from essentially every area where wece samples in those areas and cereals of course will rely on Buck tril with either peroxyl any kind of verox CAC product seems to be working quite well yet in other crops where you can use atrazine that has been very effective po Inhibitors the aim is very effective in crop if the plants again are less than two inches tall sharpen Can Be an Effective pre-plant burndown at it's a moderate use rate however we cannot expect very much soil residual from sharpen for managing kosher into the season essentially it comes down to making sure that you don't have plants there when your crop is established and trying to manage those emerging plants before they get Beyond about three Ines in height with with the sweet products that we have available I know there's a lot of areas that are listening are probably no till or minimum till but cold hard steel is still probably the most effective and reliable oan management tool tool because of the short soil residual of the seed and the susceptibility of the plants to cultivation I believe that might be the end of my slide set so if you have any questions you might be able to answer some on issues or other topics that might be pressing in your mind see a couple on there that I recognize good morning everybody doesn't look like we have many questions coming in I will be able to stick around for a little while so maybe if you type in questions for me as as Blake is doing some of his discussion then before I have to leave I can still maybe answer those thanks Joel Kurt and I want to thank NDSU and particularly Scott for uh helping coordinate uh the webinar and and for all support we've had in in the promotion of it let's see oops I went back up to one didn't IO start over [Music] still still oh got be right in here okay here we go yeah so you can click on the name Arrow just one by one all right thanks let's get started here and try to move uh rather quickly if I can and what we're going to talk about a little bit this morning is a little bit on nitrogen management and then some on on disease management some of the research that we've been doing with NDSU and SDSU and ourselves if we just look at at that first slide you're you're taking a look at there The Soil Test Plus the applied in and this is over trials be conducted in North Central Northeast South Dakota and then through the central range of of North coot all the way from Crosby to to Jamestown to Allendale kind of on that kind of a line and probably about 80 to 100 miles either side of it and what you'll see there is you you look at the maximum levels were probably coming someplace between 180 and 20 120 pounds of total available and uh if you look at at John LC's data from North East North Dakota you'll see that from 2009 to 2011 since John has started working on winter week you'll see it probably pretty close to that same amount of nitrogen uh maybe slightly higher on on the top end uh the one thing that was was kind of interesting and when we added the 2012 data into the DU sites we added another five locations and you'll that that bottom line is is shifted a little bit to the left to a little bit less nitrogen and the reason for that we believe is if you remember the winter was open we were warm most of the winter and then March was about 15 degrees noral and we think there was probably quite a bit of extra conversion going on in the soils from the organic matter and so we had actually two sites that responded to end additional end we had two sites that that showed no response to additional end once we got to that per 60 Bush yeld goal plane and then we had one site where actually every level of end that we added decreased yield further and that was due to the fact that the additional end caused lodging so the more end we put on the more lodging we had and the lower the yields became with that nitrogen and we we knew that to be the case uh through Farm experience and and past yield experiences but in actually now in the 13 years we've been doing these trials this is the first year we've been able to document it in trial setting and so that that does happen so if we look at the amount of nitrogen talking with Ron gelderman South Dakota State SDSU is still at 2 and a half pounds NDSU is is at still at 2 and a half pounds per bushel axal nitrogen and uh they're working on new wrecks some data that we've been using in our DU studies from ARS that was conducted for a long period of time winter weat at Mandan North cord at Sydney Montana was was 2.25 pounds of M for bushel for 12% protein we're pretty comfortable with that we think at some point in time hopefully with more data we'll actually be able to reduce that number further and I think as some of these new breeding programs and techniques come online now you'll start to see groups focus on greater efficiency with nitrogen as well in these new Vari one thing I just wanted to point out I I showed this slide last year is that we just need to remember and working with our producers or if you are prod producer is that winter wheat has a higher yield potential than the spring seated Wheats by 20 to 30% so you need to take that into account when you design your nitrogen programs for this spring or if you've already done it last fall uh the other thing that remember in that is I think winter week probably can get by with that quarter pound less per Bushell than than the spring grains can so you do gain some efficiencies there but probably not enough to make up the fact that you need to add more into to your wi week to attain those yields uh one thing is is we talked about the maximum end needed for for maximum yield to be in that 180 to 220 230 range obviously economics play an impact on that and what that Final End rate will actually be and you can see on this slide I'm going to see if I can make this point at work over on the left side you've got four and and $6 wheat so you got two sets of lines obviously if you got higher priced wheat you can afford to put more nitrogen on on uh on the crop the other thing that you've got is is if you look on the the far right you've got 50 Cent In which is the blue lines and the 75 cent which is the green lines with the $6 we so the cost van is going to impact where those where that line is at the other issue that you have is the in protein discounts or notebook or and and no protein discounts obviously if you're you're looking at the where there's there's no discount on the protein on the top or the blue we reach our maximum end level at an earlier stage but if you have discounts you you'll notice then that that you actually need more nitrogen to to reach your uh top net profit potential for the winter week so you can take a look at this slide more and and as we uh will post these our websites at NDSU and and du and study these a little bit but uh they're they're kind of interesting and someday hope we can can develop a a table that will allow us to plug in the discounts plug in the the cost of the nitrogen the cost and the price of the wheed and and be able to predict more closely the amount end that we should probably be looking at on a given year if we look at placement uh Steve pulled together some data for me uh from our last two years of of end trials that incorporate timing as well and you'll note that there's really no difference in yield from the seating time application will replace the end B of the soil surface to the the surface applications of 28% with stream bars and so if you look at it which would be breaking dormy and then we've got the combination of seating plus which is the Ura down uh below the surface at seating times long with the early stream bar and then the last one is the seating with the late stream bar you can see there's there's less than a bushel difference in those over the 2-year period and this follows a very similar pattern to the number that we generated from 04 to through 07 in North and South coota in our Tri if we look at the proteins this pattern of the last two years in our end trials follows that that same time span in North and South Dakota when we did 04 to8 but that that ball seating application actually uh does have a tendency to have a little less protein than than the spring applic and it generally runs anywhere from 3/10 all the way up to 6/10 less uh than the spring applications and I I think that that graph basically tells you to that the more n you put on the later you put it on the higher the protein levels will be just uh one site this year where we we did see response to the full rate of nitrogen rates was at Crosby North Dakota and we had application versus spring application and then nitrogen rates as well but if you look at treatments in two three and four on the left those were Ura out seating time placed in a deep band and then N5 six and seven were stream bars uh N2 was a 60 bushel yield goal rate three was 85 and four was 110 and five six and seven were corresponding to one thing you'll note was that there was probably slightly higher yield to the fall application with the Ura when you average those three at 91.5 versus the the stream bar in at 89.5 statistically obviously not different but we were noticing that pretty consistently this year we think that was probably due to the fact that we had the urita placed below ground we we did not have we did have excess moisture obviously following seating and and during the course of this growing season and where we looked at the uan sometimes the rainfall didn't come following the uan application for anywhere from two to four weeks following U applications so there was some delay in in availability of the the U and if you look at the proteins on the right hand side you'll note that with the ining fertilizer rates within the n234 and then within the n56 7 you'll see increasing levels of protein which you would expect the other thing again just showing the protein on the right the average of 11.6% for the Ura in the ball versus the 12.2% for the uan in the spring just pointing out to the fact that some spring nitrogen has the ability to increase your protein LS for you then looking at at our watery stage nitrogen application in other words applying 10 gallons of 28% with 10 gallons of water for a total of 20 gallons per Acer with a with a flat fan nozzle uh trying to increase your proteins right after flow but before the kernel leaves that watery stage and hasn't re reached the milk stage but if you look at the yields of the uh let me get the pointer here comparing the the watery stage and versus the no watery stage and you can see that the yields were identical in some cases depending on how the applications go some people do worry about the water stage application reducing yields due to Leaf burn but we did not have any issue with that the last two years if you look at the at the apprach levels on the right side you'll note that for the 60 Bush yield goal when you increase those nitrogen levels for the 85 Bush we increase the amount of protein from 12.1 to 13.1 and uh you can see that that similar Trend under the no watery stage uh nitrogen applications or excuse me with no actual application at the lottery stage you can see that the increased levels of an increas the protein but I think the important thing here is if you look at the the yellow shaded area in the bottom the watery stage application gave 12.8% potation versus none at 11.7 for the average so we picked almost a full point of protein up this year from that application last year those numbers were at about a half percent we look at some some information that Ron gelderman shared with us in December and want to thank Ron for these Ron had done some trials with ESN on Ura and its influence on on winter week yield the thing that that I want to point out as you'll notice these are two locations Fort pier and wall and you can see there are some tremendous yields at at Pier and 102 with the fall application of your in 107 with the spring application of your in the thing that you'll notice though is he added the ESN they were both 102 and with that spring application he lost about five bushels and you'll see that he lost eight bush with a spring application uh at wall and my guess is is that this was 100% ESN treated Ura that that ESN that Ura to a point where it didn't benefit yield then you noticed in in the next slide that you'll see that the the protein levels actually increased a little bit and that would probably fit that reasoning then is that the ESN held that that nitrogen so if you're going to use ESN with your winter weat uh application just remember winter week needs that nitrogen early you're probably definitely not going to want to put 100% youra spread out there in the spring of the year on your winter we we look at this this next slide looking at aggain this was some work that John lukach has done uh up in Northeast North Dakota he actually had six sites in in 2010 and 2011 and I I dropped the one site I was a little uncomfortable with with the gray the the URI agotan was had had dropped its yield pretty substantially I think it's one of those outlier type situations uh but at any rate you can you can take a look at the yields at the various locations for 10 and 11 and you know in in several cases there's no difference in yield but in two or three cases there are some some differences in yield and if you look at the averages on the far right you can see the Ura was was basically 80 buels the Ura plus agane was 83.8 or about 84 and then the ammonium nitrate is not to have any volatility because it's it's 100% nitrate had 83.3 so it's kind of a check to to the agrian um as John says it's not meant to work every year because you hope you're going to get rain that Ura on the surface and it's going to take it in and I agree with John so it's in those circumstances where maybe like in 2012 we apped the Ura early we had an early spring we didn't get any rainfall for two to four weeks so you'd hope expect to see a response I know on some of the trials that we did in 2012 we did not see a response uh to the agine and again I think it went back to the fact that we were getting sub of organic matter uh that we uh it wasn't an issue I think this is probably the most important thing I'm going to show in my portion of the slides today Joel talked about stands and stage of winter week and if you look at the the top leftand picture uh you'll notice that the development here is is from below the soul surface all the way up to one Le stage and this was actually in the1 at our Min not location at Windfield and then if you look at the bottom slide on on the right this was actually a little foul strip plot area that that hadn't been seated the prior year we seated right through those areas you can see we had two and a half Lea whe there versus the stage that we had one of the things that we tell Growers is our goal is is to have approximately 50 to 70 in per square foot when we come to that Harvest stage now obviously if if we're seating and we're seating at rates of 25 to 35 plants per square foot we're going to need to make up some time here so we're going to need to want to encourage some King and so we're going to want to probably put some nitrogen on early uh to enhance that the chillery prospect so if you look at the the two pitchers in the two corners we got good Viger on the field on the left but we got very poor Vigor on the field on the right and what you want to do is just as soon as you can traffic that field once the frost is out you probably to get 15 to 25 pounds of an on some point Ura or or 28% or whatever form you can get it on and hopefully get some rain and help stimulate the children just thing I'm going to cover now is just a little bit on on disease management and mainly it's on on funas site timing applications and and on response in 2012 we saw the least response we've seen in the past three to four possibly five years uh to fungicide application as you recall it was dry early so can spot wasn't a big issue and scab was not a big issue we did have some stripe rust in some locations in the Eastern Dakota uh but you can see that in our 2012 variety trials which are scattered across North and South Dakota we had a 3.8 Bush response across all varieties that obviously varied from location to location and from variety to variety with about a 5% return increase in yield I should say we looked at 2009 it was a 10.2 bushel response and about 15% increase in yield uh 2010 was a 14.2 bushel with about a 20% response and 2011 was was a 12.9 or 13 bushel with about a 24% increase and and so we look at that average across all those years with 12 included it's been about a 10 bushel response with about a 15% increase in John gas and data I'm not going to go through this slide but I just wanted to show it to you and you can go back to again to the websites and dig into this if you want but this is John's data from Northeast North Dakota from 9 10 11 and 12 and from that data these next three or four slides are summarized from that data but if you look at at the sites there was 22 experiments that contained the pasaro application at early flower in the sto with the herbicide and then the pasaro at at the early plow and then the check and you can see that in in those years in Northeast North Dakota uh he's getting most of this benefit from the pasaro application at the year CL so in three out of 22 experiment experiments as indicated below he had a five Bush greater yield increase the trip herbicide time with the fungicide so if you look at the next one you you broke that further apart and he's indicating that in five out of 14 experiments uh there was a five Bush or greater yield increase due to the flag Le Fungicide and then in 12 out of 14 experiments it was due to the early FL fungicides so for John in that area uh that is pretty evidence that that application at that early flower stage is really important then he went on to further break out a few other comparisons and indicating that in four out of 10 experiments bisaro treatments yielded five bushels or more than the fure treatments I think many of you probably remember Marsh McMullen the NDSU plant pathologist that retired last year always indicating that she felt that the parar will P for the difference and cost between that and the FK here and the generics and John's data here is indicating the same now if you look at the next statement in seven out of 10 years poer increased yield by five bushels are greater over the no fungicide treatment and in the case ofar it was eight out of 10 experiments in that particular series I think if if you look further south say South of Highway 2 and west of Highway uh there you'll see those early herbicide treatments or the combination of the herbicide and fungicide pay more than they do in John's area because handspot is a bigger issue as you move into to a different climate compared to what John has up in the north east corner of nor uh just in closing to open it up for questions uh we're thinking about conducting a webinar in July or August again uh to talk about a number of different things but to prepare proceeding in the fall U some of the stuff we'd like to probably share then is we're getting quite a bit of new data with with starter trial research with p and potassium chloride and sulfur and so we're going to share some of that also want to share some information on some of the noil rotations that are going on around around the country this is just a slide from the ccsp farm that is kind of jointly LED between rers and Northeast South Dakota and Southeast North Dakota and what you have there is a blue lines is the yield for corn you a corn corn rotation where the corn is stripped till uh the second bar the rose colored bar is is a wheat wheat a spring wheat winter wheat and then corn following that and if a strict no till set til and then the third one the elar is is a spring wheat winter wheat and then corn but the winter weed is strip tilled and fall and then the corns planted into that and then it's a soybean corn rotation where the soybean ground of strip till and the corn is planted into that and you'll just notice the fouryear average I did not include 2011 because of hail uh but you'll note that that the uh the strip Heat and the soybean strip till are both very competitive one another over the long term term and you'll note that the corn on corn even using the strip till uh cannot compete with those two and then the other thing you should point out is actually in 12 and 08 you'll note that the corn has done a little better in one year and then that the the noil wheat without the strip actually done the best and that's when we're in a drier environment and warmer environment in those and I think the one thing we should remember is we've been in quite a period of wet years and I'm just kind of wondering if we're not transitioning back to drier climate and if we do uh some of the things and some of the practices that we look like we may need to go back and evaluate where we're at prior to this web period so those are some of the things we'd like to probably take a look at the next webinar some of the rotation impacts on economics and some of the things dealing with rotations on leader resistance I'm going to quit with that and we're going to open it up to questions well we're waiting for some questions again I just remind you that um we'll be uh posting these to the websites and if the South Dakota state folks like us to ship it to them and have them posted on their website we can do that as well number of the pieces of data that that we used in our trial things are from South Dakota um the other thing what we did also indicate that we were going to give out a little prize and uh Joel picked out a number for us and uh then Scott figured out who who the login was and it was Sue raisin and I believe Sue is the writer for the farm and ranch guy bismar so Su will be getting you to that little GI later on okay I see there's a a comment there about that there's less than 10% of the winter weed in our area has emerged what are the hopes for a decent CR we can Joel and I both respond yeah that that really is a a point of concern um because we really don't know what the status of that seed is I mean it it's quite possible that it imbibed and started the germination process and that process will continue as we get into the spring and uh that seed will obviously have bur so that's not a critical issue it's just kind of how much Vigor and how much stand we're going to likely get from a a crop that really just started the process of germination in the fall so that would be one scenario I guess we could have a scenario where those seats sit there dry and never did germinate they'll germinate in the spring and uh and then you know I guess in a worst case scenario they'll they'll act like a winter wheat crup was planted in Spring and will not have been vernalized but my my sense would be that in most locations we probably had enough uh moisture to get this germination uh process started and that we'll have to keep a close eye on the fields as we come into spring and to see if they're survived you know that's one strike against them being lady mergers um in small plants in the fall and um and hopefully that they'll we'll have the kind of weather that will allow those things to express themselves and get out of the ground before it gets too late in the season to where we have to make some kind of determination for determining the crop and plant something but I think generally we would say that that it's not a hopel situation that uh that uh often we have success when fields we planning the fall really didn't emerge completely in the fall but we're able to get a start and and then develop into the spring I just com I've been working with winter weat since 1977 and you know it seems like one location every year either with research or with my actual Fields Farm as well was that we would have a location someplace where witer we either was underneath the so surface or slightly above the soil surface um but so much of the WEA it makes it or not depend on obviously over winter but this period we're in right now if we can get some moisture to Reet that surface if the crown is still alive anyway uh there's still a very good chance that this crop will make it I think we've only lost one research plot since 1999 uh due to poor emergence and we've had quite a few of them that were either below the Sol surface or half Leaf to Leaf stage of grow uh don't be completely discouraged by it I guess the other thing I'd encourage you to consider is the fact that if you're dry and you take this crop out what crop are you going to plant and what crop is that crop going to have any better chance of making so I I'd encourage you particularly in those areas where you don't have any subsoil moisture to give this crop a little bit of time before you get too anxious okay okay I just want to one comment if if you're seeing mold uh on the plants is probably dead so that is generally a pretty good sign that that plant has sued what was the next question 32 degrees start toow yeah Joel says 32 degrees so in end I agree with that as far as vernalization I'm not worried about vernalization at all if you've had that seed in the ground my guess says there's been enough moisture went for that seed to swell and that uh that's all it takes then once then it gets cold again then the vernalization process is is taken play care of responded to you were talking before there yeah and that be the next question and as far as how long is it the temperature required to to be cold again Joel I can't remember what that time period is you know it's it's probably about a 30-day period yeah Joel saying it's about a 30-day period that you need for that cold one of the things that you can do is if you go to our website or the DU Canada website or this is just catch one there's a Dr fer has winter Cals manual there and there's a really good section on cold and vernalization and I would guess that NDSU and SDSU probably have that in their materials as well someplace and just bear in mind it doesn't have crazy yeah and Joel pointed out and and that's true that it doesn't have to be below freezing for the vernalization to occur it's just temperature Circle ser and then Becky actually answer Aon answered okay so then just okay next question from Evan is when we planted into broken CRP and am most concerned with the volunteer Gras mostly Timothy what herbicides would you recommend [Laughter] Jo I think yeah I think unless it's one of those winter annuals generally the normal you know grass wheat control will take out most of grass just want to get good timing start goals goal's response is you know if it's it's your Ann your winter annuals or your your annual grasses you know we've got some tools to select from with if pral which I think Timothy is and I'm not familiar with with control on on Timothy uh but my guess is is is you probably don't have much choice in terms of that control but I tell you what if you want to go to our website and drop me an email Evan uh I'll do some research on that and and try to get back to you okay we think we may have missed a question here I'll get to the ice question here in a couple seconds I can't remember now was that the first one you went to yep what about that okay no that was the first one and there's the okay where we at so ice okay ice can have a very detrimental effect on win uh particularly as we we get closer to uh breaking dormy is that plant is is needing more oxygen but uh if you get get a layer of solid ice over top of that plant and it stays there for probably four to seven days uh it can actually cause desiccation and and the most the worst situation would be is that surface is is probably a little dry and you get some melting going on and then you get a solid layer of of water around that crown and all the way to the surface of the soil and that that it becomes probably the most desal children yeah so it's it's not what you call typical winter kill this would be ice en casement it's very deadly there's nothing you can do about it I mean it it'll doesn't take long to kill the plant but that common except in your low spots typically that you would have your whole field covered with ice but it's yeah it's anytime from now until uh things get too big to be iced up uh ice encasement can be a real uh lethal kind of scenario one of one of the things we've experienced is is that if the ground is warm underneath the ice layer that ice can actually will actually granu particularly if you've got a snow layer above the ice and uh sometimes it it will gruiz fast enough that that there'll still be enough oxygen movement or if you've got stubble sticking through that ice that can also act as a conduit for oxygen as well and that can help well I think we're going to wrap up um unless we have a quick question well thank you folks for attending uh looks like we had pretty close to 70 folks on and I think there were some groups in the session so if you find us effective way to communicate some timely issues let us know and we'd also appreciate feedback on the type of information you'd like to see in these webinars so thanks again for your participation thank you very much",
