2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,870
hey guys this is Adam with farm life

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,000
Outfitters and I just wanted to jump on

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:19,470
here today and and talk to you a little

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,420
bit about our cows we purchased our

6
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:26,849
first cows this year so this is year one

7
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:30,960
with them and we've learned a lot we

8
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:32,610
have enjoyed them I just I love having

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,910
the cows they're they're easy to manage

10
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:41,430
they they're just a pleasure to be

11
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:43,739
around the only con is that they eat a

12
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:45,570
lot they do require quite a bit of food

13
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:49,440
compared to what we've had in the past

14
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:52,469
with our sheep and goats so I had to buy

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:56,640
quite a bit of hay this year and they

16
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:58,109
require a lot of pasture so I want to

17
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,699
talk to you about a little experiment

18
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:05,129
that I'm doing right now with managed

19
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:11,460
grazing compared to continuous grazing

20
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:15,509
so here we go alright so from about

21
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:18,180
September I don't know early September

22
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:22,830
through October we did not have much

23
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:26,040
rain at all and so I I kept our cows

24
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:28,350
over here close to the house and fed

25
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:31,680
them hay during that time to keep them

26
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:35,310
off the pasture so over here one of our

27
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:39,259
pastures is approximately five acres and

28
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,259
it looks something like this

29
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:47,430
I think you guys saw me splitting this

30
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:49,170
up into paddocks earlier in the year so

31
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:53,520
it looks something like this and then we

32
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:54,120
have a divider that looks something like

33
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,180
that

34
00:01:54,120 --> 00:02:02,870
so we separated the entire pasture into

35
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:05,610
two two patches basically so the total

36
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:09,750
total is about five acres for this

37
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:12,690
entire plot so from the end of August

38
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:14,880
till November there were there were no

39
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:20,430
animals on this pasture which allowed

40
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:22,410
the grass to regrow and before I took

41
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,480
the cows over I mean it was probably a

42
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:27,630
foot tall in some places or maybe more

43
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:34,110
in the grass so well November the 10th I

44
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:38,910
moved the cows over here and and I've

45
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:41,360
setting up a daily rotation which looks

46
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,360
like this

47
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:49,650
so everyday I will set this up these

48
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:52,320
three wires get set up everyday so

49
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:54,060
they're here on day one then they move

50
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:57,180
here and then this wire gets moved to

51
00:02:54,060 --> 00:03:00,140
here so the next day they moved here and

52
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:03,990
so on and so on so I've calculated that

53
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:09,300
by keeping this these paddocks tight

54
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:13,580
I've got 50 days worth of grazing in

55
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:16,110
this in this five acres I am new to this

56
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:18,120
I'm new to having cows I'm still

57
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,600
figuring out how to move in that what to

58
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,330
do

59
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:26,270
and we also forgot to tell you how many

60
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:33,740
we have so we have six cows we have

61
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:33,740
three calves and one ball

62
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:43,760
so I've calculated that this five acres

63
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:46,580
will last 50 days by moving them every

64
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:50,360
day from paddock to paddock on the other

65
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:52,280
hand and this is the part of the

66
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,840
experiment that I'm sort of guessing at

67
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,370
I mean I can I can look at the patch

68
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:00,440
during kind of tale how long it might

69
00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:02,840
last so I have estimated that if I were

70
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:05,360
to turn the cows out into this five

71
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:08,810
acres with no divisions just let them

72
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:14,350
have the entire five acres my estimation

73
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:19,810
would be that it would last two weeks so

74
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:26,600
continuous grazing would last two weeks

75
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:28,430
with no hay so that would mean out of

76
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:33,670
the fifty days they would be here I

77
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:33,670
would have to feed hay for five weeks

78
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:43,790
and from having them close to the house

79
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:46,310
and feeding them hey I have found that

80
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:48,889
they will go through a roll of hay in

81
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:52,210
three to four days so let's just say

82
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:57,650
every four days we need a roll of hay

83
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:59,479
so that would be nine rules well that

84
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:03,380
would be a cost of three hundred and

85
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:05,630
fifteen dollars for continuous grazing

86
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,850
that's two weeks with no hay in five

87
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:10,010
weeks

88
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:12,590
feeding hay and feeding out nine rolls

89
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:17,419
of hay during that time let's compare

90
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:20,510
that to managed intensive grazing by

91
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:24,350
moving them every day and giving them

92
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:27,380
just enough for that day all right so I

93
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:29,840
am like I said I'm moving the cows but

94
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:32,570
I'm also giving them some hay and I

95
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:36,560
found that for let's just call it

96
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:43,610
managed intensive grazing MiG one roll

97
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:46,820
of hay will last two weeks and that's

98
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,990
giving them just enough every day just

99
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:52,190
to make sure they get enough to eat

100
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:56,150
and so one roll will last two weeks so

101
00:05:52,190 --> 00:06:02,479
that means in 50 days I will have fed

102
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:07,000
out three and a half rolls of hay times

103
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:12,080
$35 is a hundred and twenty-five dollars

104
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:14,680
that's the cost feeding the cows during

105
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,680
this 50 days

106
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:29,740
so we have $315 for continuous grazing -

107
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:36,000
$125 is a balance of a hundred and

108
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:36,000
ninety dollars savings

109
00:06:36,789 --> 00:06:44,389
for moving the cows everyday so after I

110
00:06:41,719 --> 00:06:46,579
figured that I wanted to see how much

111
00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:48,679
like you know it takes time to move

112
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:51,859
these cows so it takes me on the average

113
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:53,929
20 minutes per day so that's every

114
00:06:51,859 --> 00:06:55,879
morning I go and I give the cows a

115
00:06:53,929 --> 00:06:58,069
little bit of hay which takes about 10

116
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:00,529
minutes and then every afternoon I go

117
00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:03,019
and move the cows to the next paddock

118
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:08,719
which takes about 10 minutes so on

119
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:12,679
average I spend 20 minutes a day feeding

120
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:17,649
and moving the cows so - 20 minutes a

121
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:22,789
day that is 16 and a half hours roughly

122
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:27,259
during this 50-day pasture rotation I've

123
00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:32,209
got 16 and a half hours labor and moving

124
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:40,159
the cows so then we do $190 divided by

125
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:45,049
16 and a half hours so I make $11.50 an

126
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:49,549
hour to go move the cows so to me that's

127
00:07:45,049 --> 00:07:52,669
worth it that's worth it not only am i

128
00:07:49,549 --> 00:07:55,369
saving money to go move the cows it's

129
00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:57,679
also benefiting the land by moving the

130
00:07:55,369 --> 00:08:01,189
cows I've noticed that I'm spreading the

131
00:07:57,679 --> 00:08:03,409
fertility where I wanted because if if

132
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:06,409
they were continuous grazing over this

133
00:08:03,409 --> 00:08:08,839
whole pasture they would pick a spot

134
00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:10,519
let's say there's a tree here the tree

135
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:12,319
here that you know they would pick these

136
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:14,989
spots that they would lounge every day

137
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:17,989
and that's where most of the manure

138
00:08:14,989 --> 00:08:20,329
would be deposited and that's where the

139
00:08:17,989 --> 00:08:21,199
fertility would would go but by moving

140
00:08:20,329 --> 00:08:23,719
them every day

141
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,519
this whole paddock right here is covered

142
00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:28,869
with manure and then the next day this

143
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:33,110
whole paddock is just covered in manure

144
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:35,149
so on and so on so I am spreading out my

145
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:37,429
fertility over the whole pasture instead

146
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:38,690
of concentrating it in this one area

147
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:42,590
where they like to

148
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:45,980
every day another benefit that I've

149
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:48,230
noticed even though we're in fall winter

150
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:50,120
and the temperatures are pretty cold

151
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:53,480
you know we're we've gotten down into

152
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:55,970
the 20s but most days it's lows in the

153
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:59,750
30s and highs in the 60s so I've noticed

154
00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:04,700
that by the time I get here which is

155
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:08,180
this is about three weeks this grass

156
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:11,780
back here is already grown back so once

157
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:13,790
I keep going going around I can come

158
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:15,800
back again and make the paddock a little

159
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:20,360
bigger you know maybe make this area

160
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:21,980
their paddock for the day or I can just

161
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,450
give them out the whole pasture at that

162
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:25,040
point but I think what I'm going to do

163
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:27,080
since the grass is regrowing a little

164
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,880
bit is just give them a slightly bigger

165
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:32,120
paddock and then just keep going around

166
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:35,840
and so instead of 50 paddocks I might

167
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:38,540
have 20 so one you know just have 20

168
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:40,000
paddocks going around so thank you for

169
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:43,060
joining me today on this little

170
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,860
experiment that I'm doing with the cows

171
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:48,080
like I said I really enjoy the cows I

172
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:50,960
like to see what they're doing to the

173
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,940
land and I'm excited to see just the

174
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,520
benefit of having the cows on the land

175
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:57,020
and and how much better our pastures are

176
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,270
going to be I hope you guys have a great

177
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:08,909
day and we'll see you on the next one

178
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:08,909
[Music]

179
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:32,490
hey will last about three weeks

180
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:32,490
