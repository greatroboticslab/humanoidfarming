1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,770
you know that's one thing I haven't

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,540
heard yet today is carbon and soil and

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,610
that's the driving force in what we're

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,620
doing I don't care what anybody says

5
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,570
that's a driving force and we've got to

6
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,040
really focus on that you know and

7
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,540
another thing I've learned over the

8
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,600
years is you can't make all the mistakes

9
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,369
yourself and I really try to do that so

10
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,900
what I'm saying is team together you

11
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:23,939
guys with your neighbor or whatever and

12
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,550
try to learn from each other because if

13
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:28,859
rather we realized or not we have to

14
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,529
change what we're doing we have got to

15
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:34,070
change what we're doing we've got to be

16
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:34,070
more sustainable

17
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:41,399
so we're 9600 acres and we've been

18
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:44,309
no-till since 1993 we feel like residues

19
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,649
really a friend we'll do our rotation

20
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:48,539
with a heavier residue crop because we

21
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:50,850
need the soil armor so residue is our

22
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,860
friend we did not take one if we'd out

23
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,309
of a rotation because residue is our

24
00:00:52,860 --> 00:01:03,149
friend

25
00:00:53,309 --> 00:01:05,280
we've got to have that soil armor Brady

26
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:07,770
85 hundred acres of grass on the

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,229
Missouri River breaks 850 head of cows

28
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:13,590
at the cow-calf pair and you can see

29
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:15,479
that'll always be a virgin sod and and

30
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,750
it's a good thing the boys do a really

31
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:21,720
good job of managing there are pastures

32
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,400
they they rotate them they've got

33
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,350
divided fences they're doing a

34
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,720
tremendously good job with their cattle

35
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,369
and and it's nothing but a where I used

36
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,340
to think it was kind of a detriment to a

37
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:34,079
farm and now I think it's all about our

38
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:37,619
farm is about our cattle because one

39
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:40,860
pays the other one off so here's our

40
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:43,200
pasture and the bad thing is it's in one

41
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:46,590
chunk and so when we run into a little

42
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,079
dry spell and we get hurt but then we

43
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,119
run into in the wintertime we've got two

44
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:55,229
sections where we bring the cows home -

45
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,850
and so we so we had an issue so we're

46
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:58,799
bringing them home we were grazing them

47
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,570
hard we're losing residue so we were

48
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,240
getting to her

49
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:04,310
our home two sections we're losing

50
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,840
productivity off of it because we are

51
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:09,410
grazing it too hard in the winter time

52
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,260
and so then as the story goes along I'll

53
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:13,400
tell you how we tried to remedy that

54
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:15,920
okay so I don't know how many you guys

55
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,760
have read Howard Buffett's book 40

56
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:22,010
chances so what he said in this book is

57
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,800
you've got 40 chances in your life to

58
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:28,270
make a difference just think about that

59
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:31,160
your farmer maybe you've already used 20

60
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:32,600
so you've got 40 chances to really make

61
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:38,480
a difference in your life

62
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:41,510
so I've already used 48 let's see what

63
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,520
what I'm ashamed of embarrassed of and

64
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:46,010
what I'm trying to make better is the

65
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:49,580
first 24 years I completely destroyed

66
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:54,260
this soil then what Dave was talking

67
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:57,320
about in the 70s I lived the 70s I mean

68
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:59,239
it was I did we did everything we could

69
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,520
do to destroy the soil and we didn't

70
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:06,200
know any better and I'm not so sure that

71
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:09,440
isn't what happened right now so much to

72
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:11,630
do in so little time to me that's my

73
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,160
main goal it's what I want to do is if I

74
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:18,400
can influence people to do the right

75
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:21,920
thing that's a win-win situation for me

76
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,080
so in the seventies we were good farmers

77
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,650
we felt we were the better farmers

78
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,470
around

79
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:29,840
we are cover crops was wild buck what

80
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:32,720
buckwheat and cosa weed and and though

81
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,239
we didn't really understand anything all

82
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,799
we knew was we were so busy working so

83
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:37,610
busy no one doing we were doing the

84
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,739
right thing

85
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:42,230
tilling the ground working the ground

86
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:46,549
after harvest she would go out there and

87
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:48,320
you'd you had the power to disc it when

88
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:50,570
dave said there when you started plough

89
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:53,330
and you kept plowing and till the color

90
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:55,640
of the soil changed what we'd do was I

91
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:57,650
mean actually you guys in the time that

92
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,120
we ploughed we did we were plowing six

93
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:01,160
inches deep and then all of a sudden you

94
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,000
went to five because we're turning it up

95
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:09,590
yellow dirt we didn't understand

96
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,660
but so we're our own worst enemies the

97
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:13,640
worst two pieces of machinery you can

98
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:17,090
use this one's terrible cuts all the

99
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:18,769
macropores off we had to go to we had we

100
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,750
finally went to Buckley because earlier

101
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:23,510
normal blades because our Buckley was so

102
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:26,060
bad we couldn't get through our stubble

103
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:27,530
because the buckwheat was so bad right

104
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,780
now we don't have any buckwheat on our

105
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:35,090
farm with our rotations we pretty well

106
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:36,740
take care of it so farm in the 80s so

107
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:39,170
you'd go along and every time the wind

108
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:40,820
blew if you were in powder if you were

109
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:43,490
someplace you were afraid to look like

110
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:47,180
Tosti to be the West because there'd be

111
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:48,890
dirt in here and we're just so we just

112
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:51,080
been so afraid it would be us that we

113
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:52,580
just go home you wouldn't go out look

114
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,490
because it wasn't a lot you could do

115
00:04:52,580 --> 00:05:01,010
about it but we still thought we were

116
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:04,040
good farmers so we didn't have really

117
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:06,760
good we didn't really have really good

118
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:12,220
deals what we thought we thought we did

119
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:15,500
one thing about the corn this 70 bushel

120
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:19,250
we'd never plant corn but over three

121
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,330
miles away from the farm because we knew

122
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:24,919
we were going to have to cut it for

123
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:26,660
silage we knew it wouldn't make corn so

124
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:29,810
we'd always be close to the house and

125
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:32,720
then another thing is this was on black

126
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:37,340
summer fellow and we thought we were

127
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:39,410
good farmers so our organic matter

128
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:41,060
really you know it was going down and

129
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:45,260
then we started using some fertilizer

130
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:47,180
and and you talked about a response you

131
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:49,520
talked about a response first we started

132
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,860
using phosphorus of 50-pound bags and

133
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,410
then we went to some nitrogen and we had

134
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:56,060
one drill with the with fertilizer rope

135
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:58,370
or fertilizer cashflow and the other

136
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,919
than we didn't but you talk about a

137
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:07,090
response so we thought we had this deal

138
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:10,790
figured out you know I just compared the

139
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:13,220
rainfall here Alexandr you know they get

140
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:15,270
about thirty seven where am I at

141
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:17,849
twenty-four about 25 inches

142
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:20,190
we get nineteen six only thing is you

143
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:23,190
guys are a little bit warmer but then

144
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:26,520
look at this year there's not a lot of

145
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:29,610
difference is there this isn't all this

146
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:33,210
is in our whole County but see the thing

147
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:35,069
like with us you take our snow away and

148
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:37,380
we have seventeen three inches of

149
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:40,229
moisture this year and you guys had

150
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:43,500
eighteen point one so one thing about

151
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:45,990
this whole thing with this snow were you

152
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,699
able to capture it did you have the

153
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:49,620
residue standing that you're not using

154
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:52,110
the knife rollers did you leave that

155
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:54,569
residue stand to catch that snow a lot

156
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:58,560
of guys say you're too wet and I think

157
00:06:54,569 --> 00:07:00,750
with the no-till and in a high diversity

158
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,940
and rotation I think you can handle I

159
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:04,560
make it different so this is part of

160
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,090
County so it's just like anything and

161
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,860
I'm sure it's the same way the county is

162
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:13,289
here see the difference in the rainfalls

163
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:15,599
so there's our place there's a main farm

164
00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:17,729
but see there's a river there's our

165
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,969
pastures 13 inches of rain down there

166
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:23,250
this year I mean so the boys in there

167
00:07:20,969 --> 00:07:25,289
they're the native grass and their

168
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:31,530
pasture rotations are bringing us

169
00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:34,889
through but it's it's an issue okay this

170
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:36,419
is how it all changed Duane back you

171
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:38,610
know I'm very fortunate enough to be on

172
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:40,860
Dakota lakes board and I'm very

173
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:43,199
fortunate enough to be on South Dakota

174
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,199
soil health coalition board Dwayne's the

175
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,449
one that started this the only reason

176
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:52,469
Dwayne we were the first ones in our

177
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:55,710
area to start a no-till we have seven

178
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:57,719
50s and we didn't know what we were

179
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:59,639
doing with Dwayne's lead but I mean you

180
00:07:57,719 --> 00:08:01,560
talk about someone you didn't have

181
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:04,169
places like this to go to safe what am I

182
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:07,289
going to do we didn't have we were

183
00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:09,840
really struggling with rotations we we

184
00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:11,909
just it was a struggle but you can't put

185
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:16,039
a value on what it's done for our area

186
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:20,550
and when I say no-till I mean low

187
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:22,440
residue no-till as far as I am concerned

188
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:24,220
there's a shank drill that will do quite

189
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:27,340
a bit of damage I'm talking about it

190
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:30,190
if drill you know there's a lot of

191
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:32,349
no-till captures carbon and organic

192
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:34,870
matter which is full of nutrients

193
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:37,060
so yes the tillage past will release

194
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:39,610
those nutrients causing a crop response

195
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:41,409
but then you are back to square one it's

196
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:43,300
like burning your house your house for

197
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:46,120
heat you did get some heat but you

198
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:49,030
destroyed your house so basically you're

199
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,560
not capturing that carbon all the carbon

200
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:52,240
you plant took in you go work it

201
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,880
whatever the way that carbon goes in the

202
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,370
air there's a lot of truth to that you

203
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,080
guys we have to focus on carbon there's

204
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:03,190
no question in my mind you have to focus

205
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:08,230
on carbon so we were looking for ways to

206
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:12,850
fertilize we had 750 drills and on and

207
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:14,290
so we tried spreading urea and we really

208
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:16,240
get like that because we knew were

209
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:19,000
volatize and we knew where it loses some

210
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,310
fertilizer and you're always you there's

211
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,990
a lot of times they're having to spread

212
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:25,210
when they had time instead of when it

213
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:28,300
should have been done so then we went to

214
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:30,070
anhydrous and you can see why we didn't

215
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:32,350
like anhydrous see what it did to the

216
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:34,750
soil anytime you do that you're gonna

217
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:37,140
release carbon then another thing you're

218
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:41,950
going to lose that source or armor and

219
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:43,720
we had to have that soil armor so this

220
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:45,970
is how we do our wheat and there's a

221
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,820
reason I'm going to tell you on how why

222
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:51,730
we put our fertilizer down so we have an

223
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:54,250
1895 drill so the fertilizer will gold

224
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:59,290
the nitrogen to go five inches away from

225
00:09:54,250 --> 00:10:00,790
the seed and then the but the reason

226
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:03,160
when you do that when there's five

227
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:07,150
inches away 45 inches away from the seed

228
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:08,589
at the fourth week four sleeve the

229
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:11,680
nitrogen and fertilizer will get

230
00:10:08,589 --> 00:10:12,880
together and when it does that then

231
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,540
that's how you can control your

232
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,880
tillering

233
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:18,160
so basically what you're doing instead

234
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:21,040
of like having five pillars if it's

235
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,970
broadcast we want about we want about

236
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,680
two and a half

237
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:26,020
good heads between two and two and a

238
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,430
half a good hands per kernel of wheat we

239
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:29,350
don't want to grow strong we want to

240
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:32,320
grow heads of wheat so that really

241
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:35,230
helped another thing about the 1895 the

242
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,820
first one that John Deere Bill went to

243
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:39,190
Ralph Holsworth he's the neighbor he

244
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:41,380
started no-tilling year before we did it

245
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:43,900
went to he lives a mile or three miles

246
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:46,300
west of Weston and drill number two went

247
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:48,089
to our farm so that's how much we

248
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:51,520
believe that we're that in this system

249
00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:54,339
and then we'll put down we'll put down

250
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:56,620
1152 and reduce of potash and AMS with

251
00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:59,470
their starter and the potash we want the

252
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:02,020
chloride for soil health and then we

253
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:05,920
come back at stream bar I know Dave said

254
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:08,260
that with us we have to have protein we

255
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,810
have got to have quality we have to

256
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:12,730
assure ourselves of quality so what

257
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:14,760
we'll do is we'll put enough on and then

258
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:17,470
we'll come back the way the weather is

259
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,730
timing the weather or whatever in heaven

260
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:23,050
and then we'll come back and stream

261
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:24,930
barge at about fetus five because in our

262
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:28,720
environment we have got to have protein

263
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:30,670
if we do not have protein like on spring

264
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,240
wood if we don't have 14 protein does

265
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:38,500
it's just about feed they'll cost you a

266
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:41,190
dollar a bushel so this is our a field

267
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,190
of no tilled

268
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:46,720
long-term no-till sunflower stalks and

269
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,610
you can see our residue I mean you can't

270
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,130
say enough good things about our residue

271
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:52,750
but so there's quite a bit of that

272
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:55,360
around so that was in central South

273
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:59,200
Dakota in 2007 just a little bit little

274
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:02,740
what too far from our place that came

275
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:05,980
off the sunflower field so we got to

276
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:09,700
stop this we know how to stop this well

277
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:11,980
here's 2012 that's four miles from my

278
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,990
place that was a bean field that they

279
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:16,060
planted the spring wheat and then it

280
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:17,830
blew there's quite a bit of that where

281
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:20,740
they'll put fertilizer on bean stubble

282
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:22,390
in the fall and then it'll blow so you

283
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:28,390
know we got over that we won't let that

284
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:32,020
happen again whoops we did you know

285
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:34,120
that's organic matter there this is a

286
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,710
this is a high note Hill environment

287
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,200
that's what manage you'll do man

288
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:39,700
but we'll do we've got to pay attention

289
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,880
to that everybody's got to pay attention

290
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:45,580
that we can't let that happen

291
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:47,830
so you know and this is Dwayne helped us

292
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:51,220
with this week so what do we do so

293
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:54,940
here's an 1895 drill these are 10 inches

294
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:56,590
apart so and then so all we did and this

295
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,540
isn't a very good picture but see we

296
00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:00,100
just took and put the wheel over here

297
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:03,910
will over there so then you've got a

298
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:06,460
rolling stock standing right here we did

299
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:08,530
it we did that on both sides of the

300
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:10,990
drill on the wings and that was enough

301
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:12,430
so what our fields look right now that's

302
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:16,120
what I feel look like and that was

303
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:18,190
enough to stop to blowing if you if we

304
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:22,420
have enough residue we won't blow but

305
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:26,470
that's enough to stop the blowing so our

306
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:27,910
row crowd fertilizers will we put we on

307
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:32,440
the river we do a little different but

308
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:34,120
on our dryland are your real gold three

309
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,760
inches off the side and two inches down

310
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:40,360
and we'll put our starter with with the

311
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:42,210
the seed and I'm gonna there's I'm

312
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:46,930
coming too that's why we're doing this

313
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:50,470
so if you broadcast urea on top to soil

314
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:52,840
the rias enzyme will break it down and

315
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:55,990
that's where you get it we release it

316
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:57,850
and get your validation so but if it's

317
00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:01,150
under the ground it'll help but he'll

318
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:04,120
slow it down so this is my theory and

319
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:06,370
it's just a theory so Colton and you can

320
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,930
google it this was in the thrill

321
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:10,930
magazine I've read quite a bit about

322
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:16,110
this so what they claim is you if you

323
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:19,300
pack it if you pack that urea into tight

324
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:23,290
deal it'll it'll slow down your real

325
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:25,510
system and make it flow relief and I

326
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:28,140
really I really feel that's working for

327
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:30,480
so you say what's your benefit abandon

328
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:33,010
someone will say well you can cut back

329
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,890
some will say well you know cuz it's

330
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:37,990
close to the seed and I you know and

331
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:39,160
this is my thought now get into a little

332
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:40,839
more what

333
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:43,240
ah hi I'm beginning to believe this all

334
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:44,949
the time a lot of you guys have probably

335
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:48,310
read this book if you don't have this

336
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:51,160
book you get this book 84 pages long

337
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:55,589
that don't only get it but get one to

338
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:58,269
give to your neighbor also good book

339
00:14:55,589 --> 00:14:59,980
much of modern agronomy is focused on

340
00:14:58,269 --> 00:15:04,120
feeding plants the nutrients they need

341
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:06,189
to grow for harvestable crop very little

342
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,259
is said about the most limited element

343
00:15:06,189 --> 00:15:12,910
most needed for crop production that is

344
00:15:08,259 --> 00:15:19,779
carbon we've got to have carbon we've

345
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:21,759
got to have carbon so right now you put

346
00:15:19,779 --> 00:15:25,720
on your you put on your inorganic

347
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:29,319
fertilizer and you plant a plant so that

348
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:30,730
plants on welfare most the time what a

349
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:32,439
plan will do is they'll take them

350
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,910
through for the census they'll take in

351
00:15:32,439 --> 00:15:36,910
it'll take out and you'll take the cart

352
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:38,319
of the sugar out and then the fungi will

353
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:42,100
take it and then they'll go get the

354
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:45,339
organic nitrogen so what happens when it

355
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:47,110
does this is it's got its on welfare so

356
00:15:45,339 --> 00:15:51,009
it's going to use that or inorganic

357
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:53,319
nitrogen and it's gonna get lazy I mean

358
00:15:51,009 --> 00:15:55,360
why wouldn't you why wouldn't you use

359
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:57,759
that if you could how many people have

360
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,259
you had if you had free meals given to

361
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,290
your pie would you have to go work so

362
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:05,709
that's exactly what the plants doing so

363
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:08,759
then when it comes time for the plant to

364
00:16:05,709 --> 00:16:11,439
actually save line running out of that

365
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:14,500
inorganic fertilizer I need some more so

366
00:16:11,439 --> 00:16:17,980
it goes as if since sugar out to try to

367
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:20,290
get the attention of the mycorrhizae and

368
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:23,740
the bacteria to go after and get the

369
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:27,100
organic in so instead of taking

370
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:29,319
everything to the head it's taking

371
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:34,360
everything it's got to try to go after

372
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:38,079
more fertilizer so I'm not saying we

373
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:40,300
should quit fertilizing I'm not saying I

374
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:42,160
think we need to watch what we fertilize

375
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:45,529
it may be managed or fertilizer a little

376
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:48,510
better but one thing I'm really

377
00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:50,970
I'm one thing in the end I there's no

378
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:52,860
scientific deal this is just a farmer's

379
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:54,990
thought I think when you put that

380
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:57,480
fertilizer in a tight band like that I

381
00:16:54,990 --> 00:17:00,029
think part of this is what helping we're

382
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:03,779
actually going off and finding it's not

383
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:07,620
being overwhelmed with that inorganic

384
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:09,480
fertilizer we soil sample with variable

385
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:12,660
rate we do our own I've been doing it

386
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:15,569
since 2000 and the main reason we do

387
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:17,550
this is because not that for most

388
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:20,189
production we're just finding out what

389
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:23,339
the fields need and I think the last

390
00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:26,610
thing we on our farm right now we don't

391
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:29,970
farm for max maximum yield

392
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:31,380
we farm for maximum profit and when we

393
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:33,480
started doing that that made a lot of

394
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,590
difference because you know if you're

395
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,080
not you're gonna be going through the

396
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:38,880
180 bushel yields and you might get them

397
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,429
1 out of 10 years and we take an average

398
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,250
and so we don't do that anymore we farm

399
00:17:41,429 --> 00:17:46,400
for maximum profit so you put all them

400
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:50,460
together you got a variable rate map

401
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:55,260
again same thing cost efficient

402
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:57,240
management I think you really have to do

403
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:59,210
that our feeling that's really taken us

404
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:03,960
two long ways on our farm

405
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:07,260
here's another staying of Duane's quit

406
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:09,750
putting band-aids on things when you

407
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:11,460
have something wrong instead of just

408
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,620
trying to find out some way to well how

409
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,540
am I gonna heal this or let's see I need

410
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:17,700
I need to go buy another fungicide that

411
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:19,890
will take care of this or they've got a

412
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:22,110
new herbicide and I know I gotta spray

413
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:23,820
that herbicide what you do is you go

414
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:26,309
find out what the problem is what the

415
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:30,480
issue is and it took me a while I'm a

416
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:32,880
full learner so I thought well this is

417
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,040
where we need to be and the reason these

418
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,650
are the first rotations we started with

419
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:40,320
and the reason this was is because

420
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:42,419
before the freedom to farm we had to we

421
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,010
had the planter fleet base the only way

422
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:47,070
we could plant wheat base is plant when

423
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:50,400
if we back on spring wheat so and so I

424
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:52,290
mean we thought we had it made well the

425
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,660
only thing that someone else was

426
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:56,360
thinking the cheatgrass said you know

427
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:59,240
I'm gonna figure you guys

428
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:01,100
so we went we went two times around on

429
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,100
this two and a half times around we

430
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:05,570
realized we had to make a change we

431
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:07,940
could either spray for cheatgrass and

432
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:11,270
keep fighting the cheatgrass or we had

433
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:13,670
to let rotations do it and and our goal

434
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:15,680
was to do it with rotation so these

435
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:18,970
aren't any big deals we just all we did

436
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:21,470
was we stayed up two years away from

437
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:24,620
there were three years away from wheat I

438
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:26,210
mean but doing this we still that's the

439
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:28,100
reason we were doing a but in the long

440
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:30,590
run what it was really doing was getting

441
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:34,880
us more diversified and helping us with

442
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:40,630
soil health and then we started cover

443
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:44,660
crops in 2006 these are a crop trades in

444
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:46,850
2017 and I know we've got forage crops

445
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:49,220
in there but one thing we'll do is we'll

446
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:51,640
go look for the markets but you can see

447
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:55,550
our high residue crop we value residue

448
00:19:51,640 --> 00:20:00,650
and our dry environment we've we value

449
00:19:55,550 --> 00:20:02,270
residue have to have residue if you ever

450
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:06,110
want to read something and rusty just

451
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:08,480
Charles Darwin on worms I mean you can

452
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:10,040
read for hours about what is what he

453
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:17,330
what's his thoughts were on worms

454
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:20,690
earthworms this is a field of it was

455
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:22,460
volunteer levels this fall and you know

456
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:25,040
when you the levels were sorted anyway

457
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:27,260
and and when you're full CD rates forty

458
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,630
pounds so it wasn't anything to leave

459
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:31,160
3040 pounds because they shattered

460
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:36,530
they're only six inches tall eight

461
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:42,710
inches tall but look at the look at the

462
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:44,240
earthworm hold there's water gonna go

463
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:46,280
down as water gonna go down it's just

464
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:50,260
got a place to go risk got a place to go

465
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:50,260
but another thing

466
00:20:52,450 --> 00:21:02,019
with earthworms channels there's two and

467
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:04,629
a half times more nitrogen there's a 1/2

468
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:07,450
more carbon one and a half more times

469
00:21:04,629 --> 00:21:10,929
nitrogen seven times more phosphorus at

470
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:13,989
six and a half times more potash so if

471
00:21:10,929 --> 00:21:16,539
you were a plant you're in a drier

472
00:21:13,989 --> 00:21:18,129
environment and you had to you said well

473
00:21:16,539 --> 00:21:19,659
where am I gonna go well here's an easy

474
00:21:18,129 --> 00:21:21,609
place than when I go down there I'm

475
00:21:19,659 --> 00:21:23,230
going to have all that fertility I'm

476
00:21:21,609 --> 00:21:29,919
gonna have all that fertility at the

477
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:32,139
earth rooms created you know the NRCS

478
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:35,200
has done a lot of work on our farm and

479
00:21:32,139 --> 00:21:37,509
and along with SDSU I don't want to give

480
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,669
one anybody one more credit than the

481
00:21:37,509 --> 00:21:41,379
other but you know the more you read the

482
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:44,889
more you realize this what's under the

483
00:21:41,379 --> 00:21:47,350
soil everybody drives by and say boy

484
00:21:44,889 --> 00:21:49,989
that's a nice corn crop boy that's a

485
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:51,850
nice wheat crop how many times do you

486
00:21:49,989 --> 00:21:55,059
say boy let's go take a spade and go

487
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:57,129
look at that soil I mean I think we have

488
00:21:55,059 --> 00:21:59,559
to do that you guys I think we have to

489
00:21:57,129 --> 00:22:02,369
because soils a driving force is what's

490
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:05,230
going to happen in the future so we took

491
00:22:02,369 --> 00:22:08,830
Chad and Osborne and Mike Lehman askest

492
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:12,340
told us we could bring some some soil

493
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:15,309
samples over to the lab and it was 2012

494
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:17,499
extremely dry and I said I don't think

495
00:22:15,309 --> 00:22:19,779
you'll do any good because we're dry I

496
00:22:17,499 --> 00:22:21,190
mean we're just terribly drying it was

497
00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:24,940
middle of winter

498
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:27,220
February well February 14th guess what

499
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:30,129
else I did on Valentine's Day but anyway

500
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:33,190
so anyway and this is this is how lowly

501
00:22:30,129 --> 00:22:35,739
that I know about it so I was so proud

502
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:38,139
of taking this one because look at the

503
00:22:35,739 --> 00:22:40,299
rotation I mean holy buckets I mean

504
00:22:38,139 --> 00:22:42,489
there wasn't any way that thing wasn't

505
00:22:40,299 --> 00:22:46,090
going to be a you know as big rotation

506
00:22:42,489 --> 00:22:47,710
and it was the least count so it just

507
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:49,989
kind of shows you how little we know

508
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:52,769
about what's going on under her feet but

509
00:22:49,989 --> 00:22:56,470
the one thing that really helped me is

510
00:22:52,769 --> 00:22:58,450
everything was still alive when you

511
00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:01,119
warmed it up under a microscope it was

512
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:01,989
still alive and I just thought that

513
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:04,679
meant a lot

514
00:23:01,989 --> 00:23:08,070
so mycorrhizae

515
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:09,830
Micro is a fungi if you guys ever get it

516
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:12,150
all you read everything you can about it

517
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:16,340
because that thing's helping us so much

518
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:19,140
it's been around forever but the it dumb

519
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:22,320
it moves in from legume plants that

520
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:25,080
started fertilizer is reduced destroying

521
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:30,360
the food web by tillage I mean that'll

522
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:32,850
hurt it it can access water from very

523
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:34,529
small pores in the soil bringing the

524
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:38,370
water through the plants during times

525
00:23:34,529 --> 00:23:40,830
when the soil is dry when we were in

526
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:44,399
Indianapolis with dr. ray wells how to

527
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:47,940
talk and it was all the talk on what his

528
00:23:44,399 --> 00:23:49,890
talk was is on the micro rise I the

529
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:52,740
ruddy structure of a mycorrhizae and

530
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:55,440
he's got pictures of my cries a poor

531
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:57,330
little gold aggregation when you get

532
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,850
aggregated soils that look like cottage

533
00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:02,460
cheese that's the glue mona from those

534
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:04,710
is from the sugar that the mycorrhizae

535
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:07,049
takes to the center of that and then

536
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:09,690
that's what makes it as sticky and then

537
00:24:07,049 --> 00:24:10,890
that's but anyway he has pictures of it

538
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:13,710
where his right and it will go right

539
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:15,630
right in the center of that and then

540
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:18,510
that's where it will take most of the

541
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:22,500
it'll go after most of my Fuhrer but I

542
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:27,179
thought it was kind of neat so we put a

543
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:29,279
we had of forage soybeans and then we

544
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:31,289
planted corn and we came back we did

545
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,779
this two years and one year I took it to

546
00:24:31,289 --> 00:24:36,809
harvest and the other year we cut it for

547
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:41,159
silage and so what we'll do what we did

548
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:43,140
was we came back and we planted the corn

549
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:45,149
and came back about right when the corn

550
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:48,779
was spiked and plants of forage soybeans

551
00:24:45,149 --> 00:24:52,140
group sevens you know and the the thing

552
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:54,390
that was really stuck out at me is so

553
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:57,000
these are the this is the corn with the

554
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:59,730
soybeans and we thought we were running

555
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,940
it was a drought but you see the tips of

556
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:04,799
these that corn house tipped back so

557
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:08,299
basically then forage soybeans were

558
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:10,529
feeding the nitrogen and our limited

559
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:12,240
rainfall we have to be careful with this

560
00:25:10,529 --> 00:25:14,280
because then forage soybeans talk quite

561
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,520
a bit of moisture but it's just enough

562
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:20,260
to be kind to have to be care

563
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:23,020
Flo you know this is another thing dr.

564
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:27,190
Dave Francine we plant flocks I love

565
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:29,770
flax but it's micros a friendly flock

566
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:32,070
doesn't take any and he he would have

567
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:35,170
told you that today that's in his book

568
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:36,760
it doesn't take any phosphorous because

569
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:40,270
the mycorrhizae it goes after the

570
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:42,750
organic phosphorous if you could get him

571
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:45,610
to say it and we should ask him today

572
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:47,679
he'll tell you that sunflowers doesn't

573
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:50,140
take any phosphorous he don't recommend

574
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:52,120
any phosphorous the sunflowers and if

575
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:54,850
you would ask him is it mycorrhizae and

576
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:57,900
he probably would have said yes because

577
00:25:54,850 --> 00:26:03,460
if sunflowers are very mycorrhizae

578
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:05,620
lovely in a cover crop mix there would

579
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:07,840
be sufficient link to my crazy hype in

580
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:10,480
the top four inches of a four square

581
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:15,940
yard of healthy grassland to stretch

582
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:18,370
around the world there's a lot to this I

583
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:20,500
mean you guys I really encourage you to

584
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:22,660
read about it because the more you read

585
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:24,550
about it the more you plan my carides I

586
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:27,910
plants and there's a lot of them just

587
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:32,860
realized the value of them okay now

588
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:38,590
we're gonna get into carbon we were at a

589
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:40,200
meeting in 1991 and Dwayne Beck said do

590
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:45,400
you see what I see

591
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:47,559
and he was talking about carbon it blew

592
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:50,290
over the top of my head only took me 20

593
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:52,870
years to figure it out but it's you guys

594
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:54,880
the more you the more you realize we

595
00:26:52,870 --> 00:27:00,550
have to take carbon in not only take

596
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:06,820
carbon in but we have to store it 57

597
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:10,179
percent of organic matter is carbon we

598
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:12,490
have to take carbon in that's the

599
00:27:10,179 --> 00:27:14,559
biggest thing about you carbon is a

600
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:16,360
driving force any time you could grow

601
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:19,630
bring it in through the plants you've

602
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:21,940
got to have carbon another thing we're

603
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:24,490
doing is we're working some native grass

604
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:26,260
and are nothing big but you know it's

605
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:28,270
kind of a rotation type deal

606
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:30,820
kind of slough area some hunting area

607
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:33,370
will put 60 acres in Lee within four or

608
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:34,720
five years to take it out again we're

609
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:37,210
getting a written structure we're

610
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,679
getting we're bringing that land back I

611
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:40,809
mean we're bringing it back to where it

612
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:42,940
was so I mean then we will take it back

613
00:27:40,809 --> 00:27:46,720
to a crop but I just think that's really

614
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:49,840
going to help us in the long run je

615
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:52,090
Fuhrer take the world to Jai this is a

616
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:55,270
trade cronin that's Mike's son he's

617
00:27:52,090 --> 00:28:00,360
going to be one of the the main owners

618
00:27:55,270 --> 00:28:03,370
the farms shifting gears next year and

619
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:06,520
Kacy and Cori that's Monty's two sons

620
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:09,309
and Mike and Trager it's going to Bonnie

621
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:11,620
stepping out of the picture he's going

622
00:28:09,309 --> 00:28:14,590
to retire which is you know fine but

623
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:16,450
anyway I really believe that if you have

624
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:18,429
more carbon entering your soil than

625
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:20,559
leaving your kids will probably farm

626
00:28:18,429 --> 00:28:22,780
that land if you have more carbon

627
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:25,690
leaving than entering they probably will

628
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:31,690
not what he's saying is you gotta farm

629
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:33,790
for the future so we had some corn and

630
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:39,490
heavy strip of stubble in 2017

631
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:44,530
nice-looking corn old deeds we had a

632
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:45,760
Frost June 26th was it going to come

633
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:47,890
back I don't know if it was going to

634
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:51,820
come back it was really it was probably

635
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:54,610
six collar plus the thing but is our

636
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:56,440
that would have 160 acres and we lost

637
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:59,290
maybe eighty acres out of the quarter

638
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:00,790
but it was being the low ground didn't

639
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:03,520
know how to make any sense of it so we

640
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:05,440
knew we had to do something we weren't

641
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,809
going to leave that land alone because

642
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:10,840
it had the fertility there it wanted

643
00:29:07,809 --> 00:29:12,669
something growing in it so we planted

644
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,980
you can't see it very well but we

645
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:17,020
planted the pearl millet because that's

646
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:20,460
what the chemical let me had kalisto on

647
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:26,760
it and brown mid we have forage sorghum

648
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:26,760
because we had cows because we had cows

649
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:35,380
here's what we ended up with I should

650
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:40,480
have done a biomass unreal unreal what

651
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:42,880
we did and to show you Ruth came up Ruth

652
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,470
beckoned and I said now to say Ruth

653
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,450
Becca should be able to say Ruth and

654
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:49,300
everybody knows her because she's up but

655
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:51,280
anyway Ruth came up and Jason and we

656
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:53,380
went out there you guys and it was it

657
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:56,260
was really something it was really felt

658
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:58,300
like this success story so what we did

659
00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:00,280
as we had them so what are you gonna how

660
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:02,980
are you going to handle it now so we

661
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:05,410
went in with decided now this is our

662
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:08,230
better soils so we knew we had the

663
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:09,160
fertility there we knew organic matters

664
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:12,160
will hire there

665
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:14,740
we knew the we had still had good ground

666
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:18,280
cover you saw that on the picture so

667
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:20,560
what do you do so we cut up for silage

668
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:22,600
and you say boy you took all that stuff

669
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:25,090
off but you know that was terrible well

670
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:28,720
I understand but we had to do what we

671
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:30,430
had to do so we took this silage off but

672
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,970
I kept thinking look at all the root

673
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:35,500
mass we have look at the rut master we'd

674
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:37,960
have with that they've probably down

675
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:41,470
three three foot two and a half three

676
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:43,000
foot so I felt I did want to take it all

677
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:44,890
off but it's something in the way the

678
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,920
temperature was or the weather was the

679
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:49,780
rainfall we felt we had to so here's

680
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:54,850
another thing about if we need cover or

681
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:57,250
not so look at the temperature look at

682
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:59,620
the temperature when you start the start

683
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:01,060
evaporating 85 percent of the moisture

684
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:05,710
loss through evaporation transpiration

685
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:08,110
at 95 degrees so what happens on bare

686
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:09,670
soils you know if you guys ever done

687
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:11,320
much of this it doesn't take very much

688
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:13,990
to go over the thermometer and get a

689
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:17,470
hundred and hundred and ten degrees soil

690
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:19,510
on bare soil so this is just one of them

691
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:22,510
things and this isn't my pictures the

692
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:24,160
NRCS my thermometers sideways and it's

693
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:26,890
hard to take a picture but look at the

694
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:31,930
difference same day same place these

695
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:33,130
came from Jay Fuhrer we have to have

696
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:37,720
that soil Armen

697
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:40,200
we have to have that soil covered so

698
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:43,990
here's where organic matter

699
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:46,180
when we started taking off I mean so

700
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:48,550
it's building and we felt good about it

701
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:50,170
and that we're no-tilling and you know

702
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:52,570
you feel you know we're going in the

703
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:54,100
right direction because if we would not

704
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:58,660
have I don't know where we would have

705
00:31:54,100 --> 00:32:00,010
been because when you the microbes are

706
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:01,660
going to eat something and they're going

707
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:03,430
to eat organic matter if they don't have

708
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:06,220
anything any carbon that you brought in

709
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:10,150
so they're going to eat something so

710
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:12,490
this is 10% it's where we used to be we

711
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:15,670
let a lot of places in the United States

712
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:19,440
for less than two what do you think that

713
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:23,290
grant was telling his grandson I'm sorry

714
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:26,830
when we were in Indiana with the buffett

715
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:28,540
people we had people from the thumb of

716
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:32,050
Michigan we had from the Boot Hill

717
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:35,080
Missouri from Nebraska to Indiana to

718
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:37,060
Iowa and a lot of guys you talk about

719
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:39,520
organic wagon they didn't want to really

720
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:41,440
talk about organic matter but when they

721
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:43,540
did talk that their lot of members in

722
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,810
the one and a half two twos the two and

723
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,810
a halves

724
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:50,170
they're trying to do it all with they're

725
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:52,960
getting in to cover crops now that's

726
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:54,580
what they should but because they've got

727
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,920
to get carbon back to make organic

728
00:32:54,580 --> 00:33:01,450
matter they're trying to do with the

729
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:03,400
inorganic nutrients so this is what

730
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:06,160
we've done on our farm and so what I did

731
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:08,290
was I took of that grass was planted in

732
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:10,810
the 30s it was planted back in the 30s

733
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:13,240
so I took a soil sample of it I should

734
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:17,260
have gone to native but so it was five

735
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:19,750
point one an average land in 2008 was

736
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:23,050
2.8 and we have a lot of land in the

737
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:26,650
fours right now what I'm going to say

738
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:29,140
about cover crops anytime you get a

739
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:31,120
cover crop going on your field but I

740
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:33,640
mean I'm talking a pretty active cover

741
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:36,100
crop where everything's really Perkin

742
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:38,260
well I think you know I used to say if

743
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:39,850
you could gain a tenth of a percent a

744
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:41,410
year you're doing well and I think you

745
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:43,150
could get the two tenths or maybe even

746
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:43,510
three tenths here by uses of the cover

747
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:46,060
crop

748
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:49,510
I think cover crop is just going to

749
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:50,710
jumpstart that soil one thing too is and

750
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:53,320
Jay talked about

751
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:55,060
is when you plant covers don't be

752
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:57,280
disappointed after the first year

753
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:59,380
because he explains it kind of like a

754
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,610
soybean where the second year soybeans

755
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:03,160
always better than the first year

756
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:04,780
natively and he says it's just something

757
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:07,720
about it because you plan to cover on

758
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:09,640
that stubble it's just kind of a shock

759
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,530
to this house stuff that's never had

760
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:13,750
before but it's always better the second

761
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:15,610
time around so while I'm really saying

762
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:17,320
to you guys it's just this this ain't

763
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:21,120
just a one or two year deal we just got

764
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:23,200
to have to keep working on this benefits

765
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:30,310
twenty to thirty pounds of nitrogen

766
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:32,230
sulfur phosphorus what I would pay

767
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:36,970
attention to the most is your organic

768
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:38,560
matter water holding capacity and our

769
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:41,080
dryer environment that's tremendously

770
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,940
important if I can hold another 1/2 or

771
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:45,190
3/4 inch of water that's going to get me

772
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:49,780
through that tough time time and time

773
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:52,470
again it shows that mineralization this

774
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:54,640
fall we really you know we just

775
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:56,740
everybody said boy I can't believe we've

776
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:59,350
got that much nitrogen well all it is is

777
00:34:56,740 --> 00:35:00,820
is the microbes are really working and

778
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:03,070
they're working on your organic matter

779
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:04,810
and whatever whatever but the more

780
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:10,900
organic matter you have the more

781
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:13,930
mineralization you're gonna have this is

782
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:16,840
our word organic matter what's going now

783
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:18,730
and that's uh I feel good about that I

784
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:21,780
just hope we can keep the one thing

785
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:24,610
about it is we're not going backwards I

786
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:30,910
do not take credit for organic matter in

787
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:33,220
a soil test they will not 1% of organic

788
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:36,220
matter is like one point one trillion

789
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:38,910
waters a gallon per day over Niagara

790
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:42,070
Falls one percent over the United States

791
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:47,830
that's how much water that 1% of organic

792
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:51,070
matter could hold it's our savings

793
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:52,630
account when we fertilize for one

794
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:55,540
hundred and forty and you can have a

795
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:57,060
good moisture and get 160 how do you get

796
00:35:55,540 --> 00:36:02,530
that you get it from your organic matter

797
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:04,510
but Dave Francine says just like Connie

798
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:09,460
and he just came out with this

799
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:12,070
on his corn deal if you have 6% organic

800
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:15,520
matter over he'll credit he won't credit

801
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:17,680
until you get 60% he sees the value of

802
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:20,470
organic matter so like when he talks

803
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:23,140
about fertilizing wheat which I'm not

804
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:24,550
saying I don't I'm a farmer I don't have

805
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:27,670
I don't have enough knowledge or

806
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:29,440
education disagree with dr. Francine but

807
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:32,350
I don't I don't really believe that

808
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,960
because what he's saying he's going to

809
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:36,760
fertilize for two bushel wheat and if he

810
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,250
gets rain the organic matter is gonna

811
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:41,920
kick in the only thing is it's what if

812
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:43,690
you don't have five percent organic

813
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:47,440
matter what if you're two and a half and

814
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:49,540
so I think I think I I really think

815
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,460
that's critical that you that's why we

816
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:53,290
won't use any organic matter credit we

817
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:55,770
do what we don't we don't use it as

818
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:59,290
credit when we do use organic matter

819
00:36:55,770 --> 00:37:01,570
this is on the Internet $600 six hundred

820
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:03,490
eighty dollars for one percent of

821
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:10,450
organic matter and I just put some of

822
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:12,670
our own numbers in and you still there's

823
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:15,790
really still quite a value to 1% of

824
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:18,880
organic matter if you own your land if

825
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:20,980
you own your own land why aren't you

826
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:25,900
doing that why aren't you trying to get

827
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:28,290
more organic matter everybody says I'm

828
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:31,000
too hot to drive whatever whatever but

829
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:36,280
optimum management and add an external

830
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:41,700
carbon stores anytime you can anytime

831
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:41,700
you can cover crops you guys

832
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:48,260
this is our first cover crop Dwayne you

833
00:37:45,859 --> 00:37:50,869
know he was going he was trying to get

834
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:53,180
someone to try cover crops and he got me

835
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:56,119
kind of cornered and so we did it the

836
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:58,220
only thing is is we come off a really

837
00:37:56,119 --> 00:38:02,210
dry year we had thirteen point seven

838
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:04,010
inches of moisture but it was really a

839
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:08,750
low carbon to only a twenty to one

840
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:10,220
carbon and and I was worried about it

841
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:11,599
and he was worried about it enough he

842
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:13,220
called one day and he said when you're

843
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:14,690
gonna start combining that and I said

844
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:17,119
well we're probably gonna be doing it

845
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:19,310
Tuesday and Tuesday morning he pulled in

846
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:21,020
and he rolled with me so he was as

847
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:22,970
nervous as I was but it turned out

848
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:26,030
pretty good for his we ended up with

849
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:30,800
good moisture in 2007 but it turned out

850
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:33,530
for us so another question so we're

851
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:35,450
gonna plant cover crops there's not

852
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:38,420
enough people a lot of people what

853
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:39,980
they'll do is though and I'm not I think

854
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:41,450
there's a tremendous lot of good seed

855
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:44,119
sales when I I hope I don't offend

856
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:47,420
anybody but when you walk up your seed

857
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:50,900
salesman you say this is what I want to

858
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:53,630
do I want to graze it I want to increase

859
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:55,940
organic matter you know and whatever you

860
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:58,849
want to do you want to use up the excess

861
00:38:55,940 --> 00:39:00,680
moisture whatever you want to do you

862
00:38:58,849 --> 00:39:05,720
have them goals and usually what I do

863
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:09,710
when I sit down to make my my cover crop

864
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:11,839
plans I have three things in mind if

865
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:14,660
it's grazing organic matter would it be

866
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:16,099
one two three I always have my first one

867
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:18,800
but don't just go up there and say I

868
00:39:16,099 --> 00:39:20,480
need a cover crop they can help you they

869
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,319
know what you want but you let them know

870
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,319
what you want

871
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:31,650
this is from the NRCS jason miller and

872
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:34,350
jeff Hemmings we made this and it's a

873
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:36,360
good chart and and what I usually do

874
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:39,510
let's just take flocks for instance so

875
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:42,450
you know it's highly my karai's I it's

876
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:45,060
good you know an intelligent it's very

877
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:48,150
organic matter carbonate nitrogen ratio

878
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:49,710
high but so one thing too is you look at

879
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:52,830
the seeding rate full seeding rate

880
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:56,160
twenty pounds so when I make a cover

881
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:58,380
crop mix if I got five things and I

882
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:01,680
wonder so I got five things that we like

883
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:05,040
I want so I'll do twenty percent of each

884
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:08,610
one so right now that'd be four pounds

885
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:11,460
of flax and that's how I build my cover

886
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:13,200
crop mix so do a percentage if you feel

887
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:15,840
really good about it if you've got

888
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:19,920
enough moisture I sometimes go to 115 to

889
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:21,270
120 percent that's that's who I I'm not

890
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,720
saying this the right ways just the way

891
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:25,950
I do it

892
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:29,070
another thing Chris mentioned this this

893
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:31,080
is on the Google cover crop chart ARS

894
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:32,730
and you can go and they'll tell you

895
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:35,660
anything you want to know about any

896
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:40,400
cover crop the carbon and nitrogen ratio

897
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:43,650
everything salt-tolerant good website

898
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:45,960
one thing I found in the Sarah book and

899
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:48,390
I started doing this because when we

900
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:51,060
plant sorghum Sudan grass we always

901
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:52,260
plant Piper's today on grass I never

902
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:55,040
plant one thing alone

903
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:58,170
Piper's today on grass and probably like

904
00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:01,290
either a white a white wonder of a

905
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:03,060
German millet because I never want

906
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:05,160
anything alone I think that everybody

907
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:07,770
gets along better when there's something

908
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:09,810
else there then another thing about that

909
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:14,310
millet is it keeps the windrow fluffy

910
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:17,060
and but the one thing that really just

911
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:19,590
look at that so a few money seen this

912
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:26,250
six inch stub will look how much deeper

913
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:28,800
the rust go more root mass more it takes

914
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:32,010
in more carbon the more benefit that's

915
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:37,130
taught soil microbes I mean if a guy has

916
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:37,130
cattle I mean I think this is a win-win

917
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:43,960
carbon-to-nitrogen ratio so you know one

918
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:45,880
time Dwayne was up and I was talking

919
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:48,099
about all our high carbon crops at all

920
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:49,960
this double we had and and he made the

921
00:41:48,099 --> 00:41:52,630
comment to me he said but you have to

922
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:55,539
learn to manage that that's a high

923
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:58,869
management and that I thought well you

924
00:41:55,539 --> 00:42:01,839
know anybody could but it is I mean is 8

925
00:41:58,869 --> 00:42:04,450
inches of stubble it's ok but is it too

926
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:06,420
much so you just have to kind of realize

927
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:10,029
what you want to do with your cover crop

928
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:12,309
or with your soil cover with your carbon

929
00:42:10,029 --> 00:42:14,980
but one thing you have to be awful

930
00:42:12,309 --> 00:42:17,769
careful that you don't use it up and you

931
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:19,539
leave some right now like on our littles

932
00:42:17,769 --> 00:42:22,299
and peas where a lot of guys will go on

933
00:42:19,539 --> 00:42:25,599
corn stalks I'll plant them on some on

934
00:42:22,299 --> 00:42:28,749
sprinkly stubble okay so I got spring

935
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:31,180
wheat stubble then lentils and then I'll

936
00:42:28,749 --> 00:42:33,579
and then I'll come back to corn corn or

937
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:34,089
winter wheat for one thing is the weed

938
00:42:33,579 --> 00:42:36,430
control

939
00:42:34,089 --> 00:42:39,880
if I've got a cheatgrass issue downy

940
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:42,190
Brome issue behind the spring wheat the

941
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:44,859
lentils I can take anything out I want

942
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:46,450
as far as grass is concerned and then I

943
00:42:44,859 --> 00:42:48,609
can come back to one of wheat the next

944
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:51,220
year and then corn so I just take a

945
00:42:48,609 --> 00:42:52,779
break I don't have any set rotations and

946
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:55,680
I don't know if that's right or wrong

947
00:42:52,779 --> 00:43:00,099
it's just something that works for us

948
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:02,589
carbon nitrogen ratio so like that one

949
00:43:00,099 --> 00:43:05,680
we said was right here on that first

950
00:43:02,589 --> 00:43:08,349
cover crop ideal is right here and I

951
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:11,410
don't know on our where soil czar so

952
00:43:08,349 --> 00:43:15,130
active with the mature soil so I like to

953
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:17,079
be a little higher than that and we

954
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:19,059
started working covers into our pivots

955
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:21,849
covers and rotations because I thought

956
00:43:19,059 --> 00:43:23,559
this is really an important thing as we

957
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:26,019
were the corn bean guys were kind of

958
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:28,869
caught up in that and that was the best

959
00:43:26,019 --> 00:43:31,900
thing we ever did was get was get rid of

960
00:43:28,869 --> 00:43:34,450
that corn bean corn bean corn bean we

961
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:38,019
got rid of our white mold issue I mean

962
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:40,440
you talk about a win-win situation so we

963
00:43:38,019 --> 00:43:42,759
plan a lot of different crops down there

964
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:45,460
you know and I've heard the comment

965
00:43:42,759 --> 00:43:47,920
today how do you make money on wheat how

966
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:49,310
do you make money on oats you plan a

967
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:55,490
cover behind them

968
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:58,430
you put your cattle on there so we had a

969
00:43:55,490 --> 00:44:00,950
we had a pivot it was filled peas and we

970
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:04,130
planned two full season cover in 2016

971
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:06,830
and the boys always passed you in so

972
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:08,600
what they'll do is they'll take the know

973
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:10,430
that they'll along the river they'll

974
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,960
take the cows on one side of the fence

975
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:13,670
and the calves on the other the calves

976
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:15,620
will stay next to the river where they

977
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:17,420
used to drink and out of and then

978
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:20,200
they'll then they'll just leave them

979
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:23,710
like that well this year what they did

980
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:26,060
so it was a we planted a 10-way mix

981
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:28,490
that's snow in the air these are the

982
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:32,000
calves so what they did is they put the

983
00:44:28,490 --> 00:44:34,580
pears in and then after about seven days

984
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,320
they took the cows out and the calves

985
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:38,870
didn't have any idea of what happened

986
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:41,330
they just they were so satisfied they

987
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:43,690
didn't care whatever but the one thing

988
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:46,040
that really noticeable about that

989
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:47,960
usually bring the cows home about the

990
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:50,900
fifteenth the septic Absalom about the

991
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:54,110
15th of September and this year we that

992
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:55,910
year they didn't have to because this is

993
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:57,530
like the seventh of November and them

994
00:44:55,910 --> 00:45:00,380
calves are still there and they're still

995
00:44:57,530 --> 00:45:02,870
doing good there's no dust there's

996
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:04,760
there's plenty of grazing so I that was

997
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:07,760
really a and we're gonna try to copy

998
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:11,390
that again we got two pivots kind of set

999
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:14,420
up for that purpose this coming year so

1000
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:17,120
this is a we planted the corn in 2017

1001
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:20,090
and this is a heavy Gumble circle heavy

1002
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:24,080
heavy soil when I broke them the circles

1003
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:26,780
back in 70 I don't know a 77 or 78 with

1004
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:29,150
the disc the there was two circles

1005
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:33,590
side-by-side 140-acre circle and this

1006
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:36,650
circle was virgin sod the homesteaders

1007
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:38,350
knew enough not to farm this so we

1008
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:41,270
always struggle with raising the crop

1009
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:43,150
always struggle so then we got into

1010
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:45,710
no-till and we really helped yourselves

1011
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:48,170
this is the second time this fields had

1012
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:50,180
covers on it and this respondent it's

1013
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:52,700
getting so we can manage it now we're

1014
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:55,280
getting good yields we had to 20-plus on

1015
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:56,960
it this year but this is something I'd

1016
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,880
like to be able to do it again and I

1017
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,410
don't know how but this is the volunteer

1018
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:02,650
come

1019
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:04,690
from the year before the cattle stomped

1020
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:08,109
the oats and the radishes and turnips in

1021
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:11,410
five minutes kale have to hustle but

1022
00:46:08,109 --> 00:46:15,640
they but it really is a win-win

1023
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:18,700
situation for the cattle so we started

1024
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:20,559
in 2016 I said well let's I think we can

1025
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:22,480
make more money raising the full season

1026
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:26,410
Covercraft of what we can plant wheat

1027
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:28,660
and I so we my goal was is so we planted

1028
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:31,390
June 6 and the tests double really

1029
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:33,250
diversified mix so you can see the one

1030
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:35,589
thing I really focused on is our micro

1031
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:37,599
rise I everything I put in there how to

1032
00:46:35,589 --> 00:46:40,720
had a reason we put it in there I wanted

1033
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:43,390
to 32 to 1 racial carbon and nitrogen so

1034
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:46,299
we'll just follow that through so this

1035
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:48,520
is our this is a quarter section we left

1036
00:46:46,299 --> 00:46:51,430
some in free strips I put a threeway in

1037
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:54,250
just to see why if the 3 would be rather

1038
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:56,980
than a 12 way put 50 pounds the end up

1039
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:59,530
planning and you know I didn't know if I

1040
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:01,089
should really do that or not and then je

1041
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:03,880
Fuhrer said he didn't think a guy should

1042
00:47:01,089 --> 00:47:05,740
and then this is where it cross Fitz's

1043
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:08,680
went when we fed during the wintertime

1044
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:11,980
so that we saw their different paddocks

1045
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:18,339
June 29th you can see the end free

1046
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:20,770
strips so full season

1047
00:47:18,339 --> 00:47:22,660
that's a hard picture to see but I loved

1048
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:25,750
kale kale the last way into the winter

1049
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:28,000
so here's what we what happened and so

1050
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:31,690
this is what we ended up with with most

1051
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:34,500
of field 80 200 pounds of biomass we're

1052
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:38,529
down to 25 to 1 carbon nitrogen ratio

1053
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:40,900
but you know 11 percent protein you can

1054
00:47:38,529 --> 00:47:43,270
see that how much more we gained from

1055
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:45,700
with the no end don't know in the

1056
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:48,640
earlier we had 7600 but it really fell

1057
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:52,720
off because the young succulent plants

1058
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:56,410
gave out with the cold weather so this

1059
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:59,289
is just the relative feed value so what

1060
00:47:56,410 --> 00:48:01,690
I did is is I said okay let's find out

1061
00:47:59,289 --> 00:48:03,880
what we're gonna do here so I wanted to

1062
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:04,980
know I knew how much it cost us I knew

1063
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:07,710
what I wanted to say

1064
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:09,630
we went ahead and I tracked all the the

1065
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:14,460
temperatures of what the cattle should

1066
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:16,470
eat there's a 650 had eaten there but

1067
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:18,960
one thing I didn't really count on we

1068
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:23,849
had a lot of snow and then we had we got

1069
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:25,950
really cold and sold in the long run we

1070
00:48:23,849 --> 00:48:28,500
had to feed if we fed 1/4 of our feeding

1071
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:30,030
through the wagon was it really a win it

1072
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:31,530
was still a win did we make as much

1073
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:34,859
money as we thought we did

1074
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:36,990
no we didn't but the big it really

1075
00:48:34,859 --> 00:48:40,200
showed up this year coming off that full

1076
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:42,300
season cover we wintered 150 head of

1077
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:44,160
deer and kind of waiting for the game

1078
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:48,630
fish and parks to pay us for that one

1079
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:51,329
but I guess we'll wait a while so Jason

1080
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:56,070
and Ruth and Hosea and Dwayne set up a

1081
00:48:51,329 --> 00:48:59,730
plot plan and this is kind of a so this

1082
00:48:56,070 --> 00:49:03,480
is 28% and then the rest of this is

1083
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:05,280
seated this way with their planning so

1084
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:06,930
here's what we come up with her they

1085
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,640
came up with I'm just here for the I

1086
00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:11,550
could say I get it but they're all here

1087
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:14,880
so I better not but one thing I really

1088
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:20,430
thought was so right now you take the

1089
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:25,829
one with the one with the no side side

1090
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:29,369
band in was 181 bushel no side band in

1091
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:32,910
was 149 beside with more nitrogen it was

1092
00:49:29,369 --> 00:49:35,819
less so we put the stream bar on the 2nd

1093
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:40,140
of May 46 degrees temperature humidity

1094
00:49:35,819 --> 00:49:43,349
74% but it was 7 days before we had a

1095
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:46,079
quarter inch of rain was out the reason

1096
00:49:43,349 --> 00:49:47,760
I used stream bars so I didn't want to

1097
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:50,520
spread it out I wanted to have a stream

1098
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:55,140
bar come down so the furiousness header

1099
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:57,569
was flowing and uh breaking it down so I

1100
00:49:55,140 --> 00:50:00,089
mean it just really showed us a lot of

1101
00:49:57,569 --> 00:50:01,829
things and you'll talk to Jason

1102
00:50:00,089 --> 00:50:04,650
Dwayne Routh or anybody and use your

1103
00:50:01,829 --> 00:50:06,869
yields or 10 to 12 percent more when you

1104
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:09,210
hand harvested these were hand harvested

1105
00:50:06,869 --> 00:50:11,190
so they're usually more they were dried

1106
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:11,849
down to 8 percent this is official as

1107
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:13,800
you could get

1108
00:50:11,849 --> 00:50:16,590
it's just like we the morning

1109
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:19,920
the more protein but look at here so

1110
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:21,450
everybody says boy I gotta like it's not

1111
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:26,430
such a thing it's put too much nitrogen

1112
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:31,290
on look what it did 100 180 pounds of

1113
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:35,450
nitrogen 176 bushel that's 60 pounds of

1114
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:35,450
nitrogen look what it cost it's 9 bushel

1115
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:43,110
11 bushel but so anything and the thing

1116
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:44,700
of it is on this field we're gonna go

1117
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:45,780
back on that same spot and they're gonna

1118
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:48,510
do that same thing they're gonna

1119
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:50,370
replicate the same exact spot everything

1120
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:51,960
is going to be the same we're gonna have

1121
00:50:50,370 --> 00:50:54,120
three or four of these trials around the

1122
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:57,060
farm we have to find out if we should be

1123
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:58,350
using one or one point - everybody's

1124
00:50:57,060 --> 00:51:00,180
going to be different we're not going to

1125
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:02,610
use one point - but we have to find out

1126
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:04,380
if we can use in our environment with

1127
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:06,570
our system we got to find out if we can

1128
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:09,570
use a eight tenths of a pound or nine

1129
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:13,580
tenths of a pound so this is a the one

1130
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:15,930
thing this we did a strip with the

1131
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:17,640
starter different rates have started but

1132
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:19,740
one thing I want you to notice so this

1133
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:23,430
was soil sampled in the spring before we

1134
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:26,520
planted corn and you'll see this time

1135
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:29,220
and time again I mean you know a lot of

1136
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:31,230
people talk about it after cover after

1137
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:34,500
cover later in the year you'll get a

1138
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:36,600
spike in your phosphorous and this here

1139
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:38,040
might have been a fluke the only thing

1140
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:40,500
is that a lot where they see at four

1141
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:42,060
point four then three point eight so I

1142
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:44,280
mean at least there's an increase I'm

1143
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:46,740
going to get hollered out again here so

1144
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:49,170
this is what this is basically how our

1145
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:51,300
plots turned out so there wasn't there

1146
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:55,260
wasn't any significant difference sent

1147
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:57,990
it to ward lab there's 388 pounds of

1148
00:51:55,260 --> 00:52:00,150
organic phosphorus in that soil the

1149
00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:03,360
micro rise I went and looked after the

1150
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:06,480
wind got that organic phosphorous this

1151
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:08,940
test right here is a twelve dollar and

1152
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:11,040
fifty cent test award lab if you want to

1153
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:13,950
find out your total phosphorous in the

1154
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:15,540
field so full season grazing we're going

1155
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:17,970
to do the same thing the only thing is

1156
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:21,420
I'm going to maybe try to increase the

1157
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:24,829
the carbon and nitrogen ratio it's going

1158
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:26,630
to be a dry so we soil sample

1159
00:52:24,829 --> 00:52:29,420
excuse me with planet covers and a lot

1160
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:32,059
of talk was his covers worth negative so

1161
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:34,969
we had this field side-by-side there

1162
00:52:32,059 --> 00:52:38,809
this did not have covered they were just

1163
00:52:34,969 --> 00:52:42,799
sixteen rows apart and so we went in so

1164
00:52:38,809 --> 00:52:45,410
I soil sampled it in the in in November

1165
00:52:42,799 --> 00:52:46,849
16 before the coroner is nine pounds

1166
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:50,089
where there wasn't cover there's 38

1167
00:52:46,849 --> 00:52:53,900
pounds so I came back and we soiled

1168
00:52:50,089 --> 00:52:58,279
sampler after corn harvest and we had 89

1169
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:59,779
pounds and here we had 38 so I gave it

1170
00:52:58,279 --> 00:53:02,809
back to us it just didn't give it back

1171
00:52:59,779 --> 00:53:06,680
to us in time for the the cattle I soil

1172
00:53:02,809 --> 00:53:09,739
I fertilize this accordingly so this is

1173
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:11,989
a our cover crop mix it's kind of a

1174
00:53:09,739 --> 00:53:16,789
there's a reason in that by I went to

1175
00:53:11,989 --> 00:53:21,709
that mix but this is what I the so we

1176
00:53:16,789 --> 00:53:25,459
ended up with a no cover was 160 with

1177
00:53:21,709 --> 00:53:27,619
cover is 156 so you take all it during

1178
00:53:25,459 --> 00:53:29,509
that cost you $26 when I credited

1179
00:53:27,619 --> 00:53:32,089
ourselves back to the residual end and

1180
00:53:29,509 --> 00:53:34,549
all I'm saying is you can't say anything

1181
00:53:32,089 --> 00:53:37,009
off the side by side this should even be

1182
00:53:34,549 --> 00:53:40,699
shown you've got to be replicated you

1183
00:53:37,009 --> 00:53:43,519
got to be replicated three times value

1184
00:53:40,699 --> 00:53:45,890
of it this is what our corn you know

1185
00:53:43,519 --> 00:53:47,779
this is these are three years these are

1186
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:49,849
three years all I'm trying to say is I

1187
00:53:47,779 --> 00:53:55,459
know the corn varieties gets part of

1188
00:53:49,849 --> 00:54:00,369
that but look at their 1994 19.5 2016

1189
00:53:55,459 --> 00:54:00,369
18.8 are we going in the right direction

1190
00:54:01,329 --> 00:54:06,920
this is what its kind of scares me a

1191
00:54:04,579 --> 00:54:09,469
little bit look at the amount of grass

1192
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:12,699
that came out in powder county look at

1193
00:54:09,469 --> 00:54:15,529
the amount of beans over 2006 to 2017

1194
00:54:12,699 --> 00:54:16,880
corn went up look at the winter wheat in

1195
00:54:15,529 --> 00:54:18,019
the winter if he's going to be less when

1196
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:22,190
if we going to be down there around

1197
00:54:18,019 --> 00:54:24,109
12,000 this year the teal Don beans is

1198
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:27,170
38 bushel the beans are gonna be way

1199
00:54:24,109 --> 00:54:29,390
over here so then we'll look at Davidson

1200
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:33,049
County look how much you guys took away

1201
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:36,999
from pasture increased soybeans some

1202
00:54:33,049 --> 00:54:36,999
corn some you eavesdropping

1203
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:43,330
corne retires 9 inches moisture

1204
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:46,630
vegetative growth adds 10 bushel for

1205
00:54:43,330 --> 00:54:49,750
each additional inch so a yield goal 140

1206
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:51,820
pounds how can you do that how can you

1207
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:54,390
reach that and it's organic matter the

1208
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:57,940
use of a savings account

1209
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:59,890
58% of organic matters carbon low

1210
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:03,790
disturbance no-till there's a lot of

1211
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:06,580
reasons we need to learn to farm to the

1212
00:55:03,790 --> 00:55:09,310
maximum profit not the maximum yield let

1213
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:11,260
the soil help you with that you know a

1214
00:55:09,310 --> 00:55:13,150
great deal of carbon to once restored

1215
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:14,890
the soil null storing the atmosphere and

1216
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:17,380
it's there you guys all we have to do is

1217
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:20,310
learn to get it and and we definitely

1218
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:23,860
need to return the carbon back to humans

1219
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:26,560
this is really makes you feel good

1220
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:30,940
because right here look at the youth on

1221
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:32,740
our farm and everybody says everybody

1222
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:35,200
said boy you guys got a lot of people on

1223
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:37,300
the farm well three of these aren't ours

1224
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:39,630
but you've got a lot of people on the

1225
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:42,100
farm and but everybody's get along fine

1226
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:43,960
we're making it work and we're not real

1227
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:45,970
big but we're making it work and just

1228
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:47,680
because we're we're trying to make the

1229
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:50,260
we're taking care of the soil and the

1230
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:52,720
soils taking care of us you know this is

1231
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:54,550
something that change happens when the

1232
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:57,790
pain of staying the same is greater than

1233
00:55:54,550 --> 00:56:03,130
the pain of change just think about that

1234
00:55:57,790 --> 00:56:06,280
I feel we should do everything we can to

1235
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:09,040
make this a better world and why who

1236
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:10,450
cares and just this picture is going to

1237
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:13,300
tell the story I'm not going to say

1238
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:19,680
anything about it I don't think we have

1239
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:19,680
a choice okay thank you guys sorry I

1240
00:56:21,370 --> 00:56:24,370
sorry
