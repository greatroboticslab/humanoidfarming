1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,680
Grapes are a popular fruit that holds

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,440
great potential for us in North Dakota.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,080
Here to teach us the basics of growing

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,960
grapes in our state is Dr. Harleen

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,039
Hatterman Valente. Harleen was born in

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,039
Nebraska and raised on a crop and animal

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,320
farm. And then she came to North Dakota

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:25,920
in 2000 as an assistant professor in the

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:29,199
high value crops project. Harleen has

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,560
conducted research on over 20 crops, but

11
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,960
grapes have been one of the most

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,920
predominant crops throughout her 25

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:39,280
years at North Dakota State University.

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:43,200
Harleen, welcome to the forums. Okay,

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:46,640
thank you Tom. Welcome. Okay, so we're

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:50,000
gonna get started here. So the goal in

17
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:54,640
this next 15 minutes is that going to

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,399
see handouts or slides where suggest

19
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,960
grapes that'll overwinter in North

20
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,359
Dakota. Very important. Determine some

21
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,879
of those cultural practices that'll help

22
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,400
you grow those grapes. Also very

23
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:11,360
important.

24
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:14,640
Um, if they don't ripen, I suppose in

25
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:18,159
jelly and juice, you could still add

26
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,640
more sugar and make that work, but to

27
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:24,320
have the best quality, you want to go

28
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,560
and have ripe grapes. Thus, going to

29
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,360
those first

30
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,439
two is very important. And if you get

31
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,280
all three of those, you'll probably get

32
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:37,680
this fourth one.

33
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:40,960
So site selection, a lot of us don't

34
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,840
have a choice. I just bringing this up

35
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,240
so that if you did have a choice,

36
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:50,640
there's some things you want to avoid.

37
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:53,920
Um, so if you are able to have that 1

38
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,479
and a half to 3% slope, you're going to

39
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,479
that's going to help move that cold air

40
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,399
down to the bottom. You don't want to be

41
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,040
down in that bottom. You could see on

42
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,040
the uh on that picture on the left hand

43
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:10,080
side your vineyard if

44
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:14,400
it's not in the bottom now you can be at

45
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:17,360
35 to 40 degrees there while someone who

46
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:21,920
had something to lower is going to go

47
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:24,480
and um get froze out. And I I've seen

48
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,959
this happen more in Montana where

49
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:32,080
actually I have some big differences in

50
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:36,400
terrain and in which they actually did

51
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:39,840
put grapes into a low area. It was a

52
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:43,360
nice flat level low area, but they had

53
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,920
this huge mountain that you know that

54
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:50,160
cold air would just come down.

55
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:53,200
um you can go and uh avoid that those

56
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,360
kind of frosts about 3 weeks if you're

57
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,959
on those hillsides instead of those

58
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,920
valleys. So big important thing if you

59
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:07,200
can get it on a south slope you're going

60
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:10,080
to um be able to uh control more of your

61
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,760
bud break. Now, it might be earlier, so

62
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,440
sometimes the south slope can be can be

63
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,680
bad, but you're going to get your

64
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,480
maximum daily temperature. You're going

65
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,560
to get a lot more foliage drying, which

66
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,640
will avoid a lot of your diseases.

67
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,120
You're going to get radiant heating,

68
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,840
which is going to be very beneficial.

69
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:34,080
Um, and your mid your winter

70
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:36,159
temperatures are going to be minimal.

71
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,360
um and your season length is going to be

72
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:41,560
as long as possible by having that south

73
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,480
uh slope. But

74
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:49,360
sometimes that south facing slope

75
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:52,799
because of our location we actually oh

76
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:55,599
I'd say maybe about a month ago we're

77
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,760
getting a lot of that sun has a lot of

78
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,560
warming

79
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:03,760
capabilities. So, um, what we see a lot

80
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:08,400
of times is on that south facing part of

81
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:11,200
a trunk, it it warms up, but then we,

82
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,439
you know, when the sun goes away, it

83
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,000
really drops down. That trunk has that

84
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,919
darker color, so it warms up, but then

85
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,479
we get back into the the real cold

86
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:26,400
temperatures and we cause some splitting

87
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:28,479
of the trunks. So um in those cases if

88
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,479
we can do something to minimize that

89
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:35,360
warming uh I think the long practice uh

90
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:39,199
with apple trees where they and some

91
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,840
other trees would be they go and paint

92
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,720
um white on the on the south facing part

93
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,680
of those trunks to avoid that heating up

94
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:51,199
and then cooling

95
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:54,000
down. Wind. Now we all know that North

96
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:58,560
Dakota is windy. Um maybe not this

97
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,520
windy, but um wind really can influence

98
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:05,280
temperature. A calm condition, as you

99
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:08,720
can see there, 18° higher temperature on

100
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,639
those leaves than if they're open to the

101
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,120
wind

102
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:18,240
blowing. And that also is really

103
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:21,840
important for the fruit because heat, it

104
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,880
controls the ripening. And thus we try

105
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:29,199
to get as much light

106
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:32,080
uh heat onto those uh grape clusters to

107
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,479
go and hasten ripening, which is very

108
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,919
important in North Dakota because of our

109
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:42,360
short season and the fact that we want

110
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:45,759
those um vines to start to acclimate for

111
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:48,479
dormcy as quickly as possible. So you

112
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:51,600
can use shelter belts, you can use south

113
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:56,160
sides of buildings, fences, and like

114
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:58,880
that to help go and reduce um that real

115
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,400
strong wind. You want a light breeze. A

116
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:07,639
light breeze isn't bad. Um but really

117
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:10,960
strong winds aren't good. Um, as far as

118
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:16,080
soil, really the only time you have to

119
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:19,680
be concerned is if you have a a hybrid

120
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:23,039
grape that has a lot of labusa in it.

121
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:26,400
Um, so Concord, something that says it

122
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:30,880
was I know they're seedless concords

123
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:34,160
that when that soil gets above seven,

124
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:39,080
they tend to show iron chlorosis.

125
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:41,199
Um, an example that we've have seen is

126
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:46,039
Bluebell, which you might have heard.

127
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:49,039
That's a Elmer Swansson one. Uh, here's

128
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:50,639
ES5471. Another Elmer Swenson one. Well,

129
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,880
all three of them are, but this one

130
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,440
never got released, but could be

131
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:59,199
available. And then Louise Swenson. All

132
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:02,400
of them have quite a bit of labus labusa

133
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:05,840
in them. Uh thus they have larger

134
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:09,840
berries kind of like concord grapes. Um

135
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:12,960
and we have seen where you'll have u

136
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,440
problems with some iron chlorosis. So if

137
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:19,360
you because we do tend to have soils

138
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:22,680
that are above uh a soil pH of seven. So

139
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,360
in those cases you need to add some

140
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:28,000
sulfur if you're trying to grow those

141
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,840
crops and you start to see those iron

142
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,400
chlorosis symptoms.

143
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:38,800
fertility. Too much fertility is a

144
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:42,240
problem because instead of going and

145
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:45,280
those vines putting that into the fruit

146
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:51,599
and into the production, it usually puts

147
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:52,960
it into canes that go to ta um uh to I

148
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:56,400
was going to say Carrington, probably

149
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:59,840
not that far. Um but Castleton and you

150
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:03,400
know just you got end up with 20 foot

151
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:06,160
long canes which isn't

152
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,240
needed and then starts to cause all

153
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,759
kinds of

154
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:14,400
problems. What I generally tell people

155
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:18,720
about 50 pounds of nitrogen per acre

156
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:22,800
um on a yearly basis. Now, in the in the

157
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:25,360
Fargo area, we have clay and and higher

158
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:29,520
organic matter. So, you need to count

159
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:32,880
that in. So, 1% organic matter releases

160
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:36,240
about 20 pounds of nitrogen per acre per

161
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:39,680
year. So, if you don't go and um in

162
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:42,080
those um soils that have higher organic

163
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,240
matter, if you don't go and incorporate

164
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:48,160
utilize that, you're going to be putting

165
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:51,760
way too much on um and thus have that

166
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:54,440
excess growth. I've also seen the

167
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:58,120
opposite where you know

168
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:02,880
after 10 years they haven't put on any

169
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:06,640
um nitrogen and they have a lot of grass

170
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:10,399
growing right up next to uh the vines

171
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:13,360
competing for any kind of nutrients and

172
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:16,640
out competing and thus they aren't they

173
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:20,160
don't have enough growth. They got um

174
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,800
canes that are only about um a foot and

175
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,880
a half, two foot long, and that

176
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,560
definitely isn't a a hybrid

177
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:31,440
grape. So,

178
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,519
um it's important to know what type of

179
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,240
grape what you want to do with these

180
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:40,240
grapes. If you're trying to make, like I

181
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:43,680
said earlier, juice, uh, jam or jelly,

182
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:47,399
uh, if they don't ripen completely, you

183
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:50,800
can go and and easily add some sugar and

184
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:53,920
and still be able to go and and make

185
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:57,120
your juice, jam, and jelly. Uh, table

186
00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:00,959
grapes. the the problem with table

187
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:04,320
grapes is we don't have a lot of cold

188
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:06,600
hearty table grapes uh which are

189
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,760
seedless. Now if you

190
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:12,480
consider something like uh these three

191
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:17,680
that have seeds in them as table grapes

192
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:20,079
well then um but nobody wants uh grapes

193
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:23,360
to eat that have seeds and that you have

194
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:25,360
to spit seeds all the time. Uh,

195
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,640
University of Minnesota is working on

196
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:32,399
this. So are we on trying to introd um

197
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:37,600
find and develop some really cold hearty

198
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:40,480
um seedless table grapes. Wine wine's a

199
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,480
little bit more difficult because um

200
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,839
there's all kinds of characteristics

201
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:49,519
that you need uh those grapes to be at

202
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:53,200
when you harvest them so that you can

203
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:56,160
make a proper wine. PH is important,

204
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:59,480
titratable acidity is important, as well

205
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:03,600
as the bricks or the

206
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:07,360
sugar. Okay. Um, grapes for North

207
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:10,120
Dakota. Uh, well, of course, we know

208
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:13,760
that we need to have low temperature

209
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:16,399
tolerance. We're in a 4A, as you can see

210
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:19,360
here in the Fargo area. If we went out

211
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:23,240
west to the Williston area, they're

212
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,760
closer they're closer to a 3B.

213
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:28,240
Um,

214
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:32,480
and I think there's still that there's

215
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:35,279
been some uh re redoing of uh actually

216
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:38,720
the cold hardiness zones, but for the

217
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:40,399
most part, most of North Dakota is a 4A.

218
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:45,839
Um, there could be some parts that are

219
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:49,279
more 3B. Um, you need to also consider

220
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:52,560
uh your growing degree days. Uh, you can

221
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:55,760
see here now it's supposed to get colder

222
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,959
in Willist than it does in Fargo, but

223
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:01,920
they have more heat during the summer or

224
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:05,839
during that growing season than we do.

225
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:09,360
Just a little bit. And but the Fargo

226
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:11,120
area has a few more days that are frost

227
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,880
free. So, we're talking from the last

228
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:17,279
spring frost to the first spring freeze.

229
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:22,360
And once that happens, those grapes

230
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:26,200
don't ripen anymore. Um, so

231
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:30,639
um you might have a cultivar

232
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:34,639
that is marginally uh adapted to this

233
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:36,959
area. So, you see some it dies back and

234
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:42,320
that that's the worst part about it. it

235
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:44,800
dies back or um you lose all uh it

236
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:48,000
breaks bud really really early and you

237
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:50,480
lose all of those on a consistent basis

238
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,440
and then you don't get any fruit because

239
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:56,399
the fruit comes on the previous year's

240
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,800
buds. So if you don't have those buds

241
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,920
survive, you won't get any fruit that

242
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:06,000
year and thus you'll have one year

243
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,000
without as you're starting all

244
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:16,160
over. Okay, cultivars. And you can see

245
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:17,800
here I put there's like I said there's a

246
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:22,639
lot more

247
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:28,560
wine grapes available than there are um

248
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:30,880
those strictly for for juice and and um

249
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:35,680
and that's be or table. And that's

250
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:39,440
because really um for our season and for

251
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:42,880
what's available so far, it it just

252
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:47,360
that's a market that works for us. Uh

253
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:50,480
two white grapes that we recently u

254
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:54,399
introduced and released by NDSU are

255
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:57,120
Dakota Primis. Uh which you're looking

256
00:13:54,399 --> 00:14:02,240
at that you're like, well, that isn't

257
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:06,760
white at all. And it it's more of a gree

258
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:09,839
as far as the color, but that skin

259
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:11,920
color, even if you were to ferment on

260
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,880
the skins, which you usually don't do

261
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:18,959
with whites, you'll maybe get a little

262
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:22,639
bit of more of a pinkish. and and

263
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:26,959
actually the darkness that you'll get

264
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:30,639
with this um cultivar has a lot to do

265
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:35,360
with how hot the summer is. If we don't

266
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:38,160
have a really great warm summer, um it

267
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,440
might be a little bit more kind of

268
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:44,720
closer to the prairie

269
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:47,360
star a and then you'll see with uh and

270
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:52,320
maybe just a little bit of uh light

271
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:54,959
reening in in those uh berries.

272
00:14:52,320 --> 00:15:00,880
The other one is radiant and you can see

273
00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:04,480
it looks green and um but still is is a

274
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:08,480
white wine and it may turn a little bit

275
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:12,399
more yellow similar to uh Prairie Star

276
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:16,639
as it ripens, but it's more of a it's um

277
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:20,160
more of a a a green type grape for uh

278
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:22,639
that is used for white wine.

279
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,720
Uh you can see there's a whole list of

280
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:28,320
things

281
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:31,279
here. Um and the only one for table is

282
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,279
what we call summer well it is called

283
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:36,399
Somerset seedless. It's a release by

284
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:39,440
Elmer Swenson. Um we call it somewhat

285
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:44,320
seedless because there are seed remnants

286
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:46,959
in there. Uh however um they're they're

287
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,519
you know really no problem whatsoever.

288
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:52,720
gives a little bit of that you can

289
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:55,680
notice it. You never would notice it in

290
00:15:52,720 --> 00:16:00,079
a raisin if you dried these for raisins.

291
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:03,920
Um and so and oh if you were to dry

292
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:07,440
those for raisins, you would never buy a

293
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:10,880
storebought raisin again because these

294
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:13,759
have so much more flavor than anything

295
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:16,920
you could ever get in the store. raisins

296
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:21,759
from the store are just like little

297
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:25,480
chewy sugar drops, you know, um versus

298
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:28,600
you you really get some good grape

299
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:31,920
flavor. This year we're going to start

300
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:34,800
evaluating some of the seedless

301
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:37,160
um I'd say advanced selections from the

302
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,079
University of Minnesota.

303
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:42,560
uh

304
00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:45,519
and you know they can't just like um

305
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:48,560
they can't put down what the numbers are

306
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,720
uh for uh purposes of patenting and like

307
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:54,720
that. So they called it grape r which

308
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:58,000
was the red one. And you can see how um

309
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:00,440
how that shape is. And they feel like

310
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,600
this is an improvement over Somerset

311
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:08,079
seedless cluster. Looks a lot similar to

312
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:12,919
Somerset Seedless. Uh grape B or blue.

313
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:16,319
Uh again, it has this uh unique uh

314
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:19,280
blueberry taste to it. And they've been

315
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:23,280
looking at it uh in processing for

316
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:26,079
frozen as well as baked. And um because

317
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:29,200
it isn't real large, you know, maybe

318
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:32,400
some mechanical harvesting because it is

319
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,480
rather tough though um unlike some most

320
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:39,039
of your other table grapes. You would

321
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:41,440
never consider um a red globe to go and

322
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:43,760
try to do any kind of mechanical

323
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:47,360
harvesting with that.

324
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:51,520
And then the last one is this uh G or

325
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:53,600
green um grape. And you can see it

326
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:57,919
almost to me it looks more like a lac

327
00:17:53,600 --> 00:18:00,559
crescent cluster. Um and uh it talks

328
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:03,919
about having those aromatic and tropical

329
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:08,320
flavors which is a lot like lacrescent.

330
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:11,120
Um but this is a a seedless. So, uh, the

331
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:14,360
only thing I do know about these is they

332
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:18,480
they feel like they're good in zone

333
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:21,840
five. Well, which is down by the cities.

334
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:24,960
We aren't zone five. I'm going to try

335
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:27,320
these on campus where we have a little

336
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,840
bit more protected

337
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:32,160
um

338
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:34,240
microclimate. Uh but we'll we'll it'll

339
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,240
be a wait and see and maybe there's

340
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:40,200
something that we can do to try to

341
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:44,799
hasten because they all

342
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:47,280
um the harvest time is um well you can

343
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:50,080
see for the grape G it's over 3 to four

344
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:54,799
weeks but they're all towards the later

345
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:58,000
part of the season not real early so it

346
00:18:54,799 --> 00:19:00,000
it will be diff um interesting to see

347
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,559
what happens with these three and

348
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,840
hopefully we can keep everyone a breast

349
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:08,000
of what's going on, let alone um we're

350
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:11,440
planting our first ones in the field

351
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,080
this year for seedless

352
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,000
um

353
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:19,200
evaluation. Okay, so let's go and start

354
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:23,039
talking about some um production. Oh

355
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:25,440
boy. Um you most of the time you're

356
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:27,919
going to go and get dormant rootstock.

357
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,799
They're not going to ship that to until

358
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,559
towards the end of May to be planted.

359
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,559
Maybe they'll ship it sooner and then

360
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:37,280
you have to keep it in a cooler or do

361
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,919
something to keep that cool um unless

362
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:44,160
you go and get those at a nursery that

363
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:47,120
has potted up plants. Um because you

364
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,200
only wanted one or two. Nice thing about

365
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,720
grapes

366
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:54,559
is almost everything that's going to be

367
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:56,880
available to you are complete flowers.

368
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:59,120
So you don't have to go and have

369
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,880
something go and pollinate it. So

370
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:04,440
they're not like apples. You don't need

371
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:07,360
crosspollination. So if you just wanted

372
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:11,200
one, you would you could actually just

373
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:14,320
get one. Um, if you got green material,

374
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:18,400
you want to probably wait until the end

375
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:21,600
of or until June after that May 31st,

376
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:25,240
which is usually the time for the last

377
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:28,640
the latest risk of frost in North

378
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:30,880
Dakota. Dimensions for planting, I think

379
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:35,600
that all depends on the space that you

380
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:39,240
have. Um, and again, if you're only

381
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:43,159
having a couple of plants, then a lot of

382
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:46,400
this doesn't make um isn't important for

383
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:49,799
you. Weed Whoops, got ahead of myself.

384
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:53,280
Weed control is kind of important um

385
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:56,559
because anytime you have a lot of weeds

386
00:20:53,280 --> 00:21:00,240
growing around that basin um competing

387
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:03,039
with that root system, um that's not

388
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:06,480
good. Likewise, if you're going to put a

389
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:08,960
mulch down right away, don't use

390
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:12,400
something like straw.

391
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,720
We've done a study where we've gotten um

392
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,120
one-year-old dormant cutings. We put

393
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,520
them in the ground and we use straw as a

394
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:22,640
mulch and the microbes are going to go

395
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:25,360
and be using all the nitrogen that's in

396
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:28,960
that soil to go and break down that

397
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:31,600
straw because it has a very high carbon

398
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,679
to nitro or high carbon amount in

399
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,320
comparison to nitrogen. So those

400
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,000
microbes are going to need nitrogen and

401
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:41,520
the only place they're going to find it

402
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,520
is in the soil. So those vines will

403
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:48,159
really struggle if you use something

404
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:51,240
like um straw that first year. Now later

405
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:54,640
on, you know, when you got nice

406
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:58,919
established vines, I I suppose straw

407
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:02,400
would be just fine because

408
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:04,720
um they're just have a good root system

409
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,960
and you're going to be applying some of

410
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:10,799
that nitrogen on an annual basis

411
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:14,880
anyway. Uh you want to start then your

412
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:18,000
trellis construction afterwards. And uh

413
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:21,400
but really that first year all you're

414
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,440
trying to do is get those vines

415
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:26,320
established. A lot of people will say,

416
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:30,080
"Oh, do I go and put well let me go and

417
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:32,880
do I go and put road tubes around them?"

418
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,960
Yes. If you have problems with anything

419
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,520
like rabbits,

420
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:41,360
um deer, then this is going to be

421
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:43,400
helpful. What we found is that a grow

422
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:47,880
tube isn't

423
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:52,640
necessarily needed. Um, as long

424
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:55,120
as you're you're um acclimating if

425
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,679
you're using plants, they're acclimated

426
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:00,400
before you put them out there and thus

427
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,720
aren't going to go and be thrown into a

428
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,640
different kind of

429
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,559
environment. for as long as you don't

430
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,880
have a lot of those little critters that

431
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:11,280
want to go and destroy everything for

432
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,120
you. So, the first year we're really

433
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,200
working on the root growth. I wouldn't

434
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,120
do any pruning. I wouldn't try I just

435
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,240
try to keep them growing as much as

436
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:22,640
possible because that they're uh

437
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,799
whatever you get for the root starting

438
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,320
there, it's going to be the basis.

439
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:29,400
That's going to be like your foundation

440
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:31,600
for your house. you have a poor

441
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:34,000
foundation, the rest of the house isn't

442
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,000
going to stand up very well. Second

443
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,039
year's going to start working on your

444
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:43,600
vine architecture, doing some pruning,

445
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:46,000
and you might leave a few clusters to

446
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,080
taste, but really most of those clusters

447
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,520
you should remove because you're still

448
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:53,840
working on that foundation. Finally,

449
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:56,799
your third year, you can go and keep

450
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,480
your fruit.

451
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:01,520
I'm going to go over that because I

452
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:05,360
could see how much lack of time I have.

453
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:08,799
Um, and again, those kind of m trellis

454
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:13,000
materials all depend on how many vines

455
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:15,400
you're going to get and and um and your

456
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,919
location, but you're going to need

457
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,000
something. Uh, even though I say they

458
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:23,279
have a

459
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:26,480
trunk, they don't have a really good

460
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:28,720
they need support. So, you need to find

461
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:32,640
some way of supporting these so that

462
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:35,919
they're upright. And stuff to consider

463
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:38,559
are, you know, your physical limitations

464
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:41,520
on on how you're going to grow them. Can

465
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:44,159
you go and put them on a high wire that

466
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,919
generally is six foot tall? Well, do you

467
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,159
want to always have your hands up in the

468
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:50,480
air when you're working on those? Do you

469
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,960
want them maybe a little bit lower? you

470
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,919
want to maybe go with a midwire and

471
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:58,799
train everything to grow

472
00:24:54,919 --> 00:25:01,360
upwards and thus have that fruit um at

473
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:04,360
that midwire which is about three foot.

474
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:09,039
All of those things are

475
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:11,520
important. Okay, pruning. It's important

476
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:14,720
that you go and have balanced pruning

477
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,840
because um you need to control your

478
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:20,799
crop.

479
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:23,000
Um, most of the time you'll remove 80%.

480
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:27,840
You can see it almost looks like maybe

481
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:30,720
90% of what was there. Um, because if

482
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:34,400
you don't, you're going to overcrop it.

483
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:36,600
And especially in in North Dakota,

484
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:40,600
that's really important that you don't

485
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,600
overcrop. Um,

486
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:50,400
um, yeah. bud fruitfulness. Also,

487
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:52,080
another thing on um so having all that

488
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:55,440
growth and like that if you didn't go

489
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:57,440
and take any of these uh canes off from

490
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,960
the previous year, that means you're

491
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:03,320
going to have lots and lots of layers of

492
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:06,480
leaves. And the more shading onto those

493
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:10,240
clusters, the less fruitful those buds

494
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:13,640
will be um at on those clusters, the

495
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:18,080
slower they'll ripen. But also those

496
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:20,080
nodes and buds for next year, they'll

497
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:23,039
get less light too. So they're going to

498
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:26,080
be less fruitful. So sunlight exposure

499
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,080
is really, really

500
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:33,279
important. Here shows differences for

501
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:38,559
different locations. Generally, we use

502
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:41,760
this 30 + 10 for any kind of grapes we

503
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:45,679
grow, especially the wine grapes in in

504
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:48,080
North Dakota. And that plus 10 means if

505
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:52,559
you get more than

506
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:55,600
uh two pounds of pruning from that wood,

507
00:26:52,559 --> 00:27:00,480
oh, one pound pruning. What am I I

508
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:03,120
getting off? So, um No. So, if you if

509
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:06,760
you're pruning and from a vine you get

510
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:11,360
more than two pounds of pruning, you can

511
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:13,840
add 10 more buds and have a total of 40

512
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:16,039
for this. But we're using this lowest

513
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,640
one right here

514
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:20,960
um

515
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:24,240
for almost all of ours. Now, if you've

516
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:27,520
got more than 2 lb and you're way up

517
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:31,919
here at at 4 lb

518
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:35,200
um and you can see um where we have, you

519
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:37,720
know, the um number of fruit like that,

520
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:40,159
you are this means you're

521
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:43,039
undercropping and you're you're not

522
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:45,400
leaving enough fruit. But if you're way

523
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:48,720
up here,

524
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:52,640
um then you're overcropping. I always

525
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,880
try if I have two pounds per vine and we

526
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,720
take out just a little fish scale. After

527
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,720
a little bit, you you don't even need

528
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:03,279
that scale. You kind of know what's

529
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:05,120
what. Um but 30 + 10 is lot what we use.

530
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:07,960
And I'm not going to go over all this

531
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:11,080
because I can see I'm already at that

532
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:13,760
time. Um some

533
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:16,799
characteristics. Shoot density. So per

534
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:20,000
foot of shoot or canopy.

535
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:24,399
um you want three to five shoots to be

536
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:27,840
coming out. So that means um three to

537
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:30,159
five nodes per foot more on that you

538
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,480
know hopefully on that usually in a foot

539
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,039
you can get three nodes. If you get more

540
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,440
than that

541
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:40,200
um it it means that that vine might be

542
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:43,840
under stress that it has shorter

543
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:48,480
nodes. Well I'm going to go over that um

544
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:50,720
chute thinning. Okay. So, this is done

545
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,760
to open the canopy, but it all depends

546
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:56,880
on what kind of trellis. If you have

547
00:28:53,760 --> 00:29:01,760
your um trunk going up and then you put

548
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:05,279
out cordons or arms and thus have uh

549
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:08,159
just removing most of that cane wood

550
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:10,640
leaving two shoots at each of these what

551
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:14,679
is called spurs.

552
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:17,840
What happens on that is then as those

553
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:20,880
vines grow, they get longer, you comb

554
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,799
them down, and then when they're about

555
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,720
to touch the ground, you want to go and

556
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:28,399
prune that off.

557
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:30,720
Um, they talk about a lot of times

558
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:34,159
shootute thinning before those canes get

559
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:38,240
18 in long. That's because you don't

560
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:40,880
need um that much. You need 15 to 20

561
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:44,000
leaves to to go and ripen those two to

562
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:48,039
three clusters that's on a chute. All

563
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:51,360
that extra is is

564
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:54,000
just extra stuff that might help might

565
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:56,480
go and actually go and cover up and

566
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,120
shade a lot of that. The problem is

567
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:02,960
minute you start doing some pruning you

568
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:06,000
get what is called lateral shoots. These

569
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:09,399
have no kind of fruit on them and they

570
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,960
start to shade things out.

571
00:30:09,399 --> 00:30:15,919
So shootute

572
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:19,200
thinning a lot of times is very helpful

573
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:22,159
on on going and keeping enough light

574
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:25,600
onto these and removing those lateral

575
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:28,159
shoots. It comes to a lot of work. Some

576
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:30,399
people will even actually remove leaves

577
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:35,520
that are around the clusters to help

578
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:37,399
expose those grapes to um that uh uh the

579
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:41,399
sunlight to those

580
00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:44,080
clusters. Crop thinning. Well,

581
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:46,640
um oh, but if you're going to go and

582
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:49,760
remove those leaves, you don't wait

583
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:52,480
until you know the clusters are really

584
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:55,679
huge. you need to start before you get

585
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:58,840
to verasion because otherwise

586
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:03,039
um and maybe you only do it on the west

587
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:05,360
side or or on the um east side. The west

588
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:07,279
side is going to be warmer than the east

589
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:11,919
side. So you remove them on the east

590
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:14,080
side to help get those um leaves or the

591
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:16,000
clusters a little bit warmer and you

592
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:21,200
don't have to worry as much about

593
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,679
suncalding or sunburning those clusters.

594
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,640
um crop

595
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:27,840
thinning. If you're going to do

596
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:30,799
something like that, you you would do

597
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:34,240
that, you uh would wait until about four

598
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:40,679
weeks after fruit set. Fruit set occurs

599
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:43,760
in um early June. So, um so by early

600
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:46,320
July, you would know whether or not you

601
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:49,919
have way too many clusters to go and get

602
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:52,960
them ripen in time. And then then you

603
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:55,519
can start to go and oh, I got three

604
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,240
clusters on this cane. I don't need all

605
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:02,080
three. I'm going to just remove one and

606
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:04,880
keep two. A lot of times one to two

607
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:07,919
clusters per cane is good.

608
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:10,000
So, and of course you always want to if

609
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:12,559
sometimes there's a stress and they

610
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,279
might throw out some more late clusters

611
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:17,679
or do some flowering and then you have

612
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:19,679
um some late clusters, always remove

613
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,799
those because they're just going to go

614
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:27,159
and cause

615
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:31,360
problems. Okay, last little bit Fred.

616
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:35,279
Okay, herbicide injury by 24D is going

617
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:38,640
to be can be really common. Grapes are

618
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:41,679
really susceptible to 24D, even more so

619
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:44,240
than dicama. So, you see this fanning

620
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:46,320
and if they're in your backyard, there's

621
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,720
a lot of people using 24D on their

622
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:51,519
lawns. Thus, you might see something

623
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,080
like this happening.

624
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:56,159
Um

625
00:32:53,080 --> 00:33:00,240
birds, especially for homeowners, you

626
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:02,640
might need to do some netting because uh

627
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:06,159
birds really like grapes. They like a

628
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:08,200
lot of fruit. So, and when you only have

629
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:12,120
one to

630
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:16,519
two, that really puts a target on those.

631
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:20,720
So, dear raccoon rabbits, I'm going to

632
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:22,720
questions. I did poor Tom.

633
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,360
Sorry,

634
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:27,440
I warned you. You're You're just too

635
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:30,080
knowledgeable. Got too much information

636
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,399
to share. Well, I got too many stories,

637
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:34,720
I think. I know. It's because of all

638
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:37,159
your years of working with this prop.

639
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,200
Now, listen. So, we got rapid fire

640
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:41,200
questions. Really quick answers. We're

641
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,519
going to be done in five minutes. Okay,

642
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:46,320
Arlene. First of all, would any grape

643
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:49,440
varieties work well in a high tunnel?

644
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:52,320
The problem with that all of these if

645
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:55,279
they're hardy enough for outside they're

646
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:58,000
they're good for a high tunnel. The

647
00:33:55,279 --> 00:34:00,960
thing that you can't do is you can't

648
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,960
think because I have a high tunnel um

649
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,360
which is going to give you more heat

650
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:08,399
that you're going to go and be able to

651
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:11,200
have something less hardy cold hearty

652
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:13,440
because in the winter

653
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,839
um especially at night you don't have

654
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,240
that the plastic doesn't retain that

655
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:19,839
heat. So your outside temperature is

656
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:24,240
going to be the same as what's going to

657
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:26,240
be in that high tunnel. Uh, thus okay,

658
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,919
that's good. Pick a hardy variety.

659
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:31,359
They'll all work. They have to be

660
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:34,079
hearty. This person is, is a grape

661
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:36,480
seedless due to genetics or is it seed

662
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:40,079
or can I make a grape variety seedless

663
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:44,480
by eliminating manganesees away from the

664
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:46,079
plant? No genetics. It's genetics. Now,

665
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,359
what was that variety you liked for

666
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:51,040
raisins? Oh, Somerset seedless. Yeah,

667
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:53,760
you want a seedless variety. And that's

668
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:56,399
really the only hardy reliable hearty

669
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:59,760
variety we got. Now this person lived in

670
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:03,119
Dickinson and they grew Fontineac Gree

671
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:06,880
Prairie Star and Lac Crescent. But now

672
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:09,280
they moved to West Fargo. Which one of

673
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,400
those would that would you recommend?

674
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:17,119
Oh, actually all three of them would be

675
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:22,440
even better. we get more rainfall and um

676
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:26,400
and so um depends if they w you know L

677
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:28,480
crescent is more fruity but if you if we

678
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,880
ever get a really bad winter then L

679
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,839
crescent has it really likes to throw

680
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:37,440
out volcanes and uh uh it can be

681
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:41,200
difficult but all three of them um front

682
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,960
or front gree will will make more of a a

683
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,320
straw colored wine

684
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,520
But they could do all three of them

685
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:50,079
would be fine. West Fargo, this person

686
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:52,480
has an old neglected grape vine. Should

687
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:57,040
they cut it to the ground or just dig it

688
00:35:52,480 --> 00:36:00,640
out? Uh, you can rejuvenate old grapes,

689
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:03,599
grape vines. Um, but you're going to

690
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:05,920
again, um, what happens with old vines

691
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:10,000
is that if you haven't done anything,

692
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:12,320
it's only that one year old wood that's

693
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,760
going to have fruit. So you're going to

694
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:19,760
have to do some major cutting back um

695
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:23,520
and then keep pruning. So I would u cut

696
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:26,880
it back to uh generally we like to have

697
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:29,839
two arms and do cordons. Uh you might

698
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:32,400
have uh you know do a little bit more

699
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:36,240
cutting back. Also, you could also work

700
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,960
at a lot of times they'll set up a um a

701
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,599
sucker will come up from the

702
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:45,680
base, make that your new trunk, and then

703
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:48,240
you can go and lop off everything else

704
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:50,160
or two trunks.

705
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:54,000
How about uh when's the best time to

706
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:56,560
prune a grape vine? Before it starts to

707
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,560
um open the buds. Those buds become

708
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:03,839
really easy just to knock off. So, um,

709
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:06,760
now we just had a pruning clinic, uh,

710
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:09,599
by, um, air, um,

711
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:12,480
yesterday and they were still dormant

712
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:14,240
and so this is a good time. Other people

713
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,440
go out when it's colder and they have

714
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:19,359
their gloves on, but boy, this kind of

715
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:22,880
weather is just perfect. If you can go

716
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:25,520
and get it done quickly, do it now. Are

717
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,520
all grape leaves edible for Greek

718
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,839
recipes?

719
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:32,560
Yeah, but I would probably avoid the

720
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:34,720
ones that have all the white tomatoss on

721
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:38,480
the backside. I don't think those would

722
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:41,599
be as tasty as something that um isn't

723
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,920
as pubescent on the underside. Okay. How

724
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:47,560
about what variety is best for up north

725
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,560
in the Turtle Mountains?

726
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:53,200
Oh, well, what are they trying to do

727
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:57,440
with it? Well, ju I would guess juice.

728
00:37:53,200 --> 00:38:00,920
Okay. um our only choice. Our overall

729
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:03,599
our our heartiest grapes that we've ever

730
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:05,680
tested are valiant and king of the

731
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:09,520
north.

732
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:11,760
Um it's good. Is spotted winged a

733
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:16,359
concern with grapes?

734
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:19,280
Not unless you have problems where with

735
00:38:16,359 --> 00:38:22,000
rainfall in the fall that you start to

736
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:25,920
get little fissures or little openings

737
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:29,920
by where they attach to the stem that

738
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:33,200
then um valiant has been the only grape

739
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:36,400
that we've seen anyone report um spotted

740
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:40,079
Wayne Drosophila. And again, um, we feel

741
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:42,720
like it was because of some rainfall

742
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:45,040
which then put a crack and then the

743
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:49,680
spotted winged or soft said, "Hey, thank

744
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:52,000
you." and laid some eggs. Start my own

745
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:54,560
grape vine from a wild grape and just

746
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,920
take a cutting and stick it in a pot and

747
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:59,760
get started. Yeah, you can. Okay, that's

748
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:03,040
good. What's the best mulch you would

749
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:06,160
use in an established vine? Shredded

750
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:09,760
bark. Uh shredded bark would be good.

751
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:13,200
Yep. Um because the and the larger the

752
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:17,839
chunks, the the slower the degradation

753
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:19,839
would occur. How about Marshall Foch?

754
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:23,760
Are those Marshall Foch? Are those

755
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:27,200
seedless? No, that is a French American

756
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:30,320
wine grape. Yeah, that's not a party

757
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:32,960
here, is it? Or it's marginal. Uh kind

758
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:36,480
of iffy. Yeah, not looking the best out

759
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:38,079
in our variety trial. Okay, well that's

760
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,839
going to do it for for this

761
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:41,680
presentation. Thank you. Was loaded with

762
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:45,440
information. I couldn't get to all the

763
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:47,680
questions, but you can contact Harleen

764
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,440
and or you can contact your local county

765
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,680
agent. They can help you and also

766
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:56,119
myself. We'll be happy to help you.

767
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:56,119
Okay. Thank you, Harleen, so much.
