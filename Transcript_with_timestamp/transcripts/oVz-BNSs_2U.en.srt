1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,730
this week at the moment we've been

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:05,130
putting in the very earliest of our

3
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:07,200
pansies and as well as our ranunculus

4
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,330
and then through into June and we'll

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,460
finish off with our bulbs there's no

6
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,900
real way of avoiding the bending there's

7
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,820
plenty of time spent on the hands and

8
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,949
knees during this time of the year but

9
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,289
we do have a few tools that we use to to

10
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:21,570
alleviate some of that we stagger our

11
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:23,880
planting dates through the nursery one

12
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,730
to assist with them and their bench

13
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,130
space and allow us to plant throughout a

14
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,599
period of about eight to ten weeks other

15
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,850
one we're currently planting there's

16
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,610
about 450 pansies that have gone into

17
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,469
the border and approximately 250

18
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,090
ranunculus in the middle but in Queens

19
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:41,370
Park Gardens here we'll be looking in

20
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,620
the vicinity of 35 to 40 thousand

21
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,690
seedlings and approximately five to six

22
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,260
thousand bulbs it is a lot of work but

23
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,260
well worth it

24
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,280
you
