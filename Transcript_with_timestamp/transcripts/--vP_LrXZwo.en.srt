00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,640
i'm standing in a field with a cover

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,320
crop mix planted

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,800
and

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:16,960
this probably went in around the middle

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:19,279
of july it is now the 29th of august

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,600
so this was a wheat field that was

7
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,480
harvested so we're seeing

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,960
some

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,000
volunteer wheat coming up as it normally

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,320
does

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,160
and

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,519
the obvious thing is that buckwheat is

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,640
flowering

14
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,399
um that's going to make seeds so that's

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,160
obviously a problem

16
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,920
we have

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,360
radish

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,800
lots of radish

19
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:47,520
that is doing nicely

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,600
but many of them are really pale so it

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,280
is running out of nitrogen

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,239
so it's retrieving all the nitrogen but

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,559
a good

24
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,600
radish cover crop should have a better

25
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:02,079
nitrogen supply than this one does

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,000
we have a few odds and ends so we've got

27
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,080
a soybean coming up

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,159
we've got corn coming up

29
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,240
don't know what they're doing

30
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,439
sunflowers were part of the mix and here

31
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,520
and there

32
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,600
the sunflowers are doing

33
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,520
very well

34
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,640
one of the challenges with sunflowers of

35
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,479
course

36
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,280
is that they make

37
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,280
quite a thick stem

38
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,320
and that is going to be difficult to

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,320
manage

40
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,400
once they mature

41
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,079
so the question is what's the

42
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,759
decomposition

43
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,920
going to be in this how are they going

44
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,079
to manage

45
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,280
the buckwheat seeds

46
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,680
and

47
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,399
the radishes are going to be undersized

48
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,600
because they don't have enough nitrogen

49
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,600
but they've done a better job

50
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,960
managing the radishes

51
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,799
so

52
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,319
that one's only as big as my thumb so

53
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,160
far so it's got a ways to go and maybe a

54
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:14,560
challenge getting there

55
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:16,480
and oh look there we've got clover too

56
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,640
so by spring this may be primarily a

57
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,560
clover stand

58
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:27,040
and along with the winter wheat

59
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,040
so there's a look at a cover crop mix

60
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,360
that

61
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,760
looks okay now

62
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,280
good combination but

63
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,400
it's really a question whether it's

64
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,959
going to

65
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,959
do any job particularly well
