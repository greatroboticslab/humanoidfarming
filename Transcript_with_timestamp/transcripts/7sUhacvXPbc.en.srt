00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:20,480
[Music]

2
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,960
Okay. So about four years ago, our path

3
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,279
crossed and he's popularly known in the

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:29,439
eastern region for cultivating crops

5
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:31,199
like rubber, cocoa, and plantain. is an

6
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,960
interesting get together again. And

7
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,360
today we are not just going to talk

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,040
about the old things but something new

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,680
that has happened which has to do with

10
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,280
coconut nursery production. And seated

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,960
next to me to tell me more about this

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,510
business and what got him into it

13
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,360
iswamiame and

14
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:51,840
[Applause]

15
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,440
aka I don't want to mention that oneame.

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,760
Nice meeting you again. Nice meeting

17
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,960
you. Oh my goodness. It's been 4 years

18
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,600
already. Yeah. So, how has it been? It's

19
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,359
been great. It's been great. I

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,840
understand the difficulties we all have

21
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,360
in this country, but we all count. I'm

22
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,119
counting my blessings. It's been great.

23
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,640
Great. Great. Let's refresh the memory

24
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,920
of those who might not have seen your

25
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:17,520
story four years ago. Um, your schooling

26
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,200
days in UK and then you got back to

27
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,080
Ghana and then refused to go. When we

28
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,400
want to go, me I want to go.

29
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,920
Let's get to know briefly again who

30
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,600
Kqaame is for the purpose of those who

31
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,000
have not seen the interviews we've done

32
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,840
four years ago.

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,640
Uhwame I'll simply say somebody who is

34
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,680
so passionate about agric

35
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,400
um I think coming September will be my

36
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,280
12th year of being being in agriculture

37
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,799
being a farmer 12th year right so I

38
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,960
think the journey started somewhere in

39
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:51,280
2012 when I decided to go into rubber so

40
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,960
currently I have about 94 acres of

41
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:59,280
rubber then I moved into cocoa which I'm

42
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:01,119
doing about 160 acres of cocoa mhm M um

43
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,040
I like the challenge so I decided to

44
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:06,079
take on something very different and

45
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,640
that is coconut. So um I think among all

46
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,560
these two three um the three cups that

47
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,040
I'm planting coconut is something that I

48
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,480
really enjoy. Oh really? And um yeah I

49
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,200
think I really really enjoy doing

50
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,920
coconut. Okay. Um not just because of

51
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,920
how sweet coconut taste but I I think

52
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,239
it's a lovely tree crop. Okay. And I

53
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,720
think people need to really understand

54
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,520
more about coconut. So I mean we here to

55
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,319
just breathe. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome.

56
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,200
Um talking about a sweetness and a

57
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:38,160
lovely crop. Is that what made you got

58
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,720
started or something else? Um I think

59
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,360
it's more of diversification. Okay.

60
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,120
Where I was looking at diversifying and

61
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,760
looking for something different to do.

62
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,480
Um as I said the first focus was to do

63
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,680
rubber then cocoa. I've done a lot of

64
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,000
things you know. I don't really want to

65
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,040
talk about it like in vegetables almost

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,239
a lot of things but I think um I chanced

67
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,599
on coconut I mean where I realized was

68
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,319
something that Ghanaians were really

69
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:07,200
patronizing so the interest I mean got

70
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,440
to me so I decided to just um diversify

71
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,040
into coconut as well okay and how will

72
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,599
you describe the experience so far it's

73
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:17,040
been great um I know a lot of people

74
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:21,040
want to get go into agriculture and I

75
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:24,480
would say coconut is um somehow one the

76
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:27,519
easiest treatment. Okay. Um I mean I say

77
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,239
easiest not to say that it's easy to do

78
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,959
but then if you follow the right

79
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,879
procedures and the right methods, it's

80
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,200
not that difficult. Okay. And then a lot

81
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,440
of Ghanaians are I can I realize we are

82
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,360
we don't have the time. Most of the

83
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,400
people who want to go into agriculture

84
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,680
one way or the other don't have the time

85
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,000
to be a farm throughout 24/7. Exactly.

86
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,400
Um I think coconut is one of the farms

87
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,239
that you can have where you can be a bit

88
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,000
absent because it doesn't really demand

89
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,319
you know doesn't demand a lot but then

90
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,560
as I said you need to get it right okay

91
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,400
you can't just do it anyhow you know you

92
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,200
can't just do it I understand with all

93
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,879
the three cups having it been cocoa

94
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:14,000
coconut guava mango cashew it all

95
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,680
demands time lifewise coconut but then

96
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,079
with my experience I think it's one of

97
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,120
the things that most people can invest

98
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,800
in where they can feel very relaxed and

99
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,320
you know visit the farms as to when they

100
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,800
make the time to go there. So yeah a lot

101
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,280
of people are interested in coconut

102
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,520
farming um especially because of its

103
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,120
profitability and also the endless

104
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,440
benefit that you get from coconut.

105
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,680
However, most people also get it wrong

106
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:45,199
especially when they are going to buy

107
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:48,240
the seedling for planting. And so I want

108
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,080
want us to touch on how can a novelist

109
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,000
or even someone is already into farming

110
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,199
but want to diversify like you have

111
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
done. How am I able to identify a hybrid

112
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,919
and non-hybrid coconut seedling? A very

113
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,560
good question. I would want to go back a

114
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:05,680
little bit to share how I even got into

115
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:09,039
coconut nursery. Go ahead. So I think

116
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,160
2017 that was when I wanted to embark on

117
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:14,720
um having a coconut farm.

118
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:17,120
Um, fortunately I I like to do farms on

119
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,199
a large scale. I don't really believe in

120
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,800
2, three, four, five acres. Not to say,

121
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,039
okay, if you want to have an acre

122
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,880
coconut farm is bad, but then I was

123
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:28,400
looking at doing coconut up to about 200

124
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:31,199
acres. Okay. So the seedling selection

125
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,919
as to what exactly I'm planting was

126
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,639
something I was very very interested in.

127
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,880
Not to say there weren't nursery

128
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,800
operators around. I saw a lot of them.

129
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,240
Yeah. But then when the right questions

130
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,120
I call it right question because I did

131
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,639
my research I I asked they are not able

132
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,800
to really give me the answers to the

133
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,400
question that I'm asking them. So I

134
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,520
think it was a bit difficult for me when

135
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,600
it comes to um um getting my siblings

136
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,240
for my coconut farm. You know like the

137
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,240
rubber was easy because um right where I

138
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,400
have my rubber farms there's a company

139
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,120
RPG rubber plantation Ghana so they have

140
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,759
the siblings. at the cocoa farm you know

141
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,880
we have a subsidiary for cocoa that's

142
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:13,039
the um SPDC production department who

143
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,120
goes to the um producing the seedlings

144
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,680
for us but with the coconut I realized

145
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:22,720
there was nothing like that you know so

146
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:26,160
that's when I met one um aonomist Dr.

147
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:29,520
who I met you know through research.

148
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,840
Okay. Who explained things to me um who

149
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,000
gave me some numbers then I embarked on

150
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,080
it. Yeah. But prior to that I still went

151
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,319
ahead to purchase some few seedlings

152
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,479
from some few natural places but

153
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,560
subsequently I started nursing my own

154
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,759
siblings in my farm just to transplant

155
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:49,039
them into my field into the field.

156
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,120
Exactly. So I think I had a lot of

157
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,960
interest. I mean when people came to the

158
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,080
farm they saw my siblings and are you

159
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:59,759
selling them? Are you selling them? And

160
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:02,800
I started giving them um exactly what

161
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,919
got me to start this nursery. So with a

162
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,280
lot of experience the question going

163
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,440
back to the question you asked me how do

164
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,880
you identify between the hybrid the

165
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,560
hybrid because I get it a lot when you

166
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:15,440
go to a typical um nezri or n operator

167
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,440
who is selling coconut. I mean the the

168
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,240
first question people ask is I want

169
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,240
hybrid. I want hybrid. I want the one

170
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,240
that that germinates within that start

171
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,160
producing food within three years within

172
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,960
five years and it's a very difficult

173
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:32,319
it's a very good question but how do you

174
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,639
it's kind of impossible impossible to

175
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:37,759
identify a hybrid seedling by just

176
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,759
picking the nut. It's impossible because

177
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,319
you have to be in the farm you have to

178
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:45,120
see the tree to where the nut is coming

179
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:48,080
from. You can easily identify a hybrid

180
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:51,039
tree. So out of the hybrid tree, you get

181
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,840
the hybrid nuts. And I was a bit shocked

182
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,440
because mean you go out there to the N

183
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,360
operators asking them is it hybrid? They

184
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,440
will tell you yes, it's hybrid.

185
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,639
Sometimes it's true. I'm not saying and

186
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,280
I'm not trying to say that they're

187
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,440
lying. But how are you sure these are

188
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,840
hybrid seeds? So that's when I was a bit

189
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,080
excited because I was picking my nuts

190
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,919
from a hybrid farm. I was producing my

191
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,520
own nursery for my own farm.

192
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:18,240
So I I have all the benefit a hybrid

193
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,080
farm can have in my farm. So you can't

194
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,199
identify unless you're in the farm.

195
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:26,400
Sometimes you can try to use the the

196
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,080
overallness of the of the of the nuts,

197
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,000
but it's still not doesn't make any

198
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,919
sense to me. You have to be in the farm,

199
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,200
okay, to really know whether this nurses

200
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,320
it's hybrid or not. You have to be in

201
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,640
the farm to really identify. M if not I

202
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,839
don't see any way you can identify

203
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,160
between a hybrid and another hybrid farm

204
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,760
not a hybrid there's no way it's

205
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,480
practically impossible so you have to be

206
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,880
in the farm see the tree and that's why

207
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,240
so let me go back to it usually when you

208
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,000
read more about coconut they will tell

209
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:01,680
you that it's it's better and it's ideal

210
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,160
to nurse seedlings out of a farm that is

211
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:08,000
about 20 years plus it's not because of

212
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:10,160
anything one you So when you have a a

213
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,240
hybrid farm that's about 20 years, you

214
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,000
can clearly see its features. You can

215
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,040
see the nuts, you can see the tree

216
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,680
itself, right? You can really identify

217
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,240
that is hybrid or not. Okay? Cuz if you

218
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,640
start using coconut that is about five,

219
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,920
six, seven years when it starting to to

220
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,839
cultivate as a cultivar to cultivate um

221
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,720
produce leisurely, it's kind of

222
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:36,480
difficult to identify it. So usually

223
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:40,160
it's better that you have a farm that is

224
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:43,279
about 25 30 years. Most of my farms, you

225
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,800
know, and to to add it up, I I hardly

226
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,720
produce I don't even produce my nurses

227
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,680
in Ghana. Okay. They all from Ivory,

228
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:53,279
okay? You know, and most of my farms are

229
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:56,000
uh usually 60 years, 40 years, 35 years.

230
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,920
Okay? And you can see a 35 year old farm

231
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,680
that has that height, okay? And you can

232
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,360
easily identify and they'll tell you

233
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,440
this same farm is 35 years, but it's not

234
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,839
hybrid. You can see how tall okay the

235
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,440
the whole farm is and let me just

236
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,360
butress with and end it with that

237
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,320
question that why do people even want

238
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,040
hybrid signals why why hybrid does it

239
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,880
mean the other nurseries are not good

240
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,600
they are good they're equally good but

241
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,560
you know the term hybrid I mean hybrid

242
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,959
in the sense that anything hybrid is

243
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,600
kind of is taken through a process where

244
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:30,079
one is a bit resistant to diseases one

245
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,920
is a bit robust is susceptible to

246
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,000
diseases and all that And the most

247
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:37,040
important thing about hybrid is hybrid

248
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
coconut is the maturity. Okay. As to

249
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,160
when when you plant it and how long it

250
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,360
will take to get the fruit. So I think

251
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,000
that answers the question. You need to

252
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,160
be in the hybrid farm. Okay. To know

253
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,800
that this farm is hybrid before you can

254
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,959
pick a nut. If not, it's impossible.

255
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,880
Okay. So what's the capacity of this

256
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:57,040
production center? Yeah. Currently here

257
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,079
we have we had about 40,000. Okay. But

258
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,959
we've been moving them out. So now we

259
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:03,200
have about 20 27,000 over here. Okay. So

260
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:06,880
what we have here are they all hybrid or

261
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,959
nonhybrid? All hybrid siblings or pure

262
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,519
proper hybrid siblings. All right. And I

263
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:14,160
I think I I want to backress with this

264
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,880
where I even prefer people to come to my

265
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:20,160
farm. You know I have 170 acre coconut

266
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:23,040
farm. Oh yeah. Sure. So usually when

267
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,880
people come over here, I tell them you

268
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,040
don't have to even listen to all that I

269
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,000
have to say to you. But if you have the

270
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,320
opportunity, visit my farm, see what

271
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,640
I've done, then you can at least speak

272
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,839
to it. Okay? It's all hybrid. Pure

273
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:40,160
hybrid. Okay. Now, when you drive around

274
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,480
Ghana, you see bits and pieces of

275
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,519
coconut here and there. Some tall, some

276
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:48,800
short and all that. But where do coconut

277
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,320
grow best in Ghana? in what soil and

278
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,680
what are some of the regions you can

279
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,519
mention? A very important question and

280
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,240
you see um farming is supposed to be

281
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:01,600
taken very serious and sometimes it

282
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:05,360
baffles me when people get up one day

283
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:08,000
probably make some money and you know

284
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,000
they just want to plant something not to

285
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,560
say I mean Ghana you can plant coconut

286
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,279
everywhere but there are ideal locations

287
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:18,240
there are there are places where it's

288
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:21,760
better let me talk about the soil so

289
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:25,200
with spoil soil you're looking at a well

290
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:28,000
drained let me just well drained sandy

291
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,760
soil okay and to say sandy soil I know

292
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,519
when we went to JSS they thought about

293
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:35,440
the properties of a sandy soil exactly

294
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:38,560
where it's loose right it's not sticky

295
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:41,600
you know it's not sticky it's loose it's

296
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,680
it's it has a very low I mean low water

297
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,880
retaining capacity what it means is it

298
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:49,040
can drain water pretty fast okay um

299
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:52,000
coconut does well in a well drained

300
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,760
sandy soil Okay. And not to say that the

301
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,480
other lands can't thrive well with

302
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,800
coconut. It can. Okay. But then just say

303
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,839
you want to do coconut on a very large

304
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:04,720
commercial scale, thousand acres, 500

305
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,560
acres. These things are necessary. You

306
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,560
can't just get up and say you have a,000

307
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:12,800
acre land. So you want to start planting

308
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:14,959
coconut. So you just start. No. So I I

309
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,800
believe that we need to do the right

310
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,600
thing when it comes to agric. Okay.

311
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:22,160
Because it's expensive, right? And we

312
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,079
get frustrated when it doesn't work, but

313
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,279
then because of the the things we take

314
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:28,959
for granted, we have to be very careful

315
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,839
when it comes to choosing a site for

316
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:34,079
coconut. As I said, it's practically

317
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,160
possible for coconut to thrive in any

318
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,560
part of our country. But then you're

319
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,240
looking at production, you know, you're

320
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,880
looking at production. That's why

321
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:46,480
specifically it stated that well drained

322
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:50,320
sandy soil you know is best and ideal

323
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,959
and to the regions the regions you know

324
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,760
um it has to be a place where rainfall

325
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:58,560
pattern is massive like you know a very

326
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,560
good rainfall areas. So talking about

327
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,399
the central the central regions and all

328
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,839
that is ideal and that is where we get

329
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,839
most of the coconut from the western

330
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,240
regions as well they are all close to

331
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,639
the coastal side. So realistically can

332
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,760
conclude by saying yeah all the sand

333
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,839
soil within those areas are almost you

334
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:19,120
know not to say coconut doesn't do well

335
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:21,120
let's say like a region coconut would do

336
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:25,120
well over there but it's a bit different

337
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:28,480
you barely find the right sandy you know

338
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,320
the sea kind of land around region it's

339
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,880
better to do it over there as well but

340
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,720
on a large commercial farm you need to

341
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:38,279
really take in consideration what kind

342
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:40,480
of land and just to add up Um, it's not

343
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:43,680
necessarily you have to do your test.

344
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,360
Mhm. You see, Ghanaians, I realize cuz I

345
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,519
meet a lot of farmers. Let me just tell

346
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,320
you what happened about 2 weeks ago

347
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,680
where a farmer, I call him a farmer. No,

348
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,720
he doesn't live in Ghana. He lives in

349
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,880
Canada. And um he got my contact. He

350
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,040
called me and he's been calling me to go

351
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:02,000
visit his farm. Okay. He has about 60

352
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,920
acre of coconut farm somewhere in Oda.

353
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,519
And I couldn't make it cuz I was very

354
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,480
busy. Yeah. So he was sent to Ghana

355
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,920
somewhere in May and um he called me

356
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:14,240
that when he comes if I can get

357
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:17,920
opportunity to visit. So yeah I he came

358
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,839
around and we visit his farm and to my

359
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:23,839
surprise the things I saw over there was

360
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:26,079
a bit like this is very serious you know

361
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:29,519
and the farm is about six seven years

362
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:30,880
and it's very poor. So from I think he

363
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,040
got it wrong from from eating the

364
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,880
seedlings. They got it wrong from the

365
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,120
planting distance. They got it wrong

366
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,760
with the soil. They got it wrong with

367
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,000
everything. Oh my. So you see all the

368
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:44,720
investment that he's putting he's put

369
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,880
into this farm with the time and he is

370
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,040
okay. He doesn't really need much. He's

371
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,519
just excited to be a farmer. But then

372
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,639
it's so depressing to to to go through

373
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,639
something like this. So I think the

374
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,040
right questions needs to be asked. You

375
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,800
know the right soil needs to be you know

376
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,560
used when you're getting into coconut

377
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,320
farming. You just don't get up and say

378
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,040
coconut does well. People can even plant

379
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:08,000
coconut in water you know in water mashy

380
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,519
areas. No you don't it's not done. Okay.

381
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,199
You know coconut is just like any other

382
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:16,480
tree just like cocoa. It needs a well

383
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:19,720
like a well you know very good soil to

384
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:22,839
go very well. Yeah. So I think

385
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:27,440
that's a place

386
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:29,680
where the soil is more sandy a very good

387
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,040
pattern. Coconut needs a lot of water,

388
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,480
you know. Not to say the water should be

389
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:36,560
retained around the coconut, but the the

390
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,800
soil should be able to drain a lot of

391
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,720
water. It shouldn't hold the water.

392
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,399
Exactly. All right. Right. So I'm sure

393
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,720
you're seeing a lot of interviews about

394
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,480
coconut on our channel but this has

395
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,120
become very important for us to

396
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,600
reiterate and you know educate you

397
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:55,120
before because most of you are wasting

398
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:57,600
money or losing very very good amount of

399
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,160
money uh because you lack knowledge

400
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,399
because you don't have the right people

401
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,480
to buy from I'm going for a quick

402
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,199
breather when I come back will tell me

403
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,280
more about if I have just one acre and I

404
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,160
want to go into coconut production or

405
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,120
farming

406
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,120
How many seedlings will I be needing to

407
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:18,079
actually do my one acre farm? I'll be

408
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,079
right back. Stay

409
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:33,280
[Music]

410
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,880
tuned. Thanks for staying. If you're

411
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,360
just tuning in, you're watching the

412
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,600
Ghanaian farmer. We encourage you to

413
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,360
share your views globally. If you're

414
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,360
watching us, you have any question, you

415
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,240
have any contribution, share with us.

416
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:51,039
But this is about how you can identify

417
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,679
the quality, the right type of coconut

418
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:56,559
seedling to buy for your farm. Don't go

419
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,480
waste your money and come back crying.

420
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,960
But before went on break, I was asking

421
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,280
if I have just one acre, it's a test

422
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:06,400
case and I want to go and plant, how

423
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:11,120
many nuts are we looking at? Okay. So,

424
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:14,160
an acre of coconut with a spacing of 7.5

425
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:18,640
m and that is actually an ideal spacing

426
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:22,480
7.5 m and that's about 25 ft. Okay. Will

427
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:25,440
be able to accommodate about 705 trees.

428
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,280
Okay. 70 to 75 trees, right? Uh most

429
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,559
people come and they will tell you, I

430
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:32,640
have an acre. I want to put about 120.

431
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:35,039
You advise them no too much. It doesn't

432
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,039
work that way. Okay? you know uh what

433
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:40,480
you put on the ground is what you get.

434
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:42,960
So that is the preferred and required

435
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,200
you know um um um planting distance and

436
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:51,039
the quantity that is used. So at a

437
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:53,919
distance of um 7.5 m apart um um that's

438
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:56,320
about 25 ft. Okay. You have close about

439
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:59,039
70 to 75 trees. Okay. On an acre of

440
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:01,200
land. Okay. Is there a special way of

441
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,919
planting coconut in the soil? Is there

442
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:07,760
any special way? Yes. Um there isn't any

443
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:10,960
special way you know I think when it

444
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:13,360
comes to general farming a lot of people

445
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,600
probably will show you how to do this

446
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,280
how to do that but you would have to try

447
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,280
and find something that works for you

448
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,120
okay you see we don't have irrigations

449
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:24,480
in Ghana we don't even irrigate our

450
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:28,240
farms right so finding a means to plant

451
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:30,480
coconut that will sustain it that will

452
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,559
help a tribe better sometimes you would

453
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,400
have to try and coin your own

454
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,160
You understand? So what I do

455
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,240
specifically usually I mean I consult

456
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:41,440
for a lot of farms and I help them in

457
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,919
planting their coconut you know coconut

458
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,720
we even call coconut as um a thirsty

459
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,520
tree cuz it needs water. Not to say that

460
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,679
there there's supposed to be so much

461
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:53,600
water around it but it needs water at

462
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,000
least every 2 weeks after planting it

463
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,280
needs to be watered. Okay. So um there

464
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,160
isn't any special way of planting

465
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:02,000
coconut. um sometimes when it comes to

466
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,919
general farming. Yeah. And that as I

467
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,640
said, I've been a farmer for the past 12

468
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,919
years. Every September was my 12th year.

469
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,320
And sometimes my friends don't even

470
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:13,679
believe that. You would have to find

471
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,760
your own way. Coin your own way. Do

472
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,520
things you think is working for you. You

473
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,240
don't you don't just go out there and

474
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,840
watch a video on YouTube someone doing

475
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,480
something and you want to replicate that

476
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,880
same thing. You know, the lands are

477
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,120
different. M so try and find ways and

478
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,360
means to to do things you think is

479
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,679
benefiting you. So one of the things I

480
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,760
do when I'm planting coconut is how I

481
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,960
dig my hole. Okay. You know I dig the

482
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,720
hole such that it's so big where I have

483
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,120
a lot of space around it. Put the

484
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,039
coconut in the middle. Yeah. Cover the

485
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,200
soil. Yeah. Cover the coconut with the

486
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:49,440
soil. But then there's still a lot of

487
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,039
there's a lot of space around it. What

488
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,600
does that do? See, we don't irrigate our

489
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:56,720
fun. Yes. And see the rainfall patterns

490
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:59,200
are pretty poor sometimes. So you need

491
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,520
coconut. As I said, coconut is usually

492
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,919
called the testy tree. It needs water to

493
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:07,200
dry very well. So leaving that space

494
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,720
around the coconut tree when it rains

495
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,559
sort of like you have some water

496
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,240
collected around it. So it means if it's

497
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:14,480
not going to rain for even a month or

498
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,720
even two weeks, you have that space

499
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,799
around the coconut being very moist

500
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,799
which will aid in proper growing of your

501
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:22,400
coconut tree. Okay. So there isn't any

502
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,720
kind of like special way of planting

503
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,480
coconut but you do things that will help

504
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,520
you things that will make your farm do

505
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,960
well. So you need to find ways. As I

506
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,799
said farming is not something you can

507
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,159
learn and say you are done learning. You

508
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,600
learn every day. You keep learning. You

509
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,159
keep learning every day. So there isn't

510
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,400
any special way as in somebody trying to

511
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,679
tell you it can work. If somebody is

512
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,600
trying to demonstrate something to you

513
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,039
it mean the person have tried it but it

514
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,039
doesn't mean when you try it it's going

515
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:50,880
to work for you. Okay. So that is my

516
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:52,400
way. try and dig the hole that big. Put

517
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,320
the coconut in the middle. Leave a bit

518
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,080
of space around it where there will be

519
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,840
some water collected when it rains. At

520
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,000
least if it's not raining. Yeah, it will

521
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,679
still use that water. Okay, that's

522
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,440
interesting. I've not seen that before,

523
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:06,240
but I can't wait for him to demonstrate

524
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,880
for us to see. That's a tip for you. So,

525
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,520
when it come to the nursery, if I buy

526
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,679
the nuts, how long does it take for me

527
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:18,240
to start seeing the leaves shooting?

528
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:20,640
Great. M so we start coconut by picking

529
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:24,640
the dry nuts. Okay. Usually it's

530
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:27,440
advisable that the nut drops themsel you

531
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:30,960
know it's usually not advisable to climb

532
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:33,440
the tree to pluck dry nuts. Um in terms

533
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,360
you it has to be well dried before it

534
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,559
can germinate. Okay. If it's not well

535
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:40,559
dry it will never germinate. Okay. So

536
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:44,320
usually when we go to some of the farms

537
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:46,320
that we we we start our nurseries from M

538
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,960
um usually we don't have enough nuts so

539
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,039
we are forced to climb the trees to

540
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,159
pluck some of the dry nuts and to our

541
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:56,400
surprise um over times the nuts start

542
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,080
gating even on top of the tree. Oh

543
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,760
really? You can see it protrudes just a

544
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,440
little bit. Okay. Whilst it's still

545
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,280
hanging on the tree and then that's one

546
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,520
of the difference between the hybrid and

547
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,799
the non-hybrid seedlings. I think the

548
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:11,280
hybrid seedlings have a very soft shell

549
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:15,280
sort of where germinations are pretty

550
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:17,360
easy. So if you happen to have a nut

551
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,840
that is already germinated, it means

552
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:22,320
easy to go. It means within some few

553
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,880
months, it goes really fast. But the

554
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:27,520
germination is a problem. There are

555
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:30,880
times you can go under a typical tree,

556
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:33,440
you have about let's say 100 nuts, dry

557
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:36,080
nuts dropped. Yeah. Out of these 100

558
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,320
nuts, you can have let's say 30

559
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,919
germinated. Okay. And it's just natural.

560
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:43,679
It's not something out of anything.

561
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:45,120
Yeah. you know, so you have to notch it.

562
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,440
Usually we call what we call notching.

563
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,679
Notching is where we cut just a bit.

564
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,559
Okay. Let's pick one that you've cut. So

565
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:54,640
something like this. Okay. So we notch

566
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:56,559
this coconut. You know, coconut has this

567
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,640
shell. Yeah. Where when there's water

568
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,559
poured on it, it will just drop off.

569
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,880
They won't get into the coconut. You're

570
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:05,440
trying to force water into the coconut

571
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,440
to aid germination. Okay. So the whole

572
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,919
idea of notching where we cut a bit of

573
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:13,360
this space is to get water into the into

574
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:15,440
the coconut where it can aid fast

575
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:17,840
germination. Okay. Right. So when

576
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,240
germination starts it takes close to

577
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,799
about 6 months transplanting it gets to

578
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:26,480
the height where you can transplant the

579
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:28,320
coconut. Okay. So from let's say from

580
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,640
the time you pick the nut to

581
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,720
transplanting it's about 6 months. Okay.

582
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,880
Yeah. So what it takes 6 month here

583
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:38,880
before a farmer comes to buy. Exactly.

584
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:41,679
Oh my I see. Okay. So when I'm coming to

585
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,679
buy the nuts to go and transplant, what

586
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:47,600
time of the day do you recommend I come

587
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:49,840
by to to buy my nuts? Yeah. Um this is a

588
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,240
general question where I'll answer for

589
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:55,679
all tree crops. Okay. And these are the

590
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:57,840
mistakes we do as farmers as well. Yes.

591
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,360
Tree crops, you know, mostly

592
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:02,320
predominantly in Ghana, we don't

593
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:05,039
irrigate them. Okay. What it means is we

594
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:07,440
plant them early part of the year when

595
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:09,039
the rain setting. Yeah, there isn't any

596
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,960
particular day as in planting in the

597
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:14,159
morning or in the afternoon but it

598
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:16,559
should be planted early I mean the month

599
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,559
we know somewhere in April May we start

600
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:21,840
getting rains in Ghana okay it's ideal

601
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:26,320
to plant any tree okay be it rubber be

602
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:28,400
it cocoa be it cashew coconut

603
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:31,520
very early what you're trying to do is

604
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,840
to help this tree crop to establish very

605
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,600
well so it means when you plant them

606
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,200
early let's say you plant it by May

607
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,960
you're done planting your seedlings. It

608
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,159
means it gets all the rains. That's you

609
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,919
know we call them the Ghana we have the

610
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,919
major rainy season and the minor.

611
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:46,159
Exactly. So the major rainy season is

612
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:48,080
usually between April, May, June, July.

613
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,159
Then we have a bit of a drought. Then

614
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,919
August, September, October, November we

615
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,480
have the minor rainy season. So if you

616
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:57,840
plan early, it means you have all this

617
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,679
rain from you know May, June, July all

618
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:02,080
the way through to about December. Yeah.

619
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:04,960
So, you have a wellestablished tree

620
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,960
crop, whether being coconut or cocoa or

621
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,600
something like that. I I get a lot of

622
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,840
people who come around somewhere, you

623
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,840
know, in September and they want to buy

624
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,200
seedlings to go plant cuz we start

625
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,559
nursing seedlings somewhere September,

626
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,240
October. That's when we start doing our

627
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:21,120
preparations. And I tell them, it's not

628
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,640
ideal because you're not sure cuz we are

629
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,240
entering the minor, we are in the minor

630
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,799
season and there's going to be drought.

631
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:29,120
Yeah. So as to a specific time of

632
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:30,960
planting, no but it needs to be planted

633
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,960
early. At least your land preparation

634
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,320
should start early. You know by January,

635
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,200
February, March, you should be done. You

636
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:39,039
with your land preparation by May you

637
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,039
have to finish planting your seedlings.

638
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:43,120
Okay? And that will help you have a very

639
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:45,520
good um seedling growing for for you.

640
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,200
But what if I have irrigation? That is

641
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,480
also okay. But you know there is

642
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,039
something different. There's a big

643
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,200
difference between natural rainfall and

644
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:56,960
irrigation. Yes, you can't 100% rely on

645
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:58,720
irrigation, especially with tree crops,

646
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,799
you know, it doesn't really need a lot

647
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,960
of water. If you can add irrigation to

648
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:05,520
your tree crops like coconut, there you

649
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:08,480
go. It's excellent. It's ideal. You can

650
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:10,720
you can you can it does really well.

651
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,880
Okay, you know, but then because you

652
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,080
don't want to spend so much money,

653
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,840
sometime not say it's not necessary,

654
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,240
it's very necessary if you have the

655
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,320
finances to have an irrigated coconut

656
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,200
farm. It's a plus for you. All right.

657
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:25,840
But then if you plant it early and it's

658
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,679
well established by November, December,

659
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,320
why you don't even need any irrigation?

660
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,799
In that case, how long then after my

661
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,960
transplanting will I be waiting to start

662
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:36,799
plucking and selling or enjoying my

663
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,720
coconut? Yeah, I I get this question a

664
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:42,159
lot. A lot of questions people come over

665
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:44,080
here. My brother, how long am I going?

666
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,440
You know, I heard there is one that even

667
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,520
someone even said there's one that is

668
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,400
even two years start getting coconut.

669
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:53,679
Coconut. See, um

670
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:56,000
And this not to say anything. Coconut as

671
00:27:53,679 --> 00:28:01,399
I said earlier thrives really well in

672
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:04,000
sandy well drained sandy soil, right?

673
00:28:01,399 --> 00:28:07,440
And with the hybrid seedlings you're

674
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,760
looking at between 3 to 5 years. 3 to 5

675
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,520
years. In my farms, in some of my farms,

676
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:14,159
I demonstrated where when I planted the

677
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,600
seedlings, yeah, when I transplanted, I

678
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:20,159
took I took note of it when we did the

679
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:22,320
transplant. Um in one of my farms about

680
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:25,120
5 acre farm like a plot where I

681
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:29,600
demarcated and did the planting

682
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:32,320
we realized that we had about 60% okay

683
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:36,240
of the seedlings giving us flowers after

684
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:38,159
the third year oh about 60% okay you see

685
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,240
when somebody comes over here probably

686
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:44,640
they want to buy like one seedling or

687
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:47,120
two or three and buying three seedlings

688
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,360
and planting them and expecting maybe

689
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,840
for it to give you fruits in let's say

690
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,760
three years and four years it's usually

691
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:57,279
not realistic. I say it's not realistic

692
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:59,600
because if you're doing a whole a whole

693
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:02,480
plantation like a big farm you know the

694
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:04,880
soil nutrients is completely different

695
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,360
from each part of the soil like it's

696
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,200
land you can have a big land but the

697
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,840
nutrients at one particular spot is

698
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:15,360
completely different you know so it's

699
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:17,840
usually proper and ideal to have some

700
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:20,559
quantity of seedlings where you can now

701
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,399
be very sure that are these really good

702
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,600
quality seedlings you can use one

703
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:26,320
seedling or two seedling that you

704
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,080
planted in your house as a yastic to say

705
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,080
it's not a good quality seedling maybe

706
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,080
the soil that you even planted the

707
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:35,919
seedling on it it's not good it's not

708
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:38,640
good quality right and you ask how long

709
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,640
I said 3 to 5 years I know with the

710
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,120
hybrid seedlings after the third year

711
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,960
you see signs of flowers okay you see

712
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,840
signs of flowers after the third year

713
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:50,720
but let me add this it doesn't matter if

714
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:52,480
you buy a hybrid seedlings and you don't

715
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,640
go through the proper

716
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,480
things you need to do for the coconut to

717
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:00,799
thrive well. Okay. Everything needs to

718
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:02,720
be met. You know, proper planting,

719
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:05,440
everything has to be equal. All right.

720
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,960
So, if everything is done well, I mean

721
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,559
farming, somebody say farming is too

722
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,039
risky. Of course it is. Everything is

723
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:13,120
risky. Everything is risky everywhere.

724
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:15,679
If you can do it right, if you can do it

725
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,760
very well, be guaranteed that at least.

726
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:20,080
And if you know you are buying a right

727
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,200
proper seedling it's a very important

728
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,520
and that's one of the things people

729
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,760
neglect not just with coconut in

730
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:28,080
everything we do having it being

731
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,520
vegetables or anything you know you have

732
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,840
people it all start from the seed.

733
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,880
Exactly. You need the right seed to get

734
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,240
the right you know I mean whatever the

735
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,760
outcome is to get something better out

736
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,559
of it. So why compromise on the on the

737
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:42,080
on the initial initial I mean nursery

738
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:44,159
you don't compromise. Cuz if you

739
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,399
compromise on the nursery, everything

740
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,320
you're doing, whether it's 2 years or 3

741
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:50,720
or 5 years, is all compromised.

742
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,799
Struggle. Okay. Since you have a coconut

743
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:56,000
farm, you should be in the best place to

744
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:57,840
tell me how many fruits am I likely to

745
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,559
get on one plant? And of course, what

746
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:03,760
would be the lifespan of a coconut tree?

747
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:06,559
So, um, ideally it varies from region to

748
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:09,840
region. I said when I go to Ivory Coast

749
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:13,679
where we start our nursing and I see the

750
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:16,960
kind of farms they have with the kind of

751
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:19,679
maintenance they are giving the farms

752
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:22,720
and you see the typical coconut tree

753
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:24,799
with a lot of nuts on it.

754
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:27,440
I can't say you can have that same thing

755
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:30,640
probably when you plant it. That's why I

756
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:33,399
said it varies from origin.

757
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:36,880
on the average when the coconut is

758
00:31:33,399 --> 00:31:39,360
starts after let's say the fifth year I

759
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,919
mean it's so tender and so young on the

760
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,679
tree to carry a lot of trees I mean

761
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:46,159
coconut a lot of nuts at a time you know

762
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:48,480
it's so tender it's still young so it

763
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,240
can't hold a lot of I mean coconut you

764
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,919
know coconut is very heavy exactly so

765
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,159
when they are very young you don't

766
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:57,279
expect much but in the full maturity

767
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:59,440
we're looking at between let's say 5 to

768
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:02,080
15 years when the coconut is well

769
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,519
established. You are confident that you

770
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,399
should you shouldn't have anything less

771
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:09,120
than 100 nuts in a year. Okay. In a year

772
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:11,679
between 70 to 100 on one on one tree.

773
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:15,200
Okay. 70 to 100 and it can go all the

774
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:19,360
way to 150. I went to a farm and I

775
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:22,880
counted not less than 120 120 nuts on

776
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:27,279
each of the of the tree that I Oh yeah.

777
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:30,080
Okay. I counted not less than 120 nuts

778
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:32,399
right on each tree. But as I said, you

779
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,000
can't say because you have 120 when you

780
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:36,640
come by the seedlings and you go plant

781
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,159
it, you also expect to have 120 your

782
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,640
care, your maintenance, your farm

783
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:43,360
practices. The soil is a big

784
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,440
determinant. So it's not always about

785
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:48,320
what you do. Sometimes you do everything

786
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,080
right, but you still not get that, you

787
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,760
know, expected um, you know, what you're

788
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,559
looking for. You probably want to get

789
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:57,360
130 a tree, right? But then I know that

790
00:32:54,559 --> 00:33:00,080
at least a poor farm that is probably

791
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,519
taken care of. I mean a poor soil that

792
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,000
is well probably taken care of, the

793
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,039
right fertilizer and all that. I mean I

794
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
think you should probably get something

795
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:10,320
above 70 to 100. Okay. Per tree for a

796
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,640
year. Okay. A year. Okay. And the

797
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:15,279
lifespan will be how long can a coconut

798
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:18,000
tree coconut usually we call it the

799
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:20,000
three generation. Three generation means

800
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
when you plant it, your kids will come

801
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,880
eat it and your kids kids will come eat

802
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,919
it. Usually they say about 60 70 years

803
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:30,000
but then it can go more than 100 years

804
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,720
but you know in in in farming there's

805
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,840
something called viability

806
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:38,080
it's not economically viable after some

807
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,159
years because probably you be giving it

808
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,919
too much care too much attention where

809
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,360
the fruit that is giving you can't

810
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:46,240
complement how much you're making out of

811
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,919
it so it becomes not economically viable

812
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,159
at some point I mean I'm sure maybe

813
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:52,559
after 70 80 years it's proper to

814
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:55,440
probably start a farm all over Okay.

815
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:58,320
Yeah. Okay. Do coconut need fertilizer

816
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,240
and are there any specific fertilizer

817
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:03,120
that coconut need? Yes, coconut needs

818
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:06,559
fertilizers just like any other tree. Um

819
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:08,320
people say yeah. But then um I think one

820
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:11,119
of the easiest

821
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:14,560
um um um fertilizers you can find around

822
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:17,440
which is available is a chicken man. It

823
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:19,520
responds so well to chicken. Okay. Yeah.

824
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,599
Okay. I don't think it's a heavy feeder

825
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,919
fertilizer. I don't think so. All right.

826
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:26,240
That's why it's a very robust plant.

827
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:29,040
That's why I like it. It's robust and

828
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:30,720
it's not too difficult to do. Okay. So,

829
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,839
with just a little fertilizer, as I

830
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:35,040
said, you can do the some of the

831
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:38,480
inorganic fertilizers. Okay. The MPKs

832
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:40,800
are all good for coconut. But I prefer

833
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,320
people doing more of the organic where

834
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,320
they can embed a lot of the chicken

835
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,240
manure around the coconut. You know, it

836
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,280
keeps that space around the coconut very

837
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:50,879
moist. Okay. Cuz it likes that. Yeah. So

838
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:54,480
in as much as you can give it fertilizer

839
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:56,320
like the NPKs like the 1515 it's also

840
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:59,200
okay to give the organic money like

841
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:01,520
inorganic man inorganic um fertilizers

842
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:05,040
and to add it to butress it do you know

843
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:10,079
we give coconut salt salt drink is it

844
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:12,960
the big ones or the adan salt okay so

845
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:16,560
you wonder why coconut thrive so well at

846
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:19,119
the shop yeah exactly keta adan you have

847
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:22,400
coconut and they are there for years. So

848
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:23,920
coconut does well having given it salt

849
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,000
because you probably will bring coconut

850
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:30,720
to your farm, there's no salt content in

851
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:32,240
the soil. So I I read extensively and I

852
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,240
started doing it in my farm and I saw

853
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,000
the response. A lot of people complain

854
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,320
so much about my farm is not doing well.

855
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,720
There are too many um um diseases here

856
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:43,119
and there and I think salt is a cure. I

857
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:46,000
see. It all depends on how you apply it

858
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:48,720
apply it. We would go to his farm for

859
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,000
him to show us that Exactly. Because um

860
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:54,560
and this is something that

861
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:57,520
um yeah I consult a lot sometimes for

862
00:35:54,560 --> 00:36:00,640
free. I like I love to do it and people

863
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:02,240
have so many issues on their farms and I

864
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,800
get there and it's something very simple

865
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,400
simple okay something very simple to do

866
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,000
you know and because usually they are

867
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,760
not there and they leave the farm for

868
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,680
farm managers to take care of them

869
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,079
they're not able to identify this salt

870
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:16,240
plays a very good role in coconut by

871
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:18,079
applying it around the roots. Some you

872
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,599
can even put a little bit of you grind

873
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:22,440
it and put a little bit into the leaves.

874
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:24,640
It does really well. Okay. You mentioned

875
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,960
disease. Are there any disease that

876
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:30,640
affected coconut? How do I prevent or

877
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:33,760
cure it? Great. So um um coconut I

878
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:36,640
realize usually predominantly it's um

879
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:41,359
the root rot usually caused by fungus.

880
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:44,079
Okay. Um coconut is sweet. So you have

881
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:46,640
every every insect like you know even

882
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:49,280
rodents Yeah. attacking coconut. It's a

883
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:51,800
sweet I mean crop so you need to really

884
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:55,599
take care of it very well. One of

885
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:58,240
the diseases that I find easy attacking

886
00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:00,800
coconut is the root rot where usually

887
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,960
when you're planting the seedling um you

888
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,280
have a bit of termites and some you know

889
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:07,280
in the soil. So they end up chewing the

890
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,119
the the the root which to prevent the

891
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,200
coconut from growing it ends up killing

892
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:14,079
the coconut. So the root rot which there

893
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:16,720
is a way to to to solve that issue with

894
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:18,720
the root root rot and I see more of

895
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,800
people complaining more of the wevils

896
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,240
you know getting into the like you know

897
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,760
the middle part of the coconut chewing

898
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,599
the middle part that is supposed to

899
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:29,520
germinate that's supposed to grow very

900
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:32,240
well I mean there are easy ways to kill

901
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:34,079
these things but then just to add it up

902
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:37,400
I went to somebody's farm who was

903
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:39,599
complaining about this issue of

904
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:41,839
having you know chewing

905
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:44,640
their coconut. But I go to the farm and

906
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:49,839
the farm was all bushy. A lot of weeds.

907
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:51,359
Okay. So you can't cail these weevils

908
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:53,359
whilst you have a lot of weeds in your

909
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,800
Exactly. Where do you expect the weevils

910
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:56,480
to go when you treat them? The moment

911
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,200
you treat them, they will just jump into

912
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,960
the the next one. The bush. The bush

913
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:04,320
where they will hide. Yes. So your

914
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:06,320
coconut farm should be free. Okay. And

915
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,240
it's a basic principle.

916
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,000
The moment you can keep it weight free

917
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,320
where there aren't many waste you won't

918
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
have a lot of insects hiding into into

919
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,320
the bush which will end up going into

920
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
your coconut to to call it. So sometimes

921
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,839
it's not really about focusing so much

922
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,839
on the coconut, but it's about focusing

923
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:23,920
so much on the kind of things you need

924
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:25,599
to do in the farm, the maintenance, the

925
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,000
reading, right? It's not really about

926
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:31,520
the coconut cuz as as I said, the

927
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,839
aronomic practices are very key. Okay.

928
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:36,400
So once I have to wait for 3 years plus

929
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:39,520
to start harvesting my first fruit, is

930
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:42,320
there any form of or any type of crop I

931
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:44,160
can intercrop with my coconut? And at

932
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,000
what stage of the coconut am I allowed

933
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:48,839
to do my intercropping? Very very good

934
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:52,000
question. Very very good question.

935
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:54,480
Um I understand Ghanaians usually don't

936
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,680
have a lot of farm lands. Yeah. So they

937
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:00,160
like to intercrop cropping we call it.

938
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:02,800
Um yes coconut you can do some

939
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,960
intercropping. Yeah. But it has to be

940
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:08,320
some specific crops. Okay. And I would

941
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:12,720
generalize by saying vegetables

942
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:14,880
things like tubers like cava. Yum. Nope.

943
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,800
Okay. I don't subscribe to those things

944
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,880
because they are so heavy feeders on

945
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,720
fertilizers. I mean sorry on nutrients

946
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,880
on nutrients.

947
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:27,040
So I usually don't subscribe people

948
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:29,680
intercropping tubers or cripping plants

949
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:32,079
like you know within coconut but

950
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:35,200
anything like vegetables um vegetables

951
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:37,119
like tomatoes, garden eggs, okra these

952
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,640
can be planted within coconut. Okay. And

953
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:41,520
it can be done right after you even

954
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:44,640
plant plant a coconut, you know. But as

955
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:46,800
I said, not to say that casaba will have

956
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,480
anything bad on coconut. Yeah, I visit

957
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,320
somebody's farm like that. He's planted

958
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,560
co I mean casabas throughout his farm.

959
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:55,920
Okay, he has a big farm and it was full

960
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:57,760
of cassaba. And I told him, boss, it's

961
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,280
not done. And he said, nothing has

962
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,720
happened to my farm. And I said, nothing

963
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,359
will happen to your farm. I'm not saying

964
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:05,440
the cava will kill your coconut. It

965
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:08,320
won't kill it but the cassava will

966
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:10,079
deplete the soil so much that no matter

967
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,680
no matter the fertilizer you introduce

968
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,359
you introduce to the coconut it won't do

969
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:15,599
well. Okay. You know there are some key

970
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:17,440
nutrients in the soil that is not

971
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:19,040
replenished. You can replenish them. It

972
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,040
takes time. That's why we have what we

973
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:23,119
call the pharaoh period in agriculture.

974
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:25,280
Exactly. You just have to leave the soil

975
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:28,320
to just stay on itself and it just

976
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:30,320
regain it. You can never introduce any

977
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:32,400
fertilizer to get that nutrients that is

978
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:36,800
lacking in the soil. That's why I say

979
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:39,280
it's not advisable to plant crops like

980
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:41,440
cava, yam and other things in the

981
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,240
coconut. Let me just backress by saying

982
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,079
coconut needs sunlight. Okay, sunlight,

983
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:49,680
plain sunlight. You go to people's farms

984
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:52,720
and you see coconut under trees,

985
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:55,200
under shades, coconut need at least 6

986
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:57,680
hours of sunlight. Okay. So it's not

987
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,200
something

988
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,960
you have to go through the processes and

989
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:03,280
if you do it well you enjoy it. Are

990
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:06,720
there any challenges associated with

991
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:09,520
coconut uh production? Um just as I

992
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:11,520
mentioned earlier with the diseases that

993
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,520
can be eliminated somehow it can be

994
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:18,480
controlled and it needs to be controlled

995
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:21,760
early. Um apart from that I would say

996
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:24,000
the drums um usually as I said you have

997
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,480
to plan early. Yeah. So if you plan

998
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,920
early your chances of having a

999
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:32,800
successful farm is higher but then if

1000
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:36,319
you have to wait and plant start

1001
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:38,720
planting somewhere September October you

1002
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:40,880
know not to say it's bad but you're not

1003
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,240
sure exactly of the rain patterns. Yeah

1004
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,480
if you have irrigation that you asked

1005
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,920
earlier that is okay you can plant it

1006
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,839
and you know you can irrigate your your

1007
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,440
seedlings when you when you transplant

1008
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:51,119
them. So these are the challenges that

1009
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,839
people face. It's expensive. It's not

1010
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:56,400
cheap. M it's not cheap. So I not even

1011
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:58,480
the nurses farming is expensive and I

1012
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,560
expect people to do it right. Get it

1013
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,880
right from the start and you enjoy it.

1014
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,480
In as much there are frustrations in it.

1015
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,720
You don't want to be frustrated so much.

1016
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:08,720
So try take your time. If you're not

1017
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,880
ready, don't even start. I tell people

1018
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:13,040
if you're not ready, don't start. It's

1019
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,880
okay to say I want to start something

1020
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,640
small. But then have it in your mind

1021
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,160
that even that small thing is

1022
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,440
challenging.

1023
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:22,480
That small that you want to start is

1024
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:25,319
challenging. So be ready, be emotionally

1025
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:27,760
prepared before you get into

1026
00:42:25,319 --> 00:42:29,839
into okay. I know you are into the

1027
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,839
farming and the nursery production but

1028
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:34,400
give and take. If you are asked to make

1029
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:36,880
a choice, will you stick to the nursery

1030
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:40,880
production and forfeit the farming or

1031
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:44,480
you you do the farming for you one not

1032
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:47,599
both. So I I I I

1033
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:50,160
I wasn't really looking forward to

1034
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:52,720
having a coconut nursery. Was never part

1035
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:56,880
of my plan. I never even envisaged or

1036
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:59,520
thought about it. Okay. Um so I remember

1037
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:01,839
somewhere 2020 when I started my nursery

1038
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:05,599
in my my time. Choose one. When I

1039
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:08,160
started my I had this agree director me

1040
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:10,640
and he saw my ne and he loved him. Okay.

1041
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:14,640
and he told me just do a lot of this and

1042
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:17,920
without you know and I was a bit

1043
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:19,839
hesitant but then I started doing it and

1044
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,839
it's giving me the opportunity to you

1045
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:23,760
know what advise people tell people what

1046
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:26,240
to do the farming practice and all that

1047
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,000
I'm sure if it was just my farm I

1048
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:30,240
wouldn't have that opportunity so it

1049
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,800
makes it very difficult and you need to

1050
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,400
have the farm okay and have the nursery

1051
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,319
to compliment because if somebody comes

1052
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,240
over here you usually I like them to

1053
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:40,319
visit the farm so they

1054
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:42,800
before they come. All right. Okay. How

1055
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:46,240
much is one? Call me. You don't have to

1056
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:50,880
say this on. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, so,

1057
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:53,119
so um let us know your location and how

1058
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:55,440
we can find you. So, we have we have

1059
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:58,960
three nursery sites. We have three

1060
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:02,040
nursery sites. One in Bas

1061
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:05,920
um not too far from We have one on the

1062
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:08,160
Asaman stretch. um that is at Samanu

1063
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,480
stretch and we have one in Kofaridia.

1064
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:13,280
Okay. So we have nursery sites in all

1065
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:15,119
these locations and we supply

1066

how we can reach out to you. But finally

1085
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:08,319
any tips or advice to give to those who

1086
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,560
are already in it, those who are yet to

1087
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:12,880
start so they can get it right because

1088
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:15,040
you had said it already. It's expensive

1089
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,640
being small or big farm. It is

1090
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:20,160
expensive.

1091
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:22,560
Yeah. Uh simply put, I would say get it

1092
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:26,000
right from the start. By getting it

1093
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:27,520
right, it means the right seedling. Ask

1094
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,319
the right questions when you're going to

1095
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:33,760
buy the seedlings, you know. Um

1096
00:45:31,319 --> 00:45:36,640
everything not just even farming starts

1097
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,960
with the how you started but farming

1098
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:40,400
specifically is with respect to the

1099
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,359
seedling that you're planting being a

1100
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:45,280
plantain being a cocoa being a coconut

1101
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:47,280
so you need to get the seedling right

1102
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,920
the neur has to be right and when we say

1103
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:52,240
get it right I mean you don't really

1104
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,400
have a lot of control you probably won't

1105
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:57,119
have the opportunity to raise your own

1106
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:59,280
neur I did for myself that is really

1107
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,640
successful for me but then wherever ever

1108
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:04,079
it is you're purchasing your seedlings

1109
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:07,520
from, try and ask the right questions.

1110
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:08,880
Cuz if it's wrong, if you get it wrong,

1111
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,720
then you're doomed. Then it's going to

1112
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,359
be very difficult for you. So ask the

1113
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:15,040
right questions and and and I think you

1114
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:17,280
can be very successful at being I mean

1115
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:19,839
get into coconut farming. Yeah. And I I

1116
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:22,880
inreat I intreat people to get into it.

1117
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:26,640
Um as I said earlier that coconut

1118
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:28,960
happens to be one of the farms to me. I

1119
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:32,400
know people will dispute that that you

1120
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:36,640
can do and relax but that is if you can

1121
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:38,319
do it well well properly planned farm

1122
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:42,640
where you don't necessarily have to be

1123
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:44,640
in the farm always okay unlike some of

1124
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,079
the other tree crops I'm a cocoa farmer

1125
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:49,040
and I know what goes into cocoa it's

1126
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:51,040
tedious it's very difficult right rubber

1127
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:54,079
farm before I started tapping rubber is

1128
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:58,319
so tedious but coconut unfortunately is

1129
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:59,599
not that difficult and I I I relied on I

1130
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:02,160
I I say it's not difficult because of

1131
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:04,920
the things the processes that are put in

1132
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:07,440
place studing well planting

1133
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:09,359
well pegging well even the lining and

1134
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:12,000
pegging has been done very well and if

1135
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:14,079
all these are met you are in for for a

1136
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,480
very beautiful journey in coconut okay

1137
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:19,520
and um coconut is good I entreat people

1138
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:22,800
to go into it yeah okay so let's use

1139
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:25,520
just one acre for an example um how much

1140
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:29,720
am I likely to make out of one acre

1141
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:32,480
coconut farm. Wo. Wo. So, um,

1142
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:35,920
coconut I would say is lucreative, okay?

1143
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:37,839
Cuz it's a demanding commodity. You

1144
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,880
know, people drink coconut everywhere in

1145
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:42,720
Ghana and it's one of the things that I

1146
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:47,520
can bet you that when you plant it, you

1147
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:49,440
certainly get the market for it. So, um,

1148
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:51,200
like like I said earlier, an acre of

1149
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,960
coconut, you're looking at around 75

1150
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:56,960
trees,

1151
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:59,520
75 acres. And I said earlier that a tree

1152
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:02,319
can give you maximum. It can give you up

1153
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:03,920
to about 150. But being realistic, we

1154
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:05,839
can limit ourselves that okay, you're

1155
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,920
going to be a very good farmer. You go

1156
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:10,640
through all the right farming practices.

1157
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:12,960
So you're targeting to have at least 100

1158
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:14,880
nuts per tree for your coconut. Let's

1159
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:17,040
just use that average. But as I said,

1160
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,480
it's not 100. It can be even less. That

1161
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,400
is depend on how you take care of your

1162
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:22,160
farm. But let's say you are a good

1163
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,880
farmer. You're going to go through the

1164
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:27,520
right processes and the right practices

1165
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:31,200
to probably get at least 100 per tree.

1166
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:33,280
So, simply you can multiply 100 nuts by

1167
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,520
75 trees. When you do that, how much how

1168
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:38,160
much do you get? 100. Uh, please wait.

1169
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:42,079
You know me, I like money. 100 multiply

1170
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:43,520
by 75 trees. Hey, how much is that? How

1171
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:46,480
how many siblings are that? So, it means

1172
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:49,920
you're going to get what? 7, 500 nuts.

1173
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:52,160
Yes. A year. Yes. I don't know how much

1174
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,920
in Ara times I buy coconut for six

1175
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,680
cities. Ah, it's CD. Sometimes I buy

1176
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,839
five cities. No, it's CCD. Right now,

1177
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:59,440
they've read budget. Exactly. So, let's

1178
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:02,160
say let's say you're not even going to

1179
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:04,319
sell it yourself in you just looking for

1180
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:05,440
let's say half of money. So, you're

1181
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:07,280
probably going to sell it for even half

1182
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:11,079
of that price for three cities. So,

1183
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:15,079
multiply 7,500 by three by

1184
00:49:11,079 --> 00:49:18,480
three. Hey, it means you have what?

1185
00:49:15,079 --> 00:49:22,400
22,500 per acre of coconut. And this is

1186
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:24,960
you doing an acre five trees. So if you

1187
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:27,760
want to do let's say 50 acres. Yes. You

1188
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:30,040
multiply 22500 by 50. How much do you

1189
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:33,319
get?

1190
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:37,440
Hey 1 billion. One means you make 1

1191
00:49:33,319 --> 00:49:39,760
million 1 million 1 million00. The G

1192
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:41,520
people say 1 million. Exactly. It means

1193
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:43,920
you can make a million cities out of

1194
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:45,839
coconut. 50 acre coconut farm. But there

1195
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:48,480
are conditions to it. Of course it's not

1196
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:50,800
that it's not magic. have 50 acres and

1197
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:53,440
you make 1 million cities, you can make

1198
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:56,160
a million cities out of a 50 acre

1199
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:57,839
coconut farm. But it all depends on what

1200
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:00,800
you do to the your management. The

1201
00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:03,200
management is a key. It plays a key role

1202
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,960
in your success. Okay. Yeah. All right.

1203
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:08,720
So, you know what we're going to do? I'm

1204
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:11,520
