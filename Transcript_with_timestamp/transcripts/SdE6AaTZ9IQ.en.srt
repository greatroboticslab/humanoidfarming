00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:04,580
all right

3
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,719
hey welcome to Uncle Tim's Farm

4
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,219
you're probably wondering what's going

5
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,840
on well

6
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,040
we're supposed to be getting a bunch of

7
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,000
rain and where these pigs have been

8
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,760
living

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,280
when that ground gets wet it is

10
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,739
impossible for me to get in there

11
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,879
it basically turns to just grease on the

12
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:56,460
surface

13
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:57,600
so I'm having to pull those pigs out of

14
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,039
there

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,019
for now well they're gonna be harvested

16
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,900
in just over a week

17
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,040
or actually yeah just over a week a week

18
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,799
from tomorrow

19
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,240
we're going to harvest them and so I

20
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,460
need to get them out of there because we

21
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,860
have we're expecting a bunch of rain the

22
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:19,260
next couple nights and then again all

23
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,180
next week it's supposed to rain so that

24
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:23,220
ground would just be way too wet for me

25
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,540
to get in there and get hooked up to

26
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,159
that trailer

27
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,840
so I went ahead and pulled them out

28
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,880
today and they're just gonna

29
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,619
go ahead and live in that trailer for

30
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,960
the next week

31
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,220
and I'll go ahead and add some more

32
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,380
straw in there they've had quite a bit

33
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,460
of straw put in a water bucket and a

34
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,960
feed tub

35
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,460
and that's just where they'll live for

36
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,560
the next week

37
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,500
they've already basically been spending

38
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,360
90 percent of their time in there they

39
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,320
go in there for shelter they sleep in

40
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,960
there

41
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,280
so it's not going to be that drastic of

42
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,680
a change for them the only thing is is

43
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,939
they won't have access to the pond you

44
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,500
know get out and roam around to go down

45
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:01,619
to the pond but

46
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,960
they'll be fine for the next week and

47
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:07,200
this way I am sure that I have them out

48
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:09,979
of there so that we can Harvest them

49
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,979
next week

61
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,139
well the pigs are all moved and settled

62
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,940
in

63
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:58,940
got their food and water for them

64
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,720
their food tub

65
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,940
water bucket

66
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,220
and lots of straw

67
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:10,020
so they should be set for the next week

68
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,919
in here should keep them nice and

69
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,320
comfortable

70
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:15,860
and I don't have to worry about not

71
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:18,000
being able to get into that

72
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:20,400
pasture to be able to

73
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,639
get them out of there

74
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:27,360
and it's looking like there

75
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:29,880
nice and big and ready to be harvested
