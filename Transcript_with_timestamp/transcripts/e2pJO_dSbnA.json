  "text": "[Music] well hey everybody peace and blessings to everyone so today I'm going to give you guys the update on how the garden is doing also on today I am going to plant the seed potatoes so I need to hear up and get them going um before we're past that Mark so it's the middle of February here in San Antonio and I want to go ahead and get these seed potatoes planted um so this is a seed potato Harvest blend uh it has like the purple potatoes the yellow potatoes and the red so we're going to go ahead and get these planted and I'm going to give you an update on how everything else has been growing on in the garden all right so everything is going along pretty good we have some cabbages over here that are really forming um the oregano it's been thriving it with stod the the winter U when we had a little Frost our th plant is growing back also the Mexican mint is growing back and we have cilantro uh we also have a little parsley that's peeking through over there unfortunately our basil died but it was expected so we're not too sad about that over here we have more cabbin look at these cabbages they are growing and really fing I have to get out here and treat them again because you as you can see you have the little bugs that's kind of wearing them out also we have broccoli look at the broccoli is growing the broccoli is coming through so I'm excited we have a lot of broccoli heads that are growing also over here we have the brussel sprouts that are growing as well you can look down in there these are brussels sprout plants um uh we have some more over here and then we have more broccoli that's growing so I'm excited about the broccoli all right and so over here we have more cabbages um we have some radishes that I'm going to harvest today because they have been in here too long I think I've let them I've let them get too big so uh but the spinach is doing well look at that spinach the spinach is doing very well we have some more cabbage over here um we have some lettuce and we have some carrots so everything has been growing pretty good now over here we have a we have some beets that are growing um we have our turnup greens so I am going to harvest some turnips today if you look down in there we have quite a few of these turnup greens that are they're ready they can be harvested if you look there this is like a a trio so I'm going to harvest some and then plant some more seeds the only thing I don't like is the turnips are pretty good but big but the leaves we didn't really get a lot of leav growth but had to get out here and treat it because these bugs are really eating them up and so here go the collge they're growing and then we have some Swiss short over there so if anybody I have idea what I can put down for these greens um what can stop these you know the bugs that are eating them up please let me know all right so I'm going to plant the potatoes over here in these two boxes and then I put some uh compost um dirt that I already had I put it in here and then I'm just going to mix it with some miracle Grill and some other top saw dirt that I have all right going to put the dirt in here this is just some pot and so it's not that expensive I feel this well since these are full I am just going to put so let see we hold all right so this looks like a red one so I'm going to put that down there and cover it up another one right there put this one over here I'm not putting them too far down but just down enough I don't no I'm not supposed to put which way I supposed to putant there a hole I'm going put the roots that one right there we have another one right here this here and them up so I have one more so I'm thinking about the this one I'm just going to put this one in another box and go from there all right so I have another box this is the biggest one I can find it's a little smaller than the H or to but it's going to work go ahead and put this side in here so this almost fills this box up so I'm going to add some of the [Applause] put the too there all right so here's the tuer I'm going put this one right here in the middle cover it up and then I'm going to water so what I'm also going to do I'll probably get another bag up there just to feel these all the way up to the top I'm go ahead and under M estim the water coming all the way over here so once they store gr I just use the get the water in from now do this hopefully it doesn't miss the box so I wonder should I put a plastic EG in here anyway oh we're going to see it's going to be TR the Box start breaking think that should little but oh well we going to go from here and see how yeah all right so I got the potatoes done so next thing I'm going to do um probably tomorrow I have some seedlings I'm going to go ahead and start indoors um so um you know when the spring kick in so still got a little time but I'm going to go ahead and start them indoors so I can transplant them um in six weeks so thank you guys for watching my um Gardon Channel God bless you eat what you grow and have a growthful day [Music]",
