a report commissioned by the uk

government and adopted by the united

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,840
nations estimates that 10 million deaths

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,719
may occur

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,199
each year by 2050 due to antimicrobial

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:20,000
resistance if nothing is done

00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,760

fao together with the government of

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,680
kenya have designed interventions to

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,240
fight antimicrobial resistance in

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,640
poultry production in kenya we have

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,120
deployed interventions that are related

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:45,200
to proper feeding

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:47,440
vaccinations and improving hygiene

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,719
antimicrobial resistance shorthand as

amr

18
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,160
is a global public health threat in

00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:55,199
simple terms

20
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:58,640
antimicrobial resistance refers to

21
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:02,160
as the situation where the germs are not

22
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,960
killed by the drugs that used to kill

23
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,600
them before

24
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,119
the process of antimicrobial resistance

25
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,520
though occurring naturally

26
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,119
is escalated by misuse and overuse of

27
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,600
antibiotics

28
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:17,600
to address this interventions need to be

29
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:22,319
instituted in both human and animal

concertation of farmers involved in

rearing of commercial layers

35
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,799
in a knowledge attitude and practices

36
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,040
study done in this area

37
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,000
fao found out that out of the 10 most

38
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,399
common diseases

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,560
in poultry four can be prevented through

40
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,320
vaccination and six can be prevented

41
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,960
through hygiene

42
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,200
fao then conducted a pilot project that

43
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,439
involved training of about 50 poultry

44
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,799
farmers in best practices in poultry

45
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,960
production

46
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,799
the project adopted the farmer field

47
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,119
school approach where the farmers were

48
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,200
divided into three groups

49
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,360
learning took place in a class without

50
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,239
walls and a fully stocked poultry unit

51
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,599
was also availed for practical lessons

52
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:15,040
we are trying to train our farmers

53
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:18,160
to clear their chicken produce

54
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:23,840
eggs that are free from

55
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,840
antibiotics cow

56
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:36,800
it is possible and profitable

57
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,959
to rear chicken without the use of drugs

58
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,959
because antimicrobial resistance is

59
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,760
brought about by misuse and overuse of

60
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,599
drugs

61
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,840
and drugs are mostly needed to cure

62
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,519
diseases therefore if diseases are

63
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,080
prevented there would be no need for

64
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,680
drugs

65
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,680
and hence reduced occurrence of

66
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,760
antimicrobial resistance

67
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,599
since most diseases are brought by about

68
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,760
unhygienic conditions

69
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,599
improvement of hygiene and biosecurity

70
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,599
was the main focus of training in the

71
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,360
farmer field schools

72
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,959
already the farmers have begun

73
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,959
implementing the lessons learned in

74
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,200
their poultry farms the farmers

75
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,040
have actually changed they are already

76
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,599
practicing what

77
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,640
we've been able to to teach them how to

78
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,159
train them

79
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,680
and at the moment the three groups are

80
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:22,480
already able to produce

81
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:24,040
eggs which are free from antimicrobial

82
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:28,400
residues

my name is steven gacho himboro when

85
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,519
you observe proper hygiene you hardly

86
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,400
make use of

87
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,750
any drug and we have realized that is

88
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,159
true

90
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,840
i don't remember when the last time that

91
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,319
i used drugs

92
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,200
i passed right since the fire came in

93
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,080
actually

94
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,360
when checking my record i wondered what

95
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,480
happened to the diseases that

96
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,560
used to inflict my birds

97
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,720
stephen is planning to reconstruct his

98
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,080
poultry unit to conform to what he has

99
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,000
learned in farmer's field

100
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:08,159
school nancy on the other hand has

101
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,159
improved her bio-security measures

102
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,360
this is the 26th week of training and

103
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,840
the birds in the poultry show house have

104
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,560
attained

105
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,759
peak production with no death from

106
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,880
disease

107
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:39,280
we are hoping that this this knowledge

108
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,400
the farmers have received it will be

109
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,320
cascaded

110
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:47,280
outwards in fact it can be done

111
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,280
internationally the farmers are proud

112
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,759
and happy as they are graduating in a

113
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:57,840
ceremony presided over by fao and

114
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:57,840
government representatives

115
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,560
i'm not just like any other farmer i

116
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,080
have graduated i'm very happy about that

117
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,639
i have a certificate that can actually

118
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,360
present it

119
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,680
somewhere in an office yeah and that

120
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,840
means that i've been given a go ahead

121
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:39,220
to do as much as i would like about

122
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:46,229
those birds i have a lot of knowledge
