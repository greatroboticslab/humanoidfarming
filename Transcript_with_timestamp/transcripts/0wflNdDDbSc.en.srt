2020 edition

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,160
well we've got six quick hitches lined

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,279
up here and if you just give them a

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,119
quick glance

7
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,119
you might see a few different colors but

8
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,160
the construction is generally the same

9
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,840
let's go ahead and point out some

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,960
differences here throughout this video

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,239
show you

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,200
oh let's just wait for rosie there

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,320
show you what actually makes these

15
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,680
things a little bit different

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,520
one of them is going to stand out from

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,719
the rest in a big way it's gonna save

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,840
you a lot of money make sure you stick

19
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,000
around

through the description as well a lot of

24
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,800
helpful links down there

25
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,719
check out the other videos on the

26
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,920
channel here we go

27
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,920
okay so i'm going to go ahead i'll tell

28
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,199
you what each one of these quick hitches

29
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,800
is here you know who makes it the

30
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,000
manufacturer that kind of thing then

31
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,320
we're going to kind of go through

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,920
just some general um properties of them

33
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,400
you know weight dimensions

34
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,000
construction color adjustability and if

35
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,439
they require bushings or not

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,439
as far as pricing goes you can get that

37
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,759
on my website go to

38
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:17,360
goodworkstractors.com

39
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,960
it changes over time i don't really like

40
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,640
to put the pricing in here

41
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,240
i call this the 2020 version because i

42
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,439
did a version about two and a half years

43
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,280
ago i put the price

44
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,799
of one of these quick hitches in there

45
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,840
and the price went up it's gone up a

46
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,119
couple times since then

47
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,560
and so you know it's like putting my

48
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,360
foot in my mouth when i can't honor that

49
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,759
price because

50
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,040
the prices just go up over time okay so

51
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,320
this one right by me here is going to be

52
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,960
the work saver quick hitch this is the

53
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,560
one that

54
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,720
i've been selling over the last couple

55
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,200
of years a very popular choice very well

56
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,799
built

57
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,920
a good price point as well this green

58
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,840
one that you see here this can be the

59
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,439
john deere eye match you're going to see

60
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,040
all sorts of those all over the place

61
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,520
this next one up right here is going to

62
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,680
be a

63
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,040
tar river quick hitch okay and keep in

64
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,159
mind these are all category 1 quick

65
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,920
hitches as well

66
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,040
uh next one up here is going to be a lan

67
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,560
pride this particular model is a qh-15

68
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,000
on there next one up right here is a

69
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,719
nortec you guys probably haven't seen

70
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,079
this

71
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,920
on my website but i did just get these

72
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,280
in fairly recently and the last one

73
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,360
right here is going to be the brand new

74
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,800
one that i have the spiko quick hitch

75
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,040
okay so first thing here let's just take

76
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,120
a look at the general construction

77
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,319
probably one of the key differences

78
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,760
between

79
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,080
a couple different versions of this is

80
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,080
going to be in kind of this

81
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,760
gusset area here this cross bracing area

82
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,520
between the legs that come down

83
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,200
and then the top section okay so if you

84
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,080
take a look a lot of them are going to

85
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,080
have this thicker

86
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,440
chunkier beefier section here you can

87
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,959
see it there in the spiko

88
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,440
you can see it there on the nortec you

89
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,040
can see it oh nope not on the land pride

90
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,519
you can see it there on the

91
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,959
tar river you got a little bit right

92
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,480
there on the eye match

93
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,400
and then you're going to have it you

94
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,760
know that same chunkiness on the work

95
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,440
saver as well now

96
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,440
over here on the lamp if you look at the

97
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,959
back side there is a they do have a flat

98
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,760
piece right here okay flat piece of

99
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,160
steel

100
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,760
get you down take a look on the bottom

101
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,040
side it's kind of hard to see you know

102
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,959
but maybe you can see it there a little

103
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,000
bit better but this um

104
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,599
all the others that are going to have

105
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,239
that substantial cross bracing it's all

106
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,400
the way through

107
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,480
okay on the front and the back so that's

108
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,720
going to be one of the key differences

109
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,319
between these quick hitches now on a

110
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,440
general construction note as well you

111
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,760
can see on the top

112
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,519
hook where there's all the different

113
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,360
positions there okay that's going to be

114
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,440
pretty well standard

115
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,640
some might have an extra bolt hole or

116
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,920
two compared to some others we're

117
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,959
talking these bolt holes here where you

118
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,599
can adjust

119
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,360
the top hook in multiple positions there

120
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,879
was an old version of at least the eye

121
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,400
mask probably some others as well that

122
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,239
actually had just a welded

123
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,159
top hook so this wasn't able to be moved

124
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,400
and adjusted up and down which

125
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,680
is very convenient to do so keep that in

126
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,120
mind if you are shopping for something

127
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,720
that's in the used market and you see an

128
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,560
eye match or something similar

129
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,680
maybe just double check it has these

130
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,760
additional holes here where you can

131
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,120
adjust this top hook position

132
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,400
so while we're kind of staring at these

133
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,000
top hooks here too if you take a look

134
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,519
you see how this comes out here and then

135
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,560
it's kind of a longer taper if you take

136
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,560
a look at the

137
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,720
eye match for instance it's a pretty

138
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,560
narrow position from here to here with

139
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,000
not as much of a taper so you'll hear

140
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,080
some folks say they have trouble

141
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,640
with this top hook not kind of extending

142
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,640
out enough to be able to grab the top

143
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,760
link there on the three-point hitch you

144
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,760
can see there these

145
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,200
others all kind of for the most part

146
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,239
generally extend out a little bit

147
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,840
further okay

148
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,280
compared to the eye match just a point

149
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,479
of observation

150
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,479
they're all going to have these spring

151
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,000
handles that are on top here so if you

152
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:24,320
take a look this way

153
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,199
you can just you know rock that top

154
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,720
handle you can see

155
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,639
down here pay attention down here okay

156
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,400
when you open up the top handle

157
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,240
it retracts that okay and then you close

158
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,000
it back up on top of there

159
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,120
just the general functionality of all

160
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,080
these doesn't really matter you can see

161
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,600
there's levers on

162
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,680
on all of them too one for each side

163
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,360
there okay next up we're gonna do the

164
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,040
old weight test on here got the scale

165
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,360
out here hopefully you can see the uh

166
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,120
the the digital display right there if

167
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,560
you can i'll go ahead and repeat it but

168
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,479
i did add a piece of wood on here it's

169
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,800
reading 0.0 i zeroed it out with the

170
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:51,840
wood

171
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,680
i just need that on there to kind of

172
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,120
support the legs uh we'll go ahead and

173
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,520
get some weights

174
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,800
okay so spiko's reading in at 69.6

175
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:04,080
pounds

176
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:11,120
this is the nortec 56.6 pounds

177
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:13,919
land pride 68.6 pounds

178
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,919
entire river

179
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:24,800
56.0 i

180
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:27,840
match 65.4

181
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,600
well 65.2 it went down to

182
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,360
lastly is the work saver it does come

183
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,000
with this um

184
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,479
this top link here which i'm going to

185
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,479
take off

186
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,919
this is just for like um non-quick hitch

187
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,280
compatible

188
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,960
attachments if you can see that right

189
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,720
there kind of goes in and gets a little

190
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,080
bit more flexibility to connect

191
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,000
but also i just realized let's see the

192
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,360
spiko doesn't have the top pin so that's

193
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,759
probably just a few ounces there

194
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,600
that's gonna you know affect the weight

195
00:05:53,759 --> 00:06:00,560
but not significantly

196
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,759
the work saver 70.2 pounds okay

197
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,280
okay i don't want to keep you hanging

198
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,520
too much longer but i want to get right

199
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,440
to the point here on why that spiko is

200
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,639
going to save you a bunch of money okay

201
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,319
it's going to save you a lot more money

202
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,600
compared to all the others every single

203
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,000
other one that you saw there

204
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,800
is going to require something like what

205
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,280
you see right here

206
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,639
now this big old rusty looking thing you

207
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,479
might see in brass color as well but

208
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,400
it's called a bushing okay it takes

209
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,840
what is a category one attachment and

210
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,960
turns it into a category three

211
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,800
attachment

212
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,280
for whatever reason category one quick

213
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,680
hitches nobody's ever explained it to me

214
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,840
need to get upsized to a category three

215
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,000
by use of this bushing which can be

216
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,520
upwards of forty dollars per set you

217
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,880
need to have a set of these bushings for

218
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,319
every three point attachment that you

219
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,199
would normally hook up directly to your

220
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,280
three-point hitch

221
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,560
with a category one no problem you need

222
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,759
to get a set of these bushings

223
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,919
for every single one that you want to

224
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,400
put in a quick hitch quick hitches are

225
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,680
just a fantastic tool to take the pain

226
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,520
out of the hook up process

227
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,199
they're not going to hook up the pto but

228
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,960
they're going to take the process

229
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,639
of attaching individually the three

230
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,639
points on the three-point hitch

231
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,400
and allow you to do that all at one time

232
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,080
so with that speako quick hitch there

233
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,599
you don't need those bushings so

234
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,199
depending if you have two three four

235
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,880
five six attachments

236
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,560
times that by just roughly forty dollars

237
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,319
for a ballpark and you can look at the

238
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,800
savings that you're going to see

239
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,560
and did i mention i can ship these quick

240
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,240
hitches out to you as well so yeah

241
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,160
i can ship the spiko i can ship the

242
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,400
nortec if you wanted i can ship

243
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,080
the tar river i can ship a used imatch i

244
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,520
don't get news of those and i can ship a

245
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,880
work saver so i can ship pretty much

246
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,160
what you see here

247
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,319
the land pride i kind of keep for

248
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,599
demonstration purposes but i do get used

249
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,960
eye matches in

250
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,960
the other stuff is going to be brand new

251
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,400
typically the speakers right now are the

252
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,759
big seller because again they don't

253
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,880
require those bushings so

254
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,960
get a hold of me if you'd like to order

255
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,759
one now let's grab a quick dimension

256
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,360
here we're going to go ahead and take

257
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,520
the outside to outside might come back

258
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,800
and do the inside to inside as well but

259
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,120
you're going to see these are all going

260
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,280
to be very very very similar in

261
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,479
in width overall okay not really too

262
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,280
concerned about the height from the

263
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,639
bottom link

264
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,080
to the top link because you can see

265
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,120
again with all the adjustability that

266
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,560
these have

267
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,400
you can play with this however you need

268
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,840
to you have more than enough flexibility

269
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,360
there to make that work so

270
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,720
main concern is going to be your width

271
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,840
down here in the bottom i just want to

272
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,800
show it to you that way you can see it

273
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,479
for yourself

274
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,280
outside the outside on the speako just

275
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:14,000
under 29 and a half

276
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,759
outside to outside on the nortec just

277
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,039
over 29 and a half

278
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:21,680
outside to outside on the land pride

279
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,199
just under 29 and a half outside the

280
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,319
outside on the tar river

281
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:29,919
just over 29 and a half outside

282
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:32,320
outside on the eye match

283
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,240
pretty much right on 29 and a half and

284
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,680
then outside to outside on the work

285
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,080
saver

286
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,839
just under 29 and a half there's going

287
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,880
to be manufacturing tolerances that come

288
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,719
into play that's going to

289
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,240
have that vary just slightly but

290
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,720
basically look at 29.5

291
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,000
outside the outside dimension okay now

292
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,480
really quick we'll go ahead and do the

293
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,720
inside to inside

294
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,320
you're going to be at 27 and a quarter

295
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,160
on the spiko

296
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:01,440
27 and a quarter on the nortec

297
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,760
basically 27 on the land pride

298
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,959
just over 27 and a quarter on the tar

299
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,240
river

300
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:11,600
about 27 and eighth on the i match

301
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,360
and 27 and eighth on the work saver

302
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,040
oh well i hope that was as much fun for

303
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,959
you as it was for me got a little bit of

304
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,560
a workout in there but

305
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,320
spiko okay i've been selling these

306
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,600
things like hotcakes right now but

307
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,800
got a lot of questions on them recently

308
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,399
so i wanted to show you how they

309
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,959
compared to the other models that are in

310
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,480
here

311
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,160
try to do that give you as much of a

312
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,920
apples to apples as possible

313
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,240
it's not perfect it's not scientific it

314
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,760
just it's me doing my thing okay so

315
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,200
i don't really care which one you buy as

316
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,560
long as you buy it from me

317
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,080
maybe i'll cut that out i might leave it

318
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,600
in but the point being the reason i'm

319
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,120
selling so many of these right now is

320
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,800
because of this requirement right down

321
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,120
here does not require the bushings it's

322
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,200
a direct fit to your category one pins

323
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,480
saves you a lot of money that way again

324
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,880
if there was some

325
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,399
majorly detrimental reason to why it

326
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,320
shouldn't be set up like this

327
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,160
i probably wouldn't be selling them okay

328
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,480
but the fact that there's not

329
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,839
and nothing has ever been said about the

330
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,680
reason why that

331
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,079
these bushings are required for all

332
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,839
these other quickitches here

333
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,279
seems like a racket to me so so whatever

334
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,560
i mean this is just information for you

335
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,000
guys helping make a better decision

336
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,519
because a lot of you guys can't come and

337
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,519
see this product in person

338
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,800
i ship it out all the time so it's just

339
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,720
to let you see

340
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,320
what they all are side by side you know

341
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,959
dimensional-wise are all built to the

342
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,519
same asae specification that is going to

343
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,600
be

344
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,680
controlling the dimensional tolerances

345
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,680
of everything that way it works and so

346
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,519
that means that not only is going to be

347
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,279
on the quick hitch side but also

348
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,800
the quick hitch compatible attachments

349
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,680
if something is branded as quick hitch

350
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,800
compatible

351
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,240
it's going to work with a quick hitch

352
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,839
okay you may just need the bushings if

353
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,680
you don't go ahead and get a speaker

354
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,600
as far as color hey right now they're

355
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,519
red i had some in black

356
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,959
you know get a can of spray paint paint

357
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,560
it whatever color you want

358
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,320
it's just a basic hunk of steel meant to

359
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,480
make your life a lot easier

360
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,680
get into it cheaper without the bushings

361
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,040
