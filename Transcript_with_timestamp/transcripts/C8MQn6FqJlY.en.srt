2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,879
we're here in the village of Sardar in

3
00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:09,480
the province of Kandahar in Afghanistan

4
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:11,960
we've just had a fantastic meeting with

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,280
a group of Village elders and farmers

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,559
and a Farmers Association to talk about

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,400
some of the many challenges they're

8
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:20,439
facing in this country which has been

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,640
facing now over 35 years of Warf for

10
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:23,599
what is really interesting with these

11
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,640
Farmers is to discover how aware they

12
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:27,519
are of the challenges they're facing

13
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,679
we've talked a lot about water water

14
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:32,399
scarcity we've talked about crops we've

15
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:35,320
talked about the soil problems markets

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,879
but what's most amazing to me is their

17
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,360
awareness of the fact that their

18
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:41,680
agricultural systems need to change to

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,879
evolve to adapt to what they're facing

20
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,120
climate change here we've just finished

21
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:48,239
looking at a check Dam which will help

22
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,199
them to prevent too much water flow in

23
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,440
their in their land to prevent erosion

24
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:54,160
and we'll also recharge groundwater this

25
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,640
is an important project that was funded

26
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,440
by the World Bank and implemented

27
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,000
through FAO uh one of almost 7,000 check

28
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,280
dams that FAO has done in the country

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,320
country they want to move into uh

30
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,320
Horticultural crops they realize that

31
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:10,159
farming systems must evolve um but for

32
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,600
us as FAO the most precious part here is

33
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,640
the fact that they already know what

34
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,960
these challenges are and we can support

35
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,680
them we can help them with so many ways

36
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,780
but we're pushing on an open door they

37
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:28,920
already know so much of what it's

38
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:31,110
