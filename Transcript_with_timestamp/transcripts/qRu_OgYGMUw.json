  "text": "hi I'm Lucy Edwards with the Alabama Cooperative Extension system today we're going to go over the basic steps for taking your soil sample what do you have a raised bed garden a lot of times you're going to have high organic material in your raised bed so this will not be a routine soil test this will be run as what they consider a saturated paste test to analyze that high organic matter it will still give you results for nitrogen phosphorus potassium calcium magnesium and then if you want additional micronutrients it can also tell you that as well so a few things that you will need when you take a soil sample first you'll need a container so this is just an old pot lying around you can use anything just something to hold the soil if you have a soil probe you can use a soil probe but most of us probably have a handy trowel lying around and so that's what we'll use today with in this race bed I'm going to take a couple of different sub samples mix them together in my bucket and then lastly I will combine them in a ziploc bag because this is about as much soil as you need and then we'll place the soil in our box and they will fill out the salt form that goes with each sample now each form you can do up to five samples so you don't necessarily need a form for each box you can use five different soil boxes to go with one form some people will ask well do I do do I need a separate source ample for each raised bed my response to that would be if you can tell the major difference in your growing conditions so like this bed grew really well but the wood beside it grew portly I'd probably do two separate samples now if they're both having similar yields then I would only take one sample and what I would probably do is what I'm taking my subsamples I would take half from this bed and half from that bed so we're gonna begin sampling this bed we're gonna take subsamples about four inches deep and we're going to take on from different parts of this bed then we're going to mix this sample together that way it's a blended representation of our bed we're going to take our ziplock bag we're gonna fill it most of the way up this is about half way and that's okay the reason why we use a bag before putting it inside the box is simply because this soil is moist in the boxes cardboard and over time that moist soil will break down the cardboard box and if you mail this when it gets to the soil lab this box will be all falling apart so therefore I like to put it in a ziplock bag as you can see it fits nicely in the box we're gonna close the box according to the directions it does have a little sticky seal here so it closes you don't need any tape or anything and that is our box the next step would be filling out the name of the sender so that would be your name the mailing address the location and then field name so if you have your raised beds labeled or if you have them like tomato bed versus pepper bed you would put the the name of that raised bed where it says building name and then crop to be grown so that may be pepper tomato squash zucchini you could do generic vegetables and it will come back making recommendations for all of your vegetables then last what we write on the box we're going to then write on the form so that way it correlates this box name so if we named it named it box number one acres you have put down square footage because obviously this is not an acre and then the crops to be grown again could be tomato vegetable tomatoes or vegetables depending on what you put on your box and that is how you take a basic soil sample for a raised bed garden you",
