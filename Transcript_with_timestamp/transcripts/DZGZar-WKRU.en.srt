00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:18,190

3
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,690
[Music]

4
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,559
well one of the cooler things that we

5
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,719
have got uh since we lived here has been

6
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,440
the tractor

7
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,879
um the tractor where are you going out

8
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:45,000
of here

9
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,000
you don't want to talk about the tractor

10
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,559
seriously

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,399
yep all right

12
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,719
so let's talk about the tractor one of

13
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,480
my more genius purchases

14
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,039
probably the best thing that we've ever

15
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,960
owned has been the tractor

16
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,280
that's arguable yes i thought you didn't

17
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,359
want to talk about the tractor okay

18
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,879
so anyways uh one of the one of the

19
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,680
better things that we probably have ever

20
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,920
purchased here in my opinion not sarah's

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,560
has been the tractor uh it's the one

22
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,000
thing that i have probably learned the

23
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,159
most from

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,880
and in my opinion we wouldn't be doing

25
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,640
anything that we're doing without it

26
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,439
well if sarah doesn't want to talk about

27
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,520
the tractor that's just fine by me it's

28
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:29,520
understandable we got the tractor in

29
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,759
march of uh 2017 and it's been a huge

30
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,040
learning curve for me

31
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,439
um

32
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,520
there's been a lot of repairs on it um

33
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,520
it's a pretty old machine though so it's

34
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,640
a 1949

35
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,399
i know uh based on the

36
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,399
stamp that is on the motor that the

37
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:50,799
motor was made march 28

38
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:52,240
1949 so

39
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,479
it's always hard to tell with these

40
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,560
tractors what was done over the years

41
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,719
you know what parts were replaced was

42
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,399
this tractor destroyed at one time and

43
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,079
then they took another tractor and

44
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,880
basically

45
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,320
built one tractor out of both tractors

46
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,360
that's hard to say

47
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,640
um

48
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:13,840
but for all intents and purposes

49
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,280
uh she's a 1949 to me

50
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,599
and um

51
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,000
and it's pretty cool they uh they knew

52
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,840
what they were doing back then um

53
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,720
it's pretty impressive all the little

54
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,200
gadgets i won't go into great detail on

55
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,120
the tractor uh for all the nerds out

56
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,560
there if they're tractor nerds they

57
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,200
probably know everything there is to

58
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,840
know about it but i will show you a few

59
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,160
different cool things that i think are

60
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,640
pretty neat on it

61
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,319
this right here is the fuel shut off

62
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,080
so you got to turn that on it's got that

63
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,599
sediment bowl with a whole bunch of crap

64
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,360
in it as you can see

65
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,239
um one thing that i did add to the

66
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,319
tractor was a battery disconnect um

67
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,040
that's right here it's just basically a

68
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,440
100 amp battery disconnect switch

69
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,800
the reason i added that was i i did have

70
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,400
one of these go bad on me and um

71
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,680
i was about 30 feet away from the

72
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,560
tractor and it tried to start

73
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,319
and

74
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,239
thankfully it wasn't in gear or anything

75
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,080
like that

76
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,000
but that made me nervous enough to put a

77
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,760
battery disconnect on it

78
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,280
just to have one extra safety feature

79
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,360
too for the kids

80
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,519
although they know not to touch things

81
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,959
and they're pretty good at it um

82
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,120
the uh the

83
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,640
cool old switch here that's uh the

84
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,720
starter switch so when you go to start

85
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,920
it up basically you just turn the power

86
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,159
on

87
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,239
uh i replaced the ignition key with an

88
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,000
ignition switch that way i could easily

89
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,280
just kill it if i needed to while it was

90
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,560
out in the field

91
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,200
um

92
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,319
basically just push that pull that make

93
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,319
sure it's in neutral

94
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,000
and there she wanted to start right

95
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,000
right there so

96
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,360
pretty simple uh make sure you got the

97
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,120
gas on otherwise you'll uh

98
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,560
it'll let you know you run out of gas

99
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,480
after a couple of minutes of cruising

100
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:04,319
around so had that happen a time or two

101
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,959
this here is all brand new this year um

102
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,560
they had a piece that was in here

103
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,280
that uh

104
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,480
got busted off or they they hammered it

105
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,159
off well anyways it's supposed to have

106
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,680
this pin that goes all the way through

107
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,040
the rear so you don't end up busting

108
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,880
these ears off

109
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,320
and uh so i replaced that that was a

110
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,560
little bit of a

111
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,160
to do i had to drill out the old one and

112
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,120
there's a sleeve that goes in there and

113
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:30,320
that all works i bought this uh rocker

114
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,680
online uh it's pretty cool uh if

115
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,199
anybody's been paying attention they're

116
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,040
yelling at me for running gear on the

117
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,560
top i i know i'm not supposed to be

118
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,680
running gear on the top but for whatever

119
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,320
reason

120
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,919
the pin that i have

121
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,360
isn't long enough to go through the

122
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:45,520
bottom so i think i'm gonna have to get

123
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,680
in there and do a little sanding so calm

124
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,199
down on that it's okay uh probably the

125
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,120
first thing that i bought when i got the

126
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,560
tractor was that cover right there for

127
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,639
the uh

128
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,919
for the pto i don't want to end up with

129
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,600
my shirt or my sock or a kid's arm or

130
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,600
anything else and that that thing won't

131
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,960
stop turning ever

132
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,720
that's the one thing about these old

133
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,160
tractors is

134
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,400
you know in a way they call them widow

135
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:12,320
makers or whatever because nothing stops

136
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,840
them you know told sarah if i if i'm out

137
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,280
on the tractor and i have a heart attack

138
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,880
it's either going to end up in the pond

139
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,800
or hit a tree or

140
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,800
flip over in the ditch because there's

141
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,320
nothing that stops these things it just

142
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,520
keeps going

143
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:28,240
so this one's a four speed with reverse

144
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,400
um it does have a transmission and i

145
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,400
still i put a video out asking for guys

146
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,639
help and i'll just mention it here again

147
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,840
it has a transmission with a high low

148
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,520
gear uh selector and i have yet to have

149
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,759
anybody figure out exactly what

150
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,360
transmission it is so

151
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,800
there's some smart person watching this

152
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,720
video

153
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,639
what transmission has a handle like that

154
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,960
i've only seen one other one online with

155
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,199
the hole in that exact spot all of the

156
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:56,160
other ones that have the cable

157
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,240
uh cable switch that hole is actually up

158
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,400
on top it's about an inch up so this

159
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,800
one's a little bit different uh they had

160
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,600
cut a hole in the side here

161
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,720
uh to access inside there's kind of like

162
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,039
a a spring and a bolt that hooks to a a

163
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,720
pin for the transmission for that

164
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:16,639
um other than that i converted it to uh

165
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,319
to 12 volt that was one of the other

166
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,720
earlier things that i did and put this

167
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,360
alternator in um

168
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,520
i've replaced the head gasket i've

169
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,280
i've done all sorts of stuff so

170
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,479
when sarah's joking about not wanting to

171
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,560
hear another dang thing about the

172
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:34,160
tractor you can believe that i've talked

173
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,080
your ear off about this tractor so but

174
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,759
i'll tell you this i've never heard her

175
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,520
complain when uh

176
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,000
when the driveway's clear of snow and

177
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,720
she didn't lift a finger so i'll tease

178
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,720
her there a little bit

179
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,639
well this is implement row this is where

180
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,319
i

181
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,680
store all the stuff on the edge of the

182
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,680
woods here

183
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,080
i got quite a few different things over

184
00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:00,160
the past few years i've done pretty good

185
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,160
i think as far as cost is concerned

186
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,160
some of these uh can really do some

187
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,680
amazing stuff

188
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,840
as a matter of fact it might kind of

189
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,240
sound silly for this video but i picked

190
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,199
a small piece of land and went out and

191
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,680
used

192
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,680
these to show you guys exactly what they

193
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,919
can do so i hope you appreciate the

194
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,120
effort that i put in for that i'm not

195
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,039
going to do anything i don't have

196
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,400
anything planned to do with that that

197
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,319
land so

198
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,759
it's just going to just a small little

199
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,720
spot just to kind of show you what it

200
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,400
can do

201
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:33,919
this here is an old john deere discharl

202
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:37,199
this was a gift from my neighbor a

203
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:39,199
super super awesome gift i um

204
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,759
i think i told the story in another

205
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,199
video so i'll keep keep it short for

206
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,120
this video but

207
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,879
how i came across this was i was showing

208
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,400
my dad and my father-in-law the back

209
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,479
half of the property

210
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,240
and i walked into the weeds and ran my

211
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,599
shin directly into the side of one of

212
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,080
these things

213
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:59,599
i couldn't couldn't see the discs under

214
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:02,400
the grass and uh ran into it and my dad

215
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,919
and i and my uh father-in-law mike we

216
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,000
uncovered it

217
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,919
and my dad said hey it's an old disk he

218
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,960
was all excited and i thought nothing of

219
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,680
it and

220
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,599
then later on down the road after the

221
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,680
whole garden fiasco we had with the

222
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,280
other stupid thing i bought

223
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,800
i thought about this laying out there

224
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,599
and wondered what condition it was in

225
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,120
and

226
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,319
went out and kind of took a better look

227
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,400
at it and

228
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,800
figured it belonged to my neighbor since

229
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,840
he owned my land previous and i called

230
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,240
him up and

231
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,959
asked him about it and

232
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,719
he uh he said yeah if you uh if you want

233
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,719
to get that thing unburied out there

234
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,000
it's yours so i took it back to the

235
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,000
garage and

236
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,399
and tore it completely apart and did a

237
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,760
complete restore and rebuild on it boy

238
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,680
it looked beautiful

239
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,680
when it when it first got pulled out of

240
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,959
the garage after it got all repainted

241
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,959
and everything but

242
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:53,040
she's got some wear on her now

243
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,480
but it's pretty cool it's got a couple

244
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,399
of uh neat things

245
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,320
it's got this adjustment handle here

246
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,920
with all these notches and basically you

247
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:05,440
just as you pull this forward it slides

248
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:07,839
the um carriages and starts to add pitch

249
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,600
to the discs so that you can get more

250
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,440
aggressive with the ground

251
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,040
and actually the back carriage works in

252
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,240
the same fashion

253
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,640
um

254
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,399
basically you can just change uh

255
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,000
whichever holes you want to be hooked

256
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,160
into and that'll change the pitch of the

257
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,880
rear carriage for the people who had

258
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,480
watched the video where i lost this uh

259
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,240
this piece here

260
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,920
that piece is pretty important to me and

261
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,680
i'm glad i found it the reason is is

262
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,040
because that piece locks in the entire

263
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,959
back carriage

264
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,720
so without that piece and i probably

265
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,560
would have a tough time replacing it or

266
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,279
finding another one

267
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:44,560
it would make the entire back carriage

268
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:47,200
unusable so i'm pretty excited that i

269
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,519
happen to come across and find it

270
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,480
this was actually sitting directly next

271
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:54,720
to it out in the weeds and i didn't go

272
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,480
and uncover this for another year after

273
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,640
i got the disc and i called my neighbor

274
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,399
back up and

275
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,560
said boy uh there's something else out

276
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,720
there i'm interested in

277
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,640
and he said i tell you what

278
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,000
clean everything out of there

279
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,440
because there's a whole bunch of crap

280
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,880
laying in there he said clean everything

281
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,560
out of there and lay it out in the yard

282
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,240
so i can take a look at what else is in

283
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,079
there and it's yours so

284
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,760
i took this back to the

285
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,839
to the garage and completely tore it

286
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,440
apart and repainted and

287
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,200
and i i can't remember the name of the

288
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,040
company it's like peterman's or peter

289
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,800
smith or some some company i think in

290
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,519
wisconsin made these

291
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,560
i want to say this thing is probably

292
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,959
was made sometime in the 80s versus the

293
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,800
disc i think the disc was made

294
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,440
uh

295
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:42,480
somewhere in the 40s if i was to guess

296
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,920
then uh i've seen my uh

297
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,680
my planter

298
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,680
still haven't repaired the front of it

299
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,839
you gotta gotta do that still if you

300
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,880
watch that episode where i

301
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,800
had a little

302
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,399
problem with that and

303
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,360
smash that up a bit

304
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,760
uh this here is a uh a ferguson double

305
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,560
bottom plow uh this one i think was the

306
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,240
first implement that we bought um

307
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,720
bought it from a guy uh

308
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,320
south of the twin cities um

309
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,920
he wanted a reasonable

310
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,839
reasonable price compared to other

311
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,240
people i had been kind of checking out

312
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,160
on craigslist and

313
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,480
so on a trip uh

314
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,959
down to visit some relatives sarah and i

315
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,480
stopped in and bought this plow and

316
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:26,320
and uh

317
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,720
boy amazing after after uh trying that

318
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,399
that first stupid haro the first year

319
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,320
that didn't do anything

320
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,000
i'll never forget the look on sarah's

321
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,160
face the first time i went by on the

322
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,839
tractor with this plow

323
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,880
and uh

324
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:43,200
it it absolutely just folds the ground

325
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:47,760
right over no problem

326
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:49,120
amazing this is a dearborn 1906 uh

327
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,800
this here

328
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,360
uh it doesn't have a chain on it

329
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,040
typically i'm just storing that on it

330
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,480
this is a

331
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,839
back scoop

332
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:02,480
um it's a only one direction so you hook

333
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,880
it to the tractor and you have to drive

334
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,040
into whatever you're gonna scoop up

335
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,120
and then uh you can reach this handle

336
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:12,720
here from the seat and you pull the

337
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,399
handle and the bucket dumps itself so

338
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:18,000
it's pretty slick

339
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:20,160
that was a a steal of a deal um

340
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,560
found this for sale about a half hour

341
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,000
from the house and they wanted 20

342
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,760
and i told sarah i said i don't even

343
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,760
care if we use it or don't use it

344
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,680
there's more than 20 worth of steel i'll

345
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,880
cut it up and do something with it if if

346
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,720
we don't do

347
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,399
if we don't use it this we're not going

348
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,079
to talk about this was a failed

349
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,839
experiment

350
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,839
so just get that out of your head

351
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,440
this i bought for uh i think 75 bucks

352
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,839
and they originally had a bale spear

353
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,839
sticking out the rear end of it but when

354
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,079
i saw it for sale i wasn't thinking bale

355
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,399
spear i was thinking other things so i

356
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:57,760
ended up making this hilling machine

357
00:12:54,399 --> 00:13:00,880
and i uh welded these brackets on here

358
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,160
and uh bought these discs online

359
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,920
and

360
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,160
this thing's a pretty cool machine you

361
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,839
can you can set the pitch and you can

362
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,320
you can hill mound anything you want to

363
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,760
plant it really helps out with our weed

364
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,000
control that way we're not using

365
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,560
chemicals or nothing like that and i've

366
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,240
used it in quite a few videos i'm sure

367
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,279
sure you've seen it uh

368
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,800
seen it featured in a few uh this here

369
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:26,079
this is kind of sitting a little bit

370
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,079
goofy but this is uh

371
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,600
get her tipped up here

372
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,720
this here is a back blade

373
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,240
that

374
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,160
can be used for moving dirt and

375
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,000
everything like that but mainly i use it

376
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,040
for moving snow

377
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,800
so uh

378
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,880
just hooks up to the tractor on the

379
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,959
front end over here with the

380
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:48,480
with the three point

381
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:49,839
and uh you can push or you can drag this

382
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,360
particular

383
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,800
back blade you can spin it 360 degrees

384
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,680
depending on which direction you want to

385
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,600
move it and i also made a video where i

386
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,800
showed i made a custom

387
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,639
pipe

388
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,880
for the bottom of the blade what that

389
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,880
helps out with is if you have a gravel

390
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,279
driveway in the winter time when you're

391
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,839
piling snow you're not pushing gravel

392
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:14,639
around so that pipe kind of just floats

393
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:17,680
on top of the gravel makes it so that uh

394
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,920
all you're pushing around is snow

395
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:23,279
this here

396
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:25,680
this here is another 196 deerborn uh i

397
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:28,320
bought this one this uh back bucket

398
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,720
before i bought the other one that i

399
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,600
showed you for 20 bucks i want to say i

400
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,240
paid 100 and something for this one um

401
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:39,360
maybe 150 or something

402
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:42,079
but because this one was not in as good

403
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,680
a condition as the one that i picked up

404
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,519
for 20 dollars

405
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,279
i ended up doing a little bit of an

406
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,959
experiment on this you'll notice this

407
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,399
one might look just slightly different

408
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,639
than the uh

409
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,800
than the other one and what i did was i

410
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,720
took the other bracket

411
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,519
that was supposed to come here out the

412
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,760
front

413
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:02,000
that would hook to the tractor and i cut

414
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,920
these ears off the back and i welded

415
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,199
them off of the back of it

416
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,199
and then i made this uh

417
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,519
as i made that top piece so that it

418
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,920
hooks on with the uh

419
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,480
with the top link across the back and

420
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,880
then i made my custom sized

421
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,880
top link that i don't think they sell or

422
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,639
make anywhere else and

423
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,399
and uh that thing works pretty good it

424
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,399
looks a little ridiculous on the back of

425
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,560
the tractor but believe it or not that

426
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,320
thing really really works good so if

427
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,480
there's something that i want to

428
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,720
back up into and scoop

429
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,680
this is the one that can get it done and

430
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,440
uh

431
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,440
and so far it hasn't failed me at all

432
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,839
i've had it for a couple of years

433
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,320
well anyways that's the tour down

434
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:47,279
implement row

435
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,839
and all the cool farming stuff that

436
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,519
goes along with the tractor

437
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,519
boy i don't know if we'd be doing as

438
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,240
much as we're doing without that tractor

439
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,199
that thing sure has saved us

440
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,680
and

441
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:01,600
sure has proven

442
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,040
proven to be a good asset to what we're

443
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,720
doing here

444
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,800
anytime we need to run around and pick

445
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,600
something up

446
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,279
just hop on the tractor and

447
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,519
and go do it

448
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:15,759
if this is the first video on the series

449
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,440

450
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,600
