1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,440
peas beans and clover are among the 18

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,279
000 species in the pea family

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,840
most species in this family including

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:11,440
these three are known as nitrogen fixers

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,200
they increase the level of nitrogen in

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,719
the soil which plants need to produce

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,759
proteins so they can grow

8
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,160
and chlorophyll so they can

9
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,000
photosynthesize one way to use this in

10
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,680
the garden is to interplant nitrogen

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,720
fixers with other plants that need a lot

12
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,080
of nitrogen

13
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,160
or you could plant a nitrogen-fixing

14
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,840
cover crop like clover for fertile soil

15
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,760
next year

16
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,679
okay this can be useful but doesn't

17
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,960
nitrogen fertilizer do the same thing

18
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,040
but more conveniently

19
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,079
why bother with this nitrogen fixation

20
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,600
thing

21
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,840
understanding this requires us to

22
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,520
understand how nitrogen fixation works

23
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,360
which in turn requires us to understand

24
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,800
the broader nitrogen cycle

25
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,800
so let's start with the big picture

26
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,840
nitrogen makes up 78 of the earth's

27
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,600
atmosphere by volume

28
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,520
but most of this nitrogen takes the form

29
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,079
of two nitrogen atoms strongly bonded

30
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,079
together

31
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,120
which isn't very reactive and is useless

32
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,120
to plants

33
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,800
for it to become plant available we need

34
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,400
the help of bacteria

35
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,159
various species of bacteria eat

36
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,880
atmospheric nitrogen and poop out

37
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,240
ammonium

38
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,000
this gets eaten by other kinds of

39
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,600
bacteria which poop out nitrite

40
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,520
which gets eaten by yet another kind of

41
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,880
bacteria which poops out nitrate

42
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,200
all of these forms of nitrogen are

43
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,040
available for plants especially nitrate

44
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,560
which is the easiest for plants to use

45
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,479
plants can take this up directly if it

46
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,479
is near their roots but they most often

47
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,159
rely on strands of fungi that attach to

48
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,360
their roots and bring nutrients to them

49
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,680
in exchange for the sugars and

50
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,520
carbohydrates the plant roots exude

51
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,200
dead plant material is also rich in

52
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,360
nitrogen and gets brought down with the

53
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,119
help of worms whose poop is a delicacy

54
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,119
among nitrifying bacteria

55
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,200
some of the ways nitrogen exits the soil

56
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,759
is when the crop is harvested

57
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,439
when water carries it away or when it

58
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,119
becomes gaseous and returns to the

59
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,680
atmosphere

60
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,759
or if the soil lacks oxygen different

61
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,920
anaerobic bacteria grow which convert

62
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,520
nitrates back into atmospheric nitrogen

63
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,200
notice that these things only happen

64
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,719
with loose nitrogen in the soil

65
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,560
not with nitrogen inside organisms

66
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,479
okay so we know that the nitrogen cycle

67
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,000
depends heavily on life in the soil

68
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,000
without them the plants would be quite

69
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,759
sad but you may have noticed

70
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,080
if the fixation process is done by

71
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,040
bacteria where do nitrogen-fixing plants

72
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,280
fit into this

73
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,720
believe it or not nitrogen-fixing plants

74
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,319
don't fix nitrogen

75
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,319
rather they create habitat for the

76
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,239
bacteria that do the roots of this

77
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,160
clover plant have little nodules that

78
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,120
house huge amounts of nitrogen-fixing

79
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,959
bacteria

80
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,720
the ammonium that these bacteria create

81
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,480
slowly releases into the soil for

82
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,680
neighboring plants and microorganisms to

83
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,360
use

84
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,800
when the plant dies the bacteria

85
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,560
disperse into the soil

86
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,720
resulting in an abundance of bacterial

87
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,720
allies for future plants nitrogen needs

88
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,599
you know how earlier i said that water

89
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,519
can carry soil nitrogen away

90
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,519
this nitrogen ends up in rivers which

91
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,040
can disrupt the ecosystem by enabling

92
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,040
algae to dominate

93
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,239
but remember this only happens to lose

94
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,560
nitrogen in the soil

95
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,519
and not nitrogen embedded in organisms

96
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,920
and fertilizer

97
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,879
adds pure nitrogen without the organisms

98
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,480
so when it rains

99
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,080
huge amounts of it runoff and pollute

100
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,000
the water loose nitrogen

101
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,239
molecules are also much more prone to

102
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,640
volatilization releasing huge amounts of

103
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:13,280
nitrous oxide a potent greenhouse gas

104
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,200
into the atmosphere but that's not all

105
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,360
such quantities of pure nitrogen

106
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,319
irritate earthworms which end up dying

107
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,239
or leaving

108
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,239
it disrupts the helpful fungus on plant

109
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,720
roots and changes the soil ph

110
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,799
making it inhospitable to bacteria in

111
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,480
short it kills the soil

112
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,480
when the nitrogen all gets used up or

113
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,319
washes away the organisms aren't there

114
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,840
to help the plants get more so now you

115
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,360
have to add more fertilizer which

116
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,959
worsens the problem

117
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,200
and these organisms did much more than

118
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,560
just supply nitrogen the root fungi also

119
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,840
brought up important minerals for the

120
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,360
plants

121
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,280
and now that they're gone mineral

122
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,319
fertilizer must also be used

123
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,400
instead of working with this

124
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,360
self-sustaining web of organisms freely

125
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,120
sharing nutrients

126
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,640
we have to spend more money to add loads

127
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,480
of fertilizer to dead soil

128
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,720
poisoning the water and contributing to

129
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,319
climate change considering the inability

130
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,959
of dead soil to supply plants with

131
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,400
nutrients

132
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,000
it's no wonder that throughout the last

133
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,920
century vegetables have been steadily

134
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,599
declining in nutritional value

135
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,599
healthy food requires healthy soil

136
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,519
so if the soil around you is rich and

137
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,760
alive try to keep it that way

138
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,360
but if like most of us the soil around

139
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,120
you is dead or dying

140
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,040
nitrogen fixers can help to add a little

141
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:29,759
more life so that someday our tiny

142
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:31,840
allies under our feet will come back

143
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,840
you
