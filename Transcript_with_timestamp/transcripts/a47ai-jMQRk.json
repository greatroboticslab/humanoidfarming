  "text": "hey folks this josh starting rich farmer welcome to the farm vlog today today is going to be pretty fun we're gonna be installing more solar lights and I know what you're thinking do you really need more solar lights on the farm well yes we do so we have a little bit of a predator problem down at the chicken coop something's been digging and scratching around and trying to get in the chicken coop at night I've got some pretty heavy-duty wire on there but I want to deter those predators from coming and what deters a predator more than being discovered ok so we're going to be installing these 100 whip LED light fixtures on the outside of the chicken coop they're all solar panel self-contained very very simple design they have a hundred LED lights and we'll go into more detail about what they do and how they do but the first thing we got to do is we're gonna set them out here in the sunlight and let them charge for about five hours guys and we'll see you in just a minute we'll install these new solar lights all right so folks the first thing you need to know is this thing comes with a little pin this little pin I guess they call it the key the instruction manual which I'm not really good about reading tells you what you have to do with this pin so first thing you do is unbag it and it has a protective layer here you peel that protective layer off of that solar panel look how pretty that solar panel is then there's a little power switch right in there and you take your little pin stick it in there and you push the power button and it clicks and it's on pretty cool now what I've learned is it has two positions it's an up position that sticks out a little more and a down position down is on it needs to be on in order to receive a charge and we're gonna sit them in the bright sunlight right here right in the driveway right where it's gonna get plenty of sunlight okay and we're gonna let them charge for I don't know two three hours so things says five hours should get about four or five hours of direct sunlight but we'll see I hope this will be the solution to keep the critters away from our garden and away from our chicken coop now our chicken coop is right beside our garden down there so we can use them and you were on the garden will see this company sent me a huge huge discount code for this thing it's like 50% off so guys if you're interested in getting a solar light if you're ever thinking about getting one of these for outside your house or for an area that doesn't have electricity like your barn or something like that this is the time to get it 50 percent off of this thing and it was pretty cheap to start with so some of the specs on it it says it's 2000 lumens 4.8 watts and it's about 10 inches by 7 inches fairly small fits right on my t-shirt and covers up that keeping it Dutch shirt right there just a little shout-out for my buddy Dutch so we've got five or six of these things all over the farm we've got them on our farm gate we've got them on the house we've got them all over in places that we don't want to run wires for light and they're just handy and it's half off so the deal was with the company I said you can send me these lights but you've got to pass on some sort of savings to my subscribers so they knock 50 percent off that's all I have for you now something I've learned about being a youtuber for the past two years here is that people don't like brand placement they don't like product placement they don't like it when you show things like wd-40 they don't like that stuff like wd-40 I don't like to do a lot of product placements in my videos part of being a youtuber sometimes is doing stuff like this and passing on savings to my subscribers so I hope you appreciate it and don't think it's something stupid by the way guys this light will not serve as a substitute for the most sold rifle in America the pain it will not serve as a substitute for that just so you know the thought process here is to take this thing as high as I possibly can but I don't want the eaves to be hanging over top of the solar panel okay and I've charged these for about 30 minutes or so right now and then they're lighting up just fine so I'm pretty impressed I think I'll be very happy with these all right so we went up to the barn and we got the ladder now you might notice my ladder is a little different than your ladder might be I have towels wrapped around the end of the ladder right here and that's so I don't scratch up the paint on the house or scratch up the paint on the building just take some towels and duct tape them around there they last you about six or eight months as long as you keep it dry to last forever and that way you don't beat up your building we brought our level and we brought our light now we're going to take our light and down it up make sure it's nice and level pretty close to the center right here okay pretty simple just gonna kind of mount it up right there it's gonna drive me crazy but I'm gonna do it off-center [Music] take my level make sure I'm nice and level come down just a hair all right they're two sided tape trick worked pretty good we've got some self-tapping screws we'll go ahead and zip to self tappers in here now the kit does not come with self tapping screws it comes with wood screws or screws where you can mount it into like the siding or something like that but it's right here it's good enough for us cool so folks Mountain this thing couldn't be any simpler basically you just have two screw holes one screw hole here one screw hole here it comes with some hardware and a kit with little tiny screws I want to use some bigger heavy-duty screws because that's just the kind of person I am so we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna install this guy I don't want to install it right here I was gonna put it up high but I'm afraid that the rain water dripping off on it constantly will run down in here and cause damage so we're gonna put it right here now you're wondering are we gonna get enough sunlight right here you get the morning Sun right here it'll be just perfect so very very simple all I'm gonna do is mount it up here easily enough I'm gonna put one screw in first okay and that will hold it in place once I get that first screw in then we'll put the level on the top and make sure it's level I'll show you guys you're gonna love my rooster here in a second he is a movie star he loves the crow when the cameras on it's pretty funny we're gonna go ahead and raise this up and after I put this up I'll give you a little quick tour of the chicken coop it's kind of a mess right now but I'll show you how it's built anyhow I'll put this up here slide our level up make sure we're right on the money okay hold it in place and then we'll zip our screw in now it's mounted up nice and sturdy if it doesn't get enough sunlight right here which I don't see a problem but if it doesn't get enough sunlight it's okay I can always move it it takes two seconds to move we're going to go ahead and put the next one over here on the other side of the coop I'll show you so the next one is going to go right up there okay we're going to it right on the eaves alright so we'll back right up here with the Gator and that way we can just hop right up on the Gator right here and get the job done there we go that's simple that's simple to install guys let me walk you around the chicken coop and tell you a little bit about it case you want some ideas for your own chicken coop so we were thinking predators the whole time when we built this coop this right here is another solar panel it's got a little dust on the top of it but these little lights light up on all four corners of the coop and also they light up the outside of the coop right here too so these little solar panels little lights this is a eight by eight enclosure there's about fifteen chickens in there and basically we used heavy-duty wire so that nothing could get through it in the inside we have two bolts and it's a mess in here guys I just want to let you know but in here we have the place where the chickens can roost and we have our nesting boxes and we have our food which is supported by a chain up in the ceiling and that's poop now the design of the coop is such that I can pull this board straight up and pull my wheelbarrow which is stored under here right up underneath it and rake out the poop into the wheelbarrow and take it to the garden so here on the outside are my nesting boxes I think they're eight nesting boxes maybe more have a little hook here we unhook the hook we raise it up and inside our little laying boxes okay and then we've mounted a light right here a little push button light so if we get eggs up in the dark we've got light and here's our outside chicken run you can also see I have lots of lights around here to help deter predators from getting in the chicken coop and really I haven't had any troubles hardly at all except for the last little bit and I'm not so sure that one of the neighbors critters might be trying to get in there like a dog that's it it's a pretty fun little chicken coop there's an eight by eight outside run for the chickens will open the door and let them run through the garden run through the yard sometimes and we have the laying boxes and we have a four by eight little area for them to hang out and roost well folks thanks a whole lot for watching the vlog today I appreciate you I just want to show you some cool products show you a cool chicken coop show you what we've got going on on the farm today got small projects going on right now while we wait for our new 30 acres of grass to start sprouting over here and it's starting to sprout so he's a ham guys be sure you click the like button subscribe to the channel if you haven't already subscribed and click the little bell down there don't notify it when I post a new video share this with your friends if you know anybody want some lights like this on the outside of their house for security or somebody who'd want them on the outside of their barn or their shed let them know about it 50% off can't beat that right across here I'll have a little scrolling code for you and we'll come back right after dark and show you how good the lights are alright thanks a lot guys and we'll see you next time on Stoney Ridge farm [Music] Piron sweet add some ways those Denise Tony Reed alright guys so we're gonna test out the light I promised you a good test and here we are the lights on the chicken coop right here and we just block out a little light right here and though thing is really really bright 2000 lumens 100 LED lights very very impressive very impressive thanks a lot guys we'll see you next time no nuts please thank you guys know maybe yeah I almost fell down I really like shiny stuff",
