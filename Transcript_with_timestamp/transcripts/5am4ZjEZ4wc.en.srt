that we have that are linked below so

17
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,800
that i can explain to you why we use

18
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:55,440
them and then how

19
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,360
to use them properly and then answer any

20
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,079
of the questions that you guys have

21
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,800
so before we get started i'm going to

22
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,479
play a pre-recorded uh snippet and this

23
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,680
snippet is going to show you how we use

24
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,600
bleed it's going to answer a lot of

25
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,840
questions up front it's also going to

26
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,360
probably spark some questions for you

27
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,799
and so my goal for you is that we get

28
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,479
all of your questions answered in the

29
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,080
short time that we have here today i

30
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,840
really respect your time and especially

31
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,000
that you showed up on a saturday morning

32
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,080
so i'm honored i'm i'm delighted to get

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,360
to spend this time with you and so uh we

34
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,360
will jump over and we will watch that

35
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,880
pre-recorded clip now and then i will

36
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,400
jump back in and we will answer your

37
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,159
questions and we'll rock and roll

38
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,400
through this whole thing so uh here we

39
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,400
go

40
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,479
don't do it very often but when you do

41
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,840
you want to make sure you have all the

42
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,759
personal protective equipment that you

43
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,400
need and you have a proper system in

44
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,320
place

45
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,320
and that once it's clean we're going to

46
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,079
maintain it with just regular everyday

47
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,159
cleaning chemicals and we don't need

48
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,240
really strong cleaning chemicals most of

49
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,840
the time but if you do have a shower

50
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,520
like the one we're going to clean today

51
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,399
we do need bleach and here is the

52
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,360
process

53
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,200
the first thing we're going to do is

54
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,960
start with personal protective equipment

55
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,960
i've got a bib apron on that covers all

56
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,479
of my clothing to protect it from any

57
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,119
spray we're going to be using a spray

58
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:08,080
bottle from any spray getting on my

59
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,200
clothing and then also my shoes so as

60
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,640
part of our personal protective

61
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,560
equipment we are going to wear shoe

62
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,560
covers now we never wear shoe covers in

63
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,239
the shower except

64
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,640
when we're using bleach and that way it

65
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,160
keeps it from getting on our shoes we're

66
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,760
also going to wear a pair of gloves the

67
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,920
gloves are going to keep any spray from

68
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,640
getting on our hands and we are going to

69
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,440
wear a face mask to protect us from

70
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,680
breathing in any fumes now quick tip

71
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,040
once you are ready to spray you're going

72
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,800
to hold your breath while you're

73
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,280
spraying when you have to take a breath

74
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,879
dip out of the shower take room

75
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,959
temperature breathing because it's an

76
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,200
enclosed space and if you breathe in the

77
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,120
fumes it will make your eyes red and it

78
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,640
will be hard on your breathing okay so

79
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,160
we are still gonna wear a face mask but

80
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,599
we're gonna breathe outside the shower

81
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,840
when we spray we're going to hold our

82
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,840
breath inside the shower okay all right

83
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,680
next thing is i have personal protective

84
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,680
glasses that i'm going to wear this will

85
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,360
keep any spray from getting inside my

86
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,840
eyes all right so now that we are

87
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,599
personally protected for climbing inside

88
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,800
our shower before we do we're going to

89
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,560
remove the bath mat if in the event we

90
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,640
end up spraying anything on the floor

91
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,560
and then we step out onto the bath mat

92
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,640
it's going to ruin that bath mat so we

93
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,040
want to make sure we remove the bath mat

94
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,360
before we climb inside the shower now

95
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,840
once the bath mat is removed

96
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,080
i have two terry cloths and these terry

97
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,159
cloths are folded in half i'm just gonna

98
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,799
lay one down right where i'm gonna step

99
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:31,120
out so my foot will step on one of these

100
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,879
on each side as i climb outside the

101
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,200
shower okay and i will have my shoe

102
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,959
covers on but anything that touched the

103
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,480
shoe covers i don't want to transfer

104
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,560
that onto the floor and i don't want to

105
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,640
transfer it onto the customer's carpet

106
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,799
or anywhere else in their house so as i

107
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,319
step out of the shower if i have bleach

108
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,000
on my feet i'm going to step on a terry

109
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,519
cloth the shoe covers are going to come

110
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,040
off i'm going to wipe off the bottoms of

111
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,120
my shoes then we're going to be good to

112
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,080
go all right the next thing i have is a

113
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,159
great big old bath towel and you say

114
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,799
what is the bath towel for well we're

115
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:03,280
going to use ozone for this project and

116
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:06,560
this is an ozone generator right here

117
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:09,360
the ozone has three oxygen atoms that

118
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,400
are connected to it so it's a molecule

119
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,159
of a light blue gas and ozone is also

120
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,639
known as smog and so what's going to

121
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,239
happen with this ozone generator is once

122
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,680
we spray the bathroom down we're going

123
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,320
to have a lot of fumes inside the

124
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,000
bathroom so we're going to let ozone go

125
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,479
into the air and create a pocket of

126
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,240
ozone around my bathroom and then it's

127
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,400
going to decompose all of the bleach

128
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,560
smell and then once all the fumes and

129
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,240
all the smells are gone then we're gonna

130
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,000
go back in and we're gonna clean the

131
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,600
bathroom okay so we're gonna spray it

132
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,520
first we're gonna leave for about an

133
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,680
hour and a half that's where this bath

134
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,639
towel comes in so what i'm going to do

135
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,720
in order to keep ozone and

136
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,479
bleach fumes from circulating throughout

137
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,000
the house we're going to turn off the

138
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,000
air conditioning and we're going to turn

139
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,600
off the heat and we're going to turn off

140
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,600
the ventilation so we're just going to

141
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,840
create a packet of

142
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,680
ozone and bleach inside the bathroom all

143
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,240
right here's where the bath mat comes in

144
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:05,919
i don't want any person

145
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,600
plant or pet inside my ozone chamber so

146
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,880
i'm going to take my bath towel and i'm

147
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,440
going to open it up and i'm going to

148
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,919
roll it sideways and i'm going to plant

149
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,000
it below the bottom of the door and that

150
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,320
way when i close the bathroom doors and

151
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,080
it's on the bottom of the door no ozone

152
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,240
can escape and i'm going to turn the

153
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,120
ozone machine on this is perfect for a

154
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,600
master bath it has a timer on it and i'm

155
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,320
going to set the timer for 30 minutes so

156
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,840
30 minutes of ozone then once the ozone

157
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,960
dies down i'm going to let it set for

158
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,680
about an hour and that way all the ozone

159
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,680
can disintegrate out of the air okay now

160
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,440
for the bleach part we're going to climb

161
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,800
inside the shower we're going to spray

162
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,039
the bleach and this is just an empty

163
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,039
bottle i've just got regular straight

164
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,960
bleach the regular straight bleach goes

165
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,039
inside the bottle we're not diluting it

166
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,400
we're going to use it full strength okay

167
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,720
the full strength is what's gonna make

168
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,880
your eyes turn red if for any reason you

169
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,800
don't wear the glasses and you're inside

170
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,639
reading the fumes okay so this is the

171
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,120
reason that we're gonna do such personal

172
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,120
protective equipment and then also our

173
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,280
spray all right so once we have the

174
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,600
spray we're gonna spray the shower from

175
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,520
top to bottom and we're gonna let it

176
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,960
just set we're not gonna agitate it

177
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,360
we're not gonna scrub it we're not gonna

178
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,880
anything we're just going to spray the

179
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,720
entire shower down okay there's a catch

180
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,720
the only part of the shower that we're

181
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,039
not going to spray is all of the

182
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,919
hardware that's the faucet that's the

183
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:30,080
faucet head and it's the rim around the

184
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:34,080
glass because we don't want our bleach

185
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:36,720
to eat all that up okay so no hardware

186
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,720
and no chrome or no bronze or anything

187
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,080
gets sprayed with the bleach we're going

188
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,520
to come in after we're done and we're

189
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,440
going to use a steamer for that now in

190
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,080
chemical safety we know that we can't

191
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,520
mix anything at all with bleach so we're

192
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,199
not going to come in with another

193
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,479
cleaner after we're done we're going to

194
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,080
come in we're going to hose the whole

195
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,080
shower down and we're going to be done

196
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,280
with all the bleach once we're done with

197
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,759
the bleach we're going to come in with a

198
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,840
steamer this is just water okay tap

199
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,240
water we're going to use on the shower

200
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,680
itself now in order to clean the glass

201
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,520
because we have not sprayed the glass

202
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,759
with bleach what we're going to do is

203
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,680
just use a steamer pad and we're going

204
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,080
to use steam and we're going to clean

205
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,960
the walls with the steamer pad then

206
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,440
we're going to clean the grout with the

207
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,840
steamer and you'll notice on the steamer

208
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,919
there's a little tiny head it's very

209
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,280
skinny that will fit with the grout and

210
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,240
so with the grout we're just going to go

211
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,000
up and down very lightly very easily

212
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,440
with the steam and then we're going to

213
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,639
go ahead and steam the rest of the walls

214
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,319
down we're going to squeegee the wall

215
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,000
down we're going to scrape all the water

216
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,599
towards the center of the floor and

217
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,400
we're going to be done with our shower

218
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:42,080
so instead of it taking us hours to do

219
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,759
we're going to do this setup which is

220
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,280
going to take a couple of minutes then

221
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,440
we're going to let the chemicals and the

222
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,120
bleach do all its work

223
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,840
then we're going to go clean the rest of

224
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,400
the house when we come back everything

225
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,240
will be nice and tidy but

226
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,319
we'll wash everything down and then

227
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,000
we'll just do the steamer quick quick

228
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,840
steam up job and then we're going to be

229
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,520
done with the project and then we can go

230
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,440
ahead and clean the regular bathroom

231
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,440
it's just a regular bathroom so we still

232
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,520
have the bathroom to do but here's the

233
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,120
secret when you go to a customer's house

234
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,599
if you're a professional house cleaner

235
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,919
you're going to do this process at the

236
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,680
very first of the job that way you can

237
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,520
be cleaning the rest of the house then

238
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,840
when you come back the bleach and the

239
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,960
ozone will have already done its job and

240
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,400
then you can go ahead and clean the

241
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,000
bathroom just as you would normally

242
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,440
clean a bathroom and the whole bathroom

243
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,440
is not a deep clean project

244
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,800
all right so i hope that set the stage

245
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,240
and we did get some excellent questions

246
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,159
that came in so thank you so much for

247
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,919
your participation this one is from

248
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,080
laura and she said so straight bleach

249
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:44,480
will just clean my soap scum

250
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,000
let's be very clear about what bleach is

251
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,000
bleach and this is the one that i'm

252
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,080
referring to today and there are

253
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,040
different brands of bleach and stuff on

254
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,880
the market but this is the one that

255
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,720
we're going to reference today

256
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,200
bleach is not a cleaner bleach is a

257
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,120
disinfectant and so we're going to treat

258
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,640
the bathroom after we do the bleach so

259
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,560
the bleach is going to be like the first

260
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,160
step and the reason we're going to do

261
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,360
this is because if you are a house

262
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,200
cleaner and i don't know are you guys

263
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,640
house cleaners are you guys homeowners

264
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,560
if you're a professional house cleaner

265
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,640
type house cleaner in the comments if

266
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,120
you are an airbnb host and you sanitize

267
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,800
between guests type airbnb host in the

268
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,399
comments and if you are a homeowner type

269
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,800
the word homeowner and then i will kind

270
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,720
of know who's here and then we can guide

271
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,080
our comments toward that but if you are

272
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,360
a professional house cleaner and you

273
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,880
show up at a customer's house and you're

274
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,560
doing a walk through

275
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,000
when you get to the customer's house and

276
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,920
you walk in the bathroom and you see

277
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,920
like a really icky bathtub and it has

278
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,680
the soap scum and it has the build up or

279
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,320
maybe the tub has backed up and there's

280
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,839
like all this gunk in the tub the first

281
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,080
question we want to ask is how did it

282
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,600
get that way and so once we determine

283
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,080
how did it get that way it will help us

284
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,080
determine what the gunk actually is so

285
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,839
if it's soap scum that that we're

286
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,519
probably going to use a degreaser for

287
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,279
right because the soap scum is what

288
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,080
comes from body proteins and it comes

289
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,839
off our bodies it is um the gunk the

290
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,760
dirt the the germs that we have that

291
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,360
we've washed down the drain it's other

292
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,800
soap products

293
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,560
that we've used either shampoo or

294
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,320
conditioner or things like that that

295
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,160
have mixed with water and they either

296
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,680
set on the side of the walls or they

297
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,880
splashed on the sides of the walls and

298
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,120
then they got stuck because they weren't

299
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,399
rinsed off properly so once we know what

300
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,880
we're looking at that's going to help us

301
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,480
determine how exactly we clean it now if

302
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,720
you go into a customer's home

303
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,320
and the tub is backed up and i say the

304
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,399
tub is backed up you usually see a ring

305
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,079
around the tub and what that suggests is

306
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,279
that there's hair clogged in the drain

307
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,600
and so as the water was trying to go

308
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,680
down the drain it did not drain properly

309
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,680
therefore it backed up and it created

310
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,600
that soap scum where there's body

311
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,600
proteins and dirt and grime and shampoo

312
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,079
and stuff like that that has settled in

313
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,000
the tub and then it slowly drained and

314
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,240
as it drained it didn't have a chance to

315
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,760
rinse off the sides of the tub or the

316
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,000
shower therefore it's stuck in the

317
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,880
bottom so if that's what we have we may

318
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,440
have to use a de-clogger which also has

319
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,959
a really potent smell so if you are in a

320
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,880
shower for example and the one that we

321
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:59,600
just looked at had some of that serratia

322
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,600
marcescens which we call pink slime and

323
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,000
that is very toxic to our bodies and we

324
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,680
don't want that in our showers at all

325
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,440
and that's where the bleach comes in so

326
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,279
once you're aware of what it is you

327
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,800
might just determine that you are going

328
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:15,360
to use bleach now we do not use bleach

329
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,079
very often i want to make very very

330
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,920
clear that bleach is a specialty product

331
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,800
it's used for special cleaning

332
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,399
situations okay and i have

333
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,200
links below so that you can see what i'm

334
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,120
talking about but i really want us to be

335
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,880
aware this is a specialty product and

336
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,880
should be treated with the utmost

337
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,240
respect and we can't we can't get mad at

338
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,800
bleach for what it does because it's

339
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,880
it's very strong and it's very

340
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,399
designed for a very specific use

341
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,920
i want to stop for a second and say that

342
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,839
for every chemical that exists on the

343
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,000
market there's what's called a safety

344
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,320
data sheet and that is designed by the

345
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,200
globally harmonized system and it's now

346
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,720
man mandated it's it's worldwide that

347
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,240
every chemical must

348
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,560
be provided by the manufacturer a sheet

349
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,000
there are 16 sections on the sheet and

350
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,760
the very first section will tell you the

351
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,959
manufacturer and their phone number and

352
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,639
if you have any questions about the

353
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,880
product whatsoever you can call the

354
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,639
manufacturer and there's like a chemical

355
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,160
safety person that will answer the phone

356
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,920
and they will answer your questions so

357
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,279
that's always really good to know the

358
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,279
second thing that's really important to

359
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,279
know is if there are any hazards

360
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,720
associated with the product it will also

361
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,800
tell you that as well and that's in

362
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,800
section number two of the sixteen

363
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,120
sections if you go to section number

364
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,920
nine it will tell you where on the ph

365
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,519
scale the product lies now seven is

366
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,600
right in the middle and that's neutral

367
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,760
zero is all the way over to the side and

368
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,839
those are going to be your acids all the

369
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,240
way over to your side on 14 that's going

370
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:41,440
to be your alkalines so we have acids

371
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:44,639
neutral and then alkalines and so every

372
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,399
number you go from seven in any

373
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,399
direction it's going to be ten times

374
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,399
stronger than the number before so

375
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,560
number eight is ten times stronger than

376
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,560
number seven number nine is ten times

377
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,040
stronger than number eight right all the

378
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,839
way down bleach this particular bottle

379
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,639
of bleach is 12.5

380
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,560
on the ph scale so that is really really

381
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,560
really strong we're not talking about

382
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,560
just a couple numbers away from seven

383
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,800
we're talking about a couple of thousand

384
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,959
numbers away from seven right it's very

385
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,120
strong on the logarithmic scale all

386
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,720
right so that said how do we use bleach

387
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,120
when do we use it

388
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,399
why do we use it i know it gets really

389
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,560
kind of like

390
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,800
should we use it at all it does have a

391
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,160
purpose and so if you know how to use it

392
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,160
you're not going to be scared when you

393
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,360
do use it so a couple things that i want

394
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,440
to talk about while we're still talking

395
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,480
about bleach is bleach first and

396
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,800
foremost i don't know if you ever

397
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,360
noticed this or not but it comes in a

398
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,519
jar that you cannot see through and this

399
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,160
is to protect it from sunlight so that

400
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:45,040
it stays stable so even if you pour it

401
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,360
into another container it must also be

402
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,279
a non-see-through container just like

403
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,440
hydrogen peroxide for example comes in

404
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,120
that brown container that's a plastic

405
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,040
container that you cannot see through

406
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,519
it's to prevent sunlight from coming

407
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,680
through so all bleach containers will

408
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,760
come in this really durable thick

409
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,560
plastic it's not a regular plastic

410
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:07,040
container this is a heavy-duty durable

411
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,959
plastic that it won't eat through and

412
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,800
that also the sun can't see through did

413
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,120
you know that that's a fun fact right

414
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,880
how cool is that okay so the next thing

415
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,959
that's really interesting about bleach

416
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,399
is most of the time depending on the

417
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:22,079
size of the jug and really really every

418
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,959
bleach container that i've that i've

419
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:27,760
purchased has this wide lid that is

420
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:29,519
typical of gallon jugs so if you are

421
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,959
using this for regular cleaning and we

422
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,279
saw a lot of people using this for

423
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,720
regular cleaning during the pandemic and

424
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,959
i don't mean to clean things but to

425
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,560
sanitize and disinfect after they've

426
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,720
cleaned things so it's a two-step

427
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,639
process but what they did then is they

428
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:46,000
were asking lots of questions on how do

429
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:47,760
i measure the bleach right how do i how

430
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,480
do i know that i got the right amount of

431
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:53,279
bleach so that's a really great question

432
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:56,839
so in our um in the links here let me

433
00:14:53,279 --> 00:15:00,800
see if i can find this there is a

434
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:00,800
um there's uh

435
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,279
and let me remove this here

436
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,279
uh

437
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,959
where's that question

438
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:11,600
i've got homeowners here i've got house

439
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:13,839
cleaners hey nick hey anna this is so

440
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,279
exciting if you guys will type in q

441
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,199
before your question then i will know if

442
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,320
you're just saying hi to me and those of

443
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,279
you that have questions because i do

444
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,880
want to come back and i want to answer

445
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,800
all your questions we've got house

446
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:26,000
cleaners in the room we've got airbnb

447
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:28,240
hosts we have lots of homeowners this is

448
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,839
so awesome so i'm super excited all

449
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,079
right so this is a pump spray that we

450
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,759
use in professional house cleaning and

451
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:36,000
the cool part about this is is this

452
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:38,800
little adapter right here holds one

453
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,600
ounce of clorox or one ounce of cleaning

454
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,120
solution so if we buy any of our

455
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,120
concentrates or we buy a gallon

456
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,680
container which is what we have here you

457
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,560
can just remove this lid and you can put

458
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:53,279
this in here and one pump will be one

459
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,560
ounce and so if we have a 32 ounce

460
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,399
container let's say that we were going

461
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,519
to use this this is the one that we used

462
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:03,199
in the demo this is 32 ounces so three

463
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:05,279
pumps would be one part to 10

464
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:07,120
ounces of water and so that's how we

465
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,560
would do it for a 32 ounce container we

466
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,360
would do three pumps and that's for

467
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,040
regular sanitizing disinfecting spray so

468
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,560
if you were going to use it to disinfect

469
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,639
like we did during the pandemic you

470
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,759
would use three pumps to a 32 ounce

471
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,759
container and so this is very helpful

472
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,240
for measuring but the thing that i like

473
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,720
best about this is it's scalable and so

474
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,880
if we have employees for example that we

475
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,720
have sent out to do their own measuring

476
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,560
of cleaning chemicals we don't want them

477
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,839
to use it straight if they're going to

478
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:38,240
use it as a disinfecting spray for flat

479
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,920
surfaces for example right so we want to

480
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,600
make sure that it's measured properly so

481
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,680
that's the reason why i included this

482
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,720
here also these are kind of hard to find

483
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,440
and so

484
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,120
i i'm really keen on having these and so

485
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,880
i just wanted to recommend these to you

486
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,040
if you have a jug and you'll notice that

487
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:56,079
this one where the lid goes it's a

488
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,920
little bit longer than the jug itself

489
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,560
because this is plastic you can just cut

490
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,959
that off so that it matches the size of

491
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,600
your jug and still reaches to the bottom

492
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,679
so there's a helpful tip right there all

493
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:10,079
right so the next thing about the bleach

494
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,919
when we're using the bleach um if we're

495
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,439
using it to clean out a shower like the

496
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,520
one that i mentioned when you get to a

497
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,720
customer's house the very first thing

498
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,919
that we're going to do like let's say

499
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,240
that this is the first time that you've

500
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:22,799
cleaned the house and if you don't use

501
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:25,600
bleach and you don't have a system

502
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:27,839
you're probably going to end up spending

503
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,880
a lot of time and energy

504
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,480
going through the house making sure that

505
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,160
you are cleaning the house doing a

506
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,360
regular maintenance or deep clean and

507
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,280
then you're going to end up spending a

508
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,280
lot of time maybe an hour or so trying

509
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,320
to clean those icky showers so the very

510
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,760
first thing that you want to do is you

511
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,679
want to budget your time properly

512
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,559
because time is money right so the first

513
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,160
thing we're going to do is we're going

514
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,919
to treat with bleach then we're going to

515
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,679
get out of the room and then we're going

516
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,919
to go clean the rest of the house while

517
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,039
the bleach is doing its job and so the

518
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,880
first thing that we're going to do is we

519
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,640
are going to use straight bleach if you

520
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,080
have a really icky shower now what we're

521
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,280
looking for in the shower is we're

522
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,600
looking for mold and we're looking for

523
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,039
that pink slime and so if there's

524
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,640
anything that's stuck on the bottom

525
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,000
that's just like really nasty and you're

526
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,440
like oh no it's going to take me an hour

527
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,360
to clean the shower and you'll start

528
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,200
recognizing after a minute like it's one

529
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,160
of those showers okay the first thing

530
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,400
that we're going to do is we're going to

531
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,640
go to the sink in the bathroom

532
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:22,000
to the sink in the bathroom and over the

533
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,320
sink we're going to pour the

534
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,799
clorox or pour the bleach into a spray

535
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,799
bottle that we can use and i do have and

536
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:31,280
i do recommend a funnel

537
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,960
the funnel the purpose of the funnel

538
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,880
is that we will

539
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,760
not spill it on the customers

540
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,919
countertops or um i don't know

541
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,440
on ourselves or any of those things this

542
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,200
is a regular funnel and i just cut the

543
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,280
end off so that it flows quicker through

544
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,919
the jar instead of it comes down to a

545
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,080
little tiny point and it then takes

546
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,840
forever to to put it inside but when

547
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,120
we're done with this you remember how i

548
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,960
said we can't

549
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,919
leave it inside the container we're not

550
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,840
even going to take it out of the

551
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,200
bathroom inside this container so what

552
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,280
we're going to do is we're going to take

553
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,679
this to the customer's house just like

554
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,520
this it's got a lock lid on it so it's

555
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,120
not going to spill in our car it's not

556
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,280
going to spill on the cleaning caddy and

557
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,440
i think this is the only product that we

558
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,440
actually carry in its original container

559
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,280
to the customer's house all the other

560
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,559
chemicals can be mixed in our inventory

561
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,480
and we just take a bottle of spray or

562
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,480
whatever so many things have happened

563
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,480
and i don't want to run the risk of the

564
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,720
lid coming off or this leaking in your

565
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,160
caddy or getting dumped over or anything

566
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,559
and i will stop for a second and say

567
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,640
these are phenomenal spray bottles and

568
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:33,360
they've got the lock lid where you just

569
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:36,000
unscrew it and it can go from spray to

570
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,679
stream depending on what you need so i

571
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,960
really like the container but for we

572
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,400
don't want to leave it inside the bottle

573
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,480
for a couple of reasons

574
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,480
if we leave it inside the bottle around

575
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,400
the edge where we have sprayed it's

576
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,960
going to crystallize and it's going to

577
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,200
crystallize on the inside where it gets

578
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,400
sucked up the hose and into the sprayer

579
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,160
just because of the nature of what

580
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,360
bleach is so then when you go to spray

581
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,600
it next time you're going to do the pump

582
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,520
thing 20 times and nothing's going to

583
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,200
come out not only that but because

584
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,600
sunlight has gotten through your bottle

585
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,080
if you leave the inside the bottle it

586
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,679
will have oxidized some and it will not

587
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,720
be effective and then you'll be using

588
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,000
your bleach and you'll be going like

589
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,520
well just use it the other day how come

590
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,960
it's not working that's why it's not

591
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,679
working and so you want to make sure

592
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,600
that when you are done spraying that you

593
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,200
pour it back inside the bottle now the

594
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,960
exception is you can wait until it does

595
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,000
its job when you come back in the

596
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,679
bathroom because we're gonna leave the

597
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,679
bathroom while it does its job you can

598
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,520
just leave it inside here for a minute

599
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,039
when you come back then you will pour it

600
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,280
in before you go to the next step of

601
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:34,320
cleaning so these are our tools for that

602
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:37,120
icky icky icky bathtub okay i'm glad we

603
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,159
got that taken care of okay now um

604
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,520
another thing that i want to mention

605
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,840
while i'm on the bottles before i move

606
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,720
on and i should mention this

607
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,280
um

608
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,760
if you're using a bottle like this

609
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,440
nobody except you knows what's inside

610
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,520
and i really want to stop for a second

611
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,679
say that responsible cleaning means that

612
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,960
you need to label all of your containers

613
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,400
and because we're going to be the only

614
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,159
one in the bathroom and we're going to

615
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,000
be the only one pouring this in here

616
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,240
it's okay if we don't label it for this

617
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,640
one job before we leave the bathroom

618
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,400
we're going to empty this out back into

619
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,000
the original container and we're only

620
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,240
using straight bleach so it's not

621
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,760
diluted with anything okay but for your

622
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,120
other bottles and this is a note for

623
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,400
your other bottles for your other

624
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:18,000
bottles we need to have a label

625
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,240
and this needs to be in your care

626
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,480
custody and control a hundred percent of

627
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,240
the time if someone else takes the lid

628
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,400
off and they dump this out and they pour

629
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,480
something else in whatever is inside the

630
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,240
bottle that you use whether you're a

631
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,080
homeowner or an airbnb host or

632
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,000
professional house cleaner whatever is

633
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,320
in your hand if you sprayed it it's

634
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,840
inside your care custody and control and

635
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,679
if you sprayed something and somebody

636
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,360
switched out the chemicals on you

637
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,039
the insurance company will not cover it

638
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,200
if there's property damage and that's

639
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:47,440
because you are in control of your

640
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,200
chemicals so i cannot stress the

641
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,640
importance enough of you gotta know

642
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,720
what's inside your bottles i love these

643
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,520
bottles because we do use lots of

644
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,360
concentrates as professionals and so as

645
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:00,320
professionals this is uh this is a

646
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,240
bathroom product that we use but i have

647
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,919
a label here and we use a lot of the

648
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,760
odoband products and otoban is

649
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,440
phenomenal where they provide the labels

650
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,120
for you on their website you just

651
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,640
download them print them and then put

652
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,039
packing tape over it and tape them on

653
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,600
your containers and you'll notice that

654
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:18,559
here if you look up closely this is the

655
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:21,600
dilution ratio so if i have a 16 ounce

656
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:22,799
container i have one of these pump

657
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,120
sprays

658
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,559
and if i'm doing a heavy duty cleaning

659
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,799
check it out this is where it gets

660
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:31,120
exciting then i would check this box

661
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:35,120
which is i have it i have it here for

662
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:37,200
for the 32. so is it 1 ounce for 16 or

663
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,360
is it 1 ounce for 32.

664
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,280
so you have a choice and so by doing

665
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,120
that this is the heavy duty version

666
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,919
because it's only this would be two

667
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,919
pumps for 32 ounce right and then one

668
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,520
for 32 would be for your maintenance

669
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,200
clean so you can use the same chemical

670
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,840
for maintenance or deep clean all right

671
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,200
that leads me to my next

672
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,240
topic when we're cleaning a bathroom

673
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,960
with bleach that's going to be

674
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:02,320
considered a deep clean or a special

675
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,640
product a special project that is not a

676
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,320
maintenance clean okay on a maintenance

677
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,159
clean we do not bring the bleach into

678
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,080
people's houses that's a special product

679
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,000
it's a special job it's a special

680
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,720
everything and you need special personal

681
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,640
protective equipment when you use it and

682
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,919
so we are not going to bring bleach with

683
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:22,960
us on a regular maintenance clean got it

684
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:24,400
okay cool all right now that said

685
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,240
for maintenance cleaning we'll talk

686
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,159
about that after i answer some of your

687
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,679
questions um and we do have some

688
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,799
questions here which i'm super excited

689
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:35,120
to answer thank you guys so much

690
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,120
um

691
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,520
smokey of stormwind says i would

692
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,200
recommend using some sort of a mask n95

693
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,200
a respirator and safety glasses if you

694
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,720
plan to use a spray bottle for bleach

695
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,240
also clean the spray bottle with soap

696
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,720
and water to stop the pump from getting

697
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,840
blocked yes all of those apply all of

698
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,919
those apply now if for any reason you

699
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,400
decide that you don't have uh

700
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:59,039
respirators and you're not using the n95

701
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,600
you can use a regular mask this is not

702
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:03,039
gonna protect you from fumes okay what

703
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,480
we're gonna do is this if you go inside

704
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,679
a bathroom this is on a deep clean

705
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,480
you're going to go in a bathroom and you

706
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:10,000
have one shower one icky shower spraying

707
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,480
it down is going to take you about 60

708
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,440
seconds that's it 60 seconds so what

709
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,760
we're going to do is we're going to put

710
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,840
the mask on and the mask is for us the

711
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,520
mask is to remind us

712
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,120
that we are inside a shower and while we

713
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,960
have it on we are not going to breathe

714
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,200
you're going to dump yourself inside the

715
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,559
shower you're going to grab your spray

716
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,400
you're going to hold your breath and

717
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:30,400
you're going to spray the shower down

718
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,600
you're going to step out of the shower

719
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,200
you're going to turn your head and take

720
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,039
a breath but you're not going to be

721
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,200
breathing the fumes inside the sharks

722
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,559
that's a really tight tiny closed space

723
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,440
right then you're going to get out of

724
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,960
the bathroom so for 60 seconds most

725
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,559
house cleaners and the reason that i say

726
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,960
this is most house cleaners will not

727
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:48,240
carry big respirator masks with the big

728
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,279
you know we're not we're not going to be

729
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,360
spending all day in there we're going to

730
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:53,039
spend less than 60 seconds spraying the

731
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,200
walls down and then we're going to bolt

732
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:57,760
okay so it's going to be quick in quick

733
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,520
out and we're done all right um and i

734
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:02,320
love this question because we do have to

735
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,960
think about safety protective equipment

736
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,480
one of the things that uh uh and anne

737
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,159
says odoban what is your experience with

738
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,400
this cleaner it smells nice and it says

739
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,720
disinfect but being a bleach fan i'm

740
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,320
doubtful um okay so

741
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,400
it does do a phenomenal job for

742
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,919
disinfecting and i think odoban is one

743
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,880
of the few products on the market that

744
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,080
is grossly

745
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,919
mis-marketed um they're a phenomenal

746
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,320
company they've been around for 30 years

747
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,520
they are all their stuff meets all of

748
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,240
the

749
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,840
epa regulations and it is on the safer

750
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,840
choice most of their products are in the

751
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,279
the safety choice uh what is it safer

752
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,600
safer choice products that are

753
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,279
registered by the epa and the ap epa

754
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,440
when they register those products they

755
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:43,440
don't just register the regular product

756
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,279
they register every single ingredient of

757
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,760
those products and then they determine

758
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:49,840
whether or not it meets uh its

759
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,600
competitors brands that have more toxic

760
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,440
fumes and stuff like that otoban is a

761
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,320
phenomenal product today we just happen

762
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:58,240
to be talking about bleach and because

763
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,480
bleach will like bleach your clothes and

764
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,000
it stains things and you know people are

765
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,840
scared of it and it smells bad and all

766
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,520
that stuff and i'm not knocking the

767
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,840
product because there's a very good use

768
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:12,880
for it and when used properly you can be

769
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:14,320
safe all right so that said um uh denise

770
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,320
said i'll jump in here real quick denise

771
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,000
said former custodian and homemaker now

772
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,640
wear white t-shirt if you can to prevent

773
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,440
bleach stains absolute

774
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:26,000
absolutely label put it on a high shelf

775
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,240
uh yeah that's a great a great

776
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,240
suggestion and if you are a homeowner

777
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,279
and you have that ability that's awesome

778
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,799
some house cleaners that are

779
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,480
professionals are required to wear their

780
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,640
uniforms while they're cleaning and so

781
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,400
in this particular situation they may

782
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,240
not be able to wear a white t-shirt if

783
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:43,520
that's the case what we do want to do is

784
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,919
we want to wear our bib apron

785
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,440
and the bib apron

786
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,679
is

787
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,120
the one that i recommend is adjustable

788
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,559
and this allows you to put it on over

789
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,720
your head and then adjust it so that it

790
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,480
fits you perfectly and get it up tight

791
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,720
over your clothes like scooch it up near

792
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,120
your neck so that it covers you and it

793
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,760
doesn't get any of your clothes this one

794
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,080
also goes all the way down past my knees

795
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:08,559
almost like three quarters past my knees

796
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,080
down almost to the the floor um and the

797
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:12,480
thing i like about this is it is water

798
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,480
resistant so it will repel water and

799
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,640
it's it doesn't absorb so fastly into

800
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,120
your clothes if you get some bleach on

801
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,120
it it will stain but it's not going to

802
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,399
stain your clothes and so i really like

803
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,799
it for that reason these are fairly

804
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:26,480
inexpensive um but i do recommend that

805
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:29,039
you wear something to protect your

806
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,640
uniform for the very same reason i

807
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,760
recommend and this is this this goes

808
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,720
against everything that we've trained

809
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,120
before

810
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,520
but i recommend that when you are doing

811
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,600
bleach and a shower that you also wear

812
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,880
shoe covers now we wear shoe covers as

813
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,080
house cleaners when we're inside

814
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,320
someone's home

815
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,320
because we want to prevent ourselves

816
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:49,200
from tracking in dirt from outside and

817
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,960
so if we are at a customer's house and

818
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,480
we are um

819
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,240
we are wearing our shoe covers when we

820
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,000
get inside their house that's cool but

821
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,760
we usually take them off when we get

822
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
inside the shower and the reason for

823
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,240
that is when you get inside the shower

824
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,919
we don't want to slip and fall right but

825
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,600
for this particular situation we're not

826
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:08,000
going to be climbing inside the shower

827
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,960
unless we absolutely have to what we're

828
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,480
going to be doing is we're going to be

829
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,760
reaching inside the shower we're going

830
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,760
to be spraying and then we're going to

831
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:16,240
be dipping back outside the shower again

832
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,159
so this is for our feet in the event

833
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,399
that there's any overspray we don't want

834
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,559
it on our nice expensive shoes and so i

835
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:25,360
do recommend these shoe covers while

836
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:27,039
you're doing the bleach application okay

837
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,799
so for for this particular time we're

838
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,159
not going to take the shoe covers off

839
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,679
when we go inside the bathroom we're

840
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,720
going to leave them on

841
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:36,240
and i recommend the kind of shoe covers

842
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,520
again i've got links below so that you

843
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,679
guys can learn more about this you can

844
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,840
add some to your card if you want um i

845
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,720
have gone through all of the products

846
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,799
that

847
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,360
i'm sharing with you today and i found

848
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:48,799
the very best prices for these products

849
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,080
and i will i will tell you i do make a

850
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:51,760
commission if you buy them and that's

851
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,279
not why i'm here you're going to buy

852
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,200
them anyway i want you to buy the right

853
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:57,360
ones and i want you to understand the

854
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,440
products and then i want you to save

855
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,720
some money at the same time okay and if

856
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,080
you can do something else without

857
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,000
spending the money i will tell you that

858
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,600
as well but i want you to buy the right

859
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,200
stuff the first time there's nothing

860
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,039
more that makes me sad that people buy a

861
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,799
whole bunch of stuff and then it's the

862
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:13,039
wrong stuff either they bought the cheap

863
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,640
version and it fell apart or it was not

864
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:16,559
it wasn't quality and it didn't do the

865
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,080
job or

866
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:20,159
they bought something that they got

867
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,000
price gouge done right so i just want to

868
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:24,640
tell you but to have the ones with the

869
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,480
treads on the bottom that's a non-slip

870
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,799
protective

871
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,720
protection and so for all of the shoe

872
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:32,799
covers that you buy these are not the

873
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,799
cheapest on the market but these will

874
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:36,159
prevent with the non-skids these will

875
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:38,480
prevent you from slipping like on

876
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,000
hardwood floors or whatever we buy one

877
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,320
kind and we use them for all of our

878
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,080
cleaning so if you're on ceramic tile

879
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,360
floors if you're on hardwood floors if

880
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,799
you are cleaning anywhere in a

881
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,039
customer's house this is going to

882
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:51,360
prevent your shoes from tracking in

883
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,720
anything from outside and some house

884
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,720
cleaners have asked me the question so

885
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,919
i'll just answer it now should we take

886
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,600
our shoes off when we go inside a

887
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,679
customer's house and the answer is

888
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,679
absolutely not because you are on your

889
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,279
feet as a house cleaner all day and so

890
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,679
if you're cleaning from sun up till

891
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:07,039
sundown that's a lot of time

892
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,880
that you're you're putting pressure on

893
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:11,039
your back your hips your knees your

894
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,360
spine you need the support that good

895
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:16,000
shock absorbers can provide from really

896
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,320
great quality athletic shoes and so the

897
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,720
shoe that i use is a i believe it's an

898
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,399
excursion a trail excursion it's a cross

899
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,720
cross shoe between

900
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:26,000
a trail running shoe and a running shoe

901
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,679
and so it's got a lot of shock

902
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
absorbency in it it's got the high

903
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:32,159
arches it's got a really flexible toe

904
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,240
box i'm not here to sell your shoes but

905
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:36,159
you need to be wearing shoes when you're

906
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,919
cleaning house so even if it's your own

907
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:40,399
house if it's someone else's house if

908
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,320
you're cleaning for an airbnb please

909
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:45,679
wear your shoes and then just cover a

910
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:47,200
shoe cover to protect your your feet so

911
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,480
that you're not upsetting a homeowner

912
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,000
that's like i don't want to use my house

913
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,279
or whatever you need to wear shoes to

914
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,960
protect your back your spine your hips

915
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:55,919
and your knees okay so i'm glad we said

916
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,200
that yay i feel so much better already

917
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,039
all right one more piece of personal

918
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,120
protective equipment while we are

919
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,840
talking about the shoe covers

920
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,760
is i want to talk for a second about

921
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:07,600
gloves and gloves are really important i

922
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,840
always wear nitrile gloves and i like

923
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:12,799
the nitrile gloves better than the latex

924
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,399
i find that over the long haul they are

925
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:16,480
um

926
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:18,720
they they they work with more house

927
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,880
cleaners some house cleaners have latex

928
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,360
allergies the nitrile seems to just be a

929
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,279
good middle of the road

930
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,039
glove that you can wear and i like it

931
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:28,480
because they're really durable they

932
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:30,559
don't rip as easy as some of the other

933
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,919
brands that i've seen and the thing that

934
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:34,159
i like about them is if i'm running my

935
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:36,880
hands across a countertop i can feel the

936
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,480
grit with my fingers with the gloves on

937
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,240
and so i can tell like oh is this dirty

938
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,440
or is it clean even without looking at

939
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,679
it like sometimes you go to clean

940
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,440
something and you hit like a a piece of

941
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:48,080
gunk and you can't tell that there's

942
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,679
gunk this allows you to to sense that

943
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,120
while you're wearing these gloves this

944
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,600
will also protect your hands from

945
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:55,039
getting bleach on them okay and it's

946
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,799
really important because even if it's

947
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,640
just an over spray and you're using that

948
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:02,159
that motion with a

949
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:04,080
spray bottle it can leak and it can get

950
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,919
on your hands and it can eat through

951
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,919
your hands because it's a very strong

952
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:10,080
chemical right and we want to be

953
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,760
sensitive to chemicals especially if

954
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,039
we're cleaning all day all right i'm

955
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,640
going to stop for just a second answer

956
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:17,279
your questions and then we'll jump back

957
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,519
in uh marilyn says best product found

958
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:22,159
for the bathroom is clorox cleaner and

959
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:23,120
bleach spray and done okay yes that is

960
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,480
awesome

961
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,840
maryland also says if you have hard

962
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,440
water stains in the toilet and you've

963
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,120
tried everything endless chemicals

964
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,519
didn't work you can clean without

965
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,519
chemicals if you want get some gloves

966
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:35,760
and like grit

967
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,200
wet dry sandpaper and go to town so

968
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,880
we're not going to talk about cleaning

969
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,120
toilets today because we are going to

970
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,640
talk about bleach but i do want us to be

971
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,600
really really cautious and that's that's

972
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,600
an excellent tool thanks for

973
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:48,080
recommending that um i do want to

974
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:50,480
recommend that while we're using bleach

975
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,559
again to be very painfully clear that

976
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,039
this is a specialty product not to be

977
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:56,720
used by anyone unless they've had proper

978
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,880
training on your team so if you are

979
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,640
bringing house cleaners in it is your

980
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,360
job as a professional that you do

981
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,240
provide personal protective equipment

982
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,840
um

983
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,519
one of the personal protective equipment

984
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,440
that we also recommend are safety

985
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,880
glasses and these safety glasses are

986
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,399
really great because they wrap around

987
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,240
your eyes

988
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:16,080
and it will prevent you if you are

989
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,159
spraying that any

990
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,760
back spray would flip inside your eyes

991
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:20,880
so it's not going to completely cover

992
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,480
your eyes like if you were to have

993
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,080
goggles that were sealed which would be

994
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,760
awesome if you covered those two but

995
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,279
that's like the respiratory mask most

996
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,640
people are not going to go

997
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:30,000
that severe

998
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,000
your basic

999
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,360
tools that you are required by osha to

1000
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,679
have are enough that will remind a house

1001
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:40,080
cleaner that you are in an environment

1002
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:42,240
where you must be careful and it's that

1003
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,320
being on high alert and that situational

1004
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,640
awareness that protects us it's going to

1005
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,320
help you protect yourself from spilling

1006
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,000
stuff you're going to be very careful

1007
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,679
about where you stand you're going to be

1008
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,360
careful about if you lean up against a

1009
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,799
shower that you've just sprayed you're

1010
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,960
going to be careful about all of those

1011
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:58,799
things and you want to make sure that

1012
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,720
you're very careful and the personal

1013
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:03,120
protective equipment from top to bottom

1014
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,679
and that's your eyes your face mask your

1015
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,919
gloves your shoe covers your apron you

1016
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:09,599
are from head to toe you're covered and

1017
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,720
so that's just going to be an awareness

1018
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,280
to you that

1019
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:15,280
i'm i got to be careful right i'm doing

1020
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,919
this bleach project

1021
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,440
all right uh smoky of storm and says and

1022
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:22,240
if you're using bleach you want to

1023
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,079
protect your skin and your feet

1024
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,320
from bleach it can make skin start to

1025
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:28,639
peel if exposed for a long time yes

1026
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,399
that's true we want to prevent prevent

1027
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,480
all of our skin from touching it and we

1028
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:34,720
want to especially prevent our eyes

1029
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:37,440
getting it in our eyes on the safety

1030
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:39,679
data sheet going back to the precautions

1031
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,040
it is very harmful to your eyes and if

1032
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,399
you do get it in your eyes you want to

1033
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,480
stop what you're doing and you want to

1034
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:46,560
flush it with water all right so that

1035
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,119
said i want to jump over to what is the

1036
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,639
process of using bleach okay so once

1037
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,480
we've showed up and i said already this

1038
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,079
is a special project right if you are

1039
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,079
going to a customer's house for the very

1040
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:58,640
first time and you know you're going to

1041
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:00,560
do a bleach this is a special project so

1042
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,640
you need you need to bill for it you

1043
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,880
need to bring your special training your

1044
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:07,119
special equipment and your special caddy

1045
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,440
that has your bleach and then also your

1046
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:10,720
ozone generator this is an ozone

1047
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,520
generator we need to talk about this for

1048
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,960
a second it's about the size of my head

1049
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,560
and so you can see

1050
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,599
how big it is it's really not that big

1051
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,800
at all

1052
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:23,680
it comes with a three prong plug

1053
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,760
and so it fits into a regular outlet

1054
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,760
um

1055
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,480
can you see that

1056
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:33,119
and then this is the other side of it so

1057
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:36,000
it's a little plug that fits into the

1058
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:38,079
back of this right here

1059
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,599
all right and then there's a big fan on

1060
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:42,560
the back here which is going to help

1061
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:44,880
circulate the air and on the front there

1062
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,720
are different timing timings so you can

1063
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,160
set it for 20 minutes 30 minutes 60

1064
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,160
minutes 90 minutes all the way up to

1065
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,480
three hours and then it has a hold

1066
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,160
button down here so you can see the hold

1067
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,760
and you can turn it on and leave it on

1068
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,760
if you need it but for most

1069
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,200
circumstances like if you're in a master

1070
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,760
bathroom and you're going to be using

1071
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,520
bleach probably 20 or 30 minutes will

1072
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,320
work now let's talk about ozone for a

1073
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:09,200
second and what is this this is an ozone

1074
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:11,280
generating machine and the purpose of

1075
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:14,800
having an ozone generating machine is

1076
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:18,400
that it's going to remove the smell from

1077
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:20,720
the bleach that is what causes us to go

1078
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,359
like that if we breathe it okay but

1079
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:25,599
ozone also does that to you ozone also

1080
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:27,200
creates its own nasty smell so if you've

1081
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,800
ever been outside

1082
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,880
and there's like lightning

1083
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,960
and you go outside and you smell that it

1084
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,359
just kind of smells like a musty dirt

1085
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,680
smell and you're kind of like

1086
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,560
like that that's ozone

1087
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,480
so

1088
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,960
having bleach and ozone in the same

1089
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,160
place is just like double nasty right so

1090
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,320
what we're going to do is we're going to

1091
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,920
create a ozone chamber and then we're

1092
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,599
going to get out of the bathroom while

1093
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,480
it does its work now here's how ozone

1094
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:55,839
works um regular oxygen that we breathe

1095
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:58,160
is o2 and it has two molecules of oxygen

1096
00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:00,640
okay that's normal everyday oxygen that

1097
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:02,880
we breathe the ozone which are little

1098
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:06,160
short rays from uv that come from like

1099
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:08,240
the light of the sun that is o1 and so

1100
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,560
like when lightning strikes for example

1101
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:12,640
it connects to the the regular oxygen

1102
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:15,599
molecules and now instead of having o2

1103
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:18,400
you have o3 and the o3 is a really

1104
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:20,160
unstable oxygen so what happens is it

1105
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,880
kind of like fights to get back to its

1106
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:25,839
equilibrium which it dissipates one of

1107
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,520
those oxygen molecules and as a result

1108
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:30,000
of it it's kind of cool but what it does

1109
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,760
is it grabs the odors the the molecules

1110
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,920
that have odors in them and it breaks it

1111
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,599
down and decomposes it and oxidizes it

1112
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,440
then it goes back to normal so what

1113
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:39,760
we've discovered over the course of time

1114
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,839
is that by having an ozone generator we

1115
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,760
can use it for cleaning chemicals like

1116
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:45,760
bleach so this becomes a really great

1117
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,520
powerhouse and the reason this becomes a

1118
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,720
special project because when you go to a

1119
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,320
customer's house and you're bringing

1120
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,839
extra equipment you got to pay for the

1121
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,160
extra equipment you have to know how to

1122
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:56,079
use the extra equipment it's extra

1123
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:58,240
training because it's not a regular

1124
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:59,839
process that we're going to do like when

1125
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,520
we're regularly cleaning a customer's

1126
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:03,280
house right

1127
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,440
so there are rules and regulations for

1128
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,440
using an ozone generator so if you are

1129
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,200
going to clean a customer's house with

1130
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,599
bleach and you bring your ozone

1131
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,680
generator you also have to bring a

1132
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:15,200
couple other things so one of the things

1133
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,200
that you're going to bring with you is a

1134
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,839
bath towel and

1135
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,520
i have um added a couple of bath towels

1136
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:24,000
down here and it's because you need a

1137
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,280
really heavy duty durable bath towel it

1138
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,720
doesn't matter what kind it doesn't

1139
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,000
matter if it's old it doesn't matter if

1140
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,839
it's stained it doesn't it doesn't

1141
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,720
matter um but it's going to be a great

1142
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:34,320
big heavy duty durable thick plush bath

1143
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,400
towel and you're going to lay it down

1144
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,160
and you're going to roll it sideways so

1145
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,000
that it will cover the bottom of an

1146
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,839
entire door and what we're going to do

1147
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,240
is we're going to block off

1148
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:46,000
all of the air that's circulating in the

1149
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:48,079
room now you'll notice in really fancy

1150
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,599
homes especially they've got these huge

1151
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:51,040
palladium windows in their bathroom and

1152
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,320
all that's in all this beautiful light

1153
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,000
they've got these big tubs and big

1154
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,160
showers but they have really poor

1155
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
ventilation in many homes because those

1156
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,760
windows do not open

1157
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,599
and so they might have a little fan

1158
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,680
which they're required by law to have

1159
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:05,760
that meets the builder's code but the

1160
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:08,320
builders the the fan in the bathroom

1161
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,520
often doesn't have proper ventilation

1162
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,960
and then in the next room they might

1163
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,800
have a bedroom or something and if the

1164
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:15,520
windows are not open

1165
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,040
it's common to get all kinds of mold

1166
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,880
inside these really fancy expensive

1167
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,480
showers and so if you're going inside

1168
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,760
one of those bathrooms what you're going

1169
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,839
to do is you're going to close off the

1170
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,920
bathroom you'll go inside you'll spray

1171
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:27,520
the bathroom with bleach and then you'll

1172
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,760
close the bathroom off and you will turn

1173
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,800
on the the ozone generator and then

1174
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,960
you're going to leave and go clean the

1175
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,880
rest of the house while it does the

1176
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,119
bleach part and while it does the ozone

1177
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,200
part okay so what happens is in this

1178
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:42,240
ceramic that inside this machine it has

1179
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:44,720
a ceramic plate and this electrically

1180
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,560
creates that ozone it's just like

1181
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,160
lightning and it creates the ozone which

1182
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:50,800
is like a smog and it has that really

1183
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,720
awful nasty smell to it we don't want

1184
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,320
that smell circulating through the house

1185
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,760
because now you've got bleach and you

1186
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,440
have ozone that would be circulating

1187
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,280
through the house and so the rule of

1188
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,359
thumb is if you're going to use an ozone

1189
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,680
machine get everybody out of the house

1190
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:05,599
okay don't use it with people plants or

1191
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:08,480
pets inside the house because it's not

1192
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:10,400
healthy and it can be toxic to plants

1193
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,760
for example it can kill your plants as

1194
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,359
far as people and pets it's just going

1195
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,760
to make you sick it's like when you

1196
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:17,920
breathe fumes and you get that

1197
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:21,040
feeling in your lungs it's the same kind

1198
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:24,160
of thing so we don't want that to happen

1199
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:26,560
as far as um

1200
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:28,800
us breathing that uh smokey if stormwind

1201
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,720
says uh used to use ozone generators

1202
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,960
when guests would smoke in the rooms it

1203
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:35,200
gets rid of cigarette smoke smell and it

1204
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,480
works awesome that is so true and i'm so

1205
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,520
glad you brought that up thank you so

1206
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:41,839
much there are lots of airbnb hosts that

1207
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:44,319
use the ozone generators between guests

1208
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:46,720
to get rid of stinky stock smile or if

1209
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:48,640
there is uh like if they did smoke or if

1210
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,240
they smoked marijuana or something on

1211
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,560
the property there were no smoking

1212
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:54,720
policies sometimes even if they vape or

1213
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,720
if they burned incense it can be really

1214
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,640
nasty smells that you're not accustomed

1215
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,680
to i know another one is cooking with

1216
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:03,599
curry curry has a really strong smell

1217
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,760
and so if you have an airbnb and then

1218
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:07,760
you come in to clean and you find that

1219
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,599
whoa somebody loved curry while they

1220
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,079
were here and they did lots of cooking

1221
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,760
and it's that the smell has lingered

1222
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:16,240
this is a great way to get that out of

1223
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,240
the air for airbnb hosts and one of the

1224
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,240
reasons it's so popular with airbnb

1225
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:23,280
hosts i'll share this with you it is

1226
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:25,440
also really really popular with flood

1227
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,680
and fire restoration companies and for

1228
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,839
the reason that if there's been a fire

1229
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,119
in the house and the smoke alarm goes

1230
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:33,200
off even if there wasn't a fire but

1231
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:35,200
there was lots of smoke for example if

1232
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:37,760
something overheated or something you

1233
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,040
know burnt pizza or whatever it is

1234
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,640
um

1235
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,720
the smell of that can get stuck on

1236
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,800
things like oil paintings

1237
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,800
and you can't grab cleaning solution and

1238
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,359
go spray oil paintings and get the smell

1239
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,880
off you can't do that and so it the

1240
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:53,680
smell the stink and the smell will get

1241
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:56,560
embedded into like fabrics and wall

1242
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:59,040
hangings and drapes and carpets and

1243
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,640
furniture and clothing and if you have a

1244
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,560
basement for example let's say if you

1245
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:06,800
have a carpeted basement that is close

1246
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:08,960
to um the the cement floor oftentimes it

1247
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,040
can if it rains or it's moist outside it

1248
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,440
can absorb a moisture that's in the

1249
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,880
cement and it can bring that into the

1250
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,040
the basement where there's not a lot of

1251
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,599
circulation and then it will smell bad

1252
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:21,280
and you have these musty dank smells you

1253
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:23,599
can grab an ozone generator and you can

1254
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,680
turn it on and you can create an ozone

1255
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:27,440
chamber and then you can lock the door

1256
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:30,319
and leave and while you're gone it can

1257
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:32,319
do the ozone the ozone thing uh the

1258
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:35,200
ozone we want to leave it for about 20

1259
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:37,760
to 30 minutes and then the ozone breaks

1260
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:39,599
down it's got like 50 life every half

1261
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:42,240
hour so the next half hour it's going to

1262
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:43,920
be 50 percent less potent as what it was

1263
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,839
before and then the next half hour it's

1264
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,520
going to be 50 of that then the next

1265
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:50,160
half hour it's going to be 50

1266
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:51,440
of that so it breaks down over two or

1267
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,440
three hours and then it doesn't smell

1268
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,280
like anything at all so it's like coming

1269
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,760
in after a rainstorm

1270
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,280
and everything has broken down properly

1271
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,520
and then you're not smelling it so that

1272
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:04,160
it's not um it's not you know hurting

1273
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:05,760
your lungs or any of those things

1274
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:08,880
so uh one of the things that i do want

1275
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:11,839
to mention if you are using it as a as a

1276
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,440
smell as a smell replacer as a smell

1277
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:15,280
destroyer

1278
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,599
just be aware that it's not great for

1279
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,440
people plants or pets and if you are

1280
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:21,920
going to use it

1281
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:24,400
while you are at a customer's house

1282
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,480
the proper way to do it is to lock the

1283
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,160
bottom of the door if you look in any

1284
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,000
room of your house if you if you are in

1285
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:32,240
a room right now where there's a door if

1286
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,839
you look in the bottom of that door

1287
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,040
you'll probably notice there's about

1288
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:39,880
this much

1289
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:39,880
underneath the door where um

1290
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:43,200
air can get through

1291
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:45,200
that's what you want to block with the

1292
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,880
towel so that nothing comes through so

1293
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:49,839
the towel is going to be on the outside

1294
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:51,520
of the door the the ozone chamber is

1295
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:53,040
going to be inside the bathroom you're

1296
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,800
going to turn the ozone on inside the

1297
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:57,040
bathroom you're going to put it at about

1298
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,720
vanity level so that it circulates

1299
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,880
evenly through the room you're going to

1300
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,960
turn off any air conditioning and any

1301
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,800
heat if you can

1302
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,960
if you can't let's say you're in an

1303
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,359
apartment complex and

1304
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,640
it's central air and heat you're not

1305
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:11,839
going to be able to go in and like oh

1306
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,920
hey can like everyone in the building

1307
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:15,280
turn off their air well while i use the

1308
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,760
ozone you're not going to be able to do

1309
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,200
that right nor nor should you

1310
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,839
so um one of the things that i've linked

1311
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,440
to below are magnetic vent covers and

1312
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:25,119
the typical vent

1313
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,200
you'll if you look there's probably one

1314
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:29,040
in every room by builders code there has

1315
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:31,040
to be a vent in every room so there's

1316
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:33,200
probably one in a small room there are

1317
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,560
probably two or three in a large room

1318
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,800
and so one of the things that we want to

1319
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,560
do is we want to put a magnetic piece

1320
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,240
over the top of that vent just to block

1321
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,200
it and when you put them up near the

1322
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,280
vent or

1323
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,040
on a floor vent it usually smacks on and

1324
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,160
there's a lot of metal there so it holds

1325
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,920
it in place

1326
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:51,200
the ones that i've linked to are i

1327
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:53,200
believe they are uh 13 by eight or

1328
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,119
something and the average vent is five

1329
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:57,280
and a half by 12. so this is going to

1330
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:59,440
over over cover it it's going to do its

1331
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:01,200
job and then if you have a big big vent

1332
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,760
you may want to put two of them on there

1333
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,599
just to cover the central air so that if

1334
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,359
the central air is on it's just going to

1335
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:08,800
block those while you're doing the ozone

1336
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:10,640
thing and that's going to protect you

1337
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,319
it's going to protect the smells

1338
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,760
circulating through the house because

1339
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:15,599
there's nothing worse than having a

1340
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,920
really strong bleach smell and then

1341
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:19,119
really strong ozone smell while you're

1342
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,200
trying to clean somewhere else in the

1343
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:23,440
house that that too will make you sick

1344
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:25,200
so we don't want to do that

1345
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:27,839
uh let's see

1346
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:30,480
uh we have we've got so many folks here

1347
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:34,480

1350
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,079
spend some time with me today this is so

1351
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:42,800
cool and i just i really appreciate your

1352
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:44,160
comments and thank you maryland as well

1353
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,240
okay so one of the things that i want to

1354
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,359
talk about is if you are inside the

1355
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,280
shower there's one more thing i want to

1356
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:50,400
mention when we talk about towels and it

1357
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,160
is um

1358
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,520
terry cloths we're going to use terry

1359
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,520
claws and i use the white ones

1360
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:58,720
especially if i'm doing bleach for the

1361
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:01,200
the fact that uh if for any reason i

1362
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:03,440
spill something it's white this goes

1363
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:05,440
back to the the conversation about

1364
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,640
having a white t-shirt if you're using a

1365
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,079
white terry cloth it's not going to

1366
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:10,319
stain as bad

1367
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:13,119
when you step out of the shower if for

1368
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:15,599
any reason you stepped on something in

1369
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:16,640
the shower and you stepped out whatever

1370
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:18,240
you step on is going to be the

1371
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,720
customer's floor we want to make sure

1372
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:22,319
that before we do the process we remove

1373
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:24,079
the bath mat take it outside of the

1374
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:25,760
bathroom we don't want to risk getting

1375
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:28,880
any bleach whatsoever on the customer's

1376
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:30,240
bath net where the shower is when you

1377
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,480
step out of the shower you're going to

1378
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,839
step out onto your terry cloths and so

1379
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,359
now you've got your shoe covers on and

1380
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:37,680
you're stepping onto a terry cloth

1381
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:39,680
that's going to absorb anything so that

1382
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:41,599
if you step out on the customer's floor

1383
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:44,000
you're not going to get any gunk on the

1384
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:45,680
customer's floor i do recommend before

1385
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,599
you leave the bathroom that you take

1386
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:49,040
those shoe covers off and then when you

1387
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:50,640
go outside the bathroom that you get

1388
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,640
another set of shoe covers for the rest

1389
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:55,520
of the customer's house we don't want to

1390
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:57,200
risk at all under any circumstances

1391
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:59,280
having gotten bleach on the bottom of

1392
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:01,119
your shoes and then tracking it anywhere

1393
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,800
in the customer's house because you are

1394
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,720
responsible again it's in your care

1395
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,720
custody and control and if you use

1396
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,560
bleach you're 100 responsible for

1397
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:10,880
whatever happens so if you have to wipe

1398
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:13,440
up any bleach and i'm not kidding even

1399
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:15,440
wiping up

1400
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,440
even wiping up the bottle the side of

1401
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,119
the bottle if some spilled on the side

1402
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,319
of the bottle and you have to wipe it up

1403
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:22,800
you want to make sure that it is a

1404
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:24,240
hundred percent wiped up before you take

1405
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,000
this bottle and put it back inside your

1406
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,680
cleaning caddy you do not want to stain

1407
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,520
your cleaning caddy you don't want the

1408
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:31,839
bottle to leak anywhere in the

1409
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:34,480
customer's house so if you've used this

1410
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:36,000
bottle to spray bleach in a customer's

1411
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,640
house you're going to want to rinse the

1412
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,240
bottle from head to toe and then dry it

1413
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:42,480
off with a

1414
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:44,240
terry cloth and that way you're covered

1415
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,599
and then there are no surprises so as

1416
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:47,839
part of the training that we do for all

1417
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:50,160
of our employees or if you're an airbnb

1418
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:52,000
host and you work in airbnbs you want to

1419
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,119
do the same process there's nothing

1420
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,400
worse

1421
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:57,920
than having a really nice dark carpet in

1422
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:00,800
a bedroom right off the side of the

1423
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:02,800
bathroom and then you walk out

1424
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,920
with your supplies and you leak bleach

1425
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,839
on it or something and then you got to

1426
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:08,480
buy them a new whatever it is a new

1427
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:10,319
carpet a new rug a new whatever so it

1428
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,800
it's your responsibility you got to be

1429
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:14,559
super careful all right let's see do i

1430
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,319
have any questions about the products

1431
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:19,599
that we've talked so far

1432
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:21,599
denise says yes please don't mix bleach

1433
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:24,160
with fumes like ammonia it's toxic and

1434
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:26,240
deadly i think that goes without saying

1435
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:28,160
but i'm so glad that denise brought that

1436
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:30,319
up we don't mix

1437
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:34,000
anything with bleach

1438
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:35,920
ever we don't mix anything with bleach

1439
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,520
ever let me say that again we don't mix

1440
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:41,680
bleach with anything ever okay so you

1441
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:44,559
can dilute bleach and we use the word

1442
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:46,480
dilute you can dilute bleach with water

1443
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:47,920
and that's technically mixing but we're

1444
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,760
going to use the word mixing we don't

1445
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,359
mix with anything because we want to

1446
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,839
know and we want all of our employees to

1447
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:56,960
know that mixing bleach like denise said

1448
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:59,200
can be deadly and every single year

1449
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,880
there are house cleaners and homeowners

1450
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:02,960
that go to the hospital because they've

1451
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:04,720
mixed bleach with something because in

1452
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,319
the back of their mind oh it did such a

1453
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,839
great job with this and this does such a

1454
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:10,400
great job over here if i mix them it

1455
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:12,400
will be twice as good right not twice as

1456
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,079
good twice as stupid and i have to say

1457
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:17,119
that because we are not for the most

1458
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:19,119
part we are not chemists and i'm really

1459
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:20,640
really keen on this you if you are not a

1460
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:23,119
chemist and you did not go to school for

1461
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:25,119
chemistry and you are not in a lab

1462
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:27,200
situation where it's a controlled

1463
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:29,599
environment where they have eye wash

1464
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:31,359
stations and they have you know

1465
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,880
emergency

1466
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:35,119
ventilators and all this kind of stuff

1467
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:37,920
to protect you if something goes wrong

1468
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:40,160
you have no business no business

1469
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:41,760
guessing on your own like oh this is

1470
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,839
this is not like cooking where you're

1471
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:46,720
mixing a couple of ingredients together

1472
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:49,119
we're talking about really specific

1473
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:52,160
varieties of chemicals that have been

1474
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:55,839
tested in controlled environments for a

1475
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:58,000
very specific task okay and so with that

1476
00:49:55,839 --> 00:50:00,160
in mind we have to we have to respect

1477
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,559
the bleach which is very very very

1478
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,839
strong i love the clorox company for the

1479
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:05,520
the things that they've done i just want

1480
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:07,119
to stop and give them a shout out uh

1481
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:09,119
during the pandemic

1482
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:11,119
uh clorox had to kind of retool all of

1483
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:12,800
the stuff that it was doing and it

1484
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:15,760
became

1485
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:17,599
a pandemic awareness about cleaning

1486
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:19,280
sanitizing and disinfecting and the

1487
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:21,200
clorox company went to task and they

1488
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:23,839
started producing

1489
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:26,880
clorox and bleach in 55 gallon drums

1490
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:29,520
because 155 gallon drum would clean 14

1491
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:31,200
000 hospital rooms and the hospitals

1492
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,880
were overwhelmed with people that were

1493
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:35,200
rushing to the hospital because of the

1494
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:38,240
of the covet virus and so because of

1495
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:40,400
that their attention was how do we serve

1496
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:42,240
and so in a place where it was tough i

1497
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:45,200
mean remember in the at the beginning of

1498
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:47,040
the pandemic how nobody nobody could get

1499
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,559
cleaning supplies you would go to a

1500
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:50,640
store and there would be like nothing

1501
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:51,839
nothing there's nothing there

1502
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:54,000
you couldn't get the cleaning supplies

1503
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:56,079
because the shipments had stopped so all

1504
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,440
of the the chemical uh products that

1505
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:58,880
they used to make clorox and all the

1506
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,880
stuff that they all the all their

1507
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,880
processing had come to a grinding halt

1508
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,640
as well and they were paying exorbitant

1509
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,000
fees to try to to stay in mass

1510
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:07,760
production and create the stuff that

1511
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,599
they normally do and so they were

1512
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:11,440
charging the same prices they weren't

1513
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:13,040
doing any price gouging whatsoever and

1514
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:15,520
they were working overtime literally

1515
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:18,079
around the clock 24 7 to try to provide

1516
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:19,280
enough clorox that it would support the

1517
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:20,640
the people that were doing all the

1518
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,960
disinfecting and all the cleaning and

1519
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:25,040
all that stuff and so i really applaud

1520
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:27,680
them because they jump through enormous

1521
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:30,079
hoops that cost them millions of dollars

1522
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:31,520
in order to be able to satisfy that need

1523
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:33,040
and granted they're a public company i

1524
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:34,800
mean they're they're here to make money

1525
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:36,480
but the things that they did went so far

1526
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,640
above and beyond just regular customer

1527
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:40,960
service and to be able to just ship out

1528
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:42,559
these big 55 gallon drums to help the

1529
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:45,920
hospitals and to try to keep everything

1530
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:47,440
sanitized to protect our health so i'm a

1531
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,200
really really big fan of the company and

1532
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:51,200
i love the fact that even though they

1533
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:53,839
have this very strong chemical that they

1534
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,880
were able to provide service now one of

1535
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:56,400
the things that's really cool about the

1536
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,839
clorox company

1537
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,680
because we got asked a lot of questions

1538
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:01,440
during the pandemic about can i use this

1539
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:03,119
on my hardwood floor to disinfect my

1540
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,640
hardwood floor

1541
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:07,119
guys can we have a conversation for a

1542
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:09,440
second about hardwood floors

1543
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:10,960
why are you disinfecting it like most

1544
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,720
people don't eat off their hardwood

1545
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:14,720
floor like the hardwood floors for

1546
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,880
walking on and if you walk inside a

1547
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:18,480
house and you take off your shoes for

1548
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,319
the most part and you're wandering

1549
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:22,319
around your own house

1550
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:24,319
um you shouldn't have like really dirty

1551
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:25,839
floors and if you do you can sweep and

1552
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:28,960
mop them but we don't need to be

1553
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:31,599
spraying bleach on our hardwood floors

1554
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:34,079
and during the pandemic i saw so much

1555
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:36,559
property damage of people that used

1556
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:38,000
bleach the wrong way i got calls from

1557
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:39,839
churches and they said you know people

1558
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,599
came in and they sprayed bleach all over

1559
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:43,599
the wood like where people put their

1560
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:47,359
hands when they kneel down to pray

1561
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:49,119
or the racks where the the hymnals are

1562
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:51,760
um they said they sprayed them on the

1563
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:53,119
the cloth which are those velvet pews

1564
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:55,119
and then they would leave it on for 10

1565
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:56,559
minutes hoping that it would disinfect

1566
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:58,480
and it ruined

1567
00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:00,400
i mean bleach is bleach it's gonna

1568
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:02,400
bleach it's gonna take the color right

1569
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:05,200
out of that but it did it bleached the

1570
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:07,680
pews it ruined the velvet it ruined the

1571
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:09,839
wood it ate through the varnish on the

1572
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:12,000
church pews the church benches they

1573
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:12,960
mopped the floors with bleach i mean

1574
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,480
you're not gonna believe the kind of

1575
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,480
property damage there were people going

1576
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,000
inside office buildings and for the few

1577
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:20,240
people that were still working before

1578
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,640
the the stay-at-home mandates

1579
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:25,520
there were people that were

1580
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:27,599
spraying like these really nice office

1581
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:29,599
desks with bleach and leaving it on

1582
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:31,200
there for 10 minutes it would just eat

1583
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:32,880
through the varnish

1584
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:35,599
and then like they're like oh no what

1585
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:37,119
did i do and then the offices would call

1586
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:39,280
me and the churches were calling me and

1587
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:41,359
i'm like well the good news is your your

1588
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:42,880
cleaner is insured right i'm sure like

1589
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:44,480
you hired a reputable cleaner and

1590
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,640
they're like oh no like the church was

1591
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:48,880
like no no we had parishioners that

1592
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:51,200
volunteered and then i was like

1593
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:54,079
oh no this is on you i mean like you're

1594
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:55,359
not you're not covered right and as a as

1595
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:56,800
a cleaner

1596
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:59,280
we had to have like these emergency

1597
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:01,280
conferences and tell all of our cleaners

1598
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:03,440
this is in your care custody and control

1599
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:05,359
and if it comes out of your spray bottle

1600
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:08,319
and you are paid to be the cleaner you

1601
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:10,480
are also being paid to know how this

1602
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:12,800
works and this is the reason why i say

1603
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,720
bleach is a special project it requires

1604
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,839
special training special equipment and i

1605
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,200
mean you're going to be bringing with

1606
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:19,040
you stuff that we don't bring to our

1607
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:21,119
normal jobs right if you're going to be

1608
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:23,520
doing an ozone job you're going to be

1609
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:25,520
bringing with you special equipment and

1610
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,760
so for that you should charge a special

1611
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:28,800
fee and if we do a special project like

1612
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,480
if we have a couple of showers that

1613
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:32,079
we're doing we'll just bundle those

1614
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:33,839
together and we'll add that maybe to the

1615
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:36,160
first cleaning but that's going to be an

1616
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:37,920
extra 100 or so to come in and treat

1617
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:40,000
that whole shower but it's going to cost

1618
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:41,760
them a hundred dollars anyway because if

1619
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,599
you don't use the bleach then when you

1620
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:45,040
come in you got to get your little scrub

1621
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:46,559
brush and what are you going to use

1622
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,680
cleanser or something and then you're

1623
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:49,200
going to have to clean that and it's

1624
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:51,200
going to take you an hour an hour and a

1625
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:52,960
half to do it anyway right so you might

1626
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:55,119
as well do the first time and kill those

1627
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:56,799
micro organisms that you find with the

1628
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:59,119
pink slime and the mold and all that

1629
00:54:56,799 --> 00:55:01,119
stuff i'd rather treat the customer the

1630
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:03,040
right way give them the right kind of

1631
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:03,920
cleaning and then they might have to pay

1632
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,839
a little bit more but they're going to

1633
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,960
pay a little bit more anyway right if it

1634
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:08,319
takes you an hour and a half to clean

1635
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,079
their shower

1636
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:12,000
why not have it just take the normal

1637
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:13,119
amount of time but you you cleaned it

1638
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,319
the right way and you were able to kill

1639
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:19,359
that bacteria so that's my that's my

1640
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:20,319
that's how i feel about that

1641
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:22,640
ah

1642
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:25,359

00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:33,599
violet xoxo xoxo says uh people today

1648
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:35,760
think you can just use bleach for

1649
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:38,640
everything scary how people go bananas

1650
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:40,960
using it that's true that's true it is

1651
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:42,880
it is scary how people think it's good

1652
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:44,240
for everything and like i said it's a

1653
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:45,599
maintenance

1654
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,599
i mean it's a special project and then

1655
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:48,880
we do maintenance cleaning after that so

1656
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:51,040
i get asked the question a lot

1657
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:52,640
especially if we've done a

1658
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:55,280
a deep clean on a shower which is a

1659
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:56,640
special project and we use the bleach

1660
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,920
i get a lot of questions where people

1661
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,760
say um

1662
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:01,760
after the bleach how do i maintain the

1663
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:03,280
shower and it comes down to training

1664
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:05,280
your customers how to clean their

1665
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:06,960
showers properly and so whether it's a

1666
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,319
bathtub or whether it's a shower that

1667
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,480
has a glass door that we have to

1668
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:12,160
squeegee at the bottom uh one of the

1669
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:14,880
things that i recommend and i'm i'm a

1670
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:19,119
really big fan of this there's a product

1671
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:21,119
and it's a mallory um

1672
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:22,319
do i have one here i do check it out i

1673
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:26,079
have one here

1674
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:28,960
if it is a

1675
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:31,200
scrub sponge that has a nylon net over

1676
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:33,359
the top of it and then on the other side

1677
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:35,040
it has a squeegee and this has a really

1678
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:36,640
long handle i'm not a fan of the long

1679
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,240
handle but this is the only way i can

1680
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:40,240
find it this is actually found in the

1681
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:41,920
automotive department and this is

1682
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:43,839
designed for getting bugs off the

1683
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:46,960
windshields of cars now sometimes you'll

1684
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:49,520
go to a gas station and in the little

1685
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:51,440
thing with the water in it you see these

1686
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:53,280
this is phenomenal and this is the best

1687
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:54,640
tool that i've ever seen

1688
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:56,319
for

1689
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:58,079
cleaning your bathroom shower and then

1690
00:56:56,319 --> 00:57:00,400
squeegeeing it down and so i've linked

1691
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:01,839
to this below and here's how i use it

1692
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,520
i grabbed the one that i hope this is

1693
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:05,359
not gross i grabbed the one from my

1694
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:07,680
bathroom this morning and it's older so

1695
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:10,240
it's kind of a little bit you know used

1696
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:12,240
and it's wet but um what i did is i just

1697
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:14,559
took a pipe cutter and i just cut the

1698
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:17,280
the handle in half so that it's more

1699
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:19,920
user friendly for my shower okay and so

1700
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:21,599
what what i do then after i am ready to

1701
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:24,160
replace it like if i'm ready to replace

1702
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:25,599
it it just unscrews like this so then i

1703
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,960
can unscrew the short little handle and

1704
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:28,160
i don't have to keep recutting it

1705
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,960
because i can only get it you can only

1706
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:33,040
buy it with the long handle anyway um

1707
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,720
this is phenomenal so going back to the

1708
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:36,319
question we had about the soap scum how

1709
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:38,319
do you get rid of the soap scum hang on

1710
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:39,680
i just dropped this there it disappeared

1711
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:43,119
and i'm back

1712
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:44,559
i use in the shower dawn dish soap so

1713
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:46,319
this is what don dish soap looks like

1714
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:47,760
most of you are familiar with it i know

1715
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:50,160
in the european continent it's called

1716
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:51,599
fairy so fairy or dawn this is what we

1717
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,960
use and i love the blue stuff i think

1718
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:56,160
it's just great

1719
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:57,680
i i have added to the links here also a

1720
00:57:56,160 --> 00:58:00,000
pump container and it doesn't matter

1721
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:02,079
what kind of pump container that you use

1722
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,000
any kind of pump container will work

1723
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:05,440
um but i think it should be clear and

1724
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,520
this is my own personal preference for

1725
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:09,599
this reason i can always see at a glance

1726
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:11,040
how much i have am i getting close am i

1727
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:14,160
getting down to the bottom you know i

1728
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:15,680
can see if i can see it's also um

1729
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:17,359
anybody that's in the shower and this

1730
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:19,119
one goes in my shower so i'm the only

1731
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:20,799
one that's there if you share a shower

1732
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:22,400
with someone else you may want to put a

1733
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:24,559
label on it so they know what it is and

1734
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:27,599
put the the tape over the front of it so

1735
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:29,520
that other people would know that um

1736
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:31,920
what it is right because that's just

1737
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:33,839
chemical safety wise but i like the

1738
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:35,359
clear container for this reason so after

1739
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:37,040
a shower this is how you do a

1740
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:38,559
maintenance clean on a shower after

1741
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:40,880
you've already done the bleach you just

1742
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:41,680
put a little couple of drops on the top

1743
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:43,520
here

1744
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:46,880
while your shower is wet

1745
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:48,960
this goes back to the concept of uh

1746
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:51,040
you know how when you soak a pot and pan

1747
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,480
like it has gunk it's caked on the

1748
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:54,480
bottom of it and it's not coming off

1749
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:55,760
with the scrubby and how you like fill

1750
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:57,440
it up with hot soap and water and you

1751
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:59,359
put dish soap in it this is the same

1752
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:01,280
concept so you're inside the shower it's

1753
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:02,640
hot it's steamy you've got nice hot

1754
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,000
water in there and it's been going for a

1755
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:06,559
couple of minutes everything in the

1756
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,480
shower is loose so if you have a whole

1757
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:10,400
shower door full of soap scum a little

1758
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:11,920
bit of dish soap on the side and this is

1759
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:13,839
a sponge with a scrubby but it's not

1760
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:16,640
going to scratch the glass so then you

1761
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:19,280
can use this and go back and forth along

1762
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:21,119
the sides of the shower glass and you

1763
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:23,599
want to go up and around the corners and

1764
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:25,760
around the handles and because this is a

1765
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:27,520
scrubby it's not going to scratch but

1766
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:29,680
you can also go around the hardware you

1767
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:32,240
remember how in the video i said don't

1768
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:33,680
use the bleach on the hardware which is

1769
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:36,880
going to be your faucet your shower head

1770
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:38,079
on a hose the metal rim around the doors

1771
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,920
we don't want to use bleach on that

1772
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:41,680
because it will eat away the finish we

1773
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:43,920
don't want to do that but you can with

1774
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:45,839
this go up and down all the hardware and

1775
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:47,440
around the faucet you can grab the

1776
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:50,079
shower head on a hose and go up and down

1777
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:52,559
on both sides and clean it with the soap

1778
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:54,000
just imagine if it was a pot in a pan

1779
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:55,680
and you were using dish soap so it's

1780
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,839
like the scrubby with the dish soap has

1781
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:59,760
the same exact effect and the dish soap

1782
00:59:57,839 --> 01:00:01,599
is a degreaser so back to the question

1783
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:04,079
about the soap scum it removes the soap

1784
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:07,200
scum so for regular everyday cleaning

1785
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:09,119
you just clean the walls with the soap

1786
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:10,640
and your sponge then you use the shower

1787
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:11,839
head on a hose and you hose the entire

1788
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,440
shower down

1789
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:16,079
when you're done with that you turn the

1790
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:17,520
squeegee over and then you just squeegee

1791
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:20,319
the walls

1792
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:21,760
now your shower looks brand new and when

1793
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:23,440
you get to a customer's house the

1794
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:25,119
customer has done this process the

1795
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:27,200
showers are going to be super easy to

1796
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:29,119
clean and if we train our customers to

1797
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:30,480
do that it's going to save them a lot of

1798
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:32,079
money because it's not going to take us

1799
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:34,559
a half hour every single time we come to

1800
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:37,760
their house to clean their shower and so

1801
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:40,400
with this this is safe for use on

1802
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:41,839
fiberglass it's safe for ceramic tile if

1803
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:43,440
you have like a ceramic tile shower like

1804
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:46,000
the one we saw in the video it's safe

1805
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:48,480
for shower glass it's just phenomenal so

1806
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:51,359
while this was designed

1807
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:54,079
for automobiles and the bugs and the tar

1808
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:56,079
and stuff it's fantastic for showers and

1809
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:59,440
so i'm a really big fan of this all

1810
01:00:56,079 --> 01:01:01,440
right so with that um i think i think

1811
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:03,200
i've covered everything

1812
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:04,880
i didn't cover everything oh my goodness

1813
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:07,200
i forgot okay i have one more thing to

1814
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:09,359
tell you when we get out of the shower

1815
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:11,119
and we've already done the whole process

1816
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:13,119
with the bleach and we use the ozone

1817
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:14,480
generator and then we left for a little

1818
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:16,559
bit i forgot to tell you what happens

1819
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:18,319
when we come back when we come back into

1820
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:19,520
the bathroom we're not going to mix

1821
01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:21,599
remember how we said we're not going to

1822
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:23,680
mix bleach with anything

1823
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:24,960
there's residue of bleach in that shower

1824
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:27,280
because we just sprayed the whole entire

1825
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:29,040
shower from top to bottom with bleach so

1826
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:30,799
there are still there's still residue of

1827
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:33,520
bleach we're not going to be bringing in

1828
01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:36,079
any other chemicals to put inside that

1829
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:38,240
shower okay not cool so what's going to

1830
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:39,359
happen is when we come back in the room

1831
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:40,880
is going to smell nice it's not going to

1832
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:42,880
smell like bleach it's not going to

1833
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:44,240
smell like ozone we've been gone for a

1834
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,920
couple hours we cleaned the rest of the

1835
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:47,839
house we're going to come back in now

1836
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:49,920
everything's going to be sort of tidy

1837
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:52,000
like all the gunk in the in the shower

1838
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:53,839
is pretty much going to be gone it's

1839
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,359
just gonna look like oh no somebody was

1840
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:56,880
in here and they did some weird stuff

1841
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:59,280
and now they left right you're gonna

1842
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,799
remove the towel remove the the

1843
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:03,359
things that are sitting in front of the

1844
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:04,559
shower you're gonna remove the bleach

1845
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:06,000
you're gonna remove you're gonna pour

1846
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:07,680
the bleach back into the container you

1847
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,440
put all your stuff away and that goes in

1848
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:11,599
a special kit okay you're going to put

1849
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:14,319
all that stuff back away inside that kit

1850
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:16,319
you're also going to bring

1851
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:18,079
a steamer this is a handheld steamer

1852
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:21,760
it's one of my favorites this is the

1853
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:22,960
bissell steamer and this steamer is

1854
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:25,119
really great for a whole lot of

1855
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:27,200
non-chemical cleaning and i like to use

1856
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:29,440
it in addition to the bleach because

1857
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:31,839
it's just steam we're talking about just

1858
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:33,760
water to combat whatever we just did

1859
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:35,440
inside the shower okay so the bleach is

1860
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:37,039
going to get most of it out we're going

1861
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:38,559
to come in with our steamer now this

1862
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:41,280
steamer i love this steamer for a couple

1863
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:43,760
reasons it comes with this kit and this

1864
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:45,440
kit has 25 attachments in it and it has

1865
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:48,000
everything from the attachments that you

1866
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:50,319
use for the barbecue grill to the grout

1867
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,160
brushes that you use if you're doing

1868
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:54,799
grout i showed you one of the grout

1869
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:56,880
brushes inside the video but it has just

1870
01:02:54,799 --> 01:02:58,880
a whole bunch of attachments this also

1871
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:00,880
has the attachment that the little

1872
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:03,440
bonnet goes on that i showed you inside

1873
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:05,680
the video where you can use it to remove

1874
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:08,000
soap scum with nothing but

1875
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:09,359
the steam and a couple things about the

1876
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,720
steam we're just going to use regular

1877
01:03:09,359 --> 01:03:12,160
water we're not going to use vinegar in

1878
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:14,480
here we're not going to use essential

1879
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:16,000
oils we're not going to use anything but

1880
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:17,760
water and i get asked this question a

1881
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,160
lot because i don't know people are

1882
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:23,760
tempted to add other stuff

1883
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:25,839
the steamer is designed to remove 99.9

1884
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:28,319
percent of bacteria with just the steam

1885
01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:30,160
it's the heat of the water that makes it

1886
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:31,920
so sanitary right it's like boiling

1887
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:33,520
something remember back in the days

1888
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:35,599
where

1889
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:37,760
a kid would drop the the binky or the

1890
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:39,760
pacifier on the floor and we would boil

1891
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:41,599
it in water the reason we did that is

1892
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:43,200
because the boiling of the water would

1893
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:45,839
disinfect and it would it would kill the

1894
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:47,200
germs by the time the kid is one why you

1895
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:49,039
just pick it off the floor you blow it

1896
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:51,599
off and you give it back

1897
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:53,680
but in the beginning when they're new we

1898
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:56,400
would boil them so that there's no germs

1899
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:57,920
right this goes along the same concept

1900
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,799
and the thing that i like about this

1901
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:01,760
unit

1902
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:04,079
is because it's just water um we're not

1903
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:05,200
mixing anything it's it's easy to use

1904
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:07,520
when you're done with the job and you

1905
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:09,839
dump the water out we always store it

1906
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:11,920
with the door open and that way the air

1907
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:14,240
can circulate and dry it out so that it

1908
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:16,400
doesn't build bacteria inside our

1909
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:18,640
reservoir okay so a couple rules about

1910
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:20,240
using a steamer and this has a really

1911
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:22,480
long cord one of the reasons i really

1912
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:24,400
like this unit it has a super long cord

1913
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:26,160
so that i don't need to bring a

1914
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:27,359
extension cord an extension cord with me

1915
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:28,720
on the job

1916
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:30,079
but the other thing that i like about

1917
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:32,480
that steamer and i just happen to have

1918
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:34,240
this with me is it also has another

1919
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:38,480
adapter where you can use it as a

1920
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:40,799
regular mop and this just pops off so

1921
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:42,720
that you can use this and attach this to

1922
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:44,079
the handheld unit so if you have to go

1923
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:46,319
up to the top of the shower and you're

1924
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:47,920
going to steam off you remember how

1925
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:50,559
you've probably seen some of these these

1926
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:52,160
online hacks where there's like gunk on

1927
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:54,000
a shower head and people take like

1928
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:55,839
vinegar and they put it in a bag they

1929
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,920
try to tie a twisty around it and leave

1930
01:04:55,839 --> 01:04:58,960
it overnight this is all kind of weird

1931
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:01,280
stuff

1932
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:02,799
if you're using a steamer and this is a

1933
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:04,880
great way to do this you just attach

1934
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:06,839
this to the steamer head

1935
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:09,839
it goes something like

1936
01:05:06,839 --> 01:05:12,400
this and now you have a long stick so it

1937
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:14,400
allows you in a tall shower even to go

1938
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:16,720
up to the top of the shower head on a

1939
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:18,480
hose or the shower head and you can

1940
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:20,160
steam that and just by steaming it you

1941
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:22,240
can remove all of the gunk so it's a

1942
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:24,000
seamless process then when you go to mop

1943
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:26,240
the floors there's a little tongue and

1944
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:28,000
groove here and the tongue and groove

1945
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:29,839
just fits right inside here i don't know

1946
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,720
if you can see it

1947
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:34,799
but anyway it just goes like this

1948
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:36,640
and once it snaps in place you hook that

1949
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:38,559
on and then you can go ahead and you can

1950
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:40,799
mop and steam like your ceramic tile

1951
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:43,920
floors and again no chemicals are

1952
01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:46,640
required and so this you can use is

1953
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:48,400
either a damp mop a dry mop or a steam

1954
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:49,520
mop and so i love it for that fact

1955
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,039
because a lot of times like if you have

1956
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:53,760
hardwood floors

1957
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:55,760
or you have luxury vinyl plank flooring

1958
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:56,640
and you don't want to use steam because

1959
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:58,480
of course you don't want to use it

1960
01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:01,280
unless you absolutely have to for like

1961
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:03,440
dog puke or you know whatever

1962
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:06,240
um this gives you the opportunity to to

1963
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:08,319
do that clean up with the damp or the

1964
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:10,000
dry mop and so there are lots of

1965
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:12,079
opportunities for using it but i love

1966
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,880
the steamer because it has so many uh

1967
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:16,880
different utilities and the steamer

1968
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:18,799
we do carry on a regular maintenance job

1969
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:20,640
with us we do carry this with us but

1970
01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:23,119
it's also one of our best and favorite

1971
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:24,720
tools for the special projects that we

1972
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:26,799
do because like if a customer wants you

1973
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:29,280
to to clean out their freezer when you

1974
01:06:26,799 --> 01:06:31,359
unplug the freezer you've got five to

1975
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:34,079
eight hours of defrosting before it's

1976
01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:35,839
actually gonna um make itself

1977
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:37,680
you know

1978
01:06:35,839 --> 01:06:39,920
what do you call it defrosted and so you

1979
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:41,839
can go in here after it's unplugged and

1980
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:43,520
don't hit the coils directly but you can

1981
01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:46,240
hit all the areas in the shelves around

1982
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:47,760
it and the as it drops it's going to air

1983
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:49,520
out all that other area and you can do

1984
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:51,599
it in about i don't know a tenth of the

1985
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:52,799
time so we use this for a lot for the

1986
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:54,240
the

1987
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:56,559
defrosting of freezers and stuff like

1988
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:58,000
that you can also use it on ovens inside

1989
01:06:56,559 --> 01:07:00,960
ovens if there's somebody with chemical

1990
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,880
safety uh chemical sensitivities

1991
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:05,200
you can also use this for that uh in the

1992
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:06,640
video you saw we also used it to clean

1993
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:08,400
up the rest of the shower if there's any

1994
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:10,559
residue in the shower after we've

1995
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:12,079
already rinsed it come in we're gonna

1996
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:13,440
rinse the shower with the shower head on

1997
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:15,760
a hose then we're going to use our

1998
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:17,119
steamer for the last little bit of

1999
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:19,839
whatever we have to do in that shower to

2000
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:21,920
get it clean so for using bleach bleach

2001
01:07:19,839 --> 01:07:23,359
when you absolutely have to make sure

2002
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:24,480
that you take your precautions and make

2003
01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:26,400
sure that you're wearing your personal

2004
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:29,200
protective equipment make sure that when

2005
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:30,799
you come into to do the after cleaning

2006
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:32,720
when you get ready to do the actual

2007
01:07:30,799 --> 01:07:34,960
cleaning because again bleach is not a

2008
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:36,480
cleaner it's a

2009
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:37,680
disinfectant

2010
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:39,440
what you're going to do then is you're

2011
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:40,799
going to just going to use your steamer

2012
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:42,799
and that way you can use any of the

2013
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:44,720
attachments that we have that will do

2014
01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:47,280
the job for what you need so if you

2015
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:49,440
decided before you started the job that

2016
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:51,520
you have um

2017
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:53,039
that you have some

2018
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:54,400
mold or something on the walls you may

2019
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:56,640
want to go over it with a steamer

2020
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:58,400
attachment that is designed and this is

2021
01:07:56,640 --> 01:08:01,359
what this looks like that it's designed

2022
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:03,599
for the grout so that it just gently

2023
01:08:01,359 --> 01:08:06,000
removes all of that and it steams it and

2024
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:06,799
disinfects it as as you go

2025
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,119
so

2026
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:10,720
let's see

2027
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:12,240
we've got uh some questions here and i

2028
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:14,319
wanna i really wanna make sure that i

2029
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:16,719
get all these answered

2030
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:19,359
uh jay said i had to report our

2031
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:20,880
housekeeping depart for spring bleach in

2032
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:22,159
the air after cleaning a room in my

2033
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:23,120
hospital

2034
01:08:22,159 --> 01:08:24,560
oh

2035
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:26,239
that's not cool

2036
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:28,560
i'm sorry that that happened

2037
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:29,679
again it comes down to just being aware

2038
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:31,040
there are a lot of people that don't

2039
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:33,359
know the rules i know during the

2040
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:35,839
pandemic we had a lot of people that

2041
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:38,880
didn't know the rules and so they were

2042
01:08:35,839 --> 01:08:40,960
they were using and misusing bleach

2043
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:43,279
and uh back the back

2044
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:45,199
back to the clorox company they made

2045
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:47,359
sure that during the pandemic when

2046
01:08:45,199 --> 01:08:49,040
people were spraying bleach on floors

2047
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:51,120
and leaving them on floors they came up

2048
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:53,199
with a clorox

2049
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:55,199
wipe it would go right over like a

2050
01:08:53,199 --> 01:08:57,440
swiffer duster for example and it fit

2051
01:08:55,199 --> 01:08:59,279
the swiffer dusters perfectly so you can

2052
01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:00,560
use existing tools that are out on the

2053
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:02,319
market they weren't even selling new

2054
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:04,000
tools this was just stop whatever you're

2055
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:06,400
doing you know with mopping with the

2056
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,960
bleach and use these wipes that have a

2057
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:11,279
limited amount of chemicals on them and

2058
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:13,359
it's it's not a bleach um

2059
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:16,480
it wasn't a bleach situation but it was

2060
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:18,480
like 99.9 sanitizing of the floors and

2061
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:21,279
we determined that that was good enough

2062
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:23,839
because for most people 99.9

2063
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:25,759
was sufficient for flooring

2064
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:27,679
unlike jay we're not doing

2065
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:29,759
medical procedures on our hardwood

2066
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:30,719
floors in our homes for the most part

2067
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:32,960
and so

2068
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:34,799
i mean i hope not at all unless you know

2069
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:37,279
i i hope not at all

2070
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:39,040
so these these tools that we use it

2071
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:41,679
comes down to are you are you working

2072
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:43,440
smart not hard and are you learning the

2073
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:45,759
proper tools and techniques and so

2074
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:47,600
that's what this whole um dog and pony

2075
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:50,319
show is today

2076
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:52,080
to let you know about the the proper

2077
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:54,159
ways that we're using this all right i

2078
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:56,880
want to open this up for questions do we

2079
01:09:54,159 --> 01:09:58,880
have any other questions here um i i see

2080
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:02,000
lots of people saying hey how you doing

2081
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:05,199
and hey how you doing back uh nestor and

2082
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:06,800
denise and uh pam pam says could you

2083
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:09,440
please explain the difference between

2084
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:11,199
clorox anywhere hard surface cleaner pet

2085
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:13,199
friendly which i can't find anymore and

2086
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:14,719
clorox hard surface cleaner commercial

2087
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:16,640
grade

2088
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:18,880
uh so i don't know without looking at

2089
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:21,199
the safety data sheets the specifics

2090
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:23,120
between those two products

2091
01:10:21,199 --> 01:10:27,199
and one of the things that i want to pay

2092
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:29,679
attention to is clorox can only be used

2093
01:10:27,199 --> 01:10:32,400
on sealed surfaces and so it's not

2094
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:34,080
designed for porous surfaces and so how

2095
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:35,760
do you know if you have a sealed surface

2096
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:37,520
so if you take some water and you spray

2097
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:39,520
it on a surface like let's say that you

2098
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:41,280
spray it on a porcelain sink and it

2099
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:43,120
beads up on the porcelain sink it

2100
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:45,120
doesn't sink in then you know you have a

2101
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:47,760
sealed surface and it's okay to use the

2102
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:51,120
clorox spray and the clark spray would

2103
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:54,480
be the dilution version that we're using

2104
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:58,320
inside a spray bottle and this is three

2105
01:10:54,480 --> 01:11:00,480
one ounces to 32 ounces of water so

2106
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:02,560
we're diluting it and that would be the

2107
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:04,080
equivalent of one of the ready-to-use

2108
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:06,000
sprays and that's something you need to

2109
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:08,080
be aware of if you go to a store they

2110
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:10,320
have concentrates and they have ready to

2111
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:12,560
use when i buy a gallon of bleach like

2112
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:14,960
this this is a concentrate and so this

2113
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:17,040
is what we're talking about diluting and

2114
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:19,040
so diluting this is we're not going to

2115
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:21,840
use it full strength except in those

2116
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:23,440
icky showers and exactly how i explained

2117
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:25,199
it that's the only way we're going to

2118
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:26,320
use it and for the rest of everything

2119
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:28,560
else that we use it for i think it's

2120
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:30,560
going to be a diluted version

2121
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:31,679
um if you buy a ready-to-use spray

2122
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:33,280
you're going to go in and there's like a

2123
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:35,360
spray with a fancy bottle and it says

2124
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:37,120
clorox bathroom spray or something

2125
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:39,520
that's a diluted version it's going to

2126
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:41,840
be the equivalent of the three pumps and

2127
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:44,560
the rest of it is water so you're mostly

2128
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:47,600
paying for water and they have different

2129
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:49,840
varieties some smell like you know

2130
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:51,440
lavender some smell like lemon they have

2131
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:53,679
different scents that some are made for

2132
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:55,520
the bathroom some are stronger

2133
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:57,840
what i recommend is that you read the

2134
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:59,760
labels and then you make sure you only

2135
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:02,080
use it on what it says because here's

2136
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:04,480
something that most people don't know

2137
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:06,719
when you use a cleaning chemical

2138
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:09,199
and you use it as is directed by the

2139
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:11,040
manufacturer you're good and if you use

2140
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:12,960
it for other things and i see a lot of

2141
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:14,880
tick-tock hacks don't get me started on

2142
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:16,320
tick-tock hacks but i see tick-tock

2143
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:18,960
hacks where people are like mixing

2144
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:20,800
chemicals and stuff and they're using it

2145
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:22,960
inconsistent with the way that the

2146
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:24,719
manufacturer intended it not only can

2147
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:28,560
that be toxic but

2148
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:30,400
if it ruins the surface or it plugs the

2149
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:32,400
toilet or it ruins whatever it's not

2150
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:33,679
under warranty it will completely void

2151
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:35,600
the warranty on whatever you have

2152
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:37,920
whether it's flooring whether it's an

2153
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:40,080
appliance whether it's the

2154
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:41,760
fridge a sink a stove a cabinet a

2155
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:44,800
countertop whatever if you use the

2156
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:47,120
products inconsistent with the the

2157
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:49,120
manufacturer's specifications they will

2158
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:51,440
not they will not stand good for it

2159
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:53,280
they're not responsible and so don't try

2160
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:55,120
to call them and say oh i used your

2161
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:56,560
product and it ruined sentences you're

2162
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:58,640
supposed to know better

2163
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:59,920
so um yeah please don't use the tick

2164
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:01,760
tock hacks

2165
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:02,640
most of them are just for entertainment

2166
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:04,560
only

2167
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:06,000
and i hope that nobody ever gets hurt

2168
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:08,560
from the

2169
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:11,040
damage that's caused by those all right

2170
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:13,760
so i i said that okay let's see do we

2171
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:17,360
have any other comments here

2172
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:19,199
uh someone's here said to mix bleach

2173
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:21,199
with thick toilet cleaner and leave it

2174
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:23,120
to sit on grout uh no we're not going to

2175
01:13:21,199 --> 01:13:24,320
do that i don't know who said that but

2176
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:26,239
we're not going to do that we just

2177
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:28,000
agreed as a as a collective group that

2178
01:13:26,239 --> 01:13:30,400
we're not going to mix bleach with

2179
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,679
anything we might dilute it with water

2180
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,880
only but we're not going to mix it with

2181
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:34,640
anything we're certainly not going to

2182
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:36,080
mix it with toilet bowl cleaner one of

2183
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:38,159
the things that we have to be painfully

2184
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:40,640
aware of and this goes back to the ph

2185
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:42,960
scale again 7 is neutral all the way

2186
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:44,560
over to the side the zero are the acids

2187
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:46,880
and all the way over the other side we

2188
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:48,880
have 14 which are the alkalines when you

2189
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:50,960
mix a product like clorox this is a

2190
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:52,480
number 12 and a half and you mix it with

2191
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:55,280
something all the way over to the other

2192
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:58,080
scale that's an acid and it does

2193
01:13:55,280 --> 01:14:00,480
clorox does react to acids and so what

2194
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:03,280
happens is you are creating toxic

2195
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:04,480
cis situations where either the fumes

2196
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:06,159
are going to be so strong they'll knock

2197
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:07,520
you out and i promise you this there are

2198
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:09,679
people that are hospitalized every day

2199
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:10,880
for making stupid things like that and i

2200
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:12,719
say stupid because they're really really

2201
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:14,400
really stupid decisions please do not

2202
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:16,080
mix chemicals do not mix it with toilet

2203
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:18,640
bowl cleaner toilet bowl cleaner is a

2204
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:20,719
one or a two on the complete opposite

2205
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:22,400
end of the scale and while you think it

2206
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:23,840
might cancel each other out because it

2207
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:26,320
neutralizes

2208
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:29,360
you know acids to alkaline the mixtures

2209
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:32,239
are so toxic they can be fatal and so if

2210
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:34,960
if i could implement or impart one piece

2211
01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:36,880
of wisdom do not mix anything with

2212
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:39,040
bleach bleach bleach is very very

2213
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:41,360
powerful all on its own it doesn't need

2214
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:42,880
anything else the only thing it needs is

2215
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:44,000
extreme caution

2216
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:45,520
got it

2217
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,440

think you can just use bleach for

2231
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:12,239
everything oh i already read this one

2232
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:14,560

uh denise said i think spring bleach in

2235
01:15:16,239 --> 01:15:20,080
the air was to fake people out into

2236
01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:21,679
thinking it was cleaned at all

2237
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:24,159
a lot of people do that they'll spray

2238
01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:26,080
stuff with a strong chemical smell and i

2239
01:15:24,159 --> 01:15:27,679
want you to be careful please be careful

2240
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:29,920
with chemicals if you're in the house

2241
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:32,080
cleaning industry as long as i have been

2242
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:33,440
20 30 years

2243
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:35,600
your body

2244
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:36,880
has chemical sensitivities and you have

2245
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:39,120
to be really painfully aware that

2246
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:41,360
there's only one version of us so please

2247
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:42,800
protect your lungs please i know i know

2248
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:44,719
for a couple of years it's been really

2249
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:45,840
unpopular to wear a mask and there have

2250
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:47,440
been people that have been really

2251
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:48,800
polarizing on both sides of it like you

2252
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:51,120
know

2253
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:53,199
we've been wearing masks for 30 years

2254
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:55,199
and this was long before the pandemic if

2255
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:57,040
you're using strong chemicals please

2256
01:15:55,199 --> 01:15:58,400
wear your masks it has nothing to do

2257
01:15:57,040 --> 01:16:00,960
with a pandemic and everything to do

2258
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:02,480
with your lungs protect yourself and if

2259
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:04,560
you're going to use

2260
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:06,640
like a really strong fume like for an

2261
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:09,600
oven cleaner for example which is on

2262
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:11,520
that side of the uh the ph scale really

2263
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:13,040
close to the top and super strong you're

2264
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:14,800
going to need an ozone generator for

2265
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:16,400
that room when you leave you don't want

2266
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:18,000
the family coming home smelling a whole

2267
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:19,520

2268
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,760
