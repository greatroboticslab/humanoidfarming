1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,000
hey guys that's the Baker with Cross

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:08,400
Timbers bison you know one of the

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,019
questions I always get besides what's

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,639
the difference between bison and Buffalo

5
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:19,400
is do you have to have a permit to raise

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,400
bison what does it take to raise bison

7
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:46,130
[Music]

8
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:54,070
so guys what I want to talk to you about

9
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:56,750
today is how to start a bison herd

10
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:58,640
there's no perfect way of doing this

11
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:01,910
I'll just tell you my experience and

12
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:05,780
what I did I had a background in bison

13
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:08,570
and obviously loved this animal and that

14
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:11,360
experience back when I worked at the

15
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:15,530
National Park Service kind of led me

16
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:20,979
into you know the influence of getting

17
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:23,420
bison and so that first of all was the

18
00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:25,100
encouragement of others and there's the

19
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:27,500
influence of a background history with

20
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:30,259
these animals I wanted to be able to

21
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:32,450
raise them so I had that inspiration

22
00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:35,000
there and an encouragement of the family

23
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:37,460
members and my and my wife to do

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,560
something like this and so that was a

25
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:42,710
support system that I got that really

26
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,300
helps a bunch but there's several

27
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:46,310
different things that I want to talk to

28
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:48,820
you about today that will help you get

29
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,820
started

30
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:07,340
to be honest with you there's no special

31
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,830
permit there's no special license or

32
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:13,100
anything to raise bison these are not

33
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:15,560
exotic animals you know you're not

34
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:17,510
you're not raising animals that are from

35
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,660
a zoo I know there's bison in some zoos

36
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:26,890
but this is not an exotic animal this is

37
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:29,090
a natural species that occurs here and

38
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:32,510
basically you just treat them it's it's

39
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:34,519
kind of like cattle if you want to start

40
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:36,380
raising cattle for whatever reason you

41
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:38,480
want to start raising cattle for you can

42
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:42,319
do it you don't have to have any special

43
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,060
permit to raise bison you don't have to

44
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:47,269
set a special license or anything like

45
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:50,890
that you if you want to do it you can as

46
00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:54,799
long as you have really good facilities

47
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:58,760
obviously to contain the Bison good

48
00:02:54,799 --> 00:03:00,980
fencing and you kind of have a

49
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:04,580
background in it it would it would

50
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:07,430
definitely help but to be honest with

51
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:10,489
you if you've had experience raising

52
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:12,680
cattle then then you're not far off of

53
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:16,070
raising bison there are a couple

54
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:18,200
different things you know behavior

55
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:21,290
differences and and different handling

56
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,570
systems and and behaviors and more

57
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:27,070
stress there there is a difference

58
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:31,400
between raising cattle and raising bison

59
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:34,760
but if you do want to raise bison it's

60
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,290
not that difficult to start you just

61
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:39,709
need to get in contact with somebody

62
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:42,950
that raises bison maybe somebody in your

63
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:44,690
local area and that's where it starts

64
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:47,590
from there if you've had if you have

65
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:50,780
somebody local or somebody in your state

66
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:52,430
that you can contact and start from

67
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,440
there that that's probably the easiest

68
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,850
way to do it and they'll kind of point

69
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,470
you in the right direction I'll do

70
00:03:55,850 --> 00:04:00,410
whatever I can to help I would love to

71
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:02,540
help you know I'm here in Oklahoma and I

72
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:05,299
can answer any questions that you have

73
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:09,169
for me that's not a problem you know I

74
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:11,540
just I got mine I got in contact with a

75
00:04:09,169 --> 00:04:14,510
guy and I was just really lucky because

76
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,110
this guy happen to be a big-time bison

77
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:17,480
guy

78
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:20,180
and he's thirty minutes down the road

79
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:24,110
from our farm and so I was just really

80
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:26,360
lucky and I got a hold of DOC Parsons

81
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:29,150
and and he pointed me in the right

82
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:32,060
direction but I had experience raising

83
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:34,820
bison I say raising them taking care of

84
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:38,150
him handling him with my experience in

85
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:40,040
the National Park Service when I was in

86
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:44,360
college so I had some experience there

87
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:46,610
and I wasn't really scared to raise them

88
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,020
or be in the pen with them at all I was

89
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:50,600
a little nervous when you buy your own

90
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:52,580
herd but it's a little bit different but

91
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:56,870
you can do it you can definitely raise

92
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:59,690
your own bison okay those are not bison

93
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:03,500
but those back here bison I don't know

94
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:05,060
what's going on here but anyways yeah

95
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,010
you're you can you're more than welcome

96
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:12,020

do so they're amazing animals and

102
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:29,570
they're fun to watch they're just

103
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:32,530
absolutely fun to watch they're hanging

104
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:36,710
out down here in our bottom pasture and

105
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:38,990

and that will be very helpful if you're

117
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:06,470
interested in raising bison that's

118
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:09,680
actually a good start and you can branch

119
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:11,270
off from there and figure out you know

120
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,240
maybe who's in your area maybe there's

121
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:16,280
somebody local that raises bison maybe

122
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,990
you've driven down the road and seen a

123
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:20,240
bison herd and you know if you can

124
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:21,500
figure out who owns those bison maybe

125
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,280
that's a good start

126
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:27,830
somebody within your state that raises

127
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,090
bison but you can always go to the

128
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:33,290

I hope that I've encouraged you with

144
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:29,640
some of my videos to raise bison it's

145
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:32,220
not for everyone I hope that you guys

146
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:35,610
understand that these animals are very

147
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:38,070
different than cattle they're different

148
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:40,430
than any sort of livestock that if

149
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:42,690
you've ever raised livestock before

150
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:46,880
they're a very unique animal they're a

151
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:50,430
special animal and they have character

152
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:54,060
they are very very social animals which

153
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:55,890
that's so interesting about them which

154
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,660
that's one of the things that just will

155
00:08:55,890 --> 00:09:00,510
attract you to them it's just how social

156
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:03,270
they are they have this this this family

157
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:05,580
and you know they you can see how they

158
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:07,640
interact with each other and and even me

159
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:11,700
as well in my family one more out here

160
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:14,520
but take your time and see if this is

161
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:18,810
the right thing for you go visit a bison

162
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:21,150
farm go and see how they operate you can

163
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:23,100
go to a large scale bison farm or you

164
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:25,080
can go to a small scale bison farm

165
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:28,050
obviously mine is smaller I started out

166
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:32,070
small and that's funny I think this is

167
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:34,380
easier to start out this way and by the

168
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:36,360
way Ted Turner started out with a very

169
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:39,300
small bison herd as well and he's the

170
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:44,940
largest bison producer and in the world

171
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:48,000
so it's ok to start out small but use

172
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:50,760
your resources dig into and get as much

173
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,130
information as you can go visit a farm

174
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,080
that's the best thing to do see how it

175
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:57,800
all are operates see how they do things

176
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:00,600
and and make a decision from there and

177
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:03,390
you know have a have a good background

178
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:06,870
of of raising animals that would be a

179
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:11,330
good start and you have to have good

180
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:14,910
property with that provides grass and

181
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:16,320
obviously good fencing which I'm going

182
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:18,090
to talk to you about an upcoming video

183
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,800
hey guys I hope you enjoyed the video

184
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:22,680
today I hope I've encouraged you to
