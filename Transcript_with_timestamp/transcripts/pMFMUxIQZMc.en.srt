1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,400
working within the context of your

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,200
ecosystem as indigenous peoples did

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,360
instead of trying to disrupt or

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:12,120
manipulate or re-engineer the ecosystem

5
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:13,960
so I see in modern agriculture with new

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,760
biotechnologies certain kinds of

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:19,359
equipment that we're continuing to

8
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,240
redesign and influence the ecosystem

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,400
however more and more is becoming not

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,240
sustainable for growing populations and

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,519
that's a recipe for disaster and so

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,080
honoring the differences in our

13
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:33,559
ecosystems which allows us to farm in

14
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,559
different ways to respect that cuz the

15
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:38,399
desert in Southwest you know us compared

16
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,840
to Nebraska where I live is completely

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,640
different our farm is different from the

18
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,239
calf operations in the Short Grass

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,079
Prairie of the Nebraska Sand Hills just

20
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,760
a little ways away is completely

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,680
different situation that we're dealing

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,680
with and so you got to respect that and

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,359
manage based on the types of soils the

24
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,760
kind of rainfalls and what really grows

25
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:57,600
in your area and so we're learning more

26
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,640
about what Grew From the indigenous

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,640
people and then reincorporating that
