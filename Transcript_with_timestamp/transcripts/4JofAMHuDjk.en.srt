pretty Pond home but they better watch

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,840
out for the bass and crappie that share

00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,800
this water a one acre Pond can really

00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,439
produce a lot of fish Grundy County

Tennessee helping farmers and land

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:35,680
owners build improve or maintain ponds

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,280
there's a lot more to ponds than just

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,680
digging a hole and letting it fill

16
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,760
sometimes they like to have the pond but

17
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,200
they don't really manage it well and

18
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,000
it's not really because they do it on

19
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,399
purpose it's just because they forget to

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,520
manage one common mistake is having a

21
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,840
pond that's too deep this 1 acre Pond is

22
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,039
about 6 feet in the middle which is just

23
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,680
about ideal also you'd think crystal

24
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,440
clear water would be the goal but water

25
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,000
that too clear allows too much sunlight

26
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,479
in which leads to weed growth you want

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,680
some algae growth in there some

28
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,880
phytoplankton growth in there so that

29
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:14,640
the sunlight can't penetrate that pond

30
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,799
floor Craig says semi murky works best

31
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,560
if you can see past 18 Ines under the

32
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,680
water through the water column then it's

33
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,600
probably too clear and it really needs

34
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,560
to be treated with some kind of pond dye

35
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,479
or maybe try to fertilize it there are

36
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,520
more than 200,000 small lakes and ponds

37
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,399
in Tennessee many of them privately

38
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:36,119
owned about a quarter of all the fishing

39
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:38,840
in our state happens on small bodies of

40
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:41,520
water like this one at two dozen Acres

41
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,320
you might label this a small Lake again

42
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,799
though it's not very deep landowner J

Argo loves to invite friends and family

44
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:54,840
over to fish I think we put in

45
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:59,000
approximately 5,000 Blu Gill uh

46
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:01,960
2,000 um hybrid crappie a good thousand

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,840
bass too but this is also a genuine

vegetable farm and Nursery ponds are a

50
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:13,520
great help to agriculture it's such a

51
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,920
such a beneficial resource to this area

52
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,480
for sure to our state uh to be able to

53
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,640
have that that Source available to you

54
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,120
when we don't have rainfall a pine

55
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,879
doesn't have to be huge to be beautiful

56
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,879
