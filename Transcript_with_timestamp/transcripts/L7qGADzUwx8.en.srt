1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:06,870
hey everyone this is IA roadkill and i

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:10,019
am going to attempt to explain how to

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:13,230
use the crop rotation planner for

4
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:17,010
seasons in farming simulator 19

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:20,699
I need to add a disclaimer right now I

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:24,420
play on the PlayStation 4 I do not have

7
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:26,670
access to seasons I've watched numerous

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:30,779
videos and I can see that everyone is

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:33,120
struggling with the idea I think I might

10
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:36,630
know how it's done so I'm gonna make

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:41,640
this video I invite people that are on

12
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:45,180
the PC to try my method see if it works

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,510
and let me know if I have mentioned

14
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,980
something incorrectly I will correct it

15
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:55,949
that way we have a good video out there

16
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:56,640
on how to set up your planner so let's

17
00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:02,460
get started

18
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:07,140
I don't have access to the game so I'm

19
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:11,549
using a spreadsheet on my Mac so here is

20
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:14,549
my number little page that I built your

21
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:22,100
crop rotation is vertical going from the

22
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:24,780
top down step 1 pick a field to plan so

23
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:29,970
for this example we're gonna say it's

24
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:33,750
called field 1 go to the field and look

25
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:37,500
at the history for that field I believe

26
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:39,450
it will say 2 years prior what it had

27
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:43,710
last year and what it had the year

28
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:47,869
before that keep a mental note of those

29
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,869
two crops

30
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:57,030
step two key in the history for the

31
00:01:52,800 --> 00:02:01,200
field field one in this case now before

32
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:03,450
you do any plowing I don't know if it

33
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:09,170
would remove the history if you plowed

34
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:13,170
or not by keying in the history I mean

35
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:15,660
go to the first open field at the top on

36
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:19,950
the left's call left column which we're

37
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:22,470
calling field one and key in the crop

38
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:27,600
that would have been the oldest or two

39
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:30,650
years ago in this case we're gonna say

40
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,650
that it was fallow

41
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:40,830
in the next field down you want to key

42
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:43,230
in the prior year or last year's

43
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:47,670
what was in the ground right now what

44
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:52,620
can you see his stubble and for this

45
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:54,330
example we'll say it was wheat we don't

46
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:57,840
know that it was wheat but it would be

47
00:02:54,330 --> 00:03:02,550
labeled as cereal so pick something that

48
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:05,700
was a cereal crop you now have the

49
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:12,360
history of that field in your system so

50
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:16,049
that you can start a good plan step 3

51
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:22,890
start adding your crop ideas for this

52
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:27,900
year on the next open slot you want to

53
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:31,470
look for the best percentage on the

54
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:37,349
column to the right of that one point

55
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:44,340
zero zero being neutral one point two

56
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:47,870
being better 0.9 being worse you want to

57
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:53,040
get the highest number possible of a

58
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:56,040
fruit or crop that you want in the next

59
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,260
year play around with different crops

60
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:03,200
and see what you can get for the highest

61
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:07,290
percentage remember that this slot is

62
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:10,530
for what you are going to plant this

63
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:15,030
spring step 4

64
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:18,329
repeat step 3 for your year 2 of the

65
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:22,470
game in other words go to the next box

66
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:25,410
down and you want to try different crops

67
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,539
until you get the best percentage for

68
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:33,840
that year

69
00:04:26,539 --> 00:04:38,130
now repeat step 4 until you have your

70
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:42,810
sheet filled out for as many years as

71
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:44,060
you want if your rotation only has 3

72
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:46,850
years

73
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:50,030
of different crops that's fine you don't

74
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:53,720
have to use all of them but there are up

75
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:56,900
to six spaces remember you can only use

76
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:59,180
four of your own crops at the present

77
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:02,680
time because we have two crops in

78
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:02,680
history at the top

79
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,880
you

80
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:30,980
at this point you have the first field

81
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:36,230
field one planned for the next four

82
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:38,420
years and it would be time to plan field

83
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:40,970
number two which is the next one to the

84
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:42,740
right field number three which is the

85
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:45,560
third one field number four which would

86
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:48,920
be the fourth one or the farthest one to

87
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:50,960
the right we're not going to fill those

88
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:53,030
in right now we'll just pretend you only

89
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:57,380
have one field and that's all you're

90
00:05:53,030 --> 00:06:02,780
concerned about after year one is over

91
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:05,740
in other words you're in spring one of

92
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:08,960
year two

93
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:10,880
okay or you could do it in winter but

94
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:16,220
it's easier to explain if you are in the

95
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:21,190
next year or spring one step eight is to

96
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:25,330
move all the planner entries up one line

97
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:30,100
so you're going to remove line one

98
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:33,760
history field from step number two and

99
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,760
move everything up

100
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:52,500
the next step

101
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:58,050
is to add the next crop idea in this

102
00:06:52,500 --> 00:07:04,919
case it would be for year five to get

103
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:05,759
the best percentage after year two is

104
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:11,360
over

105
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:14,280
in other words spring one of year three

106
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:18,120
you'll want to repeat this last steps

107
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:24,840
again move all your planner entries up

108
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:28,250
one line removing line one history of

109
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,250
field from step two

110
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:44,190
and add another crop idea in this last

111
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:47,400
open slot

112
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:53,510
cleared out again remember you don't

113
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:58,320
have to add all of them but you may as

114
00:07:53,510 --> 00:08:02,040
you enter this last time keep an eye on

115
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:05,370
what that's going to do to your year one

116
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:09,120
that is now at the top of the list it

117
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:15,000
will affect your rotation when you start

118
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:17,610
this over again remember that this is

119
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,610
only a planner for your benefit

120
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:25,260
it does not affect how the game runs I

121
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:29,370
hope this hasn't been too confusing I

122
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:32,340
hope it has simplified how the procedure

123
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:34,110
would work again if you have any

124
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:37,560
suggestions please leave them in the

125
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:40,740
comments and I can correct any errors

126
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:42,450
that I have made I'd like to thank

127
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:45,110

128
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:47,880
video if you found it enjoyable or
