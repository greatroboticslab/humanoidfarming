00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:38,860
[music]

2
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:46,460
my name is Butch Swaim a farmer from
southeast Iowa also national promotional

3
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:52,100
director for the national farmers
organization NFO at Corning Iowa today

4
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:57,559
on our Midwest farm report we have a
number of guests that are interested in

5
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:03,350
the farming picture as a whole quite
interested in business and various other

6
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:09,350
interests from around the country and
I'd like to start out by introducing to

7
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:15,920
my extreme right over here Coleman Scott
a businessman in the Midwest and other

8
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:23,420
places throughout the country then to my
immediate right Jim Parker the Parker

9
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:29,720
vacuum-cleaner supply company of Des
Moines Iowa and then on my left I have

10
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:36,860
Ed Shima a large farmer from over in
Iowa County Iowa that helps in his spare

11
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:44,569
time to get people to understand the
farm problem to get others to see that

12
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:50,539
we farmers should work together to solve
this problem and to start off with today

13
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:57,349
we would like to bring a few figures
here in a recent survey that was made of

14
00:01:57,349 --> 00:02:04,459
the Sioux City, Iowa livestock market now
on one given day there was enough hogs

15
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:09,739
and enough cattle on this particular
market that we want to show you the loss

16
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:15,470
of income that is taking place in rural
America there was receipts this

17
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:19,610
particular day and these are actual
receipts and actual prices that the

18
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:25,610
farmers received neveress receipts this
particular day of twelve thousand ninety

19
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:31,280
nine head of cattle and the top price
was twenty one dollars now supposing

20
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:37,040
that everyone received the top price
which everyone knows they don't but

21
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:43,340
nevertheless they were still being
shortchanged at least $11.50 a-hundred

22
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:47,719
from the prices they should be to get
the farm prices and balance with the

23
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:51,110
rest of it
and the same has been figured out on

24
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:57,980
hogs and it was found that in this one
day's marketing the farmers in the area

25
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:05,180
around Sioux City, Iowa marketing area
along with shortchanged one million, six hundred,

26
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:09,140
and four thousand, a hundred and
ninety three dollars just on one day's

27
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:15,769
marketing this is the astounding figure
that has caused the businessmen of rural

28
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:22,579
America is causing them I should say to
wake up and find out that the farm

29
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:27,530
problem is not just a problem of the
farmers but a problem of everyone in the

30
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:36,890
United States and first I would like to
call on Mr. Coleman Scott who

31
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:42,140
is a businessman advertising business
various other things why don't you tell

32
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:46,459
us Coleman how your business is and how
it affects you as you see it well butch

33
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:51,670
I think probably the most important part
of it as it immediately appeared to me a

34
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:58,370
few days ago I was in one of the areas
not to very far from Des Moines talking

35
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:03,590
with a man in the automobile business
now this man does all of his business

36
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:09,769
with what we call rural America about 95
percent of all of his business is done

37
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:14,870
directly with the farmer I was talking
with him about a problem which was quite

38
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:18,919
important to him and it was important to
me because he was a part of an

39
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:23,780
advertising campaign which my firm was
about to handle and he said truthfully

40
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:27,110
Coleman I don't want to do any more
business well this is up obviously

41
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:30,650
something that is very strange because
here's a man that is not only a good

42
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:33,289
merchant but he has a record of being a
good businessman

43
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:36,860
and I said what causes you to make a
statement like that or he reached in his

44
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:41,660
desk for a stack just about this side
and he said all of these represent a

45
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,470
series of people with whom I've done
business with for years who have had

46
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:50,360
excellent records of pay these people
are now all delinquent this has now

47
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,110
forced me to become de liquid at the
bank this has never happened since I've

48
00:04:54,110 --> 00:05:00,530
been in business in my conversation he
went on to say it's very tough for me to

49
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:04,370
sell something to a grocer for instance
who does business with a farmer when the

50
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:10,099
farmer doesn't have any money now over
and over I guess all of us have heard

51
00:05:10,099 --> 00:05:13,849
the story of the farmer who benefits to
the extent of having two Cadillacs one

52
00:05:13,849 --> 00:05:18,590
for town a one to drive down in the
South Forty this automatically caused

53
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:23,900
me to ask questions from him it was this
that caused me to first make my visit to

54
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:29,030
you to ask for additional information
NFO was comparatively new to me I've of

55
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:33,319
course seen it read it as a as a newsman
I've been in cut in touch with it to a

56
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:37,340
large degree because I've come in
contact with certain activities certain

57
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:41,419
things that have been said certainly
their national meetings and frankly

58
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:45,469
butch I wondered who it was that was
opposing the farmer from getting his

59
00:05:45,469 --> 00:05:51,289
legitimate share of the National part of
the gross national product this was what

60
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:56,449
first caused me to ask these questions
of you now at your office I picked up a

61
00:05:56,449 --> 00:06:00,139
sheet of paper it's a pink one here this
is obviously something people may see I

62
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:04,280
guess the cameras not turned on it but
it impressed me because I had recently

63
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,529
driven through the area- pardon me- which
was mentioned in this particular article

64
00:06:08,529 --> 00:06:14,680
was referring to a particular part of
one county of the state of California

65
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:20,389
which to a large degree is owned by a
major land corporation now this company

66
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:27,500
has a holding of two million four hundred
and twelve thousand a hundred and twelve

67
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:32,060
acres now this is one company now if
somebody were to call this corporate

68
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,650
farming this would obviously make a lot
of sense but that isn't the truth

69
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:40,960
because in addition to owning this two
million four hundred thousand acres

70
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,500
they're also the largest producer of
livestock in one of the foreign

71
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:53,270
countries they own 51% of the stock in a
major implement corporation but their

72
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:58,729
big cash return comes from the 27
percent oil depletion benefits which

73
00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:04,879
they enjoy through the series of the one
thousand five hundred and fifty

74
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:09,800
producing oil wells which are on there
two million four hundred and fourteen

75
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:15,980
thousand acres so they produce cattle
enjoying a tax benefit from

76
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:19,030
the oil depletion of the twenty seven
and a half percent allowance and

77
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:22,670
suddenly you're not talking about
farming anymore you're talking about

78
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:27,500
people in a variety of businesses the
strangest part was not their holding of

79
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,790
this but the fact that their board of
directors also had members of the board

80
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:35,960
of directors of one of the largest food
chains in the United States now in

81
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,370
reading some of your material which was
placed at my disposal I noticed that

82
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:45,440
many times many of those people had been
most belligerent in opposing the farmers

83
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,350
position for collective bargaining what
is this story Butch well this story is

84
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:55,730
to make a long story short come right to
the point here I don't know if the

85
00:07:55,730 --> 00:08:01,030
camera can see this or not but in the
October convention of the chain stores

86
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:06,620
why the vice-president of the chain
stores called for an out-and-out

87
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:13,130
abolishment of the family farm system of
agriculture in America but what's the problem I

88
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:20,480
don't know really unless it's because
the fact that in the next 35 years the

89
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,810
amount of food produced in the United
States is going to have to weigh more

90
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:28,730
than double we're going to have have to
double everything virtually in America

91
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:32,979
with the exception of the tombstones out
here in the graveyard Coleman and

92
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:36,650
Agriculture has produced seventy percent
of the new wealth that goes into the

93
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:40,490
money streams of America to keep our
industry running and it's very obvious

94
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:44,270
that some of the large interests would
like to own control agriculture this is

95
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:47,660
the only reason that I can see they
didn't say why they attacked of the

96
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:52,130
family farm system agriculture but
nevertheless they call for the abolishment

97
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,430
of the family farm system of
Agriculture well now one of the things

98
00:08:55,430 --> 00:09:01,550
that I have noticed the National farm
breeders the breeders of cattle those

99
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:05,600
who are feeders of cattle consistently
point to the amount of money that has

100
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,880
been lost by the cattle raisers yet one
of the largest rubber companies in the

101
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,540
United States maintains ten thousand
head of cattle on one of its ranches

102
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:22,370
again enjoying a series of the twenty
seven percent oil depletion it's pretty

103
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:25,640
tough it would seem to me for a man who
raises a hundred head to be able to

104
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:31,029
compete with this kind of an operation
well NFO would correct this situation

105
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:34,359
because the people that all the people
that grow a hundred head would band

106
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:38,529
together and would equal ten thousand
head in in a lot in other words it would

107
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:42,819
equal anything far greater than all the
rest of them own put together this is

108
00:09:42,819 --> 00:09:46,540
what the family farm must do they must
band together through the NFO

109
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:52,839
collective bargaining plan so that their
bargaining strength is not only just as

110
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:58,540
great as any other food producers in the
United States but is greater then the

111
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:02,410
bargaining power of those that are
buying the farm commodities well I had a

112
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:06,399
man pardon me Butch I had a man explaining
to me I asked some questions

113
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,509
of people in the processing business
today knowing that I was going to appear

114
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:15,669
with you and he said Coleman it's probably
the strangest situation that exists he

115
00:10:15,669 --> 00:10:21,220
said we in turn create a processed meat
product we know what we have to sell it

116
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,160
for because the people we're going to
sell it to tell us what they want to

117
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,689
sell it for they're going to add their
profit and we work backwards they're

118
00:10:28,689 --> 00:10:32,919
going to sell it for 69 cents we know
what their markup is so we know what

119
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:35,739
we're gonna sell it to them for him by
the time we finally reached the point

120
00:10:35,739 --> 00:10:39,459
where we buy the product that's going to
go into it we have to say to the farmer

121
00:10:39,459 --> 00:10:42,519
this is all we can tell you because
that's all there is now everybody

122
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:46,149
else's profit had been added to it now
they were at the point of origin this is

123
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:50,289
exactly opposite of any other
manufactured product in America this is

124
00:10:50,289 --> 00:10:54,579
exactly right and this is why the
farmers must act and act now because

125
00:10:54,579 --> 00:10:59,559
their whole industry is in jeopardy and
everyone else in America sets their

126
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:04,509
price based on a cost of production and
then a reasonable profit why shouldn't

127
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:08,919
the American farmer be entitled to do
the same thing to start at the origin of

128
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:12,519
the product in other words maybe to set
a price of it based on what they know

129
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:16,600
it's going to cost to produce it before
it to the crop is ever planted before

130
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:23,799
this operation starts and then ask and
receive that price well Butch of course

131
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:26,829
the biggest the biggest argument against
well let's take one particular item the

132
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:30,879
biggest argument of course against the
business of the farmers collective

133
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:34,480
bargaining has been the fact that you'd
price yourself out of the European

134
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,129
markets in the foreign markets now I
found that interesting reading well

135
00:11:39,129 --> 00:11:43,230
where's this 
to me isn't a problem because why should

136
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:49,949
we depend on the European market for a
living when we have plenty here in

137
00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:55,589
America why should we depend on the
European market last year Coleman we did sell

138
00:11:55,589 --> 00:12:02,279
one acre and four out of each four in
 foreign trade but you know why

139
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:06,269
we sold one acre and four in foreign
trade for the simple reason that we

140
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:09,629
couldn't make a living on the three
acres that we sold at home

141
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:14,069
so we built a surplus product so we
build a surplus and we operate wholly in

142
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:18,389
surplus so there's only one difference
no doubt you realize this much better

143
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:21,269
than I would
or much better than the average farmer

144
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:25,259
out here but did you ever stop to think
with the only difference between a

145
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:31,040
surplus or a so-called surplus and an
inventory is to set the price on it

146
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:37,709
so we at NFO believe that we
should get together and set the price on

147
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:42,929
our commodity change our so-called
surplus into an inventory just like any

148
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:47,160
other good business in America does
well Butch I was in your office as you will

149
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,389
recall when Jim Parker another
businessman walked in and asked almost

150
00:12:51,389 --> 00:12:55,350
identically the same type of questions I
asked so I was real pleased when you

151
00:12:55,350 --> 00:13:00,179
said Jim and I would be together in the
same show this is ironic folks these are

152
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:04,559
two businesspeople that walked in the
office the very same day within a matter

153
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:09,959
of a few minutes apart concerned about
the same things concerned that their

154
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:16,110
business was going down with the farmer
so that farming the farm problem is no

155
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:20,279
longer just the problem of the Farmers
of America but it's a problem of all

156
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:27,419
America and at this time I would like to
to ask Jim Parker to express his

157
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:33,629
business views and why we walked into
the office and why but his he told it as

158
00:13:33,629 --> 00:13:37,829
he put it and I want him to explain it
in his own words a little later and, as

159
00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:42,269
he, the more and more that he looked at
this farm situation the more that he

160
00:13:42,269 --> 00:13:45,689
felt the noose tightening around his
neck but he would no longer be in

161
00:13:45,689 --> 00:13:50,369
business if the NFO should fail and this
was just two days ago I never saw the

162
00:13:50,369 --> 00:13:53,350
man before but he's a real shrewd
businessman

163
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:58,510
folks and i would like to express get
him to express his opinion why it is

164
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:04,570
that he thinks as he put it to me that
every businessman in America should be

165
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:09,430
concerned and every businessman could
should be willing and ready to help

166
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:15,550
solve this farm problem
well Butch this is an unpaid

167
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:21,400
testimonial I agree unpaid for sure but
whether or not it'll be a testimonial

168
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,750
depend the course on whether or not I
can learn a little about the NFO and

169
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:29,440
that's my reason for being here that's
my reason for having come into the

170
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:35,380
office my business consists of
contacting dealers in small communities

171
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:41,550
through Iowa northern Missouri little of
Kansas a little of eastern Nebraska and

172
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:47,860
about two years ago I began to feel this
pinch I put a dealer in a little town of

173
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,980
Pattonsburg Missouri and I come back
six weeks later to call on him and he

174
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:54,600
was gone
now this has happened a number of times

175
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,740
I'm becoming aware and I had become
aware at that time that this little

176
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:03,790
businessman in this town when he tells
me he doesn't have the money to buy

177
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:09,220
today I contacted approximately six
dealers that told me this and these

178
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:13,620
dealers were well-established had been
in business for a number of years and

179
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:19,570
they feel it
if these dealers are affected then

180
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:24,250
they're going to be other businessmen
surely like me I would presume several

181
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:28,930
businessmen who have already been put
out of business I'm on the verge at

182
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:34,840
least in this phase of it I come into
your office in the hope that I could

183
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:39,960
find out something from NFO I've
been concerned about this holding action

184
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:44,800
some people agree with it some people
disagree but one thing about it I was

185
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:51,790
favorable to the NFO because they're
doing something I saw these television

186
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:58,360
programs that you have had on Sunday
afternoon and they  were good they

187
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:03,220
had they had good effect I like the I
like the way they go about this thing

188
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,710
they're going to make an effort to do
this

189
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:14,590
if they can find a way to bring to the
attention of the businessman to the Iowa

190
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:19,810
citizen to the citizens of this country
the fact that we surely got to take care

191
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:23,520
of our farm program we've surely got to
get the economy of the farmer right

192
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:29,950
every time isn't it true that every time
a farm closes goes out of business

193
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:34,810
we die a little more yes this is true
and we lose more business people all the

194
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:39,540
time I'm real glad Jim that you brought
up this fact of the NFO holding action

195
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:44,260
because this is probably the most
misunderstood thing there is about our

196
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:49,990
whole program but I'd like to call your
attention in fact with everybody in

197
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:55,150
America that's in business every working
man that works for a wage all of them

198
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:59,170
have a holding action all the time did
you ever stop to think that you have a

199
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:03,460
holding action on your on your business
all the time that you set a price on

200
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:08,140
your commodity and you hold for that
price but simply this has been

201
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:11,650
established before you were entered
business to the point that everybody

202
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:16,510
walks in or that buys from you pays
this price without ever thinking that

203
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:20,020
you have a holding action and the fellow
that you sell it to from the wholesale

204
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:26,290
level he has a holding action too he
holds it until he gets this price he

205
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:31,510
puts the legitimate market based on a
cost of production plus a profit the

206
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:35,770
same way you operate your business and
he has a holding action now is it so

207
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:40,240
wrong or the American farmer to do
exactly the same thing we hope to

208
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,800
educate the people and the public that
we're entitled to a cost of production

209
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:49,360
plus a reasonable profit and then as
soon as they become aware of this

210
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:55,270
situation and acknowledge this fact then
we will no longer have to have a holding

211
00:17:55,270 --> 00:18:00,340
action such as we had before that you're
referring to this holding actions we've

212
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:04,480
had in the past have been to call
people's attention for the situation and

213
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:10,030
to test our bargaining strength with the
processor the very much the same way

214
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:15,690
that a labor union for instance has a
test of strength when they have a

215
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:21,610
walkout
or at least to gain the same respect that

216
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:26,230
everyone else has the right to set down
and bargain in America for a fair price

217
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:32,590
Jim this basically is NFO are we moving- is
it moving forward now moving forward

218
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:40,080
real well we've been expanding into many
more states recently where we have

219
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,960
somewhere in the neighborhood of two or
three hundred people that are working

220
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,730
whatever time they can out in the area
we're gaining very rapidly at this time

221
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:53,140
I made this statement many times and
it's true it's been proven true all the

222
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:58,990
time but everyone in America will
support the NFO plan of action will

223
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:03,100
support the NFO efforts as soon as they
understand again in fact is I will make

224
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:07,990
this statement to anyone anywhere in
America that's against the principles of

225
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:12,880
the National Farmers Organization are
against American form of government and

226
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,409
I say this for two reasons
that number one it's been the law of our

227
00:19:17,409 --> 00:19:22,480
land for some 23 years now it's been
legal for the farmers to band together

228
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:28,780
and organize and do exactly what the NFO
is doing and number two it's the same

229
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:34,090
business principle that everyone else in
America uses all the time every day that

230
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:37,990
they're open for business right now can
I make another point Butch just before

231
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:44,919
you leave me here every community in
Iowa at least every little town that I

232
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:51,460
go to when I Drive down the Main Street
I see empty buildings businesses used to

233
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:54,730
be in these buildings but now they're
not there anymore

234
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:59,400
we can't pin this all down to one little
community or one group of communities

235
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,460
just recently I drove down the Main
Street of Cedar Rapids from Marian

236
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:09,039
driving west down First Avenue and right
down in the heart of the middle of Cedar

237
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:13,059
Rapids in in an area of a block or a
block and a half I counted four or five

238
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:16,210
empty buildings now here's one of our
leading cities in the state of Iowa

239
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:20,470
Coleman you you saw this yeah I saw that
the thing that the thing that impresses

240
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:24,520
me when I see such a thing is I wonder
what it was that caused a businessman

241
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:30,070
who had an investment in a community to
say it's got me I can't take it I wonder

242
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:33,039
what it was that caused
this man to say there is no future in

243
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,940
business and get out of it now this is
what scares me when I see that do you

244
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:40,119
think it's all of the farm, to
attribute it to the to the farm economy

245
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:43,690
no I don't attribute it to the farm
economy if I did I wouldn't I wouldn't

246
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,849
keep asking questions I don't know who's
to blame

247
00:20:45,849 --> 00:20:51,190
I keep wondering these points if a man
who works in a factory does not make

248
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:55,659
enough money to pay the milk bill I know
he can't buy milk so the government says

249
00:20:55,659 --> 00:21:00,519
to him look we're gonna give you free
milk right now this doesn't make sense

250
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:03,820
to me somebody should pay him enough
money so they can go buy the milk right

251
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:09,009
but if they do this why did- they why did
the milk cost 30 cents a quart when it

252
00:21:09,009 --> 00:21:12,129
gives given away free to him because he
didn't have enough money to get it and

253
00:21:12,129 --> 00:21:15,669
the farmer got six and a half cents a
quart for the milk anyway that he can't

254
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:19,570
buy it either if the farmer didn't have
the milk on the farm he doesn't make

255
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:24,339
enough money to bought it either
now if the farmer does not produce a

256
00:21:24,339 --> 00:21:29,080
milk product he can't buy milk for his
kids today in many cases now this is the

257
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:34,119
thing that causes me to ask why if
work is work and labor is honest I

258
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:37,809
started to ask a question a moment ago
here butch says this has been going on

259
00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:43,299
for 20-some years actually Arthur capper
who was the great friend of the farmer

260
00:21:43,299 --> 00:21:48,489
originated the act in 1922 the
capper-volstead, 43 years 43 years

261
00:21:48,489 --> 00:21:51,729
that's what I was going to correct you
on but thank you for letting me

262
00:21:51,729 --> 00:21:57,339
interrupt I didn't mean to and now we're
going to turn to farmer the fellow that

263
00:21:57,339 --> 00:22:03,399
farms for a living raising his family
doing a real good job farming one of

264
00:22:03,399 --> 00:22:08,679
them more or less a big scale not real
big scale but as far as a family farm it's

265
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:15,249
considered a real bit operation a good
50 operation an operation where

266
00:22:15,249 --> 00:22:19,389
efficiency is practiced
where's diversified he raises a number

267
00:22:19,389 --> 00:22:24,940
of things and Ed would you care to
fill in as you see it what is the

268
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:29,589
solution of this farm problem so-called
farm problem well butch we have in my

269
00:22:29,589 --> 00:22:34,239
community over the years a number of our
really what you'd call good farmers have

270
00:22:34,239 --> 00:22:38,950
been leaving and this trend is
continuing as I see it looking at my

271
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:46,140
community we're by and large we are
all of us are pretty efficient farmers

272
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:49,950
we have rather large operations we
aren't what you'd call marginal farmers

273
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:54,720
at all but still when I look at the my
neighbors practically all of them almost

274
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,830
without exception are working in the
town to supplement their farm income or

275
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:03,920
if they aren't their wives probably are
almost without exception now this is a

276
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:09,090
great concern actually then you look at
the community I live in fairly good land

277
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:13,470
and fairly good-sized farm operations
but still they aren't making a go of it

278
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:19,850
now over the years we've seen these
house farms be become larger being

279
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:25,830
consolidated and going into the future I
think this is going to continue then as

280
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:30,900
you look at these farms now they're
large investments it's hard to finance

281
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:35,130
this type of operation as they continue
to get bigger I can I wonder

282
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:38,970
who's who's going to finance these
certainly the family type farmer can't

283
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:44,100
continue to finance a large-
larger operation under the present

284
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,970
income structure that we have so then
the question is what should we do about

285
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:54,780
this and as a farmer in Iowa County Iowa
it seems to me that we need to look at

286
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:58,410
this in a more businesslike way do like
businessmen do put ourselves in a

287
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:03,240
business position of pricing our
products and in doing this this requires

288
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,210
some responsibilities you have to accept
some responsibility to price your

289
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:09,300
product you have to accept the
responsibility for the surpluses the

290
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,880
market might not absorb at this price
you have to accept the responsibility

291
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,170
for an even flow into the market you
have to be in a position to convince a

292
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:22,920
consumer that this product is worth is
this increased priced or and without

293
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:27,360
elaborating on these points I think that
there's no question what there's only

294
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,410
one solution to this problem today as I
see it and that's the National Farmers

295
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:37,050
Organization I think that until farmers
are willing to put their heads together

296
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:40,890
in terms of marketing I don't believe
that there's too much hope in improving

297
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:45,180
the farm situation today thank you ed
and I think you did a real good job

298
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:51,570
summing it up I'd like to touch on what
it really cost not to have the farmer in

299
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:56,280
balance with Reston
it not only cost the farmer it costs all

300
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:02,030
of our total economy fact is a survey
made by the independent bankers

301
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:07,650
organization this is the small banks or
rural banks of America where the new

302
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:12,390
wealth originates they've made a survey
and they prove beyond a shadow of a

303
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:18,810
doubt had the farmers been paid in
balance with the workingman and with

304
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:26,760
interest that our total national economy
would have been 303 billion I said

305
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:32,400
billion dollars more than it would have
been in 1963 in other words it would

306
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:38,940
have been 50 percent higher everyone in
America would have profited by increased

307
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:44,730
farm prices because this price would
necessarily have to raise at all to the

308
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:48,860
consumer
fact is consumers were paying far more

309
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:53,640
for a pound of beefsteak
when we were getting 32 dollars and a

310
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:59,040
half or 32 and a half cents a pound for
our cattle on the hook and we were

311
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:05,970
getting 24 to 25 dollars for hugs then
they were paying far less for food than

312
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:10,830
they are now the Department of
Agriculture shows that while food prices

313
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:16,530
have gone up 29 percent to the consumer
the prices that the farmer received for

314
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:22,050
the same amount went down some 12 to 15
percent so I don't know Coleman who's

315
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:26,460
getting this but I'm beginning to wonder
like you who is it when it will help

316
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:32,310
everybody help the total economy and
help everybody in America who is it that

317
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:36,780
would hold down the farmer what is the
ulterior motives behind it to starve out

318
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:39,690
the family farm in America there's no
question about it

319
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:45,440
now the independent bankers made a
little bit farther study they showed

320
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,460
that if the farmer had been in balance
with the rest of the economy that he

321
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:55,950
would have had twenty one and eight
tenths billion dollars more than he did

322
00:26:55,950 --> 00:27:03,090
receive in 1963 or in other word folks
for every dollar that the farmer got to

323
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:08,690
keep or was able to keep in his business
as income he was cheated out of

324
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:15,090
approximately $2 by somebody somebody
got about $2 that should belong to the

325
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:23,010
farmer now had this happened rural or
business and professional income would

326
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:29,490
have been 11 billion dollars more rental
income would have been 4 and 5/10

327
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:34,890
billion dollars more corporate profits
of America would have been 10 and 4/10

328
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:41,309
billions more in other words forget the
farm income up where it belongs would

329
00:27:41,309 --> 00:27:44,700
cost
nobody anything wouldn't cost anything

330
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:49,679
at all because the total economy would
far more than make it back the working

331
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:55,230
man would get much more income or an
opportunity to work more hours for

332
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:59,789
instance in the loaf of bread the farmer
only receives about 2 and a half cents

333
00:27:59,789 --> 00:28:04,350
of it anyway
so if bread went up 1 cent a loaf the

334
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:08,460
farmer would get 2 or 300 percent more
profit than he gets off in the wheat

335
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:12,840
that's in the loaf of bread
so as you see it costs nobody anything

336
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:17,100
to get the farm price up and it's
costing everybody it's costing them

337
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:21,299
billions of dollars three hundred and
three billion dollars gross national

338
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:27,270
product because they wouldn't let it
come up where it belongs now I wonder why

339
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:33,929
and I would like to say this to you with
all sincerity if you're not opposed to

340
00:28:33,929 --> 00:28:39,690
all this new wealth coming into rural
America at decent farm prices it's time

341
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:44,940
that you begin to look around as these
businessmen have done begin to look

342
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:50,730
around and see and wonder who is causing
the farm prices to be low who is getting

343
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:56,070
this extra money that all should be
available to the farmers and to all of

344
00:28:56,070 --> 00:29:02,070
our economy on an equal basis I think
it's time that we look around now in

345
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:07,710
closing I would like to call on the rest
of the farmers in America to become good

346
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:13,049
businessmen and women and set our
pattern up in a businesslike structure

347
00:29:13,049 --> 00:29:18,850
and operate our business by all except a
good business principles

348
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:23,510
this program today has been brought to
you by the farmers in this listening

349
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:28,820
area and others interested in seeing the
farmer get a fair price tune in again

350
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:34,309
next week for more information and join
the farmers of America to solve the

351
00:29:34,309 --> 00:29:35,000
[music]
next week for more information and join
the farmers of America to solve the

352
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,900
problem thank you
