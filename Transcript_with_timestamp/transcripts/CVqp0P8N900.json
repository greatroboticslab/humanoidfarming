jessie schmidt and I work for the UVM extension new farmer project I'm going to be moderating this evening our presenter tonight is lon de nada que she's a uvm extension food safety specialist londa grew up on a diversified farm in South Dakota and after receiving her graduate degrees worked internationally and food safety for the food and agriculture organization of the united nations londa now works with value-added producers of all sizes in Vermont to improve the safety of their products and to assist them with complying with state and federal regulations welcome londa Thank You Jesse and I have to say it's webinars are great because I can you know Jessie's in the office but I can be home and give my baby a bath a few minutes before and they can then give the webinar after so I'm hopefully the rest of you are somewhere comfortable as well listening to this and hopefully it's beneficial as well and I know that a lot of people also listen we'll listen to the recording as well I know I had a few people asking about that so so ask the questions because then the people that are going to be listening to the recording get some good feedback so so I'll go ahead and get started the first question I have actually I know Eric mentioned that he's from out of state let me see so if you can if you're from Vermont can you check check the yes button if those of you remember how to do that okay see two so if you're from out of state and you can click the no button I guess okay great all right well that's good to just have a little bit of a little bit of idea because so tonight I'm going to talk i'm going to start out with talking about food regulations for the state of Vermont so so Eric and anybody that's listening to the recording later you know these rate you'll have to find out from your state of course what exactly the regulations are but but you know some of the some of the same principles might be true in other states but they could also of course be different so so I'll talk about our regulations here in Vermont and then don't I see sandy is from Vermont too so thank you so I'll talk then i'll talk about federal regulations and that applies to everyone obviously and then and then i'll talk a little about food safety best practices and until you know this the webinar is kind of geared for farmers that you know you might be used to growing you know fresh whole produce and selling threshold produce and now you're wanting to get into selling you know some sort of value-added products and so i'll try to kind of highlight the things that are different between threshold produce and in value added of course a lot of things are the same too but there's some things that will be different so and as Jeff you mentioned that you have questions throughout the presentation please feel free to take feel free to write your questions in the chat box and I can answer them during our I can we might like say to them to the end as well but but if you have a question during the presentation go ahead and write it down before you forget so um so the first thing that I want to start talking talking about Ned's Jessie said I my title is extension food safety specialist and I studied public health and so I'm always interested in a little bit about statistics and how many people actually are getting sick from foodborne illness and and you know so you can see the statistics listed there but the thing is that these statistics are really underreported and the statistics are usually kind of skewed a little bit towards towards large-scale agriculture outbreaks from large-scale agriculture because of the way that you know reporting happens you know if you have diarrhea or vomiting you know not very many of us actually go to the doctor when that happens I know I had it a few weekends ago and I didn't go as a doctor so first you have to go to the doctors and the deck dress to take a stool sample and then there has to be enough people that have that same strain of microorganism for them to be able to say oh I wonder if this is you know this is all from the same same source and so there has to be a lot of people that ate that food products for it to actually show up as being a you know foodborne disease outbreaks so so all that to say that you know people could get sick from from even small-scale agriculture but it just doesn't show up on the radar very awesome because not as many people are eating food made by you know produced by a small local producer but but also I want to make sure I emphasize that products from small-scale producers can be very safe and products from large scale producers can be not safe or they can be saved you know it all depends on your practices so so that's the important thing they really want to make sure that everybody you know understand and obviously those of you that are listening obviously you think support food safety is important otherwise you wouldn't be spending your hour with us tonight so so I'm preaching to the choir so to say input borne illness in you know if you're a generally a healthy healthy adult you know you don't have any major you know major health issues generally speaking foodborne illness probably probably isn't as big of a concern for you but if you're selling to any of these groups that are listed on this slide you know to young people all these children too older people if you're selling to nursing homes or maybe a senior center or you know pregnant women pregnant women are especially susceptible to listeria and because the Syria can cross the placenta and can even cause miscarriage so you know of course pregnant women by you know most products and you know if you're selling to hospitals or anywhere where there might be sick people you know you really have to be concerned with especially concerned with food food safety and so I since I've already mentioned my daughter this is a picture of my daughter about a year ago actually so she's quite a bit older and has more hair here and this is my grandma and when I when I think about the importance of food safety I really think about you know these two extremes that I've you know that you really want to make sure that your product is safe for for those you know for those sort of groups so to start out with you know just generally speaking like if i want to start making salsa i want to start making jams and jellies ors bread or something you know what what regulations do i need to follow anyway so the first question I always ask people is as well if you're just selling in your state then really it's the state regulations that apply so you need to follow your state regulations once you start selling across state lines then you need to pay attention to federal regulations and when you're selling across state lines there's no sighs exemptions no matter if you're selling ten dollars worth of products or a thousand dollars worth of products you have to meet the federal requirements I'll be talking about the Food Safety Modernization Act and some upcoming slides and that could really change things in terms of you know if people if you're only selling in state you might have to might have to fall this food safety modernization act so that that's right now there's rules are in the proposed rule stage and that's from FDA so i'll talk about that in a minute if you're selling your products to grocery stores or coops distributors they may have stricter requirements then then the regulatory requirements so you need to be sure to check with them I know a lot of specialty food producers you know their goal is to sell to somebody like Whole Foods someday and I mean that's it's great you know it's a great market it's a you know a great place to sell your products but they do have really strict requirements they because they have a lot stricter requirements than the government regulation so and even if you're selling to distributors that are selling to kind of larger specialty food stores in larger cities such as in Vermont I know I have I work with someone that sells to the cells to a distributor that distributes in to specialty food stores in Boston and she has to have a hasit plan and some additional food safety plans just to be able to sell them so just check with your buyer to find out what their requirements are again in the state of Vermont to decide sure it's true in most states if you're selling to restaurants you have to follow the state regulation there's no sighs exemptions because the restaurant has to buy products only from an approved source and so I'll talk in a minute about these exemptions that are in Vermont but but if you're selling your restaurants those exemptions don't apply to you and then if you're selling to farmers market selling at farmers markets there's not there's depending on what you're selling if you're selling prepared foods there are some additional regulations and some temperatures that you need to be concerned with I actually did a webinar on this a week or two ago and I have a number of fact sheets as well on sorry regulations that best practices for selling at farmer's markets so i'll have a link to that website at the end where you can find more information on that okay so so i'm going to start with talking about the so as i said i'll start with the state of Vermont and these are the Health Department regulations and those of you that just join I saw Michelle and rac1 joined I asked at the beginning and if you don't mind if you're from the state of Vermont there's a above your name there's a checkbox and there's a green check for yes and a red check for know if you don't mind if you're from the state of Vermont those of you that just joined if you could click yes if you're from Vermont and click the red mill if you're not from Vermont just just so I have an idea of who we're talking to so racy is not from Vermont and that's fine just just wanted to just wanted to check maybe Michelle still finding it okay that's fine all right so so back to the Vermont regulations that again and you're so you'll have to check in your state exactly what el k Michelle is from Vermont thank you so at you'll have to check in your state what the regulations are but in Vermont and you need to have something called a food processors license if you're doing you know jams jellies salsa what else candy those sort of things those off under the food processors license however there is an exemption that if you're selling less okay Tracy's from New York thank you if you're selling less than ten thousand dollars worth of product per year you don't need to have a food processors license so so you don't you're not regulated if you're selling less than ten thousand dollars per year in the state of Vermont and I know that New York is stricter than that and i'm guessing virginia is as well so so vermont it has a little bit more lenient in that regard and just to mention as well if you are selling acidified foods which would be salsas and if you're selling pickles anything that that's kind of a vegetable that's had some vinegar added to it and you're selling it shelf-stable those are considered acidified foods and you have to have what's called a scheduled process for that so if you have questions on the scheduling process I can I can provide you with more information on that so if you're selling baked goods like you know breads cakes etc then you need a bakery license again there's an exemption on so you need that license if you're selling more than 6,500 dollars per year so if you're just doing a few farmers market selling you know two hundred dollars or it will hopefully a little more than that three hundred four hundred dollars worth of baked goods you don't need a license in Vermont if you're selling juice then you need to have a food processors license again if you're selling more than ten thousand dollars so if you're under that you don't need a food processor license for juice if you're selling juice out of state you are required to have a hassle plan which is a hazard analysis and critical control points plan if you're selling in in the state of Vermont they just request that you have a hassett plan that's not really a legal requirement if you are and again half the plans I can provide more information on that if you're interested if you're selling seafood then there's no sighs exemption no matter how much you're selling any sort of you know catching up seafood and processing it or just selling it you have to have a hasit plan you have to follow the regulations okay so all those regulations that I just talked about there as well as the restaurant inspection and then catering licenses those are all under the Vermont Vermont Department of Health then switching over to the Vermont Agency of Agriculture they regulate any dairy products maple especially maple syrup not so much other maple products that's really under the Department of Health eng also regulates pet food so now for all those products there's no sighs exemption so if you're selling twenty dollars worth you have to have a Dairy Dairy inspection license and they have very specific regulations and very in particular it's a pretty stringent you know you can do it you know it is possible to be able to you know to be able to build a facility on your farm but but you know you SS stainless steel etc so the agency of AG also regulates meat and with meat if you if you're selling a product that has more than three percent meat or poultry by raw ways that will fall under the Vermont Agency of Agriculture so if you wanted to make something like a meat pie you know our chicken pot pie or you know something like that and you wanted to sell it you know frozen or refrigerated or something at a grocery store that would fall under the agency of agricultural regulations and meat is quite strict in their regulations you have to have a half-foot plan it has to be quite detailed again that's a hazard analysis and critical control points plan and you have to have you have daily inspection and you again stainless steel and so on so I know that some people you know they feel like well they could just you know do a little value added of their own but it has to be done in an inspected facility again you can you know get the facility on your farm inspected but it has to meet the requirements so so if you're selling and I think probably many of you know about the poultry exemption if you're doing less than a thousand birds per year on your farm you can do it without inspection and again I have some fact sheets that talk more specifically about the meet regulations to get more information and also if you're a producer and you're selling meets you know depending on where you're selling you have to have different licenses to sell alright the agency of Agriculture is also responsible for all labeling in the state of Vermont so you no like your jams and jellies and so on they might be the safety that might be inspected by health the labeling of them is inspected by agriculture in the state and i see your grace's question here so I'll dress it while I well it's fresh in my head do you know how similar these rules and rules of the different departments are for New York and unfortunately i'm not exactly sure i do know that you that New York's rules are stricter than Vermont I don't think you have any exemptions I think my understanding is that you know if you're selling any amounts of food products you have to it has to be inspected there's not those dollar exemptions one difference to is the state of New York does not have a state meat inspection program like Vermont does so all of your meat inspection would be under it would be a USDA inspector which the the requirements really are the same but the thing is your inspector is a USDA inspector rather than vacation Vermont friendly Vermont guys that are that are inspecting your meat product so son Jesse just put a link that has all those fact sheets I was referring to so yeah and I don't know exactly the breakdown between health and AG in New York I'm afraid but but I can find out guys my email will be at the end racy and if you want to send me an email to remind me to look I can I can look for you I can find out ok so in the state of Vermont again if you're wanting to apply for these different state licenses that I talked about rather than giving you all the links in this webinar I just decided to to refer you to this fact sheet that I that I have on I'm 50g requirements for Vermont food processors and in that fact sheet there's you know specific information on exactly what's needed depending on what you're selling and then there's information on how to get the licenses from the health department and from the agency of Agriculture so that links that Jesse put up earlier that you can click on that or this is a shorter a little bit prettier URL listed here and then you just click on food safety for producers and processors and then it's under publications and then you could find this back sheet and the other fact sheets that I've been referring to ok so now I'm going to go jump to the federal level and so this would apply to to everybody in all states across the u.s. so so as I kind of indicated before USDA inspection USDA would inspect meat and poultry products so again it's the same requirement as for Vermont the three-percent meter poultry by rahway anything greater than that is under USDA inspection you're required to have a half a plan and again there's no sighs exemptions and just to mention too that the Vermont meat inspection it's considered equal to USDA inspection but like I said the big difference is in my mind the state inspection that the inspectors are you know are a little bit more a little bit more of an education-focused rather than just a regulatory focus where the USDA inspectors are really having more of a regulatory focus so and i'll get to Michelle's question after i finish i'll talk about the nutrition facts and we'll get to your question um so for meat there's a well relegates is a year old now but a regular requirement now for nutrition facts labeling on unmeet products whole muscle Cutsem and products with more than two ingredients so again I have more information about that in the late labeling fact sheet if you're interested so if you're planning to use the Hardwick food hub hub sorry would you need a license of your own the Hardwick food hub a tent I don't know what kind of product you're interested in they do not you cannot do meet there but you can do all the other products that I've talked about well it they well centrally to cheese there either necessarily but but you can do you know salts and all those sort of things you still have to get a food product if you're doing you know like jams or jellies or sauces salsa etc you still have to have your own food processors license because the processors license is tied to you not the facility however it's very easy to get the license if you're using a facility like the one in hardwick because they're already you know the facility is already passed inspection and they know you know they know the facility the inspector knows the facility very well there they also have FDA inspectors come through so you know even if you're doing FDA that would be fine so so yeah especially if you're doing the in-state license you still need to have your own license okay great yep sauce barbecue sauce and ketchup yep exactly so those sort of products would all be would all be under the food processors license and and again you know it's really just almost a matter of just sending in your money and it's like hundred and something dollars per year for the license and those products probably would not require a scheduled process depending on what kind of sauce you're doing but the barbecue sauce and ketchup would not require a scheduled process okay so FDA regulations again like I mentioned before there's no sighs exemption so if you're selling you know ten dollars worth of products across state lines you have to have it you have had you have to be registered with the FDA and I'll talk about that in a minute but you have to follow the after your requirement so FDA really they do you know processed foods and baked goods like like I talked about earlier with the Department of Health in Vermont FCA also does dairy products maple syrup pet food those are all things that are regulated by the agency of Agriculture here in Vermont but in in SGA they're regulated by them sorry it's a federal level of regulated by FDA I don't know if anybody from New Hampshire is on but i know that in New Hampshire dairy products are regulated by the state health department there and I'm not sure about New York off top of my head FDA also regulates seafood and fruit juice and again they require you to have a hash of plan alright so so they mentioned if you're selling products out of state then you have to you have to be registered with the FDA and so the steps for that our first you have to get your licensing from the state of from the appropriate Vermont Agency so even if you're selling less than ten thousand dollars worth of product in the state of Vermont and you're exempt from the state requirements if you're selling out of state then you still have to get the proper licensing from the state of Vermont because that's the requirement for FDA's to have the proper state licensing first so with FDA well with state of Vermont I kind of alluded to it it's you know you have to pay a register a licensing fee like 115 dollars or something you have to you know send them your money yearly with FDA it's free at this point they're talking about having user fees but at this point it's free you just register online I didn't share the link right now but I have it in that fact sheets of food regulations actually that I mentioned earlier you you're required to reregister your facility every two years it's in the fall of the even-numbered years so 2014 in the fall you should reregister the just want to keep track of everyone keep their list current the FDA might come and inspect your facility once you register with them on average I've heard at national average FDA inspects your facility once every approximately seven years because there's so many food processing facilities across the u.s. of FDA's meant to inspect they just can't get to everybody if you're considered a higher risk facility like if you're doing cheese or something they'll come a lot more often than once every seven years but you know no guarantees all often will come so the FDA requirements are you have to meet what's called the Good Manufacturing Practices and I'll tuck that's what I'm going to be talking about in the next section are basically good manufacturing practices kind of best practices and you can find those good manufacturing practices they're available in the Code of Federal Regulations title 21 part 110 and i found FCA's URLs are really usually really long so usually the best way to find them rather than me giving you a long URL is to just just google that and you'll be able to find them there we go okay so here's as I mentioned earlier FDA has some proposed rules on what's called the Food Safety Modernization Act and there's a proposal on produce safety as well as a proposed rule on what's called preventative controls and preventive controls is basically for food processors these proposed rules they're still in the comment period it looks like the comment periods going to be extended until like September which is good to give us more time to look through them and make some comments and it'll be a few years before processors would need to implement them however I'll talk about the next slide it's a good idea start thinking about it now and to start moving towards moving towards it whether you're going to be exempt not because we don't know what the final rules are going to say in any case so and you know anyway I have it the next slide so i'll save it till the next slide oh and the other thing i wanted to mention to while i'm talking about it as i mentioned at the beginning I wanted to kind of highlight the differences a little bit the differences between produce safety and processing safety with produce it's currently if you're selling produce in the state of Vermont there's absolutely no regulations for you know the safety and produce that you're selling your so if you're selling you know your fresh tomatoes and carrots and whatever at the farmers market fresh whole you know tomatoes and carrots and peppers and all those things the only regulatory requirement is that the product has not been exposed to flood waters so so you know for produce growers these proposed FDA rules are a big game changer because you know they haven't had regulations before people doing value-added products you know they're more used to regulations and you know people are kind of aware that they need to operate under regulations but it's only that's a big difference between you know if you're just selling threshold produce versus selling value-added products then there's a lot more regulatory control so so on the preventive controls proposed rules for FDA the Food Safety Modernization Act you can see there's a number of exemptions and I apologize that it's small font but it's just to kind of to show that there's a lot of exemptions but they're a little bit confusing and so again I have a fact sheet that that lists these in more detail and again everyone different people kind of interpret these proposed rules a little bit differently and the thing is we don't know exactly what's going to come out in the final rules anyway but but at this point it looks like small processors would be exempt from following the FDA a revised requirements but but you'd still have to follow the state regulations one thing that's kind of interesting is food hubs and people that are better commingling produce from multiple multiple growers they would they would fall under the preventive controls requirements if there's if they're storing they're having warehousing of the products you can see that one's listed at the bottom there so that's something important for food hubs and anybody doing kind of you know commingling of products from different farms to keep in mind so if you are going to be covered by the preventive controls rules if you're not exempt from them is what would you need you would need to have a written food safety plan which is similar to a half the plan I touch I checked by half with a little bit of hazard analysis and critical control points so this preventive controls plan would require you to do monitoring and have records and corrective actions for ya ok so this preventive controls would require you to monitor and have records and then corrective action plans for your food allergen controls and also for your sanitation of your of your plants our of your facility and then we clear recall plans in hasit plans you have to go through and identify where the biggest hazards are and where you're most critical control points are in your process usually those are like in a cooking step or a chilling step and then you have to keep track you have to do monitoring you know of the temperature of the time you know and keep records of that so that's in a typical hasit plan but this preventive controls plan you would have to have that as well as doing monitoring and record and so on for four items that are typically in half the plans are considered prerequisite programs so those those food allergen controls and sanitation so on so so preventive controls are kind of language the FDA uses used in the Food Safety Modernization Act to talk about you know that the places where you can best prevent foodborne foodborne illness from potentially resulting from your process so it's super magic controls could be cooking could be chillin it could also be no sanitation plans that sort of thing so the other thing with the preventive controls rule is is that they're updating the Good Manufacturing Practices and I talked about those earlier and we'll talk about them in a minute the language will be updated a little bit too but but it's not a major update really but so those good manufacturing practices and again that's we'll talk about next are really important whether you're covered by the new requirements or not so and again if you're not going to be covered you know if you are going to be exempt from if you're small enough producer if you're if you're selling lower risk products and you'd be exempt you know why why is this important why do I keep talking about it well here in Vermont the state is talking about updating its regulations and right now as I mentioned the state of Vermont food processing regulations are relatively loose compared to other states so so they really want to so they're talking about updating those to have Heather be stricter to kind of match the FDA's requirements and you know whenever there's a new regulation that comes into place buyers very often also increase their requirements so so the bar is kind of raised for everybody and then buyers might also quite have stricter requirements so so it's something again to keep your eye on okay so if you're exempt to the federal level how does that differ from the state GMP so if you are exempt from the Federal Food Safety Modernization that specific Modernization Act requirements then basically you just have to follow the state your state food safety regulations and then in addition you have to make sure that the name of the facility where you process the product is on the label which which is already really essentially a requirement of labeling and then you're supposed to notify the FDA you know that you're that you're operating under that small business exemption but again we don't know exactly how the final rules are going to they're going to shake out so that's that's what we that's what our interpretation my interpretation is of the proposed rules at this point does that answer your question Tony or if if you're looking for something else just just maybe you can ask another question too and I can clarify okay I'll I'll keep going here is it Tony if you have another question feel free to let me know so some other steps to starting it again and these might be a little bit different in your state but generally speaking these these are the steps I'm sure in every state but this for sure in Vermont you need to do these things so you need to make sure that you check with your town or city clerk for any local zoning restrictions and any licensing permitting that they might have so just to make sure that you're following their requirements it's important to get a state food processors license here in the state of Vermont they require that you first talked to the Department of device sorry the Department environmental conservation to check on the wastewater facility or the wastewater plan they don't necessarily require that you have a new you don't have to necessarily put in a new septic system they might say you know you're set with your current septic system is fine but you do have to check with the Department of Environmental Conservation so that's something that's important they do also require that you check with the Department of Public Safety to make sure that you're following the electrical and fire and plumbing codes so in order to get your state food processors license you have to be in compliance with the Dec and the Department of Public Safety you also need to check with the tax division unfortunately I didn't say that but you have to check out the tax division to make sure you're doing your tax requirements properly and then you probably want to protect the name of your business so you might want to register it with a secretary of state to protect your your awesome name that you have for your business and this lake down here has more has the lakes to all these different websites that's the department of health food and lodging program website down there alright so I've been talking about these best practices and so now I'm going to kind of going to finish up with this so again these best practices are I mean generally speaking this is what the state of Vermont's food safety requirements are for food processors and also I guess I haven't listed down here also this is generally speaking the FDA's requirements so I'm going to talk about these best practices kind of in general terms but again if you look up you know the FDA's good manufacturing practices you can get the more specific details and the state of Vermont to you can find the specific regulations that are required so these Good Manufacturing Practices that's that's the terminology that da uses in in the regulations and they're just they're the basic sanitary and processing requirements that are needed to just make sure that you're processing safe foods so they're to me they're just they're just best practices you know they're a good idea for everyone to follow whether you're exempt it or not whether you're required to meet regulations or not being on and this is yeah like it says here this is what's needed to to meet the current and the future state and federal regulations and this is both for USDA and FDA so if you're doing anything under if you're doing the meat processing the USDA also requires that you follow good manufacturing practices so again I've been mentioning half the plans if you are required to have a hasit plan that has the plan requires that you have these good manufacturing practices in place so so they're really important again I have a fact sheets that kind of you know gives a nice or give a two-page overview of good manufacturing practices it might be helpful for you okay so to start out with and in it and I just want to emphasize to that a lot of these things are probably common sense and in again if you're kind of going from being a you know produce grower or some sort of a producer on the farm to doing food processing a value-added processing a lot of these things are kind of common sense but and some of these things might be things you're already doing but but some might be a little bit different there might be some new things to think about with food processing so so again I'll just talk about them so for buildings and facilities when you're doing food processing and value-added processing you just want to make sure that the grounds are free of weeds you have the drainage you know the facilities you have to have cleanable surfaces good ventilation and lighting you know the FDA these regulations they don't really specify you know the specific surface is that you need to have just that they need to be cleanable so that kind of makes it more general again hand-washing facilities needed water just kind of fold basic things I guess your equipment and utensils you have to make sure that you're using but they're that they're of a sanitary design again cleanable materials is important you know make sure that its food grade materials would grade equipment that you're using and and then the set the equipment is you know installed and maintained that you can easily clean underneath and behind this isn't a great picture but you can see that these carts are on wheels here and so that you know they can be moved easily I guess these are excels really so then you can clean underneath the shelf and below that are behind the shelf more easily than if it was tied to the ground personnel again this is this is the same as if you're doing produce raising threshold produce on your farm you know you have to make sure that no one is working sick you know think about all the germs that are spread if you're sneezing and just you know everybody has to use good hygienic practices you're doing value-added production you need to wear hair restraints you know eating and production again these are kind of common-sense things okay that one area that's kind of again kind of different from just straight production to value-added processing then you really need to think about your raw material and your your raw materials coming in and your suppliers that you're using you need to have some sort of a system in place to make sure that your the raw materials that are coming in and the suppliers that you're using that you know that that those materials are safe because your product is only as good as the ingredients that go into that and then you know of course even if you're buying produce from your own far are using produce from your own farm i should say you know you want to make sure that that's the best quality safest material that it medic that it can be um so you know especially if you're getting in ingredients from from other places or your own farm of course you want to have some sort of inspection procedure you know for incoming low as making sure that everything is you know meeting the your requirements and and and that you're also just having good you know good handling and good storage once those ingredients get into your your facility where you're doing your processing okay so then when you're actually processing you know we make sure that your whatever ingredients are coming in first that you're using those first again kind of common sense and then another important point here they have a date and log incoming products I think I have a slide later where I talk about traceability and recall a lot tracking that's something that's going to be even more important under these new new Food Safety Modernization Act requirements so that's so it's really important when you do get in ingredients that you're dating dating those ingredients in keeping track of what ingredients are coming in and you know just making sure that you're storing your materials in a safe manner you know making sure that that everything is as good temperature control those are all important okay sanitation is super important as everybody ensures is is well understood you you want to make sure that your sanitizing everything properly your washing everything and you know to again once you get up to the higher levels of food safety programs and the stricter inspections you have to have everything documented of what you're doing for cleaning you know if you're just using if you're just operating under a you know just a state of Vermont food processors license they don't require you to document your your sanitation standard operating procedures but again once you start getting to the higher levels you need to have that documented it's just a matter of writing down you know step one take apart the mixer step to spray it off step three you know wash it with a brush that sort of thing but it's also a good way you know if you have a new employee you can you can show them like okay here's our slps or standard operating procedures for washing and then that easy way to train people another point I wanted to make is that it's important to have make sure that you're doing we should have a schedule to kind of make sure that you're all cleaning the coolers cleaning the hallways these areas that you don't have to clean every day but you do need to make sure you clean them periodically you know weekly monthly whatever is appropriate for your facility okay allergen control this is something that's really important again under the Food Safety Modernization Act but also it's really important for because so many people are sensitive to allergies these days people are really aware of allergens and you really want to make sure that you're paying attention to this because you're a lot of your customers are so you can see the eight major allergens that are listed these are the ones that you're required by law to list on your label and also to alpha to monitor in your facility so here's the main points for allergen control you know make sure that your raw materials are properly label to distort make sure you know where your allergy and container ingredients are in your facility so just you know again kind of some common sense things but but just it's really important to keep to be aware of allergens okay pest control this is another another thing again that's probably this is similar again to you know if you're growing produce or if you have animals obviously you don't want pests everywhere because you know they're not good for production and they're not good for processing either so you really want to just make sure you prevent any of those pests from getting into your facility but then you know if you can't get them if they do then you want to make sure they don't have anything to eat while they're there and then if you have to exterminate them that's the last resort okay chemical control it's also very important to make sure that any cleaner sanitizers lubricants all those things that are in your facility that are not they're not actually ingredients you want to make sure that they are properly labeled that they're stored you know away from the food and that you're using them at the right amount you know if you if you think a cup of sanitizer is is good well two cups is better that's unfortunately not true if a cup is what's required you use a cup that's it okay another program that you have to think about is blast control you know if you're sometimes you know if you're using glass glass jars you know for your packaging then it's pretty obvious like oh I got to make sure I I don't have breakage of Blass but also you know everybody has light bulbs almost over it because light bulbs in their facility so you want to make sure that those light bulbs are covered and you want to make sure that you know that that you know where all the glass is in your facility and then you so you can prevent any breakage from occurring and even if you can't prevent the breakage from occurring at least you can detect it like you know where to look for glass breakage I mean nobody wants to have a piece of glass end up in there beautiful sauce that they're selling to people ok so I think this is the last category of these sort of things i'll talk about foreign materials again you know nobody wants to see a nut your bulbs or you know a person knife or you know a piece of wood or a chunk of plastic you know we don't want to see those in our food products and see so there's a lot of potential sources you can see them all listed here how these pharma shows can into your food product so in order to control them you want to make sure that you're doing good visual inspection when you're receiving the products to receiving the raw material sorry that you don't have you know chunks of wood and your carrots or something like that or big rocks or something and you know when you're adding ingredients to the mixer make sure that you're watching that there's no you know chunks of stray things coming in and just practicing you know good hygiene and good housekeeping those are all important things but just things to keep in mind and like you've been having a pen in your coat pocket your if it's a lab coat if you lean over that pen could fall in and you don't want to penn ending up in your products okay i mentioned earlier traceability and recall again this is something that's really of growing importance and it's important that you know you need to know where your ingredients came from you need to know who you bought them from you need to know which ingredients went into every batch of your product and then you need to know where your products are going because you know we hope that everybody is producing say product that you never have to issue a recall but if you do you need to know where your products are going and what could also happen to and maybe more more likely is that one of the ingredients that you use like maybe your salt or maybe your you know whatever is your starter culture maybe that's recalled and then you have to know what batches thats all to that starter culture went into so that you can recall that final product if you need to so you need to have an accurate documentation of your receiving of your ingredients of your lot coding systems you have to know you have to document your distribution where your products are going and I can I can provide you with examples of this receiving log if you're interested and here's that here is the distribution record example and Jesse your question is an excellent question you asked about if there's any good software programs that help with lot tracking are they affordable actually thank you for prompting that because the Vermont farm viability program is actually sponsoring a project right now on a lot tracking and they did a survey I'm not tracking to find out what people are using and and they're looking into and the guy's name is Stan Ward that's organizing it and he's also looking into all the different like software programs that are available there's a number of them available you just told me today I think that's that we found like 27 different programs or something unfortunately all those well some of them are definitely more affordable than others for those lot tracking software and so one of the outcomes of that project is intended to intended to make sure that there's you know hopefully a provision of a affordable and easy to use and you know appropriate to scale lot tracking system so yeah great question and yeah you can buy really expensive programs to Tony yeah link is that a link for the those records that i was talking about the distribution and receiving records I can't send I can send a link for those if you're interested okay so the other prerequisite programs wrapping up here you know we hope that nobody will have any complaints because the you know of course your products are going to be great but it's if there is a if you if you do ever get complaints you really need to log them and track them that way you can find out you know if you need to make any corrections to your system labeling is also really important i mentioned labeling a little bit in the presentation i do have a fact sheet again on labeling and i do workshops and so on and labeling as well so that's important too and then the food defence and security prevention of intentional contamination that's also something that's kind of growing importance and so yeah i'll follow both of the slides and i'll address Tony's question there so this additional information so you can see I have a number so there's some upcoming trainings and then these fact sheets that have been talking about the number of links to different places are available here from this URL that's listed Jesse's also listed in the chat box a few times then I just want to mention Vermont has a food safety task force that we're trying to get more quickly to information from all different aspects of vermont in one place there's my contact details so if you have any specific questions or any information that you want me to be sure to provide you you can send me an email or give me a call and tony a link for the software for the tracking at this point like i said there's like twenty seven different software systems so I don't have I don't have all those links readily available but I can send you again if you send me an email i can send you at least this the report of the slot tracking project that's going on and and hopefully the final product the final results of the project will be out soon as and then we'll have then we'll have that information more readily available as i can give you the guy's name is doing that project too and he can probably give you all those links pretty easily so with that I'm sorry I see it's two minutes to eight but I'm happy to take any questions in the remaining time that we have londa thank you so much you covered such a wealth of information here in a short period of time and it's nice to have this all in one place now so this recording is going to be available on the new farmer project website as as well as a PDF of this presentation so you can go back and reference it later that should take about usually takes about a week to get up on our website and if there are any final questions go ahead and type them in otherwise thank you all for joining us this evening and londa thank you so much for taking the time to be with us looks like there's one question yeah and are you too many colleagues in New York londa that are working on this in a similar type wine yeah yeah Cornell actually I go to I called Cornell quite a bit for questions there Cornell is great especially on scheduled process stuff like so if you're doing canned foods they're they're great on that sort of thing it's the Cornell food venture center Elizabeth Sullivan and the person i always ask questions too they don't do quite as much in maybe like farmer's market food safety that sort of thing but but yeah they have a lot of great expertise there all right great well I hope that you will take a minute to give us some feedback and Lante have a good evening thanks again and we will be having our next webinar the last Tuesday in May seven pm and it's going to be focused on fencing so please join us for that if you are interested have a good night everybody you you",
