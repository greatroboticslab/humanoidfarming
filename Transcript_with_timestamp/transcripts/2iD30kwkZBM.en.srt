1
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:15,320
uh we are uh back in the field again and

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,279
I think it's uh3 days after sewing now

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,480
although we had some rewing and

4
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,320
replanting so it's not quite accurate

5
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:25,560
because we have quite a few places which

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,400
we planted later so and that creat a

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,880
challenge now because we somehow need to

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:34,280
figure out uh when to harvest this field

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,600
and uh there are various ways to do this

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,120
and we have an expert here with us today

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,320
Martin gut who is our post har

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:45,239
specialist and also leads the E program

13
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,680
for so we'll ask him for help to help us

14
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:50,960
determine where we are and what we do

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,640
next okay so there as aim said there are

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,600
different ways to determine whether the

17
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,079
crop is ready for Harvest so uh the

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,680
easiest is basically to look at the

19
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:02,359
color of the grains so if you have 80%

20
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,720
of the Grain in a panicle colored straw

21
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:07,240
yellow then that's an indication that it

22
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,400
should be should be right another way to

23
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,119
to determine whether uh the crop is

24
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,799
ready for harvesting is look at the at

25
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,560
the hardness of the grains and the the

26
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,880
grains in the bottom of the panicle

27
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,520
should be in the hard do stage so when

28
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,960
you when you basically open the Grain

29
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,880
and you look at it it should still be a

30
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,079
little bit soft but not too soft like

31
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,720
like uh when you make a hot dough for

32
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:31,880
for cooking so when you squeeze it you

33
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,320
you your nail should probably cut the

34
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:37,320
grain rather than than mash it up so to

35
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,640
speak it should not be brittle yet so we

36
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,200
start with a visual estimate of of how

37
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,840
ready the crop is and we we we first

38
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,479
look at the the proportion of yellow

39
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,439
grains the proportion of straw yellow

40
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,799
grains now Martin has suggested an ideal

41
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,240
amount for Harvest would be 80% yellow

42
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,520
now in front of me here we always have

43
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,399
an issue as to whether it's

44
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,960
representative or not it's

45
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:03,560
probably 50 to 60% yellow something of

46
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:05,960
that order it's not quite ready

47
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:09,399
yet now a more objective and

48
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:11,440
professional way to assess how uh how

49
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:14,160
ready the crop is we'll be to measure

50
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,959
its moisture content yep and this is one

51
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,080
way to do that this is a moisture meter

52
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:19,879
So-Cal moist meter it measures the

53
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,360
resistance of the crop which is uh

54
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:24,319
basically dependent on the moisture

55
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,560
content and you have a small sample tray

56
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:30,800
so you take a a sample from a panicle at

57
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:34,640
least at 80% of the of the GR should be

58
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,560
St yellow that basically says 80% of one

59
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,000
panicker getting representative is

60
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,480
always a challenge there's almost no is

61
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,879
a challenge

62
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,959
all so so uh you take a small sample

63
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,159
like this fill it in there and then uh

64
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,200
what you do with this instrument

65
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:49,920
basically you crush it oops can I give

66
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,200
you

67
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,560
thisx it you you turn the knob and crush

68
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,879
it turn it all the way to the end and

69
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,400
then uh you measure the resistance and

70
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:02,120
that gets translated in the reading of

71
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,280
the moisture conted and this case it's

72
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:07,120
21.6% and what we're going to do is mix

73
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:09,080
The Greener one I've I've I've harvested

74
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,720
and because this is a way small sample

75
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:14,080
it's not really representative neither

76
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,599
for small plot nor for the field so what

77
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,159
you have to do is you have to in one

78
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:21,000
location you should do different at

79
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,000
least three different

80
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:25,959
measurements so now in this sample for

81
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,599
example you have a lot more green grains

82
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:31,760
than in the previous one so the reading

83
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:31,760
should be a lot higher

84
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,519
27.9% and you would take at least three

85
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,040
samples and then you have a button here

86
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:45,560
where you can average the readings and

87
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,959
then you get the average reading for

88
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,720
that uh location and then what you have

89
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:51,760
to do is basically also measure in a

90
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,879
representative way in the field because

91
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,120
the the crop doesn't mature evenly

92
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:57,920
everywhere in the

93
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,680
field we're facing the final tricky

94
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,360
decision to irrigate or not to get

95
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:06,519
irrigate that is the question so we're

96
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:11,280
considering how moist the soil is now

97
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:13,799
how moist is the soil now moist

98
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,560
right we're considering what the

99
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:20,120
weather's like what's the weather like

100
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,360
hot dry and we're considering how long

101
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,560
we'd expect until we Harvest and our

102
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:28,520
consensus is about

103
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,240
10 days to 2 weeks something of that

104
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:33,280
range it'll be close to to two weeks

105
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,639
time before you're back to do the

106
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:40,160
dude so we need this to last to to

107
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:44,600
finish properly I think it needs the two

108
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:46,320
weeks but it's moist it's heavy clay and

109
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,919
we do want our combine to stay on the

110
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,240
ground not to explore the

111
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:54,600
underground I

112
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,600
vote keep it

113
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,720
dry yeah I would have if it was an

114
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,240
experiment and I knew that we would be

115
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:05,280
doing hand harvesting I would put on

116
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,919
another irrigation just for safety but

117
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,400
we need to figure out that we have to

118
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:11,320
come in with a comine and so the

119
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,039
carrying capacity of that soil will be

120
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,680
the deciding factor and we can't delay

121
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:18,319
Harvest because we see some lodging

122
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:22,360
coming in so I'll go with the majority

123
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:24,319
wot yeah I agree so no more irrigation

124
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,639
let's see but I pray for a little bit of

125
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:28,000
rain tonight

126
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:30,319
maybe well on RAC and patterns I think

127
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,400
you'll probably have that have that wish

128
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:35,360
granted so there we have it we won't

129
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,400
irrigate again and we'll it'll be in

130
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,080
approximately 2 weeks we'll come back

131
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,080
and harvest about May

132
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,680
2nd
