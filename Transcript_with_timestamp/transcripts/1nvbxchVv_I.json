  "text": "well hello my name is Don tipping I'm here at seven seeds farm which is where we run Siskiyou seeds where we grow about 700 different open pollinated organic fruits vegetables and herbs for seed to distribute all over the world and today I wanted to share how I start tomatoes and peppers and eggplants a man my greenhouse it's late March in Oregon we started on these heat mats here which are you can get at most garden centers and they just boost up the temperature so because our heat mat space is limited I like to instead of starting my tomatoes and pots I started in these these little furrows here and I'll demonstrate that in a minute the equipment I'm using here is we call this a 10 by 20 because it's ten inches by 20 inches and then inside of here I put it one that doesn't have all these holes so it can hold soil and so you can see that's what I've got here this is filled with potting soil that we made on the farm out of compost there'll be a link to another video of how to make potting soil in the comments but pretty much it's composts and a little bit of eggshells and help or you could obviously by potting soil and why you want to start these heat-loving crops on heat mat is because they germinate quite poorly in cool temperatures and right now it's probably about 50 degrees outside and these seeds one about 70 to 80 degrees so with an electric heat mat I can ensure those temperatures so I'm going to demonstrate one right now of how I do this and we save pretty much all around tomato seed I get these coin envelopes before that and you can get these at office supply store I wanted to share a few little details of how I label it tomatoes chestnut chocolate 18 I always write the year of see to know how old it is because that helps you with your seed saving so I open the packet I put a little bit of crease crease in there so as I tap it it helps the seeds to line up and give me more precision how I can tap them into this little furrow I've made I'm planting about 40 or 50 seeds in there you get about an ounce of seed per tomato plant you know I'm growing per seed but if you're just growing for your garden you're not necessarily concerned with that I know stamp those in a little bit and then I take some loose soil and cover up my little furrow I'm aiming to get them about a quarter inch deep I found it's not actually super crucial half inch to quarter inch works and then on a popsicle stick I am going to write chestnut chocolate for the variety name I know it's a tomato and at this point in my gardening life I can identify them and I write the date on their March 27th so if I'm feeling a little impatient about the seeds coming up I know when I planted them and I can tell if there's a problem or not so I'm going to show you in this tray here I planted Yankee bell peppers so this is a little bit farther along this was March 7th so 20 days ago i seeded these in here on a heat map and you can see some coming up here and they you know obviously they were planted quite close together you wouldn't want to let them grow in these open flats very long it's more just something you use to get them sprouted with heat so then I'm going to separate them out one little plant here and then this is the size I like to use for peppers you can see I'm filling up this little pot snug it in there we'll do another one just so case you missed anything it's pretty simple I generally hold seedlings buy the leaves instead of the stem because the plant can regrow leaves it can't regrow it stem in case you were a little bit rough with it tuck it in there and that's it these will grow up to be really nice it starts in these and we'll plant them out probably around June first tomatoes I use something about twice as big like something like this would work well we also have some that are a little deeper because tomatoes are just more vigorous growing so you can see with this method I can really concentrate growing a lot of starts in a small amount of space and you know make the best use out of my heat mats so I hope this was helpful and you learned something that you're able to put into action and improve your success at starting tomatoes eggplants and peppers from seeds you can use the same technique for all of them and I'll put a link again in the comments of our website for accessing seed and we have a free ebook on growing a hundred square foot garden and all that you need to know and the link to that will be in the comments as well so I wish you all the best and your growing efforts and may we grow a world of good peace",
