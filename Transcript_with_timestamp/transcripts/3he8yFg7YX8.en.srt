1
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,040
the most common question that we receive

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,040
in our extension offices across the

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,280
state of wyoming

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,840
is what type and how much fertilizer

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,960
should i put on my garden and landscapes

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,600
it's a question that i particularly hate

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,920
because i always like to be right

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,080
without a soil test i really can't

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,080
answer that question

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,559
in this 20-foot raised bed i've already

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,040
taken two samples and i'm going to take

12
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:35,040
a third

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,920
and put it in a bucket

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,360
i'll then take that bucket

15
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,040
and i'll mix it up

16
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,840
really well

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,160
i of course have sampled the top four to

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,719
six inches

19
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,280
i want to dry this soil out

20
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,399
wet soil doesn't travel well through the

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,360
mail

22
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:00,640
i'll then take a quart bag

23
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,640
put my sample in it

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,159
i don't want any

25
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,000
plant material or

26
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,439
organic material i really just need the

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
soil

28
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:14,080
well then put that sample in the mail

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,560
and send it off to the lab

30
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,799
if you need any help with soil sampling

31
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,040
techniques or where to send your soil

32
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,560
contact your local extension office

33
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,360
there's a really great scene in the

34
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,960
movie men in black where tommy lee jones

35
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,640
has a little spoon tool and he just

36
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,920
picks up some soil and hits a button and

37
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,159
it tells him everything he wanted to

38
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,520
know about the soil i've always wanted

39
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,280
one of those

40
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,320
but until i can find a store that has

41
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,000
one

42
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,360
the way i get the information that my

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,040
soil has

44
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,200
and what my plant needs are is to send

45
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,079
it off to a lab and get that information

46
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,439
back

47
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,200
