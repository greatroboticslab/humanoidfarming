1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,480
my name is mark morgan from clarksville

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,359
johnson county

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,360
we're here at peach picking paradise

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,440
we grow peaches about

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,799
25 varieties

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,599
spread out uh

7
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,400
over

8
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,480
about seven weeks or so of harvest and

9
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,160
uh today we're going to be answering

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,720
some questions about peach production in

11
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,720
arkansas

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,720
okay so the first question is uh you

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,120
know there used to be a lot more peach

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,280
orchards in arkansas uh maybe how come

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,200
there there aren't as many uh around

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,879
today you know there used to be a lot

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,399
more peach orchards around i remember

18
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,480
even just growing up there there was

19
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,120
more orchards in the state

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,079
i think it's a combination of things

21
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,480
you know

22
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,480
it's a very difficult crop to rely on

23
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,879
cash flow there's good years and bad

24
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,920
years and it's it's very difficult from

25
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:58,399
a financial standpoint to keep that even

26
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,719
the other thing is labor we still do so

27
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,199
much with peaches as far as hand

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,040
harvesting hand proving uh you know

29
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,560
thinning it's a lot of shoulders and

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,560
elbows

31
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,640
as far as you know the mechanicalization

32
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,960
as you know tractors things like that

33
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,040
they have in the row crop side

34
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,200
we haven't got as much of that in our

35
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,360
industry and so it's uh you know finding

36
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,840
labor at the right times is uh is

37
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,560
definitely a challenge

38
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,400
all right the next question uh

39
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,000
how long uh will a peach tree bear fruit

40
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,280
uh you know

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,960
if you're going if you're planting in

42
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,240
the ground that hadn't had peaches on it

43
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,600
you know you really should be able to

44
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,920
get 20 years maybe even or more

45
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,439
out of that tree as far as us we've been

46
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,119
in commercial production kind of on the

47
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,200
same soils for a while we're we're

48
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,680
really shooting more for that 15

49
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,840
uh just because uh it's had so many

50
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,159
peaches on it in the past but uh you

51
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,399
know really 20 years or longer you know

52
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,799
if you take care of it it'll it takes

53
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,840
about that third year uh to to really

54
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:03,520
start producing them but uh but yeah 20

55
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,520
15 20 years in arkansas

56
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:07,200
[Applause]

57
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,759
all right our uh

58
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,680
our next question was kind of uh

59
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,280
you know as far as uh peach what the

60
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,160
what the calendar looks like what we're

61
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,080
doing uh certain times a year uh we

62
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,360
usually start we're in bloom now

63
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:24,160
obviously uh but we usually start uh in

64
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,599
january doing pruning we prune january

65
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,440
february

66
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,200
hope to be done before bloom we've got a

67
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,640
little bit left here

68
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,400
but that's really whenever we're coming

69
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,319
in and pruning

70
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,920
if we're lucky enough to have a you know

71
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,599
this is the time of year we start really

72
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,160
looking for freezes we want to avoid

73
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:42,720
those to have a crop you know april may

74
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,800
june sometimes you can have two full of

75
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,879
a crop where a peach will put on way too

76
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,040
many peaches that it could stand so we

77
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,440
have to come in and thin that

78
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,160
then there'll be harvest season uh of

79
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,920
course irrigation you know uh mowing

80
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,239
around the trees keeping the weeds down

81
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,000
stuff like that and then in the fall

82
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,120
after we're done harvesting we come in

83
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,040
uh do some uh do some work to to really

84
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,040
get ready for the next year's crop as

85
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,120
far as uh you know looking for peach

86
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,200
tree borers spraying uh

87
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,280
and and really uh helping that tree have

88
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,319
the best setup it can be for the next

89
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,400
year

90
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,959
so when is the peak peach season in

91
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,159
arkansas uh you know in arkansas we can

92
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,480
grow peaches june july august uh really

93
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,959
even september to october

94
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,400
most uh mostly for us it's july you know

95
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,959
we start uh

96
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,599
mid-june and really go through august

97
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,280
but uh july you know we try to be going

98
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,200
by july 4th

99
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,080
we've got the peach festival in johnson

100
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,159
county the third week of july july is

101
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,239
really whenever we get going

102
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,799
here in clarksville

103
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,959
all right the next question is uh

104
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,799
what it uh why do peaches have fuzz or

105
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,920
what is the uh the peach fuzz on the

106
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,799
peach uh

107
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,519
the the fuzz really is a a defense

108
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,680
mechanism you know it keeps uh certain

109
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,680
insects uh from either you know

110
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,480
traveling over the fruit or laying eggs

111
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,920
on it so it's really uh it's a helpful

112
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,000
thing to in in defense of some insects

113
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,080
we uh you know if you look at the some

114
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,920
of the newer varieties the old-timers

115
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,599
used to talk about all the fuzz you know

116
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,239
being in the air and the packing shed

117
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,519
and

118
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,040
i think the newer varieties have a

119
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,440
little bit less fuzz on them than they

120
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:25,199
used to uh you know there's also the

121
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:27,520
nectarine and nectarine uh is a peach

122
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,199
you know pretty much it

123
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,360
on the inside it is it just does not

124
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,840
have fuzz on the outside

125
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,150
it has a recessive gene that doesn't

126
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,080
doesn't put on fuzz so

127
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,199
[Applause]

128
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,520
all right

129
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,000
our next question uh the difference

130
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,880
between uh freestone peaches and cling

131
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,160
peaches uh so on a peach

132
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,600
you know it's gonna have the stone or

133
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,919
the seed in the middle you know a

134
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,080
freestone would just break right off the

135
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,520
off the seed the the first freestone

136
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,720
really developed commercially with the

137
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,240
alberta

138
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,600
since then they've developed tons of

139
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,280
free stones

140
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,919
a lot of people prefer the freestones

141
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,440
but we also you know the cling you can't

142
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,120
just break it apart it's going to stick

143
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,039
to the seed but a lot of the cling

144
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,880
varieties we grow have a pretty big

145
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,280
following and that people would come you

146
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,960
know just specifically to get that cling

147
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,479
uh you know if you're just cooking with

148
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,320
it or whatever the free stone may be a

149
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,000
little bit easier uh but if you know

150
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:23,039
what you're doing with the cling and uh

151
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,560
really uh are used to that you know more

152
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:28,080
traditional taste

153
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,160
it has a big following as well

154
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,199
the next question

155
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,560
is uh can i plant a peach pit and grow

156
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,800
my own tree

157
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,800
uh yeah you can't you can grow a tree

158
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,800
from a pit the issue is is uh all of our

159
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,639
uh peach trees are grafted so you know

160
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,520
they have a root stock and then the

161
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:50,160
variety grafted onto it so it's kind of

162
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,479
a hybrid tree so the the seed you plant

163
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,080
you're not going to get exactly you know

164
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,280
what kind of peach it came from there's

165
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,199
going to be a little bit of variance

166
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,440
there but yeah it will grow a tree you

167
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,600
can you can get a peach tree from a pit

168
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,919
so do animals like deer and squirrel

169
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,759
like to eat peaches yes

170
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,520
yes and no

171
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,160
we all you know we have to have a deer

172
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,639
fence uh we've got so much deer pressure

173
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,880
that uh the deer don't necessarily eat

174
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,600
the peaches as much as where they really

175
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,680
hurt us as they eat the leaves

176
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,360
especially on younger trees they can

177
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,720
come through and just you know eat all

178
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,360
the leaves and then all of a sudden you

179
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,280
don't have any leaves the tree's dead

180
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,199
squirrels that they're gonna you know

181
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,000
you'll see squirrels going out and

182
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:34,000
taking ripe peaches out all the time uh

183
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,600
you know our our theory on that you just

184
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,280
got to grow more than they can carry out

185
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,880
they're going to get their share

186
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,720
got another question about like how do

187
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,319
you keep insects off

188
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,759
your peaches well it depends on the time

189
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,800
of year you know this time of year we're

190
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,720
in bloom

191
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,960
we don't want any insecticides or

192
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,280
anything we've got our bees working

193
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,960
now later in the year whenever you start

194
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,199
getting closer to harvest

195
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,199
we have to keep a pretty routine spray

196
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,000
schedule to keep

197
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:02,479
keep insects off of the fruit

198
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,199
you know your local county extension

199
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,840
agent uh can provide all kinds of uh

200
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,440
spray programs and things like that uh

201
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,000
it's uh you know something that you kind

202
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,720
of need to stay on top of but you also

203
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,160
you need to do scouting to go out uh to

204
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,599
see what your issues are because

205
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,840
sometimes you may go out and you may not

206
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,759
have any issues sometimes you may start

207
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,280
uh you know seeing the development of

208
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,520
something that could turn into a bigger

209
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,280
issue so you know scouting and uh and

210
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,759
contacting your county extension agent

211
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,759
would be uh my recommendation all right

212
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,080
and the final question uh why don't

213
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,400
people say uh that they're feeling

214
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,560
peachy when they're feeling happy uh you

215
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,800
know i really don't know that's uh

216
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,039
you've always heard that or peachy keen

217
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,560
or all that stuff

218
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,400
you know i just know that uh you know

219
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,199
when it's harvest season and and we've

220
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,759
got fresh fruit uh out here and it's you

221
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,919
know it's from an arkansas peach orchard

222
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,840
uh and they can taste it you know i

223
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,240
think to me that's what feeling peachy

224
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,000
is you know it's just that fresh uh you

225
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,440
know hadn't been processed it's just

226
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,639
right there and fresh and that's sure

227
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,000
hard to beat

228
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,319
and so uh we're looking forward to

229
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,639
having a good uh good crop this year so

230
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,199

231
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,520

232
