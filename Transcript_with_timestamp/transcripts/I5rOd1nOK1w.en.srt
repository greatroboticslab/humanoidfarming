particular can be detrimental to plant

170
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,440
growth it's best to let tap water sit

171
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,639
out for 24 hours to allow the chlorine

172
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,160
to evaporate or use a water conditioner

173
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,240
to remove it use filtered or rainwater

174
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,080
instead these options are free from

175
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,080
harmful chemicals and provide a more
