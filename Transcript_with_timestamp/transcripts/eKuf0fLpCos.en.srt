00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,920
welcome to ndsu extension

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:08,320
that's north dakota state university

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,840
extension

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:15,040
we provide our programs for everyone

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:18,480
today's program is background in cattle

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,480
fall 2021 a series for cattle producers

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,480
looking at backgrounding their cattle

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,519
today's talk will be feeds alternative

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,519
feeds and costs of gain by carl hoppe

10
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,359
extension livestock specialists located

11
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,599
at the carrington research extension

12
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,399
center part of ndsu

13
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:37,040
our new crop calves in 2021 are on the

14
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,120
ground and are being presently weaned

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,079
and the weather has changed and we're

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,879
looking forward to a new feeding season

17
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,879
of course that brings challenges so that

18
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,280
um we have to consider what happened

19
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,199
last year and i always have to comment

20
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,960
that our feed prices continue to follow

21
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:55,280
the corn price

22
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,600
and it might even be higher because of

23
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,199
the drought that we had in 2021 as you

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,680
can see in this picture our corn crop

25
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,280
was pretty small and people even turned

26
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,960
cows out on their field just to have

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,080
something to eat

28
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:11,360
and it's been a challenge for us cattle

29
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,040
producers in north dakota but we move on

30
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,840
and i'd just like to go a little walk

31
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,840
through history here

32
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,200
in 2017 our corn prices were actually

33
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,799
less than three dollars a bushel and

34
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,240
that drug the rest of our other feeds

35
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,080
down as well

36
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,560
alfalfa hay was eighty dollars a ton

37
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,520
grass hay was at 65 wheat meds or around

38
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,640
95. uh we had barley malt sprouts at

39
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,759
that time 115 or corn prices around 3

40
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:41,840
30 a ton the canola mills of 186 a ton

41
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:44,880
and dry distillers was on par at 113 per

42
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:48,000
ton all based off the corn price that

43
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,799
was in 2017 and near um

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,399
four

45
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,560
years ago

46
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,399
so now uh let's or five years ago now

47
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,159
let's look at what happened in 2018

48
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,560
prices remained almost the same 2019

49
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,560
corn price moved up a little bit maybe

50
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,560
30 40 cents and all the rest of the

51
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,879
feeds increased accordingly in 2020

52
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,640
feed prices remain somewhat the same so

53
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,360
just when you think you've got a trend

54
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,959
going here of years of lower feed costs

55
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,360
for cattle

56
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:20,239
2021 shows up and our price of corn is

57
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,239
575 a bushel that's because of national

58
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,560
demand not because of the local drought

59
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:28,239
just because the national demand now

60
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,080
alfalfa hay has increased up to 175

61
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,280
dollars a ton in some places it might be

62
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:37,840
200 250 a ton depending upon the quality

63
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:40,879
of the alfalfa um grass say is a 128 125

64
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,239
a ton uh wheat middlings 190 soy hauls

65
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,560
is a new product available in north

66
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,160
dakota because the processing industries

67
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,599
are making it more available and there's

68
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,080
more of them in north

69
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,560
in the north dakota region and it's

70
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,920
being priced at 165.

71
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,159
uh corn silage uh 55 a ton just because

72
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,760
our corn price has gone up canola meal

73
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,400
is surprisingly somewhat constant from

74
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,480
previous years but dry distillers grains

75
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,080
has increased correspondingly just like

76
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,599
the way corn has

77
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,080
so this year our feed costs have

78
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,080
increased

79
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,519
drought makes it a difficult year

80
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,840
and we have been struggling for feed for

81
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,000
cattle producers that were out of feed

82
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,239
they probably sold cows they weaned off

83
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,319
calves early fed them early this

84
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:28,799
particular program really focuses on the

85
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:30,879
fall weaning cows the ones that

86
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,200
scraped by with enough feed

87
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:36,239
worked on their harvest and now that the

88
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,239
weather has changed somewhat in november

89
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,799
weaning is now progressing on these

90
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,560
april mayborn calves

91
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,799
one thing i got to note in north dakota

92
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,920
is that we have a lot of different crop

93
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,680
processing plants across the state

94
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,080
we have

95
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,519
corn distilleries for making ethanol

96
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,040
which creates the byproduct corn

97
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,360
distillate grains

98
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,480
located throughout north dakota as well

99
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,519
as

100
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,599
into south dakota north dakota also has

101
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,640
quite a few wheat mills wheat middling

102
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:09,280
or wheat mills for making wheat mids

103
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,360
located in grand forks carrington minot

104
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,680
fairmont

105
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,439
i always have to point out that our the

106
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,000
state mill and elevator in grand forks

107
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:20,560
is the single largest mill in the world

108
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,639
in one location that just underscores

109
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,400
how much wheat mailings are produced on

110
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:29,000
that plant and mostly shipped out of

111
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,000
state uh we have uh

112
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,840
sugar uh factories uh

113
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,600
processing

114
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,040
across the state

115
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,880
mostly in the red river valley but some

116
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,440
out in sydney montana

117
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:45,360
these particular

118
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:47,040
plants produce uh beet pulp usually wet

119
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,479
they can also produce beet tailings but

120
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,479
a lot of that's being now moved up to

121
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,960
grand forks to the ethanol refinery

122
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,880
that's specifically made for uh

123
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,280
fermenting uh the sugars out of beet

124
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,759
tailings and of course we have a couple

125
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:03,840
of potato processing plants and we have

126
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:06,080
a wet corn milling facility down at

127
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,160
wahpeton we just have a plethora of

128
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,160
processing co-products available in

129
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,840
north dakota a lot of those are being

130
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,400
shipped out of state but we do have some

131
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,479
local demand and there create an

132
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,479
opportunity for us for cattle feeders in

133
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,560
north dakota

134
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,880
i said earlier here's a description of

135
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,360
what we actually have we got five plants

136
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,880
produced distillers grains we have five

137
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,199
mills to produce wheat mint leaves we've

138
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,080
got one in-state plant that produces soy

139
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,160
hulls

140
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,960
uh we have one plant that produces corn

141
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,120
gluten feed these are all high moderate

142
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,400
protein thirty anywhere from eighteen to

143
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,120
30 protein

144
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,120
soy haul's around 12

145
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,280
and these are all have a highly

146
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,360
fermentable fiber all the starch has

147
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,960
been removed for the most part and

148
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:53,039
what's left over is fermentable fiber

149
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,280
we do have like i said beet tailings and

150
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,280
beet pulp and we do have a wide variety

151
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,120
of meals available like cannoli meal

152
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,120
linseed meal sunflower meal corn gluten

153
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,360
meal and soybean meal

154
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,199
available for feeds if we need protein

155
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,800
addition to the rations

156
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,120
these are all co-products these are

157
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,000
things that are produced by our plants

158
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,199
of course we have protein sources

159
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,080
on our

160
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,759
that we produce on farm like soybeans or

161
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,400
alfalfa hay

162
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,639
or sunflowers those are all

163
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,880
filled peas and lentils are all play

164
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,120
things that can produce protein as well

165
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,440
as energy on farm and should be

166
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,360
considered in a ration

167
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,440
screenings just a word of screenings be

168
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,759
careful if you're bringing in screenings

169
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,960
from out of state the type of weed seeds

170
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,560
they might have

171
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:43,120
things like palm or amaranth

172
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,680
could be in those and you can definitely

173
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:49,840
start a problem on your feed yard

174
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,840
if you're feeding that type of feed

175
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,080
and allowing weeds to grow in the future

176
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,639
let me just make a point here about our

177
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,960
daily nutrient costs i received an email

178
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,360
this morning that talked about

179
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,520
uh how high the protein content was in

180
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,759
his creep feed and wanting to have

181
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,440
exceptional gains in his calves and

182
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,240
while protein's important the most

183
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,960
important part is the energy cost

184
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:18,400
we spend more in energy costs per day

185
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,400
than we do protein costs it takes energy

186
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,240
preventable fiber starch

187
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,479
even some proteins are metabolized free

188
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,360
energy takes energy to put growth on an

189
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,360
animal

190
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,960
so if we just look at things in general

191
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,160
say that i did some math here it takes

192
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,240
around 14 pounds of edm which is a

193
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,680
measurement of energy content

194
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,400
to uh

195
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,400
put weight gain on a 700 pound steer

196
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,680
uh this would cost about a little over a

197
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,960
dollar a day in pro in energy costs look

198
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:50,720
at protein costs there would be well

199
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:53,280
almost a dollar a day however we don't

200
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,039
pay for all the protein we buy the

201
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,000
energy first and then a lot of protein

202
00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:00,400
comes along free for in other words

203
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,639
corn is nine percent protein we buy the

204
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,199
corn for the energy content but we get

205
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,840
nine percent protein basically for free

206
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,639
so we need to do is buy additional

207
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,120
protein to boost up that corn so it has

208
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,599
enough protein to maintain the gain we

209
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,080
want there's a lot of words to say but

210
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:20,400
really we're feeding that type of ration

211
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,879
we need to provide another six tenths of

212
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,199
a pound of crude protein and if we do

213
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,639
the math cost per pound of protein at 42

214
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,240
cents that means we need to provide an

215
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,639
extra 25 cents

216
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,039
a day in protein costs so it costs a

217
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,279
dollar a day for the energy

218
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,919
and another 25 cents for additional

219
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:40,560
protein and then of course that pales to

220
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,800
the water cost and be all means that's

221
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,120
water cost per day

222
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,279
please

223
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,880
consider your water quality and water

224
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,800
availability that's some of the cheapest

225
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,120
gain you can have on a in a particular

226
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,800
cowherd

227
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,880
i'd like to look at some math here when

228
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,399
it comes to feed value

229
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,399
we've got four different feed stuffs

230
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,240
canola meal wheat meds corn grain and

231
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,640
distillers grains

232
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,519
um colonel mill is known for its crude

233
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,200
protein at 38 wheat meds is 17 percent

234
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,240
corn is low at eight and a half percent

235
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,399
distillers grains is around 26.6 percent

236
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,519
or almost 30 percent on the dry matter

237
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,959
basis

238
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,880
they all have different energy

239
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,200
calculations

240
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:24,959
um distillers grains is actually high

241
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:27,120
since it's got uh some fat in it

242
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:30,399
more than what corn grain would

243
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,760
and uh the rest of these feeds all are

244
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,760
you know

245
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,000
not considered zany's resources like

246
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,800
corn is there's different costs so we

247
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,320
see canola mill is 255 a ton which

248
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:45,519
hasn't changed wheat meds are now up to

249
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:47,839
190 corn grain at 206 and distillers at

250
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,360
230 dollars a ton so if we're looking

251
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,800
cost per pound

252
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,200
our cheapest feed is going to be this

253
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,240
year wheat mids look at cost per pound

254
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,560
of protein our cheapest feed obviously

255
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,480
is canola milk that's what we buy it for

256
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,880
is for its protein but if you look at

257
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,800
cost per pound of energy

258
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,440
our cheapest source again is wheat

259
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,760
middlings although corn and distillate

260
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,200
grains are ranked right in their side by

261
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:15,279
side as being somewhat competitive

262
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,440
as an energy source that's why distilled

263
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:20,079
grains is used as high percent a lot of

264
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,079
our rations

265
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,480
please let me talk about feed issues for

266
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,000
fall 2021.

267
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,079
our biggest issue this year is how

268
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,600
drought affected our feeds nitrate

269
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,519
accumulation

270
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,000
has occurred

271
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,800
may have decreased but be sure to test

272
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,640
your speeds for nitrates the forages the

273
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,399
grains you don't need to but the forages

274
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,160
certainly do the co-products probably

275
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,800
don't need to measure those as well but

276
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,640
any forage that you were raised on farm

277
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,640
should be tested for nitrates this year

278
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,600
and if it's over 1500 parts a million

279
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,920
nitrate nitrogen it should be decreased

280
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,399
it should be diluted with other feeds

281
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,600
that are lower nitrate nitrogen

282
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,200
high nitrates can lead to

283
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,519
basically death

284
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,399
and in pregnant cows it can lead to

285
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,200
aborted fetuses so nitrates are not to

286
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,920
be

287
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,600
ignored when it comes to rations be sure

288
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,399
to do a feed test to find out where

289
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,079
yours are at and try to feed under 15 so

290
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,160
the average of the ration delivered to

291
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,240
the cattle is under 1500 parts per

292
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,880
million nitrate nitrogen if you're using

293
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,560
a bell ring then your haze and that bell

294
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,079
ring should certainly be

295
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,760
under that fifteen hundred parts per

296
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,160
million nitrate nitrogen for calves or

297
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,320
otherwise i know some calves prefer to

298
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,640
eat grain and not come over and eat

299
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,240
uh prefer to eat hay and not eat grain

300
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,839
and of course if the nitrate nitrogen

301
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,279
was quite high

302
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,519
and that's all they're eating you would

303
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,399
end up with death loss

304
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,839
so

305
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,519
the other thing a person should do is

306
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:51,519
sample feeds for feed just for

307
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,079
for doing a feed analysis

308
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,720
a feed test on them

309
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,560
with the drought there's been a very a

310
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,399
lot of variability in the type of feeds

311
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,480
we have out there so

312
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,639
uh feed testing is always important this

313
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,320
year it's a big deal some guys have been

314
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,480
putting up hays or forages that have a

315
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,720
lot of weeds in them try to limit that

316
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,800
to your calves just because intake is

317
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,720
driven by palatability some of these

318
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,360
weeds aren't very palatable and calves

319
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,160
may not eat them of course so

320
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,680
uh our corn seemed to mature for people

321
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,959
that were actually able to get corn

322
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,880
grain that seemed like it was a heavy

323
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,279
test weight so that'll ensure that

324
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,839
there's uh some good energy content in

325
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,920
our corn uh for guys that put up uh corn

326
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,160
silage early because the drought and the

327
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,000
plants just not grown there is a higher

328
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,279
percent water in them so be sure to do a

329
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,600
feed test so you know what type of

330
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:42,560
moisture content is added so we can

331
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,200
adjust the dry matter uh consumption

332
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,200
accordingly

333
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,079
actually dry matter is going to remain

334
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,680
the same but we'll have to increase the

335
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,240
amount of corn size based on the higher

336
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,399
water content

337
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,639
as i mentioned earlier

338
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,959
our hays are highly variable between

339
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:02,959
fields when it comes to feed tests so

340
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:04,880
using book values or even just one test

341
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,760
on one particular load of feed just

342
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,200
really doesn't show what's what could be

343
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,360
out there so there's a lot of

344
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,200
variability out there encourage you to

345
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,399
feed test and know what you have

346
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,600
especially when you're trying to do

347
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,600
rates of gains for calves

348
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,079
our feed costs are quite a bit higher

349
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,000
this year i talked about that earlier

350
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,079
it's 70 percent higher compared to the

351
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,240
last few years

352
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:31,680
um availability appears to be okay

353
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,720
however

354
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,480
if you're in demand for quite a bit of

355
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,079
feed should probably figure out how to

356
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,120
get that

357
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,959
locked up

358
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,560
some places might need a contract other

359
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:45,360
places might need money paid for the

360
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,720
contract up front to guarantee supply

361
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,880
but this year

362
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,320
having it on hand might be the best

363
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,120
route to make sure you actually have the

364
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,680
feed

365
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,519
big costs and freight is always an issue

366
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,360
when you're hauling feed around but this

367
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,680
year with the feed transportation

368
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,720
programs available within north dakota

369
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,160
and the usda there might be some subsidy

370
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,399
going on there

371
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,800
or help in paying for the transportation

372
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,880
costs for things bought outside the

373
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,320
normal

374
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,079
grain is high

375
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,079
that's not a localized drought demand

376
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:18,480
that's a national demand and of course

377
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:20,240
whenever grain prices go up hey prices

378
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,560
go up as well but when you're in a

379
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,320
drought hey prices because of how

380
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,600
difficult they are to transport long

381
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,440
distances

382
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,120
uh they go up as well so that becomes a

383
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,680
big challenge

384
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,760
on trying to find haze at a reasonable

385
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,160
price for feeding cattle i'd like to go

386
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,720
through some rations now

387
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,800
i've got 12 different rations to discuss

388
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,720
in this particular slide if you look at

389
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,639
these rations we first start off with a

390
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,639
grass hay supplemented with some wheat

391
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,600
mitts we're looking at two pounds a day

392
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,680
gain

393
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,279
um it would take around 13 pounds of

394
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,399
grass hay and supplement seven pounds of

395
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:59,120
wheat meds and it would cost a dollar 48

396
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:02,480
per day with a feed cost per pound to

397
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,320
gain at uh 74 cents

398
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,000
now if you want to pick up our gain from

399
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,839
two pounds up to 2.6 pounds we're going

400
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,320
to have to throw in a little alfalfa hay

401
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,399
for the protein and energy and increase

402
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,160
the wheat meds up to 10 percent also we

403
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,480
have to increase the calcium in the

404
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,079
ration and we did that with the alfalfa

405
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,079
a

406
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,560
well our feed costs went up another

407
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,680
extra 20 cents a day because of this

408
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,560
ration

409
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,079
but our feed cost goes down 10 cents per

410
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,839
pound again

411
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,000
now the same thing holds true when we

412
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,680
start looking at using grass hay and

413
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,639
wheat mids at a higher amount at 12

414
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,560
pounds

415
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,000
we're looking at 2.8 pounds per day gain

416
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,680
we have to include the limestone to

417
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,880
offset the high phosphorus content of

418
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,880
wheat mids

419
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,279
and

420
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,120
you'll see that it costs almost the same

421
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:49,279
as the previous ration with two tenths

422
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,880
of a pound better gain which means our

423
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,720
feed cost per pound of gain actually

424
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,639
went down you'll see this in the next

425
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,199
slides too where feed costs

426
00:15:54,639 --> 00:16:00,160
go down as our

427
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:02,079
gain increases now remember on this

428
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,920
particular ration we're talking a dollar

429
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,839
66 a day let's look at some other

430
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,079
rations now

431
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,399
here's an alfalfa corn alfalfa hay corn

432
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:13,040
silage ration you got the king of

433
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,880
forages in in corn sides and the queen

434
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,120
of forages and alfalfa hay they'll blend

435
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,959
to do together at that amount could give

436
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,959
at eight pounds alfalfa hay and 29

437
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:23,519
pounds of corn size you get 1.8 pounds

438
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,880
per day average daily gain uh it'd cost

439
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,279
you a buck and a half a day but your

440
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,639
feed costs are at 83 cents now if you

441
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,040
have a little corn grain in there and

442
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,800
some wheat meds uh take out the corn

443
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,320
sides you put in alfalfa hay so six

444
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,639
pounds of grass saved four pounds of

445
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,480
alfalfa hey two pounds of corn and eight

446
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,320
pounds of wheat man so give you 2.6

447
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:44,000
pounds per day gain 65 cent cost to gain

448
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:47,040
1.69 boy that's very similar to that

449
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,720
other ration that was provided earlier

450
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,320
now if we go with one that looks for a

451
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,759
little bit better average daily gain at

452
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,040
three pounds

453
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,519
um

454
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,720
we'll find out that uh

455
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,720
where you're feeding four pounds of

456
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,480
grass hay four pounds alfalfa six pounds

457
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,759
of corn grain and six pounds of wheat

458
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,920
mitts in other words we went from two

459
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,919
pounds of corn grain up to six pounds

460
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,160
our feed costs went up accordingly to a

461
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,319
dollar eighty but our feed cost per

462
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,959
pound a gain is now the lowest at five

463
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,959
ninety six

464
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,480
another action we have here is just a

465
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:22,400
dry ration of alfalfa hay and corn grain

466
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,000
13 pounds of alfalfa hay with seven

467
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,439
pounds of corn grain

468
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,400
gave us a 2.3 pounds per day gain 77

469
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,799
cost to gain a dollar 86 per day oh

470
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,120
that's getting kind of expensive well

471
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:37,840
now let's look at a ration that we don't

472
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,760
have much for grass hay or other feeds

473
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,600
we're just going to use alfalfa and corn

474
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,039
grain and when we're feeding that amount

475
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,960
of corn grain we have to provide an

476
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,799
additional protein supplement and a

477
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,880
bagged feed works quite well for that

478
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,880
3.2 pounds per day gain which has pushed

479
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,120
these calves along pretty good our cost

480
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:57,280
of gain is 6.96

481
00:17:53,120 --> 00:18:00,640
at 69 cents which is uh competitive but

482
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,720
our costs per day are now 230. 230 2.23

483
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,320
cents again we're over three pounds a

484
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,919
day gain now if you want to increase

485
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,240
that gain a little bit higher and feed

486
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,160
less alfalfa and more corn grain

487
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,600
are at three and a half pounds per day

488
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:15,440
gain uh we're going to end up with our

489
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,440
two and a quarter per day feed cost

490
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:21,039
which is just a couple pennies more

491
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:23,600
for uh the 3.5 average daily gain versus

492
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:27,039
3.2 and our feed costs are the lowest of

493
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:29,760
six point at 64 cents per pound to gain

494
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:33,600
things to remember feet cost decreases

495
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,559
energy increases excuse me as the grain

496
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,080
uh

497
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,240
increases in the orac should say the

498
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,840
average daily gain of the rash of that

499
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,679
provides from the ration is increased

500
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,360
well okay now let's look at grass hay

501
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,679
with a little bit of distillers grains

502
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:50,400
to be added as protein and energy

503
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,000
now this is a 1.7 average daily gain

504
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,720
only it's the cheapest is a buck and a

505
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,679
half a day but our feed cost is at 82

506
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,360
cents

507
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,120
now if we put a little corn into that

508
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,559
ration at four pounds and take out some

509
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,880
of the hay we're going to get 2.8 pounds

510
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:05,919
per day gain

511
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:09,440
1.73 a day is what the cost is with a 61

512
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,440
61 cost gain

513
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,200
definitely workable but not our one of

514
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,640
our cheaper rations

515
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,080
if you want a little bit better gain at

516
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,640
3.4

517
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,799
uh we're using grasshay corn grain

518
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,240
distillers grains and limestone 3.4

519
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,480
average daily gain

520
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,640
find out this is one of our lowest cost

521
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,200
feed per cost to gain

522
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:32,160
and at a dollar 86 per day and that's

523
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,240
3.4 in the earlier slide we're at three

524
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,120
we're above threes and it was over two

525
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,280
two and a quarter a day for feed costs

526
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,120
so in this particular example you can

527
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,880
see that going from just a little bit of

528
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,360
corn grain up to a little bit more and

529
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,160
just changing the dynamics of the ration

530
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,240
really improved our feed conversion or

531
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,640
increased our average daily gain quite a

532
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,720
bit just a small difference of adding

533
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,880
three more pounds of corn grain and

534
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,799
taking out the grass hay and of course

535
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,480
we had to include limestone to increase

536
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,640
the calcium content of this ration

537
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,799
because this tillage grains is high in

538
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,840
in phosphorus and corn grain is high in

539
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,840
phosphorus as well

540
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,600
let me just make a few comments on rate

541
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,840
of gain goals

542
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:21,039
if we're looking for oil roll

543
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:23,200
ascending cattle to the grass market

544
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,480
making stockers out of these cattle

545
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,559
backgrounding them at less than two

546
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,240
pounds per day gain

547
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,000
that's what we call low rate of gain

548
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,039
medium rates again usually two to three

549
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,960
pounds

550
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,799
i like to call these as your grow cattle

551
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,799
without adding extra fat to them or

552
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:39,039
putting on condition they just have a

553
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,640
nice growth and frame once you go

554
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,159
brighter than three pounds per day

555
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,559
average day of the gain

556
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,159
if you do that more than 45 60 days

557
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,240
you're going to end up with

558
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,120
calves that add a little bit more flesh

559
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,039
to them

560
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,799
and when that happens you may reduce

561
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:56,159
subsequent feedlot performance and

562
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:58,720
cattle buyers know that so they will

563
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,799
discount accordingly however if you know

564
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,640
the genetics behind the cattle they can

565
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,799
do this type of game without any loss of

566
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,600
performance you need to know

567
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,880
what what you're buying and know this

568
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,120
best way to do that is know the

569
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,360
historical performance of cattle and go

570
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,360
that direction

571
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,679
if

572
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,000
you're going to feed cattle i always

573
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:24,720
encourage you to target the gain with a

574
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,039
balanced ration

575
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,720
said earlier as you increase the protein

576
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,320
and energy you get better feed

577
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,919
efficiency and better average daily

578
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,240
gains

579
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:37,039
so one of my examples here is to if you

580
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,360
want three pounds a day for 60 days

581
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:40,960
that'd be 180 pounds or we can do it a

582
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,760
different way and that is we want to get

583
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:46,640
a pound and a half day gain for 120 days

584
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,559
it really depends upon what your market

585
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,240
weight and date is going to be and how

586
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,159
you wish to feed cattle sometimes

587
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,760
there's changes in the market

588
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,640
that allow you to

589
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,799
uh

590
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,120
run cattle at a lower average daily gain

591
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:01,919
to pick up a higher price so even though

592
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:04,080
the feed costs might not be as efficient

593
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:07,840
the market gain will more than offset

594
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:10,480
that and provide an opportunity for you

595
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,640
and if this is all home raised feeds

596
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,919
then again the cost might be quite a bit

597
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,559
lower than it would be if it was

598
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,799
purchased out on the uh market just

599
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:21,520
opportunity cost would be uh what you'd

600
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:23,360
have to consider that

601
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,960
always like to have people think about

602
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,960
co-products and i talked about where

603
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,880
they're located in north dakota if you

604
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,200
need an info sheet of

605
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,600
where they're sourced at and prices and

606
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,280
phone calls to call please contact your

607
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,120
local county extension agent they should

608
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,480
have a list that i put together that

609
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,320
they can

610
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,440
provide to you that's your local account

611
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,760
extension agent in north dakota

612
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,720
if you can contract fees usually there's

613
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,080
summer lows that you can work around

614
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,159
anytime you have to haul at long

615
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,840
distances that really reduces your price

616
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,360
competitiveness

617
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,080
although this year with the

618
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,799
transportation assistance program that

619
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:03,760
might make a little bit of difference on

620
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:06,400
what your cost might be

621
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,799
usually we look at high fiber

622
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,880
high fiber and actually they're

623
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,720
good in protein as well when we

624
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,559
background cattle things like wheat meds

625
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,240
and distillers grains work quite well in

626
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,480
a background ration for adding a little

627
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,440
extra protein and since it's not starch

628
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,679
baits

629
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,360
they provide extra fiber in the ration

630
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:26,720
as well which can somewhat limit the

631
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,720
gain that we're looking for

632
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,360
always encourage you to do a great job

633
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,120
of feeding management that means feed

634
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,200
bunks that don't have too much feed left

635
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,120
in them but aren't empty as well provide

636
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,120
some bedding on cold days that'll make a

637
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,559
nice environment for calves we've got

638
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,240
research of the carrington research

639
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,480
extensions and other shows that does

640
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,480
affect your feed efficiency and marbling

641
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,480
in cattle uh depending upon how big

642
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,480
they've been then how their environment

643
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,320
is while they've been growing

644
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,559
clean water is always a must if you're

645
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,480
going to put calves on feed

646
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,480
please try to reduce the amount of moldy

647
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,520
feeds you have so that might discourage

648
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,600
intake

649
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,360
obviously healthy calves grow better

650
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,919
than sick calves

651
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:08,080
try to look at ration changes slowly use

652
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:10,000
step up ratchets as an example

653
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,480
be sure to balance the ration for the

654
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,159
weight gain for the weight and type of

655
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,760
cattle that you have

656
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,640
and of course like i said earlier

657
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,760
consider your rate of gain goals calves

658
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,279
that gain

659
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,039
3 pounds

660
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:24,799
per day gain

661
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:27,520
may not show any discount at the

662
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:30,000
marketplace while other groups of calves

663
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,440
might please consider the type of calf

664
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,640
when you're looking at your rate rating

665
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,000
goal

666
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,159
if you're trying to improve feed per

667
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,919
gain with cattle look at ionophores

668
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:40,159
that'll increase your income your

669
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:43,039
improvement that'll improve the feed

670
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,960
efficiency by five to seven percent uh

671
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,720
the omniforester mints and the bovita

672
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,720
the trade names

673
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,039
you can use implants do the same thing

674
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,720
five to seven percent unless you're

675
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,640
an increase in average daily gain and

676
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,120
your feeding feed efficiency will

677
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:00,000
improve seven to twelve percent

678
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,760
if you're not in a natural program

679
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,960
implants work well

680
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,960
and there are feed uh

681
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,600
additives like her medicine bovita

682
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,200
declinate chloride that can control

683
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,240
coccidiosis

684
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,039
so

685
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,279
if you've ever had coccydiosis outbreak

686
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:19,120
in a cow in a calf crop you'll certainly

687
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:21,440
want to avoid that at all costs because

688
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,960
that can certainly ruin your your growth

689
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,000
and feed to gain when you have a

690
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:29,039
coccidious outbreak and coccidiosis is a

691
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,120
stress related disease so coccidity are

692
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:33,279
always in cattle but when there's enough

693
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,880
stresses they can come pathogenic then

694
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,640
you end up with your bloody scar issue

695
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,799
or nervous coxy issues and of course

696
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,480
those can be real problems in a feed

697
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:42,559
yard

698
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:46,400
just like to summarize here that this

699
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,400
year we've got higher feed prices

700
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,360
it happens every year though but that's

701
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,039
higher average daily gains usually have

702
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,360
lower cost per pound of gain be sure to

703
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:57,200
consider what feeds you use

704
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,880
because there's lots of different

705
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,720
options out there and as i did earlier

706
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,200
on some of these examples some of these

707
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,919
feed costs are priced quite a bit lower

708
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,559
so sometimes a corn grain ration is not

709
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:11,279
your cheapest average daily gain or cost

710
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:13,520
per pound again

711
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:16,400
it might include a curl pro

712
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,400
a co-product

713
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,960
obviously co-products are high in

714
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:23,039
protein and fiber and can help

715
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,320
are a nice addition to a ration you

716
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,000
start feeding too much though you'll

717
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,159
have to make sure the ration is balanced

718
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,480
for calcium phosphorus just because the

719
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:33,679
high phosphorous loads

720
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,679
concentrations that are in co-products

721
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:38,960
and of course good management always

722
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,960
leads to great calf gain
