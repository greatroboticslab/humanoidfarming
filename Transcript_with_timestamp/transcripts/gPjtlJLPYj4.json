  "text": "hello folks and welcome to today's webinar uh the role of farms in decentralized composting uh I'm Linda bilson's brolis of the institute for local self-reliance composting for Community initiative and we're your hosts for this uh webinar but also joining me now is my colleague at issr Megan Matthews she'll be helping uh keep it helping us keep the webinar running smoothly say hi say Hi Megan hi everybody Welcome awesome all right so while we're waiting to uh for folks to finish joining um are you all hearing that feedback I'm gonna go ahead and turn off my video just in case okay so uh for those of you that aren't familiar with our work um issr is composting for Community initiative is advancing composting to reduce waste enhance local soils create Community Development opportunities and to protect the climate our focus is to catalyze distributed food waste composting options that include home community and on Farm scales and we work to promote locally based composting in a number of different ways uh we convene a national Community composter Coalition and host national uh cultivating Community composting forums we work one-on-one with communities through technical assistance and policy support we produce reports infographics and various templates for composting sites uh we host regular webinars and even a podcast we also have a map that shows initiatives around the US and the policies and programs that are advancing composting at this scale and uh Megan will be at adding some links to the chat for you to check some of that out but you can also find uh all of these resources on our websites uh if you go to il.org composting you'll see a composting resources dropdown menu on the right hand side of the screen and from there you can select reports podcasts webinars and more uh we also offer Technical Training through our neighborhood so Rebuilders composter training program and for anyone that's interested in more training on uh the composting science uh we released a self-paced online community composting 101 certificate course uh we released that earlier this year uh the course covers composting fundamentals and the ins and outs of starting a community-based composting project so if you're interested check it out there uh this webinar series is being brought to you through our involvement with the million acre challenge of which ilsr is a founding member the million acre challenge is a collaborative project that is supporting farmers in implementing healthy soils practices and regenerative agriculture on 1 million Acres of Farmland in Maryland and the Chesapeake region by 2030 healthy soils uh healthy soils practices including the skillful production and use of compost on farms uh have tremendous potential to improve Farm resilience and profitability while also providing critical ecosystem services at a crucial time for our farms and our planet to learn more about this project check out website and now uh let's get to know each other with a few interactive polls all righty so first question where are you participating from select one of the following Northeastern us Southern us Midwestern us Western us or outside the US right and let's see the results so as usual majority from the northeastern us but we got a good showing from the midwestern us um and even good representation from other parts of the US and outside so welcome to everyone uh let's go to the next poll what best describes your affiliation select one of the following are you a farmer a composter uh someone who represents a government uh are you a researcher Farm service provider or nonprofit or are you in uh a different business just a few more seconds all right let's check it out so very nice even mix of farmer composter a little head uh a lead to the government folks and a researcher Farm service provider and nonprofit I know that's a big category other business so welcome to you all and the final poll that we'll do are you currently involved in composting or supporting compost in your work and the second answer is supposed to be no not now okay just a couple more seconds great let's check it out so vast majority are already either composting or involved with composting so welcome to you all and for those that are not currently doing it uh hopefully this presentation will inspire you to to get involved awesome thanks Megan so um now uh as we hand over controls to our first presenter uh a few housekeeping notes um everyone is in listen only mode uh we will have time at the end of both presentations for question questions uh but go ahead and enter any questions you have as they come up in the go-to webinar control panel box on your screen this webinar is being recorded and a copy will be sent to you within the next day or so so no worries there but now it's my pleasure to introduce our first presenter Florian amlinger he is an a agronomist and Engineering consultant at compost Consulting and design in Austria he's contributed to Austria's decentralized network of 350 or more composting facilities through applied research and the development of organic Source separation and composting systems in various communities including in rural areas that depend on farms floran coordinated the technical specification in Austria's compost ordinance and represents Austria and the Austrian compost and biogas Association in European collaborations the welcome floran take take us away so Linda thank you very much I hope you can hear me now if not just make a remark or Give Me A Sign because it is very good it asked me for a new hardware there but I will click it off here and so off we go um I'm very happy to be with you I would L like to be together live with you best way on a composting plant or on a farm where we can do the work together um there is a philosopher uh uh from the last century and he said a very nice little sentence that the experience of the ey of myselfself is only possible in the encountering the you so encountering the world if it a human being if it is the nature or some part of the nature oh if it is the soil maybe if it is a compost te it is a personal getting personal getting involved really with my knowledge with all my biography with all my skills with all my feelings and my emotions with all I have learned in my life uh in a NeverEnding learning process as you know um in organic farming uh in the very beginning of the uh installation or founding of the International Federation of the organic farming movements I they implemented this famous sentence healthy soil means healthy plants means healthy animals and healthy man but then it took us some time and still takes our time to Define what is health really and we more and more come to the conclusion that is a very volatile very Dynamic status um uh depending on the circumstances that change from second to second from minute to minute so it is a balance we have to achieve and soil fertility is uh constant work to keep the balance on a level in the soil in the soil plant system that is providing fertility and health to the entire ecosystem we are part of it um and then I come to another citation from Johan wolf gangur I'm sorry I don't have uh citations from um from American Authors here but he says this is a translation of myself but that's not the good one but the meaning is as long as you don't have understood uh the relationship or the dynamic between death and creation death and growth death and birth you're just a dull guest on the dark Earth and this is all about this is these big microbiological microbio micrum Dynamic we are living in we have been developing out in our Evolution that we have to understand steeper and steeper how we are connected and what is is all about is what we see here it is the Garden it is the paradise that feeds us and it feeds us because there is a miracle there's a miracle that's deep under our feet there are the rocks and what is the main property in relation to what we see as a green entity on the top it is dead it doesn't create on its own what we call Life what we call development due to the laws which are you know introduced into the sub substance itself and how does it come that such a you know plant on the top I didn't bring my carrot from the garden now how does it come that on on the mineral ground of our Earth such a beautiful uh Empire of plants that's is nourishing us can evolve how does it work so there must be something that is transforming the dead Rock the scent the desert into something which is very close to life and this miracle is mainly can be named by a key word and this is symbiosis and this is a symbiosis between the plant and the mineral Empire below the soil and that is what is in between and that is soil and this is a habitat for the microbiome the soil microbiome symbiosis is everything and the plant with the plant exudates nourishes the microbiome in the root sphere by you know giving the assimilates the phytosynthesis products directly into the soil to feed the the symbiotic microorganisms in their environment in order to get them as part of their organ of the plant organ as we can name the soil as an organ of the plant to deliver the minerals and the mineral compounds to nourish again the plant it's a big you know Wonder Miracle of symbiosis and interaction As We Know master of symbiosis just symbolizing this picture and I say this only because this fungal and bacterial life in soil boosts life on Earth tremendously yeah plants May absorb just as one example 16 times more water and nutrients with the help of the fungal weap in the soil full stop it's just one small indication there's much more to say about what has been found up out in the recent years and the key is that this habitat this environment of the plant is this clay humus complex and now the I come to the agricultural composting or the corporation of the on Farm composting that this processes in the soil and the idea the ideas behind creating maintaining building up enhancing soil fertility must be understood by heart intimately by the farmers who are responsible for the soil for their grandchildren this is all they have to do soil is a common is not private property no square meter no square yard of soil belong to anybody it belongs to everybody in order to preserve life on Earth it's a very simple attitude and what we are have to take care about is this humification dynamic in the soil this is one example from a long-term experiment in Europe showing that aggregate stability by using composted manure over 21 years increases the aggregate stability against you know conventional soil management tremendously and there's also one thing one motivation I want to mention they have found out that we have to eat 24 apples to to uh receive the same amount for instance of uh iron um compared to 1914 where it was only necessary for the same amount to eat one e so something went wrong in terms of degradation of the quality of food so whus management so fertility management is a matter of food safety and therefore what we need is education education education and it is education to from the gardeners who are responsible for you know self-reliant Gardens and food provision for the families and the communities learning all about the different processes from Bashi biochar composting and the composting process itself all possibility of variations which are part of our natural bio I would say bios symbiosis in our environment and with Farmers because the farmers are the professionals here and the concept in Austria was from the very beginning in all provinces in 1980s every village is composting farmer in order to close the organic cycle Village by Village City by city but therefore the farmers have to be motivated have to understand the maintenance and how to take care about the organic fertility of their of their soil with the help of compost of the Recycled organic metal they have to understand what can go wrong in terms of drying out and the composting process they have to understand what kind of materials they have how to mix it in the right way to understand that humus formation on soil and in the natural environment in the Savana in the woods uh on aable end is not the same as in a composting heat it is an imitation of this process but it is not the same they have to learn exactly what time of Shredder material they need and depending on the type of body material they have available the machines have to develop in a way that the structure the size the particle size and the threading properties are perfect for composting specifically to create the right surfaces for the microbiota so training training training uh and to get specifically the hands on and I show you only those figures what we in Austria in these training programs um we have approximately 280 Farmers running composting plants out of 400 composting plants in total I will show you the figures later we tell them something which is very important and this is a teaching from my experience since since the 1980 this is key what I've understood of soil formation there is no stable humus formation without clay in a pure silicate Sandy situation sand desert situation without clay formation you will never achieve a stable humus layer never ever so you need clay compounds during the composting process to stabilize the clay humus complexes you produce and then we train them even a little bit about indicators they can easily test on Farm in order to have an idea not only by organoleptic observation but also by some very simple tests on the nitrogen cycle on pH on sulfate Etc and also Crest test I will show you later in order to see uh the stage of maturation that is very important to achieve a compost that contributes best possible to humus build up in the soil so this is Crest test that is done or with other plants also that is done routinely with the farmers and also this dilution test with just with distilled water where you can see from the density from um the transparency and also from the colors the maturity of your compost and the performance of your composting facility it's just a little bit of training for a proper interpretation and then at the very end what you see here on the top I can show you here I guess this is the right one uh uh what you see on the top here is the uh composta and the quality seal the quality certification for composting plans um and the some minimum uh criteria they have to achieve in order to participate uh to be awarded for the certification and what is sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry now it's going on now I come to collection what is very important if you receive not only green waste and manure from the environment but also kitchen waste and you know from households and from restaurants is the issue of impurities big problems in cities but it very much depends on the collection scheme so in the best performing on Farm composting corporations where also the farmers do the collection service for the municipalities they achieve a purity or a contamination of only 1.2% if they do it in a way I will show you in a minute and this success story where you have nearly nothing left because you have educated household by household in the schools in the households in the commercial entities Etc providing the right equipment you achieve very very high Purity because what you see here is a big problem if you screen it you will have impurities and your compost Market might be destroyed at once so all of our citizens receed these little vented buckets Ramon will tell you maybe about this also later this is standard in well performing uh circumstances situations all over Europe paper bags biodegradable bags which are certified by European standards for garden waste the bigger paperbacks um where you can put uh the grass and and clippings and some leaves Etc and flowers and it is collected by farmers in the rural environment in this way for instance uh depending on the size of the household the buckets are bigger or smaller but every bucket bucket has a name and is identified even the biodegradable BS in some areas are identified with a number so if there are a lot of impurities Plastics and some forks and metals and so included not well separated they can identify the household and contact him and tell him you're not committed in the way we need it you're part of our society and please take care with bigger facilities with pickup systems um hydraulic systems so depending on the size and uh the catchment area collection system is different here we have a example of a city of grats with more than 300,000 inhabitants and they decided to do a centralized collection prepare and purify the collected biow waste kitchen waste and garden waste in a central treatment facility put it on a truck and send it to 18 different different compost agricultural composting plants to farmers in the environment U maximum 80 kilm in average 30 kilm 10 to 30 kilm in the vicinity in the environment of the city so there is no Central bit uh composting plant but 18 onine composting plants and when the compost is tested for the standard quity criteria like heavy metals Etc and everything is okay the farmer takes over the compost for his own use or he can also sell the compost to whomever he likes so it is a win-win situation for the city for the municipality and for the farmer yes this is the typical uh Garden waste collection and then we have collection points not uh the distance between the settlements and these collection points should not be more than 5 kilm so and in a mostly connected with a recycling center this a public imunity site where people pass by frequently uh easy to access with a separation of fine and bulky Garden waste so that bulky Garden waste can be shreded and it's mostly uh can be delivered for free so the system yeah and now I show you typical composting plants on Farm composting plants from very small um uh one wind row alongside uh the field alongside the road in the countryside where he goes with the wind roll Turner alongside the little road here on the upper left side uh it is composting between 300 and 10,000 cubic met depending on the mment area and the municipality involved um most of the facilities yeah can have to be built on a paved area I will show you later uh details on on this uh exactly this is an overview of a design of a composting plant where you have H rotter there this is the main rotting area on the top this is sealed this is paved the surface B water is collected into the Wastewater retention tank that is to be calculated according to the participation and the rainfall seasons in agreement with uh the um local authorities and the experts from the licensing bodies and all facilities must be licensed as any even commercial waste treatment facility under the specific regulations and guidelines National guidelines for composting in Austria though there is no difference if you're a farmer or a commercial entity or industrial Farm you have to follow the same rules in terms of Environmental Protection and then the open the the the post roting or the maturation can be done on open ground there is no need for cealing and the definition for uh uh the maturation phase is that the compost must um achieve or maintain a temperature below 40 to 45 degre Celsius on a constant level and then you can put it on the open ground or even beside your acre or your field where you uh finish your composting for the final period in met so this is also what those Farms look like typically yeah Wastewater collection with those little gullies uh uh yeah and I I uh swiftly give an overview what is needed in terms of um regulatory framework in order to establish even this decentralized on Farm Corporation first of all in order to make the entire system of separate collection and composting successful you need an obligation of binding targets for sour separation uh this has been established already in the early 90s in Austria and then it starts the education how this must be done in order to achieve uh at the end a high quality compost so high quality feed stock means high quality compost uh in order to give time and skills and knowledge to set up the right collection scheme um in in parallel we have a ban on biodegradables of landfills so that all so separated Organics are directed towards biological treatment and then it is important to give compost a name a name as a product that means in Austria we were the first country or EU member states establishing a so-called endof waste quality standards within a decree within an ordinance that defines the eligable feed stock feed stock quality plus minimum requirements for you know time temperature regime hygienization sanitization plus the definition of quality criteria for compost two c the waste status to become a compost product to be freely marketed and put on the marketplace and therefore this was an enormous achievement to say this is a product as a fertilizer as a soil improver as a constituent for growing media that can compete with all other fertilizers growing media and and soil improver uh the next one is we need technicals standards common technical standards for design and for operation of composting plants that's very important not to be too strict and not to overrule with too you know scary and and strict and stringent requirements regarding environmental requirements we can discuss this perhaps later what I mean with this this is about order control this is about water protection Etc um where if you if you make a good job you can be quite relaxed with a composting activities um economic drivers incentives this is mainly an issue uh to make separate collection give incentive for separate collection and make residual waste expensive but this is not so much our topic here um and also of course to maybe give some support which was done in the in the beginning and now by the EU for establishing the centralized on Farm composting systems where provinces and also national government and municipalities gave uh subsidies for the investment up to 50% for the investment for building and construction of the composting plants uh and finally the quality assurance and ification scheme we have established since very beginning here uh the developments from the 1990s to today and you will wonder uh in in 1992 these obligation for separate collection of organic waste was established from that on the municipalities and waste management association started the initiatives so there's a big increase in the next uh three to four years and then constantly more and more was produced uh in terms of of quantity of bowte collected and you see a miracle in from 2017 to 2019 this is because uh we established a uh national uh um regulation for Waste reporting for electronic data management in waste reporting now we have really good data the data the the the really the reality of separate collection specifically of um of greenbase Etc chumped into the statistics so from 2017 to 2019 it it's went up from approximately 1 million to 1.6 million tons we are collecting uh I didn't mention that we have approximately 8 million inhabitants in Austria so that you have that relation at the moment and you can uh achieve a picture of our decentralized system that we have for these 8 million uh residents or inhabitants 400 composting plants um that means the average um treating approximately 1.3 million tons uh and including some sewage LGE here and this is in total 14 5 kilg per inhabitant that is fact yeah composted that's a very high number actually and uh nearly 70% are members in the quality assurance scheme and now is something very important that our um the Novation the new composting um ordinance that will be enacted next year will make the quality assurance and certification scheme including intensive education and certification obligatory so the 70% from next year or in two years time there be 100% so those composting facilities all Farms will be visited every year by an inspector and by this they receive training and Improvement year by year year by year and uh this is a very important tool to integrate this intensive communication controlling and inspection work and it creates also confidence among uh among the society among the authorities uh but also for the population and you see our small scale composting plants in average we have uh here 3,000 tons per per plant uh in the top of Austria or in the center of Austria there's one province uh they established approximately 160 composting plants for 1.4 million inhabitants in a very rural area so there it has been realized what I mentioned before every city every village every town one or two farmers yeah doing the job of separate collection on composting this is the most transparent uh and uh way to do it because every citizen knows exactly where the compost is produced the quality and where he received his compost for his garden again but the participation in separate collection depends very much first on Public Relation work on the roll out system of the bioin of the brown bin but also on of course the settlement structure more rural so we have different Pro if it's more rural or more urban areas so we have quite a difference between different provinces but one of the provinces uh the far right one with 10% participation in fact is the province that we would say is a white spot in Austria so I have still a lot to do there you see the same it is Corinthia this is the quantity in the specific quantity Collective here in 2017 kilogram per inhabitant and year and you see uh kinia here the the second left only 50 kilg per inhabitant uh if you compare it with others up to 117 some other provinces but in some districts the quantity goes up to 200 300 kilogram per inhabitant there's a huge potential still available in spite we have started in the late 80s and what is now very important is again coming back to education or to minimum requirements is that uh there is a strict rule that if you have to mix in a certain amount of bulky shredded wood waste into kitchen waso into sewage sledge so this is um a very you know a a an element of quality assurance that has been put up first as a guideline and in due time next year it will be an obligation for the license and you prevent uh mismanagement all the problems and failures on composting plant if you strictly require a certain minimum requirement for the initial mix of the feed stock that you have enough carbon Rich material and this becomes important also in terms of understanding the composting process from the very beginning uh identifying the right composition of each stock and another issue that we have a minimum requirement because all our facilities or most of them yeah 95% of our facilities are open wial uh composting plants that we want to prevent these you know 4 meter high uh Table Mountains and uh provides minimum requirements for the relation between size of the wind R and minimum requirements for turning and Aviation so feed stock mix um uh limiting the size of the windr plus turning and ariation as minimum [Music] requirements and if this is already not only in a guideline but in a binding you know setup Bing uh component element in the National liing procedure it is also educating the authorities and the experts in the authorities and in the local governments and this is another very important message that education is need needed for all involved parties not only for the composting plant operators and between the experts no you have to take on board the local government and the uh representative of the authorities which are involved in the licensing and in the control and this is just the scheme of the uh quality assurance system where all um composting plants and this was very important for the farmers are obliged to be members um so they have one person visiting them taking the samples um um providing the report from the accredited laboratory and there is an independent committee that would speak out on a the certificate year by year so every composting plants receives such a certificate uh he can use for his marketing and is is well known and accepted by all professional uses and in the markets that's another example how this is done on a European level also there's a intensive cooperation with the European compost Network and we personally in our Institute we also provide International certification for countries who do not have the infrastructure for certification of compost and every second year there is a big yester big celebration where the best 10 composting composts are awarded with the so-called composta uh that are tested for the parameters I showed you before or you will see them when you receive the presentation and finally but finally education internationally and don't know I I'm used all my time more than my time I guess already um uh you see uh after the Corona and covid break I'm happy to offer again this autumn in September an international one week uh training uh uh and uh and training and study tour in Austria where we try to show you the details um uh of the composting separate collection scheme specifically in the the decentralized model which is quite unique in Europe and I would say worldwide but I'm very happy it's not worldwide anymore that we have it uh with Ramon's activities and his friends and um I'm very happy to see and hear your efforts in the US I would be more than happy to visit once in near future all right thank you very much if you want to hear more about uh this this seminar and this uh Excursion in September I will put you in my address list and send you the information thank you so much and I'm looking forward for our discussion wonderful thank you so much Florian uh for that great presentation um and uh in the interest of time I'm going to save uh the questions for the very end like to make sure we have time for Ramon's presentation though we do have a few good questions uh please keep them coming if you have them um but now as we hand uh controls over to Ramon uh I will go ahead and introduce him so Ramon Plana uh hold a p PhD in biology and Industrial composting and is an international consultant with Maestro composor he has worked with private and public entities around the world to advance research design and imple implementation projects for the management and treatment of a variety of organic waste he holds several patents for the treatment of organic waste through aerobic and anerobic biological processes and regularly collaborates with the association of cities and regions for sustainable resource management so take us away Ramon okay hello there hello everyone just a second okay I think that you are seeing my screen now so hello everyone thank you very much to the els for the invitation to to be part of the of this webinar and uh I I think that now you are going to understand why at the beginning I asked to to Linda that floran has to talk before me because what we are going to to show you what I going to present you is a much more modest uh implementation of the fun composting of the decentralized composting model related to to farms and the first steps that we are developing here in Spain so that's either just you have it if you want to know who I am here in Spain we are uh defending that the bowte management should have three models or three first approaches the model without collection of the food waste needed Transportation the models were okay there is a collection but the transportation is minimum you don't go very far from the town from the village from the city and the centralized models that are based on collection and transportation to big facilities to be uh plants treatment plants the first two models we think that can be done with very simple and economical technology low cost low tax system but as floran said we need a very clean by ways with very low content in contaminants of in properties those systems are low Tech because we need people so we are going to rise the employment rates if in the area we we change equipments for jobs they are effective if we do it well it allows to reach successful results and we have many to present and what we think that is more important is that involve citizens because people is going to see in front of them what is happening with their wasted especially with the fot waste with the kitchen waste and what it means the quantities what it means why they do not separate it well and the possibilities to form that way into a resource so at the end the territory is also involved in the management moreover we can't involve local companies small companies small and medium companies and even those companies with social Enterprises that allow that uh people in risk of social exclusion could perform specific task that are related in one way or another with the composting with the local composting so we think that with this system you can develop a real local economy circular Economy based in the treatment of the kitchen ways or and other kinds of uh organic wastes the centralized models that uh we are looking for big facilities with high technology that allow us to treat food waste or any other kind of organic waste with a lot of contaminants uh we don't care too much for the collection systems there are automatic most of most of the of the system so the employment rate is much lower than in the others the results are mixed in the meaning that in some cases we have very good results and they those facilities produce a relatively good product but in others it's a complete disaster and uh they are distance to the people it mean that people do not care about what happens with the waste they only care for the container that they have uh in front of their house or not far from from their house that it has to be empty every night that's just what they they care for so with that in mind now we are going to to travel from the US to Spain I choose Detroit because it was the first city I visit when the first time I went to to the us and we are going to the north of Spain to the city of bilau and here I we are going to present you the first examples but before that just a few few hints about Spain and our Waste Management uh results okay this is the LA the the last results or the last uh numbers we have about the municipal waste management so as you can see most of our municipal waste goes to lfi directly to lfi it is a same and we have have a lot of work to do to fulfill all the European directives about Waste Management we are in the queue and as you can see at the at the left of the graph for composting and anerobic digestion we just recover the 3% of the of the waste of the municipal waste maybe you can you can find in in some reports and some articles that the number is around 17 why because they considered that all the food waste that are mixed with the residual waste so I mean those fractions that that not separate on SES and that go to Mechanical biological treatment facilities it's also composting but in the real reality the the quantity of food waste that is recovered separately it's just the 3% so as I said we have a lot of things to do in this in this country about the distribution of population it is interesting to understand what is happening here you can see in this map of Spain a distribution of the population and every Spike you are seeing there are points with a higher density than than others so you can see the main cities of Spain the center you can see this is the capital Madrid here in the Mediterranean Coast is Barcelona and all the municipalities around the north this is bilau and other other cities and Sebastian and this is Valencia and you can see okay this is the big or the capitals of the province of different states in results 50% of the population of Spain lives in 125 municipalities and we have more than 8,000 municipalities in in in Spain so half of the of the population of this country it's distributed it's dispersed in the countryside and our Waste Management model is in most of our region is completely centralized this is the number of mbts facilities as I said before this is with not separation of the food was you can see the the this bar is a comparison between different regions and you see most of them are in Barcelona in Catalonia in the South and Del Lucia there are Madrid if we talk about composting for food waste for biow Waste you can see that there's a big difference Catalonia and the rest why because here in Catalonia we have around 27 composting facilities for food waste and in the rest of of Spain this is is an emptiness because the north we have here we have we have two now we have one in the B country we have uh another one in in Nar and now we are building two more Madrid have just uh one of uh here in my homeland Gala in the Northwest here we just have at this moment one that is operating there are another that are private but public that is just one so as you can see the different is huge what it means that if we're trying to compare the uh centralized models and the centralized models I did this this number according to the to the number of of composting facilities in different countries in Europe and the inhabitants as you can see Portugal it has a composting facility for every five Millions vers the Spain is one composing facility for every 1.5 million but if we take out Catalonia it this number rise to more than three millions one composed facility for every three millions person at the bottom Austria as you have now listened to fan and you can understand what they meaning uh my numbers was around one composting facility for every 19 uh inhabitants floran Now update that data to 22,000 but as you can see see the big difference okay the different approach to the strategy of Waste Management the centralized models confronting front centralized models like Spain and talking about another uh models like houseold composting there are some areas in the north where there are many composter distributed in the in the households but uh at the end not all of them have been really monitored so we don't really know they're being well managed or not if they are uh processing all the food waste that is being generated in the household or not so this number have to be taken with cus and Community composting okay here we have uh two regions that there are the the main leaders at this moment this is in the north Bas country was here they were the Pioneers in in the meaning that around 13 14 years ago we begin to experiment with different municipal with the different models that could be implemented in in in their towns and Village and nowadays there are more than 500 Community composting areas and 13 different models of community composting here in the west this is the province of poned this is where I was born and here we there is a a model with a very um in intensive program about decentralized composting basic on community composting and nowadays they are treating almost 3,500 tons of food waste per year in community composting areas and there are some areas in in the in the east in in the community of Valencia there are some initiatives Navar it's now also in the Northeast they beginning with a very intensive project and some areas of Catalonia they have a very interesting developing of community composting in the rest there are also there are other experience but there are not Alternatives real alternatives to bowte management so they need to have a complimentary system with a collection so this is the overview of Spain and our Waste Management model and now I'm going to present you the different examples we go to the North La lichu uh those were the Pioneers in in the farm composting in Spain here this is a small Village of larab betu it's close to to bilau around 20 kilom far it has uh around 2,000 inhabitants and as they were about 20 kilometers far from from the big city in the area it means that they have to pay for the collection taxes and the transportation cost this uh uh higher prices than than the neighbors because they were at the end of the valley so the tracks have to go there collect a few kilograms of food waste and then come back to the big facility so for this Village it means a lot of money so in 2013 uh some neighbors here begin to think that some other options could be available for them and they have heard something about the Austrian model here in Spain it's uh you can some in some places you can you can listen that the that sentence Oh we have to replicate the Austrian model or you have to look for the Austrian model so Florian so explain you what we think what is the Austrian model so they wanted to do something like that they contact me and we were thinking about which were the real possibilities for then to to perform some kind of local composting based in the action of local farmers so nowadays you're going to see we develop a A system that they are been running during all these years that uh at this moment involve 290 families nine big producers big producers I mean uh shops restaurants um Fresh Markets in the area and they have at this moment three simple composting facilities that managed by by Farmers uh a few months ago they were four but now the one of the farmers uh decided that he couldn't continue with with with the program as you see these composting areas they are very very simple they were made by the by the neighbors and with recycled materials so the boots that you can see here they were recycled and the system is very very simple it's Bas it in the three or four boxes that when one is full they have to move the material to the next and continue and as you can see this is more or less how it looks why we can do it like that Florian also explain it we have a very very good quality of the foot waste it have less than 1% of contaminants even we can think about less than 0.5 so it's extremely easy to treat it here you have uh some videos where you can see how the the system works okay so the fot waste is generated in the households so they collected in a very small then three days during the week they can take it out to the street to to the doors of the building or the house and then the the farmer the basara is the the war in in Bas language collected okay at the beginning they have just one one farmer and they they realized that it was impossible to keep the the service during the world year so they look for other to join the the program and at this moment as I say they they are three so they they distribute when and how they they collect the the food waste every week in the composting facility they measure the quantity of the food waste by volume and they uh just put it inside the inside the boxes they add the the bulky material that they have from their activity in in the farm and from that the beginning the process begin as you know at the end they use Farmers really want the compost for for the crop plants because the the lands in that area are quite poor in infertility because of industrial activity that they had in in the area in the previous year and those vegetables are sold to the to the to the neighbors to the population so they they close the cycle during these years ER what the they got is the as I said the uh the they see that it was impossible to keep the the service if they don't have more than two or three Farmers involved because any injur of the of the farmer got ill or he wants to take up a holidays a vacation anything they want to do they couldn't take the the population un attended so they begin to involve other Farmers they begin to try with other system as I said they were the Pioneers so they were experimenting a lot with these typical home composters for the first stages and then they move it to the next and one of the most interesting things here was that in 2015 one of the most important restaurants in Spain one of with three Michelin star one of those restaurants that they give you uh a this like this and the quantity of food is like this and the bill is three pages at least and have no less than two zos so one of those restaurants joined the project and it was very very funny because here you have the composting area the first one and it's around less than a mile far from the from the uh from the town from larab betu and the restaurant it's just here really really close to the composting area but they just wanted more and more F waste beans they didn't want to know nothing about compost until the moment that the tong Hall decide okay this is the bill for all the containers that you're asking for and if you don't want to pay it you have to take your food waste and go to the composting area and uh put it there for to be processed and they wanted to say okay we will do it and moreover they begin to announce in the in the press and in their web their web page that they were making compost and at this moment uh two years ago they got an international prize award related to the was the most sustainable restaurant in the world because they were performing composting and other things of course but since then moment the pro here you can see this is the restant here at the bottom of the compos facility and since that moment the the project got more uh strength and it was more respected uh for the local authorities this is the quantities of uh food waste that they are processing in in this model okay here in the yellow ones you can see this is from the restaurant this is the quantity from the restaurant 20202 because of the copy the quantities was more smaller as you can see more they processing 70 to little more than 80 tons per per year that's quite uh modest this these are are the results from the analytics of the first compost they complies all the exigencies that we have here in Spain for the for compost and it has the highest legal quality related to the heavy metals content is Class A so here it Spain it will be available to use in organic farming pros and cons of the project okay it came from the citizens that was very important because it give you a a high resistance and citizens convince the authorities that it was good that it was uh it has a future and at the end all the Mayors accept it and and and bet the that it could be a future for for the for the town it gives you a rent to the to the farmers so they allow it to continue their activities families are encouraged to participate it because they really know what happens with the wasted and they know they are for good and not just for them for all the population it's simple it's a very simple system and they could incorporate new incentives in in the area like social currency problems that as I said they began in 2013 now we are 10 years later they are still with the same uh model so they have to improve it yet and they will take it they have to invest more money to to get all the all the efforts and all the permits that the authorities act the uh Regional authorities ask them to have and they have a big dependence of the number of of farmers okay now we go very not far from here in in the North surville and here we have also the first composting uh facility that are really managed by a farmer it is a a bigger town and here we have we find household composting Community composting and with the for the families that do not perform one of those systems they have doorto door collection and what they're doing now is they're taking part of that to toor collection and going to a farmer here where they receive two tons of bowte every 15 days so he's not under pressure he can manage them with calm and do all the things they have to be done to be be sure that you have a good compost they have a a small Turner machine that was also made in Spain and the bulky material is is provided by the municipality and also by the farmers all the farmers were trained and they have a very specific protocol for the manage M of food waste so when the TRU arrives they they are prepared to to process immediately all the food waste and build the windro perform the turnings and to keep it covered and under control at at every moment so all the parameters are monitored uh not uh at every moment but yes every day we have the register of temperatures or and either they have any any problem they find or they sense any smell or anything they immediately take note and and and try to correct it and before the use the product is analyzed so all authorities can have the can be sure that we are not doing anything harmful for the environmental or for the final destination of the compost we are still in the north this is a project uh that was Finance financed by the European union and the government of naar that involve a social company that called HOSA we are here in the north here HOSA is a is a social company that uh been uh working for 20 years now and they produce organic uh herbals medicinal medicinal herbals and teas and different kinds of cosmetic products all made by by organic products uh locally and the the workers are always people at risk of social exclusion so one of the problems that they had is what they didn't have enough compost for their Harvest so they begin to think after some of our uh meetings and speechs in the University here in Nar that maybe it could be possible that they uh do perform the collection of foot w in their area and with that food waste they're going to produce compost for themselves so they will have an economical income for the service that they offer to the to the to the towns around the their Farm the collection of the food waste and the treatment of the food waste and they have also the benefit of the compost that they're going to produce for their their use so here you have it's a very simple composting facility the they perform the biow collection to for the local and they they do the local treatment also with a very simple T machine that was made locally with a black by a blacksmith in the town but also in this project we include the training so this this facility is also a school a school for training people as uh Master composters as people that they they they learn how what they have to do technically I'm I'm Miss administrative about the management of a composting facility they also learn about the compost how they can use it to take to test the quality of the compost and also schools and universities goes there to learn more about composting another point of this project is that the university is related with it in the research of different organic products that can be produced in the composting facility not only compost by by itself we not a a liquid organic fertilizers or different mixes of products Bop pesticides Etc so there's also a research here and broadcasting we also we've been working a lot to promote this model to make people know about it so we try to to make it more popular in in in other areas of Spain last year we received an award from the rural Inspiration Awards for resilient food future so we think that we were going in the right way here another example now we're going to the to the isand we go to Bic Iceland and this is a project that connect tourists with ecology and local farming we are in the mayorca island in the Mediterranean Sea here okay some fast details you see you know here the the problem with organic matter in the soil in the Mediterranean Basin is really really terrible we have have most of our soils more than 75% of our soils have less than 2% of organic matter and we are even losing and losing that those contents for the island you can see that specifically they have six more almost 70% of the soils have an erosion risk and they are losing almost 12 tons of soil peror and per year in the island so they need organic matter moreover they almost they don't have cattle so it's hard for them to get the organic matter that they need to to to produce compost but what they have is a lot of tourists okay 2020 they have a a drastic reduction of the number of tourist but now they rise again and they have even more than before so it means that they have a high demand for local resources and a high waste generation and this hotel company Garden hotels that has been working in the island for more than 30 years and this man howas begin to think okay maybe we can do something about waste management and organic matter and soils so what they did is okay we want to offer to our customers organic I going to pass this video and will give you later they want to give you to the to our customers to our CL clients organic products but they have to be local we want local organic products and they didn't find it in in the market so what they did is okay we have we are producing more than 100 tons of food waste per year in just in one of our one of our hotels so they take it during one month October 2016 we take it to a farm managed by people as also in risk of social exclusion we teach them how to make compost and during this year that the last month of that year they produce organic compost that they G gave to the association of organic farmers of the iseland and with that compost they produce organic products for the hotel during this this pilot project we take them all the politicians all the technicians from the local government so they can see they can touch they can smell they can see that it was possible it was real and with that we could begin the real project in September 2019 so nowadays two of those restaurants and the bigger two of these hotels and the biggest restaurants in the island the hotel collect the food was from those uh those places and they take it to a uh organic farm in the island that is not far that 15 kilometers from the hotels and here we have a very small composed facility very simple we we train the people in the farm how to make compost and they take all the measure all the controls we have everything under control at every moment to be sure that they are managed the food waste correctly and the farmer gives the hotel organic products by the value of the organic matter that they receiv there is no money exchange here only products the farmer receives organic matter and the farmer gives organic products by the value of the organic matter and until now we have Pro processed more than 400 tons of food waste in this year and the content in contaminants now is around 0.15% so it's really really good material to be processed in this simple system the process as I said is monitored and all the data are collected and uploaded to the cloud so we can see immediately what is happening and we have all the process under control this project has received different Awards in the in the last year and the hotel is very happy because at the end this is publicity for them so they don't they don't care for the investment in in the project because at the end you have the the return of a very good image it's always in the press and they create jobs one of them for people social exclusion we have develop some Machinery in the island so nowadays they know how to make this this kind of machiner that we don't have it before and also the hotel create a new company for the management of green wastage of the iseland to produce the bul material that they need for for the compost so the main challenge we have during this this time was to convince the local Administration as floran said this one of the challenge and one of the specific uh Target of this kind of projects they become official waste management manager it was difficult but they they did it now they as I said they know how to produce their own bulky material we don't have providers for the Machinery in the island and at the end now we can't build it in the island so the things are changing now in in baleric Islands related to to this kind of projects and Ron I just want to flag that we just have a few more minutes so that we can leave uh time for questions okay okay so this was the last example this is the in Canary Island and just to point you this is an island with a very difficult orography high mountains volcano Etc and all the all the organic wastes are were managed here in just one point of the island and now we perform a project where there is a lot of decentralized composting all on the island and we are planning to use two composting facilities that are already exist for the treatment of agricultural wastage from bananas mainly so they can't now include also food WS from local uh Village local small village and towns in the area so this one of the projects we we are working with to finish it uh the pro the problems with the with this model is that there is not a specific regulation in Spain for this scale so it depends of the interpretation for every uh responsible from the technical of the public administration uh only in Nar they perform uh because of the project of HOSA they develop a first regulation that is based in administrative and Technical conditions okay you have it here so we make it simple to to can build and perform this facilities our main problem here is the quality of the food waste because in some cases we don't know who's going to control the food waste that the facility receives and who's going to pay if the farmer has to invest more money or more equipment and have a a loss of the quality of the compost so here this is a problem now in Spain when we try to promote this kind of models and the need of professional Technical Training that it is essential as as floran previously said okay we know that Farmers know about composting but this is a little bit different and more intense supervision external Technical Support also Florian explain it about it this here is a very a research group in the University of uh of Miguel Hernandez in in Valencia that they are doing a very amazing job work about it the training and the giving assistance to the farmers and to guarantee that the process is all the proc the service is given during the world year so this is also one of the cons that the model has so it is important to consider it finally just to commment that it's important that the Ora sector can be the all the best allies restaurants hotels censes cafeterias they create they generate a lot of food waste and very clean food waste so it's very easy to transform into a compost in a local model so as I said this is the key aspect for for the model at least here at this moment in Spain there specific regulation that we missed the guarantees of the quality of the food waste the Technical Training technical support external support service guarantees and the synergies that we can create with Rea sector just to finish uh our association that's called ferti AO has create that developed h a community composting uh guide a handbook to promote the model and it has been translated to different language it is in English if you want it and also to the to Bolivia and other areas we also perform as a friend said training courses just for looking for that so farmers and other people could be trained and also those kind of Tours to show people to show politician technicians for other countries and also other part of Spain that those models are are a reality but what they need to do what they need to know to take them to their countries to their to the regions and to really implement it so that's all and sorry if I took longer that I I thought but I hope it would be interesting for you thank you very much for your attention and any questions here you have me fabulous that was a great presentation thank you Ramon um and so now we're going to move into uh questions and answers and uh I just love the combination of um your presentations um I think the gold standard in Austria what this could look like and I love uh seeing in Spain which I think is probably more similar to where we are in the United States of of something a little bit uh where we're still striving for that gold standard so thank you for for that and uh I loved seeing the I think your presentations both clearly Illustrated the benefits of community scaled composting solutions that can really be adapted to the local conditions and local challenges and local communities but also some of the considerations and challenges at that scale and the importance of um support um for the farmer for uh in you know implementing the composting but then also for uh educating the community on how to participate so uh such great presentations uh one of the questions that I think we could posee to both of you um you both mentioned the importance of um contamination or just the needing a clean stream that will be composted at this scale and uh the question from participant was what is an acceptable amount of contamination and uh for customers or people uh submitting their uh food scraps to be composed in these projects uh what are the consequences if they exceed the limits so can you hear me yes yes very good so uh if you allow I can uh start with that because we have after now 30 years of experience again a very big discussion there um we are going to implement a a minimum requirements so a limit with um 2% by weight of impurities of contaminants uh that is allowed to enter the composting heat and there is another threshold that they consider now 5% by by weight um that can enter the composting facility but then you have to introduce a purification separation equipment yeah to take the impurities out but there's actually who will pay for it who will analyze it if it's 5.2 or 2.3 or whatever uh so it's it's really tricky so the only thing you can do you can you you um and that what was very very successful in our case is to uh achieve the commitment by the by the entities who are responsible for the collection that might be in the municipality that might be the intercommunity association so the waste management association of a number of municipalities that might be a private company but at the end the private company is contracted by the municipality or by a local Authority and in the bylaws of the contract it must be clearly stated that they have to take into account take care about the proper education and the control of the bins they collect so they have to Pro provide a system how they do the controlling and the communication about the Purity and the quality of the feed stalker and the food waste they collect and I think this again starts with a very intensive corporate um um communication and identif ation with the system and then you might succeed um you ask for the threshold that would be acceptable at the end I'm telling you it's 1% it's 1% we we shouldn't be shamed to be quite stringent and very clear about it because 5% which you will find in some of the areas in in in the big cities for instance it look it looks like hell because it's mainly plastic and 5% by by uh by weight is uh even in the final product you will have these fine plastic pieces which are uh end up in microplastic which is the big debate today yeah I absolutely agree with with Florian more than 2% becomes a problem in in this kind of facilities with so simple because if not you have to invest in equipments or you have to invest in time of your of your workers open the bags by hand taking out the Plastics so it's at the end that's impossible it means that you have to invest a lot of money for the Management Facility as F said less than 1% is the objective here buet here the problem of course is at the end who is responsible for those qualities so that's what I said at the beginning the Ora sector the hotels restaurants something like that very very easy quite easy to have it under control to teach the people in the kitchen in the Halls how they have to separate the food then it's very easy to have a important quantity of food waste that is almost completely clean so I'm begin with that and then begin to train to to raise the awareness of the people of the citizens of the politicians of the local administration of of the importance of the of the separation on source and then you can go you can try to get a a b a good quality food waste and then you can think okay now I can I can extend the model to more facilities or to do this facility a bit a little bit higher bigger yes great answers uh the importance of of models uh Pilots that that can be scaled up uh once the systems are dialed in um so I'm just flagging that it's almost 13 I'm wondering if you uh Ramon and floran would be willing to stay on for just a few more minutes to answer some more questions yes definitely no problem fabulous okay so uh one question uh directed at you Florian I think was for an urban area um did you in your the examp one of the examples you gave uh was the material sort of collected at a central area where contamin was removed and then it was sent on to Farmers who would compost it or are there also examples where the farmers have to decontaminate but it's always both because the decontamination in a central facility in the city is uh never complete yeah so um so if you collect from a city we have the problem that we might be in the range of 2% and then they have some screening and some separation by Ballistic separation and Separation by wind sifter by Separation by a magnetic separator etc etc uh but at the end um we had those problems that the mixed and prepared feed stock delivered to the farmers still was quite contaminated but this is also due to the fact that there was not a much not enough commitment by this City by the municipality and its co-workers to do more about education work to the household and to to put more effort uh even even in the in the cleaning and purification and separation activities but at the end it was the it is the responsibility of the central of the municipality and the facility to deliver uh a well well prepared uh raw fit stock mix to the farmers great thank you for that clarification now question for youon um someone asked is there any competition between composters and pig Farmers or other animal Farmers I suppose to participate in the composting model models that you mentioned unfortunately not uh it's really hard to find uh some farmers at this moment that they want to be bor in this kind of in this kind of models we have found in in some cases that they they really want the compost but when you say okay but you have to do it by yourself and we are you are going to collect or you are going to receive the the food waste and then you have to transform it into compost and they say no no no it's I don't have time it's more complicated uh it's going to be uh I have I'm going to have a lot of controls from the administration I don't want to to have problems and at this moment for example in in Pedra in that province that I said they have a very intense program in in community composting now the C the provincial government has developed a project uh to uh give uh some kind of Health economical healths to any uh farmer or Association of farmers that were that will that could will to collect or receive organic waste from municipalities around them so they want to to to give money for the investment in the facility or in the collection system and try to promote this model because they they tried it years ago and they didn't find any farmer interested in that so it's difficult hearing most of the farmers are are still related to the mineral fertilizers and it's now it's this year with the crisis in in energy crisis with a tremendous rise of the cost of the fertilizers that a lot of them now they are looking for organic fertilizers and they try to to find other sources but until now you you have to to take a lot of time to to knock a lot of doors to find fness that could be interested in the M yes uh the the current crisis um with uh prices of a lot of Commodities but including um fertilizers is uh something we feel even here in the US um it's very important but hopefully it also brings us back to the importance of um and opportunities with um compost as uh an amendment that can also reduce the need for uh fertilizers synthetic fertilizers it's a great Point um so a question that this also leads me to is um how do you balance supporting Farmers to to get involved with this without making it feel like they're being forced or um by putting too much of the onus of uh the responsibility of managing all of the different pieces of collecting the waste and processing the waste and then Distributing the compost at the end uh maybe this is question more for for uh chor and because I think ran you sort of touched on it but if you have anything to add I'd love to hear from you too now the the the key is is a farmer really interested in these humus and compost cycle so um and the second is does he has a right location and does he has the human resources and some of the equipment he can provide and this has then to be decided between the municipality the respons or the entity that is local entity that is responsible for the waste collection or the for the waste management um uh so usually we we have a sort of a concour so there is a uh uh an article in the local newspaper we are looking for a farmer who is interesting to do the job and then there are two or three Farmers coming up and they are invited and then we explain them what's coming up so what would be their Duty and their their task it could be including the separate collection collecting part or it's just receiving the organic waste that it collected by another by the municipality or by a collection company and then he's doing the job of composting from from the from the Gate of the composting plant down to the marketing and everything so it is a side job or an additional job he has to become a professionalist a professional compost producer it's nothing that he should do just by you know um in the late afternoon or in the evening it must be clear that he needs time for that to maintain the composting PL of plant of a professional level um in that case I can say um the key issue there is not to find interesting Farmers but to find the right location and and uh to to sort out to identify if the farmer has the capacity to do the job in the right way and this is a little bit uh an issue that has to be taken into account at the beginning but from that on if this is okay if I talk about location the minimum we try to achieve is at least 250300 meter distance from the next uh settlement or residential area or permanent residence or restaurant or something like that and then the local climate has to be taken into account to prevent later on you know all the problems and complaints by the neighbors and so fors if I understood your question correctly I think so Ramon do you have any insights to share uh all all the things that Florian said absolutely agree with him just to add that some cases that we found uh that the farmers look for the model or could be interested in the model because of the compost as they said that it's not easy to especially those Farmers that are looking for organic farming and they are performing organic farming they need compost and they they here in Spain to find a high quality compost that could be labeled as organic is not easy the the production is quite reduced so if they find the opportunity to do it by themselves and they they make the numbers and they see okay it is possible for me then it's a it's a good incentive for for them in our case yes compost is a a high quality compost um is not always easy to come by you have to consider it is an additional income also but have to provide service for that income so our gate fee for for for taking over uh Organic Kitchen waste is in in order to cover all the costs including the revenue it's between 50 55 to 65 Euros per ton and that is needed to do a professional job um this refers to paved and sealed and professional composting plants that are constructed on a on a on a high level um I I forgot to mention that up to 300 cubic meter uh of green waste only so Garden Parkwest only in Austria it is allowed to do the composting on open ground even the Intensive rotting phase the first I I Tred to increase this uh this threshold because we have found even if it's 1,000 cubic meters per year uh it wouldn't do any harm if you do a uh a good job um it could be open ground if if you are uh in a certain distance from surface water from rivers or whatever from a lake and you don't have groundwater problems or a nearby well or whatever but in normal cases even on open ground the ground is capable to carry your machines and so forth you can do it up to a certain uh quantity right okay well um just to get to a couple more questions from from the audience I would love to continue talking about this um but maybe another time um just to trying to compare it to what I what we're seeing in the US um there's just lots of questions that are coming up for me but um a question a clarification for you uh Ramon was in the examples that you gave were are there compost coming onto the farm to do the composting and the farmers receive the compost in the end uh or are the farmers actually doing the composting themselves I don't think I understood the question you mean they are the farmers in the examples that you in some of the examples you gave are they actually doing the composting or is there a separate entity that comes in and actually does the composting on the farm no no they do it but in all cases they do it by by by themselves but in for example in that with the hotels they have external support uh by myself and and others to teach them and if they have any problem or any doubt they just immediately pH me or send me an email to see it's happening this what I can do that that's all but they do it in every all those cases they do it by by by themselves okay well thank you for that clarification um for you for and um someone early on in your presentation asked if you could clarify the need for clay um uh adding clay into the composting mix to create stable humus yeah this is basic knowledge of soil formation lecture number one that 10,000 years ago when the glacier disappeared you have just send and grabble and so forth and then uh 100 year 100 Year by 100 year uh the soils were formed uh by a combination of further degradation and weathering of the mineral substance into the small small pieces less than two micrometer and when it's less than 2 micrometer in particle size of minerals this is secondary minerals clay minerals they become um plastic how you call that they can take up water yeah and they are performed and constructed in layers and they can take up and absorb minerals like calcium pottassium and they have also um an electric load uh in the surface which is negative and this combines now not only with minerals like calcium magnesium potassium Etc but also with degradation compounds from the organic breakdown of peptides and um um carbohydrates Etc from assimilate from the plants that are micro that are degraded by microbial activity and those um micro molecules uh also have in their outer layer uh a positive loading and this is connected now with the surface of these uh secondary clay minerals and they build a protection layer around these we call it humi compounds that we don't know exactly what it is chemically speaking we we have a guess yeah in our in in in our workbooks yeah um but at the end this clay compound is very very important to stabilize the partly degraded and stabilized organic um compounds from microbial decomposition and this is this is the basic knowledge and it is not taken into account because of costs so big facilities consider if they have to add I don't know 10% by volume or by weight what take what you want of clay clay soil into the composting process this is a lot of effort the need additional storage uh area and this costs money but at the end the stability and the quality of the humus compound they produce is less and this is a lesson we learned from basic soil formation lectures yeah thank you for that that was that was taught uh by the pioneers of composting in the 1950s already but it was forgotten most a long time yes it wasn't until I had the opportunity to study with uh some composters in Austria a few years ago that I I heard of uh clay being added so um hopefully we were are res sharing some forgotten knowledge there um so a final question for both of you um and I'm going to make it a two-part question um someone commented that it's great that restaurants and hotels are getting involved um in these efforts are there grocery stores uh getting involved too and are you aware of any examples that use uh vermic composting uh as the processing technique is the stores in the first example that I I use in those that we the bers here in Spain yes they are they're taking some organic wastage from food wastage from groceries stores so it's it's also possible it's that kind of generators that could be really welcome in this kind of of models as I said the same that hotels and restaurants it's quite easy to separate it and have a good quality and with bmit composting some for example the that project in maor the end of the mation process they do it with worms so they perform ver composting at the end but just for mation not at the beginning and uh now we are working also in in another facility Al very small that will part of it will be the the production of of ver compost so it's it's been really really possible but it's much better to be sure that everything is under controll you do it after at least after the fermentation stage of the composting process that makes sense foran uh any uh examples of either grocery stores being involved uh um I assume they must be um and then if You' know of any vermic composting that's happening in Austria you also the groceries supermarkets Etc obliged to provide separate collection usually they contract a professional collection company um so it's depends on the size of the village and the groceries Etc if they are involved in the uh agricultural composting scheme where also the farmers do the collection well they're involved partly with these on Farm composting but for the for the bigger Supermarket chains I would say not so much but we have big composting plants of course that are run by Farmers up to 15 to 20,000 tons per year uh they they're not providing the collection but they receive if the grocery are involved in the general separate collection scheme run by the municipality uh then they have to implement the S separation for the Organics and then it is included also and V composting there is only one professional example and this facility uh does uh exactly as Ramon said a a maturation phase more or less we could say so after uh I think it it's six weeks of intensive high temperature composting phase composting phase but is uh in this case only uh um uh green manure so means grass clippings and alpha alpha Etc from the farm manure and green waste so garden and park waste is composted without kitchen waste and that is then fed to a very professional um wormy Farm Compost Farm with automatic harvesting uh the the the the warm uh the war compost and so forth I'm teaching it for home composting intensively in a very simple way because with warm composting there's nearly no need for turning if you do it in the right way um it can be done very simple with a very simple performance with a simple similar equipment as Ramon showed it from from the compost boxes from the community composting facilities just a little box put a little bit on the top and let the WMS do the job and in 10 days you don't see anything anymore from the kitchen B great yes we um we uh Advocate or teach uh Worm Composting for the home scale but we are we do see it in the community scale as well so um fabulous thank you both so much for staying longer to answer some of those questions I'm sorry if we didn't get to everybody's questions but um I really appreciate this opportunity to learn from the models you have been involved with in Austria and Spain uh floran and Ramon and I just really appreciate your time and uh thank you all for participating good luck to everybody thanks to you you're welcome okay thank you and take care everyone thank you byebye by by [Music] Ramon",
