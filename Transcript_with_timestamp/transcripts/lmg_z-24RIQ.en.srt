00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,279
intro hey there fellow farmers and

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:05,279
gardening

3
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:08,480
enthusiasts have you ever wondered how

4
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:11,240
to grow more while using less water well

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,519
you're in for a treat today we're diving

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:16,119
into the world of smart irrigation

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,800
systems these clever setups are changing

8
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:18,840
the game when it comes to watering our

9
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,720
crops and

10
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,560
Gardens so grab your favorite drink and

11
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,560
let's explore how we can save water and

12
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:28,480
boost our harvests at the same time main

13
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,400
content let's start by talking about why

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,399
good water management matters so much

15
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,200
water is precious and we need to use it

16
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:38,239
wisely in farming and gardening when we

17
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,039
water our plants just right they grow

18
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:44,039
better and produce more but when we use

19
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,800
too much water we're not just wasting it

20
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:48,520
we can actually harm our plants and

21
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:51,719
reduce our yields that's where smart

22
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:54,640
irrigation systems come in so what

23
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,480
exactly is a smart irrigation system

24
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,359
it's like having a Super Smart Gardener

25
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,120
that knows exactly when and how much to

26
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:03,320
water your plants these systems use a

27
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,200
combination of sensors controllers and

28
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,280
software to make watering

29
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:10,119
decisions let's break down the main

30
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,520
parts first we have soil moisture

31
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:15,000
sensors these little devices are placed

32
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:17,280
in the soil to measure how wet or dry it

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,119
is they're like having tiny weather

34
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,200
stations right where your plants are

35
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:24,040
growing the sensors send this

36
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,759
information to the main controller next

37
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,520
up is the controller which is like the

38
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,000
brain of the system it takes in all the

39
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,759
data from the sensors and makes

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,439
decisions about watering the controller

41
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,360
can be programmed with information about

42
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:39,240
your specific plants and soil type this

43
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,280
helps it make even better choices about

44
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:45,000
when to water now here's where it gets

45
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,840
really cool many smart irrigation

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,640
systems also connect to local weather

47
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,680
stations or use weather

48
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,439
forecasts this means they can adjust

49
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,520
watering schedules based on recent

50
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:57,079
rainfall or upcoming hot weather imagine

51
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,880
not having to worry about turning off

52
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:01,680
your sprinklers when it rains the

53
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,000
software is what ties everything

54
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,840
together it allows you to Monitor and

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,720
control your irrigation system from your

56
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,200
phone or computer you can see realtime

57
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,760
data adjust settings and even get alerts

58
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,239
if something needs your attention let's

59
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,360
talk about how these systems use

60
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:21,120
real-time data to make watering

61
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,040
decisions say it's b a hot dry week the

62
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,800
soil moisture sensors will detect that

63
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,280
the soil is getting dry they'll send

64
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,280
this information to the

65
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,599
controller the controller checks the

66
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,959
weather for cast and sees no rain is

67
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,879
expected it then decides it's time to

68
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:39,720
water and turns on the irrigation system

69
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,360
but it doesn't just water for a set time

70
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,159
it keeps checking the soil moisture

71
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,080
levels and stops when the soil has

72
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:47,720
enough water this Precision means no

73
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,720
overwatering and no

74
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:53,120
underwatering just the right amount of

75
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,920
water for happy healthy plants now you

76
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,760
might be wondering does this really make

77
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,840
a difference let's look at some real

78
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,680
world examples a farm in California

79
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,879
switched to a Smart irrigation system

80
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,959
for their almond

81
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,360
Orchards they found they could reduce

82
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:10,720
their water use by 20% while maintaining

83
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,599
the same crop yield that's a huge water

84
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,480
saving in another case a corn Farmer in

85
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,480
the midwest used smart irrigation to

86
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:20,000
increase his yield by

87
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,720
15% he was able to give his crops

88
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,760
exactly the right amount of water at the

89
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:27,720
right times this led to healthier plants

90
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:30,400
and bigger harvests even on a smaller

91
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:33,120
scale smart irrigation can make a big

92
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,959
difference a community garden in Arizona

93
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,799
installed a smart system and cut their

94
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,920
water use in half their vegetables

95
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:42,680
thrived and they even saw an increase in

96
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:45,760
their Harvest these systems aren't just

97
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,720
for big Farms or dry areas they can be

98
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,040
useful in any climate and for any size

99
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:53,000
of Garden or Farm in wetter areas they

100
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,120
can help prevent overwatering which can

101
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,920
lead to plant

102
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,879
diseases in drier areas they ensure

103
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:02,079
every drop of water is used efficiently

104
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:04,560
now you might be thinking this sounds

105
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:06,200
great but isn't it complicated to set up

106
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,120
while it's true that smart irrigation

107
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,079
systems are more complex than a simple

108
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,840
sprinkler they're becoming easier to

109
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:14,200
install and use all the time many

110
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,359
companies offer Professional

111
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,799
installation

112
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:19,840
services and once they're set up they

113
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:22,720
often require less day-to-day management

114
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:25,759
than traditional irrigation methods of

115
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,440
course no system is perfect smart

116
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,360
irrigation systems do require an initial

117
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,120
investment they also need some

118
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,240
maintenance to keep them working

119
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,440
correctly but for many farmers and

120
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,360
gardeners the water savings and improved

121
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,240
yields make it well worth it as we Face

122
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,479
challenges like climate change and water

123
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:46,280
scarcity tools like smart irrigation

124
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:48,320
systems become even more important they

125
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:51,000
help us use our resources more wisely

126
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,680
and grow food more efficiently and

127
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,919
that's good news for everyone who eats

128
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,440
Alro so there you have it folks smart

129
00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:02,320
irrigation systems a clever way to save

130
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,639
water and grow more if you're interested

131
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,360
in trying out smart irrigation start by

132
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,080
researching systems that might work for

133
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,000
your

134
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,880
