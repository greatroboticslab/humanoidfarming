00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
designed

said

53
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,479
is going to focus on the tools and

54
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,120
resources

55
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,560
available at the farm labor dashboard

56
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,760
i'm going to start with a little bit of

57
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,440
background

58
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,280
then i'm going to give a quick tour of

59
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,200
the dashboard it's going to be pretty

60
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,599
speedy

61
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,120

62
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,280
the resource library

63
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,400
we'll have some time for question and

64
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,440
answers

65
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,840

00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,120
people to chime in so 14 more folks

100
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,360
and mary owes me a sandwich let's do it

101
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:07,120
people we can do this

102
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,760
somebody say it's expensive

103
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,680
yes it is they purchase my business

104
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,560
expense both farm and construction

105
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,320
business so yeah all right so now we

106
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,280
have 13 more to go

107
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,880
and i won't be hungry to improve

108
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:28,720
conditions for farm workers

109
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:32,560
excellent and compassionate

110
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,560
increased productivity nice

111
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,720
it's time consuming to have a continuous

112
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,840
turnover

113
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,840
yes and expensive as mary said

114
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:53,520
hard to find farm labor

115
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,840
uh big uh focus on reducing absenteeism

116
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,840
how

117
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,840
might we be able to do that

118
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,600
to keep young people in iowa or bring

119
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:10,000
families to our small towns

120
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:12,880
repopulate rural america yes

121
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,560
all good i'm going to um move on we

122
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,680
don't have 15 people yet then i owe

123
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,880
marry a reuben

124
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,120
labor is necessary to operate the farm

125
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,440
you keep counting i'm going to all right

126
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,759
you move on

127
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,600
so here was our team's assessment as we

128
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:31,520
came together from our various

129
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,880
um organizations and um institutions we

130
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,320
were seeing that

131
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,639
um that that like you all

132
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,600
noticed or brought out that it's a

133
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,759
significant expense

134
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,759
that for diversified and produce farms

135
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,840
labor costs range between

136
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:51,199
we were finding at the time between 35

137
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,400
and 60 percent of gross sales per acre

138
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,800
and when you're looking at small and

139
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:58,000
medium-sized farms

140
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,720
tight profit margins um having

141
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,520
uh good labor management is really key

142
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,199
to

143
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,400
viability and resilience we were finding

144
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,280
that it um

145
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,000
impacts farm scale and farmer roles and

146
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,160
also

147
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,039
farmers satisfaction with their quality

148
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,240
of life and

149
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:20,319
their business performance um

150
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,560
as people mentioned here scarce lubrical

151
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,319
and the seasonal nature of the work can

152
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,520
make it really hard to find

153
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,919
and keep employees and that redundancy

154
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:33,440
around training can be really

155
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:35,120
tiring for farmers a whole bunch of

156
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,160
regulatory challenges

157
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,680
um uh going back about five years

158
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,360
four or five years ago we were seeing

159
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,800
the labor department

160
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,880
um coming in and people finding

161
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:51,520
themselves owing some back wages

162
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:55,199
um and also a lot of policy uncertainty

163
00:06:51,520 --> 00:07:00,000
associated with things like immigration

164
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:02,240
and administration of programs like h2a

165
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,520
and perhaps the biggest and most

166
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,440
important reason that

167
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,560
we all came together was that farmers

168
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,319
were telling us that they

169
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,160
need to boost their labor management

170
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,520
skills um

171
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:16,560
and knowledge and confidence

172
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,759
um so um the group of people that

173
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,880
mary mentioned earlier all came together

174
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,960
we've worked together on two multi-state

175
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,160
integrated research and extension

176
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,160
projects

177
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:33,280
um and so the research goals

178
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:36,319
are around increasing um

179
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,800
understanding in a variety of

180
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,720
topic areas and the extension goals are

181
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,039
to develop and share

182
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,479
new training education and resource

183
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,160
education resources

184
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,800
to help farmers become more effective

185
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:52,319
labor management managers

186
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,319
and in both um projects basically had

187
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,479
the same series of

188
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,319
activities we did a bunch of interviews

189
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,160
and focus groups and serve and some

190
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,000
survey work with farmers

191
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,199
there was data analysis looking at

192
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,400
themes

193
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,720
and gaps and then all that combined

194
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,960
in the development of tools and

195
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,599
information products

196
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,160
um here's just a quick um showing you

197
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,680
the different

198
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,280
organizations that have been involved um

199
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,800
so as jason discussed in his

200
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,560
presentation yesterday

201
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,720
the research phase of the project looked

202
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,479
at how farmers identify issues in labor

203
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,599
management and

204
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:32,560
he and kayla grouped these topics into

205
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,120
six major themes which you can see here

206
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,880
um

207
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:39,039
and they all are are part of the puzzle

208
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,640
of having good employees getting the

209
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,760
work done

210
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,880
in a timely way and for each of those

211
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,839
six

212
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,720
six themes there's actually um many more

213
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,360
different topics

214
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,800
and issues there's a lot going on i'm

215
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,480
not going to get into the details of

216
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,120
this but as

217
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,320
i bet all of you know it's both

218
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,440
complicated

219
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:04,800
and complex um

220
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,040
and that's the com the context for

221
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,959
how we were thinking about the tools and

222
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,160
resources we wanted to put together

223
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:14,080
in this online resource which we're

224
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,640
calling the farm labor dashboard

225
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:19,440
so right now what we have is a suite of

226
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,800
four interactive tools

227
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,080
we have a resource library more tools

228
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,680
and resources

229
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,440
are coming in the next phase of the

230
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:31,360
project which runs through

231
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:34,800
2022 and obviously

232
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:37,200
it's online and available 24 7

233
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,839
where farmers and people work with them

234
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,160
can access the resources

235
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,200
our content focus has really been on

236
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,240
helping farmers

237
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:50,240
build um skills knowledge

238
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,959
and confidence um to be better managers

239
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,160
to help them adopt effective protocols

240
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,120
and procedures

241
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,680
and to address barriers that they

242
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,680
encounter

243
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,000
we see that it has as mary mentioned

244
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:07,040
before multiple uses the farmers can

245
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,680
access the tools anytime for those of

246
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,120
you who are

247
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:13,200
educators you might be interested in

248
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,040
incorporating them in your education or

249
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,120
outreach programs

250
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,560
and business advisors who work

251
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,920
one-on-one

252
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,680
with farm businesses or a farm team

253
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,600
i think also might find some of these

254
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,079
resources helpful

255
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:31,120
in moving your clients forward with

256
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:34,800
their labor management

257
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,480
so um i'm gonna take you on a quick tour

258
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,839
through each of the tools

259
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,920
um so the first one is called the labor

260
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,519
readiness self-assessment

261
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,160
and um basically it focuses on six areas

262
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,000
planning

263
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,200
recruiting and hiring training and

264
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,720
supervision

265
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,320
recording record keeping record-keeping

266
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,079
taxes and insurance

267
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,440
performance reviews and ending

268
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,760
employment

269
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,399
and the tool provides a summary of

270
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,480
farmers strengths it identifies weak

271
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,200
links and it suggests resources that

272
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,480
will help them

273
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:12,000
address those areas of vulnerability

274
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:15,040
moving forward so it

275
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,800
is divided into 21 questions

276
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:21,360
um and in the six critical areas

277
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,839
um here are some examples of questions

278
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,640
um

279
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:28,240
that that people will be asked to answer

280
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:31,120
and they kind of have the same structure

281
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,839
and all of the questions are required so

282
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,360
you can

283
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:37,519
kind of look at those and based on how

284
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,200
people answer those questions they get a

285
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,640
visual

286
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,360
representation of their relative

287
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,079
strengths

288
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,440
and areas where they can build knowledge

289
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:50,079
and skill

290
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:54,079
and in any area where there's a weakness

291
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:55,440
they would get get some recommendations

292
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:59,040
for resources

293
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,480
to build um to move forward and

294
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,160
we tried very hard in our

295
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,079
recommendations

296
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:08,959
both to go from kind of a asset based

297
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:10,079
both you know really recognizing their

298
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:14,000
strengths that they can build

299
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:16,880
on and the positive benefits

300
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,959
of improving in the areas that might be

301
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,360
seen as weak links

302
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:23,279
so here's one example we have considered

303
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,760
the ways that hiring

304
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,240
employees will change our roles on the

305
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,240
farm

306
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,760
so if there

307
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,079
doesn't show what they selected but for

308
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,519
example if they answered no

309
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,800
we need more information or just

310
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,880
starting they'll get some

311
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,959
recommendations for where to go

312
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,560
um and for this particular question the

313
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,800
recommendation talks about how learning

314
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,959
to be an effective manager

315
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,519
typically requires a mental shift in how

316
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:55,680
we see ourselves

317
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,600
it recognizes where many farmers are

318
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,040
coming from that they got into farming

319
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,800
because they like the work of farming

320
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,760
but also brings their attention to the

321
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,519
challenges

322
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,040
and changes in the roles and activities

323
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,440
that will be necessary to be an

324
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,519
effective farm employer

325
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,279
things like they'll be likely to be

326
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,240
spending more time managing the work of

327
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,680
others

328
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,240
teaching and help others to be

329
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,120
productive and their own time is going

330
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,200
to shift to

331
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,839
doing hiring training record-keeping and

332
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,839
managing

333
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:30,079
so it's optimistic

334
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:33,600
focuses on learning to enjoy new roles

335
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:36,240
and and it sends people to specific

336
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,240
resources

337
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,760
so with that i'm going to shift over and

338
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,199
let um

339
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,480
john lead you through the employee cost

340
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:50,000
estimator

341
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,240
um as he was the major developer of this

342
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,240
tool

343
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,839
here john i think you're on mute john

344
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:09,600
thanks mary now we can hear you

345
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,720
so this is john hendrickson i'm at the

346
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,800
center for integrated

347
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,399
agricultural systems at the university

348
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,680
of wisconsin

349
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,920
um so one of the big

350
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,880
unknowns for a lot of especially

351
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,440
first-time

352
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,160
employers who are considering hiring

353
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,839
their first

354
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,519
uh first person to help them on their

355
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,959
farm is what exactly

356
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,000
is this going to cost and you know the

357
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,959
first thing for

358
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,959
a new employer to learn is that it's not

359
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,360
just the hourly wage

360
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,160
um i guess this is assuming that they're

361
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,040
going to be

362
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:45,120
paying the uh hiring above board and not

363
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,160
just paying somebody cash under the

364
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,560
table

365
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,760
so we built this employee cost estimator

366
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,959
to help people

367
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,560
understand the full cost of becoming an

368
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,760
employer and hiring people

369
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:00,639
on their farm so there

370
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:03,120
uh mary or uh beth you've got control of

371
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,680
the slide so you can advance for me

372
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,680
go ahead

373
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:12,079
so there is a tutorial video on the

374
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,639
website that walks people through the

375
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,480
tool

376
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,560
and in perhaps greater detail than i

377
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:20,000
will do here today

378
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:22,160
uh it is also uh true that there is both

379
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,920
this online version of the tool that i'm

380
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,880
going to be showing you here

381
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,920
as well as an excel version of it that

382
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,360
you can download

383
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:33,759
from from the website as well

384
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,759
okay

385
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,680
so it's not just wages in terms of the

386
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,040
full cost

387
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:43,920
you've got payroll taxes you've got

388
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,680
insurance workers compensation insurance

389
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,880
perhaps you're going to be

390
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:51,279
having to buy you know some farms have

391
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,399
specific tools that are you know these

392
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,720
are your tools

393
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,320
bob or sally and those are yours so you

394
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,360
might be having to buy some additional

395
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,360
things for your employees

396
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,959
might be having providing food or

397
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,560
providing housing

398
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:07,440
for employees you might be offering some

399
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,839
bonuses or

400
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,839
incentives

401
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,720
and there you've got the total cost so

402
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,120
what is that total cost so

403
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,800
this form is designed to walk people

404
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,839
through that process to get to that

405
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:24,639
total cost

406
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:25,759
okay so this is what the estimator looks

407
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,800
like online

408
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,959
uh the first step is to name the report

409
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:35,199
if you want to save it

410
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:36,639
and then you can plug in a job title for

411
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,320
an employee position that you're wanting

412
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:42,079
to hire

413
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:44,800
and then below that is a place to put

414
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:47,040
the hours by month for the different

415
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,360
positions that you might be hiring

416
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,680
and then there is a second tab there so

417
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:55,839
go ahead

418
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:57,600
beth the second tab in that section

419
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,360
after you do the hours is wages and

420
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,959
benefits and this is where you start

421
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,279
with the hourly rate

422
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,480
and then add in all those other items

423
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,439
that you might be

424
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,959
providing whether it's housing or food

425
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,160
or

426
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:14,880
retirement plan perhaps health

427
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,039
or other personal insurance bonuses and

428
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,280
gifts

429
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,400
and a person can use those categories

430
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,959
for you know for

431
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,480
even things that maybe are different

432
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,720
than the titles there as long as they

433
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:31,600
get all the costs and

434
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:34,400
then below that go ahead beth is

435
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,240
first there's a spot to you can do

436
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,600
multiple employees at the same time so

437
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,480
that you see a little button there at

438
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,200
the very top

439
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,960
that says add another employee so you

440
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,960
could add in a whole bunch of employees

441
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,960
and do them all at once

442
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,400
with different hours and different wages

443
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,080
and different benefits

444
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,559
and then at the bottom is where you

445
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:56,640
build in the other costs

446
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:59,200
federal unemployment tax

447
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,160
workers compensation state unemployment

448
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,960
tax

449
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,919
all um social security uh medicare all

450
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,760
those things

451
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,160
now some of these on the federal level

452
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,679
are standardized across states

453
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,320
some of them are obviously unique to

454
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:15,440
states and so this is a place where

455
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,360
a person using this tool very well may

456
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,559
have to do some addition some homework

457
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,240
on their end

458
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,840
in particular in terms of workers

459
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,880
compensation workers compensation

460
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,120
programs

461
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,799
vary widely from state to state in terms

462
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,200
of who is required

463
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,160
to enroll in workers compensation and

464
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,720
the specifics

465
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,480
of how those costs are structured and it

466
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,200
can be quite challenging to figure that

467
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,120
out on your own

468
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,720
we encourage people in the video

469
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,320
tutorial to contact

470
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,640
people like us service providers who

471
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:49,280
work with farmers to answer questions

472
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,520
or perhaps even better to contact other

473
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,960
farmers who are already employers

474
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,400
to find out what are what is a

475
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,679
what is a percentage to put in for

476
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:02,480
workers compensation in my state

477
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,880
you click submit um and one thing i will

478
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,440
note

479
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,240
while we're uh transitioning slides is

480
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,320
that

481
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,520
none of the data that farmers are

482
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,200
entering into this

483
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,240
site whether it's the excel spreadsheet

484
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:16,720
that they download or this online tool

485
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,400
is being collected or analyzed by anyone

486
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,160
it just

487
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,720
the form gets filled out you can

488
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,400
download and print the forms as pdfs or

489
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,919
save them on your computer

490
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:31,039
but they're not being saved on our end

491
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,520
so this is an example where a person put

492
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,600
in

493
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:36,000
uh one field crew person that was

494
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,000
working

495
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,480
1280 hours on the farm at a hourly pay

496
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,160
rate of 10

497
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:46,799
and so their you know base wages is 12

498
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,480
800 but then you build in uh the

499
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,320
benefits that were being offered they're

500
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,360
going to be providing some food

501
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55,840
um and a bonus or a gift

502
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,080
and then building in the fico fuda

503
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,360
workers compensation in suda adds in all

504
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,200
those numbers

505
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,799
and so you have the total cost for the

506
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,720
employee for the year

507
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,880
and then what i think is an extremely

508
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,159
useful number for farmers

509
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,720
is the labor cost per hour this is

510
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,600
important

511
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,400
if you're sending crews out to do work

512
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,520
for you

513
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,480
it's kind of nice to know what the fully

514
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,240
loaded

515
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,080
labor cost per hour that you're paying

516
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,520
for that crew to do that person to do

517
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,520
when you're sending them out to do a job

518
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,080
so we call it an estimator because it

519
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,720
may may or may not

520
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,440
um be completely accurate depending on

521
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,880
how well

522
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,200
you've done your homework in terms of

523
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,320
some of that those factors like workers

524
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,360
compensation

525
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:44,320
um but it does provide a way

526
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,159
for uh particularly a new employer to

527
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,840
get a sense of what the full costs are

528
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,840
going to be for them

529
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,480
great thanks john

530
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,880
so the third tool that is on the

531
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,000
dashboard

532
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:07,440
is this job description generator

533
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,240
um and basically it helps people

534
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,840
um both sort of professionalize and

535
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,520
formalize

536
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:19,120
um and um provide consistency

537
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,679
in terms of creating job descriptions

538
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,600
for

539
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:26,799
the various positions on their farms

540
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:29,840
and there's six basic steps so

541
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:31,200
the step one is that you describe this

542
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,120
is what it looks like when you go there

543
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,919
you describe the over the positions

544
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,679
overall

545
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:40,320
role in the farm business um

546
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:43,520
and so you'll see that there's some

547
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,600
sample language there

548
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:48,799
that helps people get started for

549
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,799
describing their farm

550
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:55,360
and then the next step is to summarize

551
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,559
the major responsibilities

552
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,679
[Music]

553
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,880
and um it's possible to go ahead um and

554
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,880
do some of the

555
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,120
you know some people work from the big

556
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,240
picture and then fill in the details and

557
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,880
some people

558
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,159
um like to have all the details and from

559
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,080
that come up with their

560
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,000
their big picture so for some people it

561
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,960
might make sense to

562
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,400
um skip ahead to the next couple of sec

563
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,159
sections

564
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,159
and then go back and complete the

565
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,320
summary of the position you can see i've

566
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:27,280
highlighted there

567
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,760
um so right now the job description

568
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,799
generator is really focused on produce

569
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,080
farms

570
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:36,320
and it has um a pretty extensive list of

571
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:39,600
different kinds of tasks that

572
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,679
you can choose um for what what

573
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,799
the tasks are that are associated with

574
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,960
that position

575
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,559
and the approximate percentage of the

576
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,720
total work time

577
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:53,200
um and in this slide you can see

578
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,000
that any place that it had that little

579
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,600
plus

580
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
it can open up and there are a whole

581
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,320
bunch of sub um

582
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,400
sub categories of tasks that you can

583
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:06,320
select from

584
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,320
to create your job description

585
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:12,960
the next step is to think through

586
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,799
the qualifications and skills and

587
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,360
experience that are required for that

588
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,360
position

589
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:23,679
and to list the wages and benefits as

590
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:27,360
well as who the person will report to

591
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,360
categorize the type of position

592
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:35,200
and hit submit and when you hit submit

593
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,080
um you kind of get a written you get a

594
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,600
job description

595
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:42,640
you can download it both as a pdf

596
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:45,520
to use as is or as a word document so

597
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:49,360
you could further edit and modify it

598
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,400
um so um so either way works and again

599
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,640
like the job

600
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:58,159
like the estimator it doesn't store work

601
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,039
so you need to to create a new version

602
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,679
you would have to

603
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,679
start over

604
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,760
our fourth tool is a policy manual

605
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,600
generator it's a lot like the job

606
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:13,120
description generator

607
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:18,080
and it provides sample language um to

608
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:20,400
help build a policy manual which um uh

609
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,600
you know is considered an uh an

610
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,360
important part

611
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:28,799
of um of of having a

612
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:30,400
well-run farm letting your employees

613
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:33,440
know

614
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:36,080
what's expected of them um and

615
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,679
having everybody be treated the same and

616
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:41,919
fairly

617
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:45,279
um and um there's a big caveat here

618
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:47,679
about making sure that you

619
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:49,600
check with your state labor department

620
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,640
or your own attorney to make sure

621
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,520
that the policy manual is in compliance

622
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:59,600
with

623
00:24:53,520 --> 00:25:01,840
um your state's laws and best practices

624
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,320
um

625
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,880
so the policy manual generator is

626
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:09,679
divided into 12 topic areas

627
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,440
and each topic area has several items

628
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,640
and in each one there's some sample

629
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:16,400
language

630
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:19,440
that um to get you started um

631
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:22,720
so it gives people an idea of of

632
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:25,120
what what to put into those um slots

633
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,960
because we found that you know just

634
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,440
starting with a blank

635
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:32,080
piece of paper or word document could be

636
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,159
a pretty overwhelming

637
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:37,200
place to start for someone in developing

638
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,880
their farm policy manual

639
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,480
and you can see that there's places

640
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,200
there's either xxx

641
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,120
or a blank which indicates places where

642
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,840
the user needs to fill in the specifics

643
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,840
for their farm

644
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,559
and again you need to download and print

645
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,440
your work and again you get a pdf

646
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,720
version

647
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:59,039
or a word version that you can further

648
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,039
edit

649
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,440
and the final component of the dashboard

650
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,960
is this

651
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:09,039
resource library which is searchable

652
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,320
using we have this filtering factor so

653
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:12,640
you can

654
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,360
search according to topic the material

655
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:18,480
type and the location

656
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:21,760
to look for resources that are pertinent

657
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,760
to what you're working on

658
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,840
so if for example you chose from the

659
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,760
topic of managing employees there's

660
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,760
multiple subtopics you could choose

661
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,480
supervision and then you could decide

662
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,200
what

663
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,039
what material um kinds of material

664
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,640
there's videos there's fact sheets

665
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:41,840
there's some audio

666
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,440
there's um i think maybe whole

667
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,200
curriculum

668
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,679
so you can choose what you're interested

669
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:50,320
in looking at and then the location is

670
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,039
basically the four usda regions so that

671
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,080
would be

672
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:57,520
northeast north central

673
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,520
south and west

674
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:07,279
so the kinds of materials we have

675
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:09,840
there's um we've we're also pointing to

676
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:11,440
existing resources that are available at

677
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,279
other online libraries

678
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,880
um including the agricultural risk

679
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:18,559
management library

680
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:21,679
and the beginning farmer and rancher

681
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:24,399
development program um library which is

682
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,880
called farmanswers.org

683
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:28,399
and as i just said because because we

684
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,320
recognize that different people learn in

685
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:32,720
different ways some things are covered

686
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,799
in multiple ways so there might be a

687
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,679
fact sheet and a short video tutorial

688
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:39,279
that essentially cover the same topics

689
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,760
but we can imagine some people would

690
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:43,360
prefer to download it and read it

691
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,960
away from their screen other people

692
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:48,640
would be much more apt to

693
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:50,640
watch a video there's video

694
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,679
we have some templates of things like

695
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,760
job um

696
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,640
applications that people can use

697
00:27:53,760 --> 00:28:00,840
download put your logo in

698
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:02,960
um checklist for a new employee

699
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,720
orientation

700
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,640
we also work to fill in some gaps so

701
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,120
here's an example of some

702
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,039
simple fact sheets we developed to help

703
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,080
farmers make job interviews more

704
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:15,200
meaningful

705
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,000
more professional and more consistent so

706
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,159
those are easily

707
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:23,200
downloadable and if you were

708
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,960
using the readiness assessment and your

709
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,799
answers there indicated that you didn't

710
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:30,159
have a lot of experience

711
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:32,720
or a formal process for hiring process

712
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,880
they would refer you to these resources

713
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,840
as things you could use

714
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,840
to get you started

715
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:47,440
so um there are also resources

716
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:49,120
related to legal aspects of labor

717
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,159
management most of which were developed

718
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,000
by our colleagues at

719
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,399
farm commons and here's a couple of

720
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,760
examples

721
00:28:54,399 --> 00:29:01,840
um and just to like wrap up

722
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:05,520
tips on using the dashboard tools

723
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:07,200
um so you know if it's your first time

724
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,640
use the instructional information

725
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,559
provided with each tool

726
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,640
regardless of whether you're reading or

727
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:16,000
watching the video

728
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:18,399
take advantage of the sample language

729
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,640
be sure to download your work this one's

730
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:23,200
really important

731
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,000
and let us know what else is needed and

732
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,799
would be helpful

733
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,039
suggestions for your for for

734
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:31,840
farmer-ready resources are really

735
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,840
quite welcome

736
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:35,840
in uh the next phase of our work we're

737
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,520
going to be

738
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:43,760
continuing to look at the way that

739
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,760
labor and mechanization

740
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:50,080
decisions influence

741
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:51,679
and have impacts on investments in labor

742
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,240
equipment and machinery

743
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:58,080
and to integrate what we're finding into

744
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,080
education and resource materials

745
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,840
we're going to be continuing to analyze

746
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:06,880
skill sets farmers need

747
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:09,679
from workers and farm characteristics

748
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,679
farmer workers look for and again

749
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:14,320
integrate all that into our education

750
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:16,559
and resource materials

751
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,799
thanks to funding we just found out

752
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:20,720
about earlier this month

753
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:21,840
we're going to be able to offer a whole

754
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,760
new round of farmer

755
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:26,240
education later this year and in 2022

756
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,840
which

757
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:33,840
will um use many of these resources

758
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,159
and um to to help the education is going

759
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,480
to

760
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:40,080
primarily be offered online both in

761
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,840
online and self-study opportunities

762
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,440
and we're going to continue to develop

763
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:47,039
and test

764
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,039
tools at the dashboard

765
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,440
so one example is to have a tool similar

766
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,559
to the employee cost estimator to look

767
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,640
at the

768
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,600
interrelationships of mechanization and

769
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,240
the amount of kind

770
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,720
and kind of labor that's needed in an

771
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,720
operation

772
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,679
and that is the end of our presentation

773
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,679
so

774
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:11,919
um like to open it up to questions first

775
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,440
um and if we have time then we can move

776
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:16,720
to i think we will to

777
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,960
some more broad-based discussion

778
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,760
so far no questions a lot of compliments

779
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,760
about the tools

780
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,480
can we register to get updates and

781
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:34,240
taking advantage of future phases

782
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:37,840
is a question natalie asks absolutely

783
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:39,679
um so i have your contact information

784
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:42,000
now we have it now and we will

785
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:45,120
definitely use that to continue to

786
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:48,960
let people know what's what's coming

787
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:50,480
what's available i'll throw in that if

788
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,240
you use any tools and you have some

789
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,679
great successes or ways you've used them

790
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,240
and you could share those anecdotes with

791
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,159
us

792
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,679
that would be helpful to us as well

793
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:01,840
including on suggestions for improving

794
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:03,840
one thing that um john had this great

795
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,440
idea when he was looking at his um cost

796
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,440
calculator tool

797
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,360
in conversations with your employees in

798
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,679
any of their reviews or whatnot

799
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,640
potentially using that information to

800
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,120
share

801
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:17,200
hey here is the cost um you know and

802
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,559
here's here's what your hourly wages

803
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,399
given your

804
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:22,000
you know promo csa share vacation

805
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:24,080
whatever have you and

806
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,279
john i won't share any further because

807
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:29,840
you are here but i don't know if you

808
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:29,840
want to expand on that in any way

809
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,880
yeah the notion was that you know one

810
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,559
thing that

811
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:41,519
can be a struggle

812
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,559
for any employer is motivating their

813
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:46,480
employees to

814
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:49,519
be you know productive and effective

815
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,760
uh and contributing to the farm and

816
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,559
you know you as as the farm owner you

817
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,080
know you're you're

818
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,919
living and breathing and you get it how

819
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,840
important it is to

820
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:00,799
to work and get the jobs done

821
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,799
effectively and in a timely manner and

822
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:03,840
it could be more difficult for them you

823
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:06,960
know an employee

824
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:09,120
to to see that so we thought that you

825
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,080
know one way that a farmer could use

826
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,679
that

827
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,600
that information from the cost

828
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:16,960
estimators to share that with their

829
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:20,399
employees that you know i'm

830
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:23,519
yeah i'm paying you 12 dollars an hour

831
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:26,559
but you're actually costing me 16

832
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:29,679
an hour and so it can

833
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:33,919
maybe help impress upon that employee

834
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:36,559
the need for them to be uh productive

835
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,159
uh when they're on the farm is that what

836
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:40,960
you're getting at seth

837
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:42,159
yeah exactly so um somebody asked if we

838
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,919
could put the dashboard

839
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:45,679
website on the ad in the chat and so i

840
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,360
just did um

841
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:49,279
so you could click on that and get to

842
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,600
that thank you john

843
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:53,360
mary tossed about offering a disk

844
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,679
workplace profile as part of our

845
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:58,480
building effective teams

846
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:00,799
that is just simply fabulous and mary is

847
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,799
a great instructor

848
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:05,200
what additional tools are we considering

849
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:08,000
team oh back to john

850
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,399
well i just uh would think it would be

851
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,520
nice

852
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:13,280
for for mary to perhaps briefly exp

853
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,720
for those of us who don't for those in

854
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,919
our audience who don't know

855
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:22,240
what the acronym disc is why don't you

856
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:25,200
briefly tell people well done john

857
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,639
well um so there it's not really an

858
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,480
acronym in that it doesn't actually

859
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,800
stand well it does stand for something

860
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,440
but

861
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:34,000
um it basically is a workplace profile

862
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,599
it's a profile tool in the same way that

863
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,440
myers breaks you might have taken

864
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,679
myers-briggs or you might have taken

865
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,639
colors or you know there's any kind of

866
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,879
different kind of

867
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:44,000
personality assessments that are out

868
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:46,639
there this one

869
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
zeroes in there's a couple reasons why

870
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,320
we like it it zeros

871
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,359
in on this one specifically on the

872
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,359
workplace environment and it helps to

873
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:57,280
help you helps you better understand

874
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,240
basically what are the things that

875
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,000
motivate you

876
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,280
and what are the things that stress you

877
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,280
out and

878
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,280
what kinds of people are your sort of

879
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,040
natural allies in the workplace and what

880
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,880
kinds of people might you have to step

881
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,440
out of your comfort zone to work with

882
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,760
and

883
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,720
you know as managers we have to do that

884
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,079
all the time

885
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,880
and i have done this now with hundreds

886
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,920
of farmers

887
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,880
and it's incredibly accurate they always

888
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,680
love doing it

889
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,320
and it's just it's not it's not all you

890
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,839
have to do

891
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:29,760
it's necessary but it's not sufficient

892
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:31,760
but anyway so the offer i made is that

893
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,520
if you're if you're a farmer and you

894
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,359
want to know about

895
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,800
uh when we'll be offering it next then

896
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:39,760
drop your email in the chat

897
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,599
and we'll stay in touch um if you are a

898
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,280
technical assistance provider or an

899
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:44,000
extension agent and you work with

900
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,920
farmers

901
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,599
and you'd like to partner with us on

902
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,760
offering it then

903
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:52,400
let me know that as well and we're happy

904
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:55,040
to do that so

905
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,560
um it's it's a fun little piece i don't

906
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,400
recommend that we do it during the

907
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,480
height of the season but it's

908
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:04,480
it's a really nice sort of preparation

909
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:07,920
tool going into the training season so

910
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:10,560
so there's that and um beth did you tell

911
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,320
them about the tailgate trainings

912
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,480
i didn't why don't you why don't you

913
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:17,119
share about that okay

914
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,960
we uh one of the fun well i i will say

915
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:20,480
fun and quotations mark because i might

916
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,119
be the only one that actually thinks is

917
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,760
this fun

918
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:25,520
on the team but um one of the things

919
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,000
that we'll be adding under resources

920
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,880
is a series of sort of tailgate

921
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,920
trainings

922
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:36,560
and what those will be

923
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:40,079
is very short training segments that

924
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:42,000
farmer managers can download and use

925
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,280
in their own professional development to

926
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,520
get better or

927
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,599
with their directly with their employees

928
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:50,079
so you know if you're a farmer

929
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:52,240
you've got a staff meeting every tuesday

930
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:53,839
at 10 o'clock and you know you get some

931
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:56,320
coffee and you hang out

932
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:57,440
then it's like this would be a really

933
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,720
cool way

934
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,000
to give you some thoughtful ideas on how

935
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,160
you might structure

936
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,839
a staff training or some topics that you

937
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:09,520
might want to discuss with your staff

938
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:11,440
so and i see we have a disc fan in the

939
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:14,240
audience also indeed

940
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:16,079
um we also have um what is a job

941
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,119
satisfaction questionnaire for ag

942
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,920
workers

943
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:21,520
um which is which is in the works so

944
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,000
that would be excellent

945
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,440
if you interface with mary or beth and

946
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,720
they could send it all out to everyone

947
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,800
when you're done with that that sounds

948
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:31,760
great

949
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,040
so if you have ideas for training topics

950
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,960
if you have ideas

951
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,800
if you have really cool tools out there

952
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,640
as seth said if you there are places

953
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,480
that you use

954
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,880
let us know what they are send us the

955
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:45,040
links um we're not we would love to

956
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,000
house those links on the dashboard with

957
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:49,760
permission and

958
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:52,000
proper credit of course but um

959
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,320
you know we just we want to make this as

960
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,280
useful to farmers as we can possibly

961
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,200
make it

962
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,640
hopefully down the road we'll be able to

963
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,040
branch out and look at

964
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:04,320
livestock based farms as well but that's

965
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:07,920
kind of a different animal so

966
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,920
so to speak so to speak

967
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,160
animal friendly as well and so malcolm

968
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:14,240
sent us

969
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:18,720
uh the questionnaire that they're

970
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:22,560
refining so that's excellent

971
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,560
to beth our techie person for that

972
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:27,520
so yeah so all the tools will be

973
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:30,000
integrated into the

974
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,960
education that we'll be offering in the

975
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
um later

976
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,160
this year and in 2022

977
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,440
um so we'll be providing support for

978
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:40,720
farmers to

979
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:42,560
um to learn about um

980
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:47,119
to learn and to implement changes on

981
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:49,440
their farms we also have a curriculum

982
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:52,960
related to negotiation which

983
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,599
will be incorporated which can be really

984
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:58,160
helpful

985
00:38:53,599 --> 00:39:01,839
um in the employment and management

986
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,839
sphere of their work

987
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,920
so any other questions

988
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,839
not many so far

989
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,440

um which a couple of you are aware of

1012
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:26,240
but we've developed an

1013
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,160
a guide to writing a farm and play

1014
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,920
manual for massachusetts farms with a

1015
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,640
lot of guidance on the massachusetts

1016
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,760
specific laws on that front so that um

1017
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,839
we're actually

1018
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,200
just putting finishing touches on the

1019
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:39,200
web version of that we've had it in

1020
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,040
hardcopy form for a while so that'll be

1021
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:44,400
on our

1022
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:47,040
website bylocalfood.org

1023
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,040
in the coming week hopefully or two

1024
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:52,079
weeks at the most

1025
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:54,400

the link to the

1067
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,200
the future employee manual where it will

1068
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,720
be landing in a

1069
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:38,720
another week or so but yeah you've got

1070
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:41,599
it looks like angela put our our website

1071
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,599
up there thanks angela

1072
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:45,200
and you know beyond just the scope of

1073
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,400
this

1074
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:50,480
um if you have resources that you come

1075
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,079
across that you think are really good or

1076
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,560
would be good models for us

1077
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:56,800
again we would love to know i mean it's

1078
00:42:54,560 --> 00:43:00,000
um

1079
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:03,200
as beth said this labor stuff is

1080
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,440
uh complex and complicated and

1081
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,560
um it's not going to get better any time

1082
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,960
soon i don't think

1083
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,599
but it's um it's a nut that we all have

1084
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:13,280
to crack

1085
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:15,119
so um we would love

1086
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,520
we are hoping that we will be able to

1087
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:19,280
start some sort of a learning network or

1088
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,200
a community of practice or something

1089
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:23,920
around these kinds of issues and

1090
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:25,280
so that maybe we don't have to reinvent

1091
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,839
all the wheels

1092
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,839
every time

1093
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:35,359
so angela's link brings us to your um

1094
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,960
home page

1095
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:38,720
do you want to get us i guess it would

1096
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:41,839
resource farmers that's where

1097
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,839
you i would find it

1098
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,720
a learning network would be appreciated

1099
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,880
that would be actually an interesting

1100
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,880
idea mary

1101
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,000

00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:59,440
that people can reach out to me if they

1104
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,640
why don't you just put your home phone

1105
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,119
