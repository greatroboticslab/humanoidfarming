  "text": "Hey folks, making something interesting today. Uh, one of my favorite uh, dipping sauces now is from Wendy's and it's their uh, their ghost pepper ranch dipping sauce. It tastes great, but it has no heat. If you've ever had Wendy's ghost pepper ranch dipping sauce, you you know the same thing. You know, it tastes really good. It's a really good ranch. It's got just a little bit of heat in the back end, but not not what you would consider ghost pepper. So, I've been experimenting and I think I've come up with a really good um probably better copycat than uh than Wendy's. It's very similar, but uh it's got a little bit more kick, but not too much. It's got just enough to like Oh, yeah. I I I can taste that ghost pepper now, but it won't blow you away. So, here's how I'm going to make it. And then come back and I'm going to give it a try. Here I have a cup of mayonnaise and I'm going to add a uh 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder, 1/4 teaspoon of onion powder, and a half a teaspoon of salt. a tablespoon of dried parsley. A half a teaspoon of paprika. And then the star of the show, the uh the ghost pepper powder. This is a/4 of a teaspoon. This should be plenty, but if you want to really kick it up, you could add a half a teaspoon. And then I got a a half a cup of buttermilk. And I just want to whisk this all together. Get it incorporated. Okay, that looks good. Let's give it a taste. See if we need to make any adjustments. Uh, yep. It needs It needs more salt. Yeah. Yeah, definitely needs more salt. Okay, let me add some salt. I'm going to add another half a teaspoon or another 1/4 teaspoon actually. So, that's about, you know, almost a teaspoon of salt. So, let's see what that tastes like. Okay. Okay. Salt is perfect. There we go. Okay. Let's let it refrigerate and give it a taste. Okay, here's how it turned out. I portioned it out into a little container for dipping. This is what my ghost pepper ranch looks like. Here it is. Wendy's. They look looks very similar. I think Wendy's is just a tad bit orer, maybe a little bit more paprika. But, uh, that's the two side by side. Okay. Let's let me taste mine first. Give a good dunk. Got to go in again. Another dip. Definitely has a really good ranch flavor and so much more heat. It's it's not overwhelming like I I was mentioning. It's really it's it's right on you. You know that that ghost pepper is there. You can taste it. You can taste the ranch. You can taste the ghost pepper. And uh Wendy's nuggets are pretty darn good. Let me taste uh one of the nuggets here with the uh the Wendy's ghost pepper just for a comparison. Very very similar. Yeah, it's good. It just doesn't doesn't have the heat level. I have to say one thing about the Wendy's has a little bit more of a a vinegar flavor. So, I think the mayonnaise they use might have like vinegar in it. So, that being said, make this recipe with Duk's mayonnaise and you'll get a lot closer to that that vinegary flavor. Dukes. I should have thought of that in the first place. Well, there you have it, folks. Want to really kick up Wendy's uh ghost pepper ranch dipping sauce? Or you could cut it in half. Add a eighth of a teaspoon. And uh you could actually add a half a teasp. You could really kick it up is what I'm saying. That that ghost pepper um that ghost pepper powder was fantastic. And it's just pure ghost pepper. I'll put a link in the description box below where you can order that on Amazon because I couldn't find it anywhere. Well, there you have it, folks. Thanks for watching. [Music]",
