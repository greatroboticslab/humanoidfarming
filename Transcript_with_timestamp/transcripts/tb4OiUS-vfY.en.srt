00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,880
Hello everybody welcome back to our

2
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,160
farming simul 25 tips and tricks video

3
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,519
today we're going to talk about all

4
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,280
things goats goats are a new animal to

5
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,960
the Farming Simulator franchise with

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:39,000
respect to Farming Simulator 25 but they

7
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:41,360
are extremely similar to sheep so if you

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,760
have played Farm Sim in the past and you

9
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,800
have kept sheep well goats are going to

10
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:50,039
fall pretty much under the same general

11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,039
requirements as sheep had

12
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:55,359
previously to that end if you take a

13
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,440
look at the animal menu with respect to

14
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:59,399
the animal pins you're going to find

15
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,039
that sheep and goats are going to share

16
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:05,040
the same buildings so if we come in here

17
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:07,759
to build mode we come down to animals

18
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,320
and we toggle over to sheep these are

19
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:14,799
going to be able to support our goats as

20
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:17,159
well we have four different base game

21
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:20,240
buildings we're talking about here an

22
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:24,320
open sheep pasture that's going to hold

23
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,040
19 sheep or goats by default and it is

24
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,640
also going to require us to deliver not

25
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:31,920
only food but also water now the rest of

26
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,159
these buildings they are going to supply

27
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:40,320
water themselves we have one for $48,000

28
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:43,960
this going to hold 26 sheep or goats

29
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,920
$51,000 and it's going to hold 26 sheep

30
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,719
or goats just a different style of

31
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,880
building and then the larger pin which

32
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:56,320
is going to hold 68 sheep or

33
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,159
goats something new to farming simil 25

34
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,360
is also the introduction of what they

35
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,960
call dynamic pastur

36
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:07,079
Dynamic pastures allows us to

37
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:10,280
reconfigure the shape and capacity of

38
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:12,200
our animal pins as we place them down so

39
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,720
let's demonstrate how this works with

40
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,760
this large sheet pin that in its base

41
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,720
configuration is set for 68 sheep or

42
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,680
goats we're going to place it down right

43
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,879
here and we're going get a prompt do we

44
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,720
want to customize the fence for our

45
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:30,720
sheep Barn large yes we do and now you

46
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:33,440
can see we have the build down but no

47
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,760
fence because now we have the ability to

48
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:39,040
place our fence so what we're going to

49
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:43,319
do is well we're just going to build out

50
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,319
a big rectangle why

51
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,120
not and we're going to bring it back to

52
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,640
our pasture you'll see that it's just

53
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,599
going to snap into

54
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,720
place and then it says do you want to

55
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,680
plant Meadow grass for your sheep Barn

56
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:03,599
yes sure and there we go now we have our

57
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06,720
sheep Barn down we have a very large

58
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,360
pasture planned out and if we come over

59
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,799
to this

60
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,680
building we're going to see by coming to

61
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:16,080
the Paul icon this is going to be where

62
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:21,159
we can load or unload our animals we now

63
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,159
have the capacity of 113 sheep or

64
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,360
goats now this is a really neat feature

65
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,280
and while in this demonstration I just

66
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,159
simply made a giant rectangle

67
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:36,280
you could conform this to the land and

68
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:39,360
or landscaping around your farm so you

69
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:42,040
can make your way around trees you can

70
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,360
make your way around field edges

71
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,640
roadsides whatever you want you can do

72
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,280
this up on hillsides it's really going

73
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,480
to add a whole lot of customization to

74
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,480
the

75
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:57,760
game the next thing we need to talk

76
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,159
about is how do you get your animals

77
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,280
well there's two real ways to get your

78
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:03,439
animals you can either buy them directly

79
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,319
here at the pin or you can go down to

80
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:08,120
the animal dealer and buy them from

81
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:09,840
there and transport them to your farm if

82
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,079
you buy them directly from the animal

83
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,680
pin since we are talking about goats

84
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:16,079
today we're going to scroll all the way

85
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,799
down to the bottom and we can buy goats

86
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,359
in either one of three different ages we

87
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:24,680
can buy newborn goats at an age of zero

88
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:26,360
months for $200 a goat if we were to do

89
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,720
that we would double click on this we

90
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,240
would scroll up to a particular number

91
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,479
that we wanted to do and you can see how

92
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,400
much money it's going to cost us with a

93
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:38,639
small delivery

94
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:42,759
fee let's go ahead and buy those

95
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:44,759
in now we can select 3mon age juvenile

96
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:48,039
goats and they are going to be a little

97
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:50,240
bit more costly at $38 a piece we can do

98
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:53,240
the same thing we can click here once

99
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,720
this is selected we can either tick up

100
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,039
or if we wanted to fill the whole thing

101
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,120
we could just tick down and that's going

102
00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:01,680
to show us the available capacity I

103
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,639
would C though not to fill up the Sheep

104
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,479
pen because you won't have room for them

105
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:09,400
to reproduce when the time comes so

106
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,400
let's go ahead and buy these

107
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:16,320
in and then we have our oldest goats our

108
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,639
mature goats at an age of 16 months

109
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,400
they're going to be the most costly

110
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:22,759
because they're going to start producing

111
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:25,199
goat milk in large quantities right

112
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:27,560
away we can buy those for

113
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,560
$777 and again we're going to buy just

114
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,560
10

115
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,919
now let's talk about our goats goat ages

116
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,919
reproductive cycle Etc so our 16-month

117
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:44,800
old goats they're going to be our adult

118
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:47,280
goats you see they have a age of 16

119
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,720
months as I mentioned goats also have a

120
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,319
puberty period of 16

121
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,560
months so once a goat reaches 16 months

122
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:56,759
it's going to be able to start to

123
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,280
reproduce and there is a gestation

124
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:02,160
period of 5 months which means at this

125
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,840
point forward these 16-month-old goats

126
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,599
as they continue to

127
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:10,440
age will reproduce one for one every

128
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:12,160
five months so 5 months from now we will

129
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:16,599
have

130
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:19,000
20 or we have another 10 Z Monon old

131
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:21,080
goats those zero month old goats now

132
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,039
will be 5 months old and the three-month

133
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:27,120
old goats will be 8 months old 5 months

134
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:29,599
after that we'll have another newborn

135
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,400
set of goats 10 because well our

136
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:35,880
16-month old goats will have produced

137
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:38,560
again and the cycle will just continue

138
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,960
when our 3month old goats reach the age

139
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,919
of 16 months well they will start

140
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,199
reproducing as well and then our zero

141
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:49,479
month old goats again once they reach 16

142
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:52,680
months they will start reproducing also

143
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:56,440
visually we have three different

144
00:06:52,680 --> 00:07:01,080
well models of goats we have our newborn

145
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:04,360
goats we have our juvenile goats

146
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,360
and we have our adult

147
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,720
goats so here we go

148
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:12,360
newborns

149
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,680
juveniles

150
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,680
and our

151
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:24,080
adults as the goats age their visual

152
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:27,240
representation will of course change our

153
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:30,120
newborn goats will change to be the same

154
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:33,280
visual appearance as juveniles when they

155
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:35,440
reach an age of 3 months our juveniles

156
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,599
will stay that appearance until they

157
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,720
reach the adult age of 16 months at

158
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:43,199
which time then they will visually

159
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,680
change their

160
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,280
appearance let's jump over to the animal

161
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,120
dealer now and talk about what it would

162
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,639
take to purchase animals there and

163
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:55,599
deliver them to the

164
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,960
farm over at the animal dealer which on

165
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,639
riverin Springs is going to be located

166
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,560
right here right across the street from

167
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:03,639
the shop and our starting Farm is

168
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,639
located right here of course depending

169
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:07,759
on the map you're on the location of the

170
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:09,599
animal dealer will vary one thing that

171
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,759
won't be though is that Kate will be

172
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,440
here ready to answer any questions that

173
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,800
you might have but really we don't have

174
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,960
any questions for

175
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,960
her we're going to come over here to our

176
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:23,680
animal trigger and we're going to make

177
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:25,720
use of the flegal ttw 140 animal

178
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,120
trailer let's take a look in our vehicle

179
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:31,280
shop we're going to scroll down to

180
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:33,839
animals and in the animals section

181
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,640
there's going to be an animal transport

182
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,360
for transporting our goats we're going

183
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:42,039
to either need the Noah ttw 140 or the

184
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:44,600
Wilson Silver Star Trailer Silver Star

185
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:46,560
will either require a semi or a fifth

186
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:50,720
wheel Dolly meanwhile the no will

187
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,720
connect either to a truck or

188
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:56,200
tractor once we are positioned inside

189
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,120
the trigger we're going to be able to go

190
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:02,160
into our tractor we can hit R and R will

191
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:06,880
now allow us to either load onto or if

192
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:08,760
we tackle this switch to load off of the

193
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,959
trailer since we don't have any on the

194
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:14,399
trailer we can't offload right now we're

195
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:16,399
going to toggle over to our sheeps and

196
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,240
goats we're scroll down to the bottom

197
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,720
list and you can see once again these

198
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:25,240
prices are the same as they were at the

199
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:29,000
farm but in this case we do not have a

200
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:31,800
delivery fee we can store a total of 13

201
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:36,880
goats into this trailer so let's go

202
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:38,760
ahead and buy just 10 $7,777 zero

203
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,640
delivery fee because we are bringing our

204
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,399
own

205
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:46,959
trailer and we now have purchased those

206
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:50,279
and you can see that they are in the

207
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:52,600
trailer just like we can buy animals

208
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:55,760
here at the animal dealer we can also

209
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,279
sell them back so if we have had

210
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,079
reproduction to the point where now we

211
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:05,399
are over full we are at our capacity on

212
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:05,399
our pastures let's pull that

213
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:14,040
up right we are reached Max Capacity on

214
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:16,839
our pin we just cannot at any point in

215
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:19,680
time hold more therefore when our goats

216
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:22,480
reproduce we're losing we're losing

217
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,240
goats right when it fills up our goats

218
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,440
will reproduce they just won't spawn

219
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,839
anywhere yeah tell me about it it's kind

220
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,279
of interesting any rate

221
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,160
what we need to do is we need to thin

222
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,880
out the herd there's a couple ways to do

223
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,560
that we can either put down another

224
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,800
pasture and move our goats from one

225
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:43,399
pasture to another using our trailer or

226
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,680
we can load goats onto the trailer bring

227
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:47,560
them down to the animal dealer and sell

228
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,560
them back to to sell them back we're

229
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:52,480
going to come here to our menu like we

230
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:54,760
did to load onto but we're going to

231
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,600
toggle this switch which is then going

232
00:10:54,760 --> 00:11:00,200
to say we want to sell

233
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,920
from now do note we're not going to get

234
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:06,760
nearly the price that we

235
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:09,279
sold for our animals as we paid for them

236
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:12,079
but with respect to reproduction those

237
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:14,399
were basically free animals

238
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:17,040
anyway so getting a little bit of money

239
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,040
is going to be

240
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:23,079
helpful now with respect to what do our

241
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,360
goats eat well let's hit escape and

242
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:27,560
let's jump back here to our animal menu

243
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,680
and we can see from this information

244
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:33,760
screen that our sheep are going to

245
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:35,480
either take Meadow grass or grass or hay

246
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,399
so Meadow grass would be the grass that

247
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:41,680
is growing

248
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:44,360
within the pin and hay or grass would be

249
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:47,600
in the format of either Bales or loose

250
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:49,639
material brought to the pasture so we

251
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,800
have three different types of bales that

252
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:54,560
I've got here just to visually

253
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,680
demonstrate we have small baby Bales I

254
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,519
call them small square

255
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,959
bales then we have the larger square

256
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:05,399
bales these come in three different

257
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:08,120
sizes of which this is the medium size I

258
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:10,519
believe and then we have round bales and

259
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,920
again this is the medium size they come

260
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:15,279
in three different sizes I have here

261
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,320
bales of hay but you can also bail

262
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,480
straight

263
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:22,120
grass and typically to feed

264
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,240
your goats you're going to be presenting

265
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,720
the bail to the feed

266
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,800
trough and the bail is just going to

267
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,959
basically be consumed within the feed

268
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,079
trough and it's going to

269
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:36,519
vanish you're going to be transporting

270
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,959
your Bales typically with a front loader

271
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:40,279
you can either use a front loader like

272
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:43,320
this a self-propelled variety or you can

273
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:45,440
get front loader arms for your tractor

274
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:48,480
and make use of it that way we're going

275
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,639
to find these here under loaders so we

276
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,040
have our front

277
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:55,480
loader we have front loader arms that we

278
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:57,760
would attach to our tractor we have then

279
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:01,480
front L tools like a pallet fork and

280
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:04,760
bail Spike we could also use a tandler

281
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,880
or a skid steer if we wish to and then

282
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,560
also they're going to have the

283
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:13,160
corresponding pallet fork and bail

284
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:15,959
Spike for each of their Associated

285
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,720
Vehicles so here we have the bail Spike

286
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:19,720
here we have the pallet fork and we're

287
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:22,839
going to need the pallet Fork because

288
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:26,079
our goats are going to spawn pallets of

289
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:28,399
milk we going need a flatbed truck or

290
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:31,399
trailer of some sort in order to

291
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:35,079
transport our milk and possibly our

292
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:37,839
bales from the field to the farm so here

293
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:39,880
I have the international CV series and

294
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,079
we could take these sides down load up

295
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:44,800
our pallets of milk on this because

296
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:48,000
we're going to either transport our milk

297
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:50,519
to either the base game Dairy that is

298
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,440
either pre-placed on the map or one of

299
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:54,160
these two placeables which we'll talk

300
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:57,480
about in a little

301
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,600
bit for the open sheep pasture I

302
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,880
mentioned that they require water so if

303
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,880
you have placed that down you're going

304
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,040
to need to have a water tanker you're

305
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,800
going to find the water tanker under

306
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:10,040
Vehicles once again down here under the

307
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,120
animal section we have barrels and we

308
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:15,279
have four different trailers that are

309
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:18,480
going to be able to transport your water

310
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:23,399
I have the 1600 version right

311
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,399
here and then for loose

312
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:29,320
material well I want to jump up on here

313
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,320
come on

314
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,639
for loose material you'll need some sort

315
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:39,160
of trailer

316
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:41,920
or forage Wagon in order to transport

317
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:45,120
your loose grass or hay we have here the

318
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:47,519
farm Tech fdk 650 and it is loaded up

319
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,839
with a load of

320
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,680
hay because there's two of different

321
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:55,000
ways to feed you can either feed as I

322
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:57,360
mentioned in bail or loose format now

323
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,720
there is currently as a version

324
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:03,279
1.2.1 of the game an interesting bug

325
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,360
with this building here on the right it

326
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:09,360
does not appear to accept

327
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,920
Bales meanwhile the other pastures do so

328
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,399
the only way to feed this particular

329
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:15,959
building is going to be with loose

330
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:18,399
material again as of version

331
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:21,079
1.2.1 if you're watching this video and

332
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:24,480
the game has been subsequently updated

333
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:24,480
then this issue may be

334
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:32,079
corrected you can see once we add our

335
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:32,079
pay in here if we look inside our

336
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:39,839
building this hates you can see that we

337
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,839
have hay now in that trough

338
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:48,040
inside in addition to hey I mentioned

339
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,680
that our animals are going to be able to

340
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,920
feed from the meadow grass that is

341
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,279
within the

342
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:55,519
pin typically meadowgrass is going to

343
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,040
take a little bit of time to register

344
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,160
from the time that you have placed it

345
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,399
down so what I'm going to do is come

346
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:05,040
over here and go ahead and fast forward

347
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:09,160
into September and we should see now

348
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:12,199
Meadow grass appear on our food

349
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:14,279
charts good morning everybody it is now

350
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:16,079
September and if we check our animal

351
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:18,759
screen what we can now see that we have

352
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:22,839
Meadow grass appearing for all of our

353
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:25,319
pins we have a health of 60% don't worry

354
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:28,399
about that it is slightly affected

355
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:30,160
because of September we didn't feed this

356
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:33,399
particular building but we're going to

357
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,279
see in other screens that we have 100%

358
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:37,560
but any rate we have Meadow grass and we

359
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,120
have a capacity this is that big pen

360
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:42,759
that we put down

361
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:45,680
1983 L and our sheep within this are

362
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:48,560
going to be consuming Meadow grass until

363
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:51,000
winter at which time the grass will die

364
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,680
back and we'll need to then basically

365
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,959
make sure we are definitely feeding hay

366
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,959
to all of our animals otherwise their

367
00:16:55,959 --> 00:17:02,040
health and their productivity will

368
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:05,000
suffer we toggle over to our next pin

369
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:09,240
well here we have our large pin that had

370
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,839
17 no 10 adult sheep they are now 17

371
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:15,199
months old because one month has passed

372
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:18,039
they had grass or hay already supplied

373
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:20,319
for them so they have 100% health so if

374
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:22,760
you want to maximize your animals

375
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:25,520
productivity feed them right away don't

376
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,640
just count on the meadow grass being

377
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,840
there for them we can also see that we

378
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:32,720
are 20% into our reproductive cycle as

379
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,799
we move every month this is going to

380
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,880
jump 20% because it's 5 months until we

381
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:40,600
reach 100% and at that point in time

382
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:42,760
we're going to see 10 newborns also

383
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:46,280
appear in this building and then our

384
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:50,200
reproductive will go back to

385
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:53,559
0% the Sheep Barn are newborns are now

386
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:55,720
one month of age they are 6% through

387
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:58,919
their puberty cycle remember they have

388
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:01,799
to reach an age of 16 months before they

389
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:03,320
ready to reproduce and we once again we

390
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:05,080
have our metal grass showing up we have

391
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:07,919
our grass showing up and a total

392
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:11,320
productivity and health of

393
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:14,559
100% we can see this continue now these

394
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:16,799
goats they didn't again have any grass

395
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,679
fed to them so their productivity and

396
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,600
their health is down they're not

397
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:23,520
reproducing at all because well their

398
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:25,799
health isn't maximized out so again in

399
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,120
order to maximize your

400
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:31,159
productivity go ahead and have on hand

401
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:33,480
some hay to feed these guys when you

402
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:36,240
first put them

403
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,400
down then we have our sheep pasture or

404
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,480
open sheep pasture we still are good

405
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,919
with our water capacity we fed them a

406
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,120
little bit of grass from that small

407
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:46,760
baale and our Meadow grass so they are

408
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:49,080
doing fine as

409
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,360
well now back to the shop because I

410
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:53,480
mentioned you want to make sure that you

411
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:56,480
can feed these animals from the outset

412
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:58,440
and if you don't have hay right away

413
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,679
well you can come here to the shop and

414
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:03,000
you can actually buy it in which is

415
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:07,280
pretty neat so to do that we're going to

416
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:10,480
come down here to objects category Bales

417
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:13,320
and we can buy square bales of hay round

418
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,159
bales of hay and you can pretty much

419
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:18,840
just decide which bail do you want to

420
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:21,320
buy how many Bales do you want to buy

421
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,080
with a total of up to eight and if we

422
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:25,240
buy these they're going to spawn over

423
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:30,039
the shop we'll need to come and then

424
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:30,039
transport those back to the farm

425
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:36,000
now that some time has passed we also

426
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,679
can talk a little bit about what do

427
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,919
these guys produce well they produce

428
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:44,799
goat milk and goat milk is going to

429
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:47,440
appear on pallets of these milk jugs and

430
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:50,280
when the pallet reaches 1,000 L it will

431
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:53,240
be full and another pallet will spawn

432
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:55,679
until it's 1,000 L the capacity of this

433
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:59,320
pallet will just keep increasing right

434
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:02,520
now we have 164 L of goat milk in in

435
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:06,320
this pasture in our larger pasture where

436
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:09,039
we placed 10 of each size

437
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:11,280
goat we also have our

438
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:14,799
milk but you're going to notice it has

439
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,480
just 24 L of milk well the reason for

440
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:19,760
that is remember we didn't feed these

441
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,600
guys so they went a month without being

442
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,320
able to eat so they've only been able to

443
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:27,039
eat since September when that meow grass

444
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:29,799
was registered again it really holds

445
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:32,400
that we should feed our animals at the

446
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:33,679
start make sure they maintain them being

447
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,640
well

448
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:39,360
fed our newborns as should be aren't

449
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:42,039
producing any

450
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:45,240
milk but what's interesting is our

451
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:47,320
juveniles are now in my opinion that's

452
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,240
just a bug and that should be fixed out

453
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,360
juveniles should not be producing milk

454
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:54,960
we shouldn't get any milk until our

455
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:57,080
animals are at full age and here we have

456
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,360
another set of animals that are full age

457
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,919
again goat milk is only 20 leaders

458
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,679
because we didn't feed these guys

459
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:03,679
anything

460
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:09,640
either so as I mentioned our juveniles

461
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:11,799
do produce

462
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:15,480
milk a little bit of milk we have a

463
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:18,240
whole six lers of milk but we have milk

464
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:20,640
nonetheless now this also may be patched

465
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,200
in a future game update where juveniles

466
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,200
don't produce

467
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:28,720
milk when we get our pallet of milk well

468
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:31,400
what do we do with it well we can sell

469
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:34,600
our raw goat milk at the dairy if we do

470
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:38,000
not own the dairy or if we own the dairy

471
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:40,400
we can produce either bottled goat milk

472
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,039
or we can produce goat cheese so here we

473
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,559
have a bottled goat milk pallet and here

474
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:48,440
we have a pallet of goat

475
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:51,559
cheese we have two different placeable

476
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:53,799
dairies within the base game or we have

477
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:56,000
depending on the map you might have a

478
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:58,799
dairy already

479
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,679
pre-placed we do not have a dairy

480
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:05,600
available as far as a production there

481
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:09,320
is a dairy available that is a cell

482
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:12,039
point but it is not a productive point

483
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:14,760
so that is something to take note of you

484
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:16,919
may or may not have a production Dairy

485
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:20,960
on your map if we look at our prices

486
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:24,760
screen and we come down here to our goat

487
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:27,000
milk sell our goat milk at the dairy

488
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,799
this is going to be the cell point on

489
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,039
the map

490
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:34,440
or we could take it to the dairy if we

491
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:36,799
own the dairy and use it in our

492
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:40,600
production on this map since we have a

493
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:42,480
warehouse we could buy milk in but don't

494
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:45,640
it's it's never going to be profitable

495
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,679
to buy goat milk in in order to run it

496
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:50,880
through a

497
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,799
production you see our raw goat milk on

498
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,720
easy economy is going to have an average

499
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:59,480
low price of

500
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:01,559
7,614 per th000 liter to 9,220 2 per

501
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:04,039
th000 liter again if you're on normal or

502
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:07,080
hard economy these prices will be

503
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:09,360
different our bottled goat milk which is

504
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,559
an output of our production can be

505
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,520
either sold at on riverin Springs

506
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:15,960
Farmers Market Co crest valley train

507
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:19,799
sell point the restaurant or the small

508
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:23,120
farmers kiosk just up by the road and

509
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:25,600
the average low price is going to be

510
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:29,559
5,697 meanwhile the average high price

511
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:32,640
is going to be 6,900 again on easy

512
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:34,400
economy our goat cheese again based per

513
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,520
thousand lers is going to have an

514
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,200
average low of

515
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,279
4752 or an average high of

516
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,400
5754 and it's going to be available for

517
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:44,159
sale again at the farmers market train

518
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,760
sell Point restaurant or the small

519
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:49,320
farmers

520
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:51,919
kiosk let's take a look at our

521
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:53,760
production chains that we own we're

522
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,159
going to be able to bring our raw goat

523
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:58,440
milk to our production chain and we're

524
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:02,720
going to be able to produce bottled milk

525
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:04,720
at a ratio of 1 to two so for every 10

526
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:08,320
units of goat milk we bring we're going

527
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:11,440
to make 20 units of bottled goat milk so

528
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:15,320
imagine 1,000 L of goat milk in equals

529
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,919
2,000 L of goat milk out bottled with

530
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:19,039
respect to the small production we're

531
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:23,320
going to be able to do that in cycles of

532
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:24,799
14.4 cycles per month the larger placed

533
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:28,120
Dairy well it's going to be able to

534
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:30,320
Output 10 times that at 144 cycles per

535
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:32,200
month

536
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,279
our goat cheese is going to take three

537
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:37,440
units of goat cheese for six units of

538
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:39,480
goat cheese or sorry three units of goat

539
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,919
milk for six units of goat cheese so

540
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:44,440
again we are doubling and we're going to

541
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,720
do that at 960 cycles per month for goat

542
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:50,520
cheese at the big Dairy meanwhile it's

543
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:53,440
going to be just 96 cycles per month at

544
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:55,679
the small Dairy so in all regards the

545
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:59,520
small Dairy is going to produce at

546
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:03,159
1/10th the speed of the large

547
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,919
Dairy so hold on this is me post

548
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:07,240
production coming to you while I'm

549
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:10,120
editing this video I noticed that we can

550
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,919
also make standard butter with goat milk

551
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:14,559
that wasn't in the Giants information

552
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:17,120
with respect to what goats are good for

553
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:19,480
so with respect to butter we're going to

554
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,679
take three units of goat milk and it's

555
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:24,279
going to make 10 units of standard

556
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:26,720
butter that's at our larger Dairy which

557
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:28,840
is going to be able to do 744 cycles per

558
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,799
month the smaller Dairy is going to be

559
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:32,799
able to take three units of goat milk

560
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:35,640
and produce 10 units of butter but it's

561
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:39,600
going to be only able to process at

562
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:42,159
74.4 cycles per month and now on with

563
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,159
the rest of our

564
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:48,000
show so guys that is just about it I

565
00:25:46,399 --> 00:25:50,840
think that wraps up everything you need

566
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,360
to know with respect to goats and how to

567
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:56,440
car for them here in Farming Simulator

568
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:58,760
25 where to place the goats the fact

569
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:01,679
that you can customize your PIN and make

570
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:03,880
it larger and suit your area as you

571
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,840
should so fit with the use of the new

572
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:09,039
Dynamic pastures feature how to buy your

573
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:12,159
goats either here at the farm or at the

574
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:14,000
animal dealer with a trailer what to

575
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:17,399
feed your goats and how to feed your

576
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,320
goats either by Veil form or by loose

577
00:26:17,399 --> 00:26:22,640
form and then

578
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:25,720
basically what goats will produce how

579
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,919
often goats will reproduce and then

580
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:31,679
where we can take our goat output in

581
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:34,880
Goat milk and either produce additional

582
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:36,880
products with it or sell it if it is

583
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,600
available for sale I'd love to know your

584
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,159

586
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:48,520

587
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,520

588
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,640
