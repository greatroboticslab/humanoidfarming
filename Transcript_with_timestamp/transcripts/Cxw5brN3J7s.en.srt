00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,400
welcome to good works tractors

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,639
guys how we doing today we are going to

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,240
compare category 1 quick itches

4
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,560
versus category 2. so you're going to

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,920
see a cat one on both of these outside

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,119
machines right here

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,960
you'll see them in red these are all

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,240
speako quick hitches you're also going

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,439
to see one tucked down here as well

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,560
we'll get to that in just a minute

11
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,160
so if you're in the market for a quick

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,439
hitch or you just want to make it easier

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,599
to attach your three-point

14
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,640
implements right up to your tractor pay

15
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,920
attention stick around

16
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,960
watch this maybe it'll save you some

17
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,320
money maybe it'll save you some

18
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,000
frustration we have two different

19
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,280
category one quick hitches and then

20
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,960
over here we're gonna have a category

21
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,399
two quick hitch so the main difference

22
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,840
besides the color between these two

23
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,680
quick hitches right here

24
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,120
both being category one as this is going

25
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,840
to be the really popular version that

26
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,320
does not use

27
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,680
bushings you can see this right here for

28
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,680
any attachment that you have with a

29
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,640
traditional style of quick hitch

30
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,320
you're going to need to put a set of

31
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,520
bushings on every implement so if you

32
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,559
have a box blade

33
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,320
a rear blade a ballast box a tiller a

34
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,600
brush hog all that kind of stuff

35
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,359
you need to get a set of these bushings

36
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,799
to put on every single attachment and

37
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,560
that can get really expensive

38
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,799
with a quick hitch like this you avoid

39
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,280
this no more bushings required it's a

40
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,439
direct

41
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,280
pin size here i don't know the answer

42
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,880
why bushings have been required for

43
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,040
years and years on all the traditional

44
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,640
style of category one quick hitches but

45
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,240
no more you don't need it however when

46
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,759
we get into the category two

47
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,840
sizing you are going to have to use

48
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,000
bushings there's not an option

49
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,680
for a direct pin fitment on the category

50
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,119
two so you need a set of these

51
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,119
or sometimes you have the kind of the

52
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,799
clevis hook on a three-point hitch

53
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,479
where you have two pieces of steel and

54
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,759
then a pin in between there

55
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,680
you'd have a different style of bushing

56
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,640
but regardless a bushing is going to be

57
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,759
required

58
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,759
so how do you know if you need a

59
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,439
category one or a category two

60
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,880
well it's pretty simple really so when

61
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,479
you think about a category one that's

62
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,159
going to be what's on your tractor the

63
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,880
three-point hitch that's back there

64
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,040
and so if you have a 10-25-hour or even

65
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,640
all the way up to a 40-66-r

66
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,399
that's all going to be category one

67
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,119
equipment so sub compacts and compact

68
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,119
tractors

69
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,640
once you're starting to get into five

70
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,000
series tractors like this

71
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,680
utility tractors that's when you're

72
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,360
gonna be into category two

73
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,600
you're even gonna see some that are a

74
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,440
cat one cat two kind of

75
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,800
little crossover type of thing there it

76
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,360
can get a little bit tricky with one of

77
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,879
those

78
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,239
stick around to later in the video or

79
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,920
read the description below as well

80
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,680
you'll want to pay attention to all the

81
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,599
dimensions the left to right spacing the

82
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,680
up to down spacing even the gaps in

83
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,280
between the arms of the quick hitch

84
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,480
check that against what you have on your

85
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,040
machine there to make sure it's going to

86
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,879
work for you

87
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,080
so whatever category your tractor is

88
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,599
means that's going to be what size

89
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,519
attachments hook up to it so if you have

90
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,879
a category 2 machine like this one here

91
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,800
you're going to hook up category 2

92
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,160
attachments same thing if it's a cat 1

93
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,360
machine you're gonna hook up category

94
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,879
one attachments to it

95
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,640
these two category one quick hitches

96
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,400
here are gonna weigh right around 70

97
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,680
pounds give or take an ounce or two

98
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,040
when you get up to the category two

99
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,200
that's going to weigh in at a whopping

100
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,800
134 pounds how we've been shipping out

101
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,360
these category one quick hitches is

102
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,640
going to be

103
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,000
wrapping them up we don't put them in a

104
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,440
box we don't do anything like that we've

105
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,400
had really good success just wrapping

106
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,319
them up with

107
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,000
corner protection and bubble wrap and

108
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,519
shrink wrap or stretch strap and sending

109
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,519
them out ups ground

110
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,040
once you get up to the category 2 though

111
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,239
it starts to get a little bit cumbersome

112
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,000
to try to wrap that up

113
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,280
and have ups come here and pick those up

114
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,200
so i think what we're gonna do

115
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,519
is start shipping those out on a really

116
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,920
small pallet if you can find a location

117
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,840
a commercial loading dock or maybe even

118
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,360
have it picked up at a shipping terminal

119
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,560
those are gonna be the cheapest ways to

120
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,440
ship these products right here the

121
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,720
category two

122
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,720
so in particular if you're thinking

123
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,159
about getting a category two we're all

124
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,599
gonna be shipping a pallet there anyways

125
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,239
if you wanna fit some other products on

126
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,000
there like

127
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,280
wheel weights suitcase weights maybe a

128
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,080
set of pallet forks something along

129
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,239
those lines

130
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,360
it can be really economical and be a

131
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,799
really good savings going to a

132
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,400
commercial address with a loading dock

133
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,040
or even picking up at the destination

134
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,400
terminal

135
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,760
give you a real quick rundown here of

136
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,360
what these quick hitches include they

137
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,879
are all a little bit different on what's

138
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,159
included i don't know why

139
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,640
the most popular version here the

140
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,159
category one e hitch by spiko is not

141
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,599
going to require any bushings therefore

142
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,959
no bushings are included

143
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,560
the other goofy thing is it doesn't

144
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,000
include a top pin one of these can be

145
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,959
purchased from like a tsc

146
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,239
farm and flee online on amazon very easy

147
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,599
it's just a pretty standard pin here

148
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,799
that you have in the top but just want

149
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,159
to make sure you know about that over

150
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,519
here on the more traditional style of

151
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,200
category one quick hitch

152
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,360
you are gonna have a set of bushings

153
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,959
that is included you are also going to

154
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,879
have the top pin here

155
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,400
and then even this little funny looking

156
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,239
contraption right here which is called a

157
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,920
floating top link adapter

158
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,840
this is really designed to be used in

159
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,639
place of a top hook it'll kind of hang

160
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,519
down like this

161
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,040
and you can hook up maybe a non quick

162
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,960
hitch compatible attachment to it over

163
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,639
here on the category 2 quick hitch you

164
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,240
are going to get a set of bushings again

165
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,759
like this and if you have the clevis

166
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,280
style that has again the two pieces of

167
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,040
steel with a pin in between

168
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,320
this doesn't work on there but there are

169
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,759
a lot of attachments out there that do

170
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,600
use this style of bushing

171
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,120
you are also not going to get that top

172
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,479
pin on this version either

173
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,680
so make sure you pay attention it's

174
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,199
gonna be a little bit bigger pin size a

175
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,560
category two pin size

176
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,400
that you wanna have for your category

177
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,080
two quick hitch this video idea came

178
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,320
about because of a lot of questions from

179
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,199
customers that have or want a solution

180
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,600
maybe to

181
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,120
having a category one and category two

182
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,600
quick hitch compatible

183
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,960
quick hitch and i don't really know a

184
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,320
product that exists like that and that's

185
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,320
where the dimensional spacing

186
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,840
really comes into play it's true that a

187
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,479
lot of the the quick hitches out there

188
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,000
require

189
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:09,440
bushings on there that are going to size

190
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,639
it up to a category 2 or category 3.

191
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,479
talking about these things right here

192
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,240
they take if it's a category one pin

193
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,560
that's on your attachment they size it

194
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,000
up to something larger than that however

195
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,680
there's spacing that's involved that

196
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,960
becomes a real issue that's what we're

197
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,880
going to talk about now

198
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,400
so here's where the challenge lies is

199
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,120
particularly

200
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,720
particularly the lower dimensions okay

201
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,360
you're inner to inner out of the outer

202
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,000
doesn't matter

203
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,400
on a category two quick hitch your id

204
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,759
okay

205
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,960
from inside to inside is 32 and three

206
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,560
quarter inches

207
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,039
you bounce over to one of these category

208
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,880
1 quick hitches it's going to be 27 and

209
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,960
a quarter a full 5 inches

210
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,320
narrower or larger but a 5 inch

211
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,000
difference there and so that's going to

212
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,080
be why a category 1

213
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
attachment doesn't fit into a category 2

214
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,680
quick hitch and vice versa you

215
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
also have variation between the lower

216
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,039
links to the top links on the category 2

217
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,759
here it's going to be

218
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,880
just a hair under 15 inches from the

219
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,000
bottom link down here

220
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,560
to the top link on the category 2 it is

221
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,360
welded in place this top hook presumably

222
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,120
to add more

223
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,360
structure rigidity strength to the

224
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,639
overall system on the category one quick

225
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,639
hitch you're gonna have a range for that

226
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,199
top hook you know a max height a lowest

227
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,800
point

228
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,319
you're gonna have basically 14 and a

229
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,160
half inches at the minimum

230
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,000
to and a 17.5 inches so you have three

231
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,039
inches of play room wiggle room from the

232
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,400
bottom to the top

233
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,240
gonna give you a couple quick dimensions

234
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,360
here both on the hooks and then also

235
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,199
back to the id

236
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,400
on the inside of where you would mount

237
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,280
one of these quick edges to your

238
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,039
three-point hitch

239
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,560
on a category two quick hitch these

240
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,880
hooks measure

241
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,440
about one and three quarter inches wide

242
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,759
over on the category one

243
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,840
these links are going to measure oh just

244
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,360
shy of one and a quarter inches

245
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,960
the last dimension i want to give you is

246
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,720
actually going to be the id right in

247
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,479
here where the quick hitch attaches to

248
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,240
the three-point arm

249
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,440
and this question or this dimension i

250
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,479
guess i'm giving it to you because i've

251
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,400
had a few folks

252
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,080
that have actually had a stabilizer arm

253
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,840
that doesn't come back and tie in

254
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,680
somewhere mid-point on the three-point

255
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,520
arm it actually comes all the way out

256
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,440
and would tie in with a pin right up

257
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,800
here kind of unusual and it took me a

258
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,240
little while to catch on to that

259
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,240
but they were concerned about having

260
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,840
enough space inside here to not only

261
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,360
have the three-point arm come but also

262
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,880
their stabilizer arm come up

263
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,560
and fit in there and then have a pin

264
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,840
slide through and connect it all so if

265
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,840
we take a look down here

266
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,360
on the inside of a category one quick

267
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,960
hitch your id

268
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,400
of where that lower link is gonna go in

269
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,039
there is gonna be

270
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,800
an inch and not even three quarters

271
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,280
probably an inch and

272
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,960
11 16 it looks like over here on a

273
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,919
category two quick hitch we take a look

274
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,240
here at the id

275
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,280
and you're gonna have about an inch and

276
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,319
seven eighths

277
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,680
not quite 15 16. well hopefully that

278
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,080
helps you know again if you have a

279
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,879
category one tractor even as large as a

280
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,800
4066 r or something equivalent to it

281
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,479
it's category one it's really simple get

282
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,000
yourself one of these guys or if

283
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,759
if you want to use the bushings go ahead

284
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,840
and get one of these down here

285
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,759
down to a little 10 25 little subcompact

286
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,120
doesn't matter kubota mahendra massey

287
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,639
coyote you name it they're all going to

288
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,520
use those category 1.

289
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,360
if you're into a larger utility style of

290
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,080
tractor category 2 that's going to be

291
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,280
what you want

292
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,440
unfortunately there's going to be that

293
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,599
small gap that's kind of a crossover

294
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,960
you get to some of the smaller 5 series

295
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,560
like a john deere

296
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,479
50 45e something like that or an mx

297
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,000
series in kubota something equivalent to

298
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,240
that you're going to have that category

299
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
1 category 2 crossover

300
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,240
if you have category 1 attachments and

301
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,520
also category 2 attachments you're going

302
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,599
to have to get really creative on

303
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,360
finding a solution to make them all mate

304
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,399
up with one quick hitch again because of

305
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,000
the spacing

306
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,599
it's not only spacing that's on the

307
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,320
quick itches here it's also spacing

308
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,399
that's on the

309
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,680
corresponding attachments that you had

310
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,640
that hook up to the three point

311
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,399
now don't forget goodworks tractors.com

312
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,000
go ahead check them out on there

313
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,120
shoot me an email we can place the order

314
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,240
with you we ship them all over the

315
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,600
country all the time

316
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,680
these smaller ones again we can ship

317
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,519
them ups ground right to your house

318
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,959
you get one of these category twos it's

319
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,480
gonna have to ship on a skid

320
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,160
a small skid you know if you can find

321
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,760
that commercial address or

322
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,440
the the local destination terminal to

323
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,399
pick it up at those are typically your

324
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,000
cheapest options

325
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,320
if you want to maximize the shipping

326
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,600
savings stack a lot of stuff onto that

327
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,120
same little skid there

328
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,320
and you'll really minimize that savings

329
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,200
when you spread it out across all the

330
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,720
equipment you're buying

331
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,240
if you would take a second give a thumbs
