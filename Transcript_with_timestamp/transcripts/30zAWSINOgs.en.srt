00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:05,580
hey y'all it's Betsy with happily ever

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:08,760
after Etc and welcome back to another

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:12,240
Garden project so today I'm going to be

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:15,000
working on my drip irrigation system I

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,400
have a whole series of uh videos showing

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,619
you how to install a drip system from

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,500
adding it to your faucet putting it

8
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:25,320
through your garden beds and even using

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,920
it to water your pots but while drip

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:31,140
irrigation is fabulous for watering when

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,540
you're gone or even while you're home

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,340
you can set it up on a timer it will

13
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,980
automatically water every single plant

14
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,300
on your property just like mine does you

15
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,280
might be able to hear mine actually

16
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,940
because all of my pots are currently

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,160
running on my porch my window boxes my

18
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,379
stock tank Garden around the side which

19
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,940
is currently a beautiful butterfly

20
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:53,820
garden

21
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,079
it does need to be looked at sometimes

22
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,360
so today we are going to be

23
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,879
troubleshooting a few of the most common

24
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:03,840
problems that you can get with your drip

25
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:06,240
irrigation so first one is clog strip

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,580
irrigation once you've installed your

27
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,920
drip I like to come out at least once a

28
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:14,220
day if not every couple days and just

29
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,979
look at the Garden first of all it's fun

30
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,740
to watch and see things grow and Bloom

31
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:22,799
and if we're not out here enjoying our

32
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,780
Gardens what's the point of having them

33
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,939
but while you're enjoying your garden

34
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,460
you may also start to notice problems

35
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:32,759
before they get so big that you can't

36
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:36,180
fix them so our first problem are these

37
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:39,960
two pots you may have noticed like I did

38
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:42,720
but this one is big and beautiful and

39
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:46,140
blooming and bushy and that this one's

40
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,000
not bad but it is a little far behind so

41
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,759
for a couple days I just thought well

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,439
this one must be getting more sun he's a

43
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,500
happier pot

44
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:57,720
then I started looking into why else

45
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:01,079
besides Sun might this one be a little

46
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:03,659
behind and take a look

47
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,740
the drip irrigation is not running in

48
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:07,079
this pot

49
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,539
now the drip for this these two pots

50
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:13,739
comes up from the wall under my window

51
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:16,440
boxes around and into both of these pots

52
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:18,480
so it hits this pot first and this pot

53
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,180
second so the fact that this pot is

54
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,780
running means water is running past this

55
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,879
pot and just not into the pot now I

56
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,340
plugged these last year so sometimes you

57
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,980
do need to replace emitters on a yearly

58
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:35,040
basis even if your most of your tubing

59
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:38,220
and uh connectors are going to last you

60
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,180
quite a while so I took a look and short

61
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,060
enough

62
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:45,120
I see water

63
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:49,500
coming out of the back of this tube but

64
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,420
not into the actual emitters of this so

65
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,519
what I'm going to do

66
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,019
is we're going to cut this off at the

67
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,140
base here and we're going to see if

68
00:02:55,019 --> 00:03:00,180
water is coming out of it if it is all

69
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:02,720
we need to do is add new emitters around

70
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,720
the base

71
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:14,459
it's making a funny noise I was just

72
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,900
checking it's fine

73
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,760
I hope can you guys hear the kids

74
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,099
playing behind me

75
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,159
if it is not coming out of my black

76
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:25,080
quarter inch tube here then we will have

77
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:27,840
to just keep following it further back

78
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:31,140
along the drip line until we come to the

79
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,659
source of the problem so first most

80
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:36,360
common issue with your drip irrigation

81
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:38,640
is something getting plugged and having

82
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,099
to replace it the easiest way to do that

83
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,799
is to clip out to the offending emitters

84
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:46,500
and add in a new one which is why drip

85
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:49,140
irrigation is so much nicer than a

86
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,780
soaker hose or a regular hose instead of

87
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:53,280
having to replace the entire hose or

88
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,440
splice it together with a metal

89
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,260
connector which will eventually be a

90
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,720
weak spot we can slice in a new piece of

91
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:03,360
tubing and it is not a weak spot it is

92
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,099
just a continuation of the old system so

93
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,980
let me bring y'all in and show you this

94
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:09,900
and then we will move on to fixing our

95
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:14,220
second problem

96
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:15,299
all right so moment of truth let's go

97
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,220
ahead

98
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:19,440
and you can see

99
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:22,979
that there is water coming out right

100
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,600
here so I'm going to guess

101
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:28,340
that when we cut this there will be

102
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,340
water coming out of the black tube

103
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:34,280
hardly one-handed there we go yep

104
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:43,320
sorry y'all I'm a mess so there is

105
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:46,680
there's water coming out of this tube

106
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:48,120
so that means

107
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,699
that

108
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,100
I set this to turn off in a minute so it

109
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:55,380
should be winding down so that means

110
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:58,320
that somewhere

111
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:00,600
after the end of this black tube is the

112
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,180
problem so instead of troubleshooting

113
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,580
all three of the emitters in this pot we

114
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,800
are simply going to remove this ring and

115
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:10,320
add a new one

116
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,900
all right let's go ahead and we're just

117
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,720
going to cut it right here

118
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:18,800
take this

119
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,800
this tube out

120
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,960
and now we are going to measure a new

121
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,960
piece

122
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:42,780
[Music]

123
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:45,300
ta-da

124
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:48,740
put in a little emitter

125
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,740
and add it into our pot

126
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,500
and the black tubing

127
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,060
and connect the circuit

128
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,440
perfect

129
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,060
now because this was only two or three

130
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,400
small emitters I figured it was easier

131
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,080
just to cut out all three of them and

132
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,900
replace all three emitters with new

133
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,900
tubing if this was a block

134
00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:01,500
and one of my larger drip tubes say in

135
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:03,840
my garden bed I would want to find the

136
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,699
emitter that was not working cut that

137
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,639
emitter out and replace just that

138
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:10,259
section of tube with a new section

139
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,900
for now

140
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:14,759
we will consider this guy fixed I'm

141
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,440
going to go ahead and water him and then

142
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:18,600
I will keep watching them over the next

143
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:21,479
couple days if he continues to struggle

144
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,639
we can always add an extra emitter to

145
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:24,539
this pot he might need to want more

146
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:27,680
water

147
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:27,680
than his friend

148
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:33,720
and that's okay too

149
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:35,160
some plants like these impatients need a

150
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,099
little more water when these were

151
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:40,280
struggling I came in using a length of

152
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:42,660
black tubing and I added an extra

153
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:45,720
sprinkler head emitter

154
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:47,880
to these three M patients now instead of

155
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,800
wilting they are filling in this one's

156
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:52,740
almost tripled in size since we planted

157
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,300
it and they are doing fabulously so

158
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,340
individual water

159
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:59,819
one of the best parts of a drip system

160
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:02,460
so if our little petunia doesn't perk

161
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:05,720
back up we will give him his very own

162
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:09,000
large emitter these are great because

163
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:12,000
they are a 1 to 10 gallon ratio meaning

164
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,460
if I turn it smaller they get less water

165
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,940
if I turn it bigger they get more water

166
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:20,160
and we can really customize

167
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:22,440
how much water they get

168
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,740
let's go ahead head on to the porch for

169
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:27,900
our next issue all right y'all so my SAT

170
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:31,199
lavender plant it's on The Struggle Bus

171
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:34,620
he is wilting really hard and I noticed

172
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:37,020
a few days ago that he was so

173
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,880
waterlogged he could hardly handle it so

174
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:41,640
we're going to go ahead and put some

175
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:44,700
drainage holes in the bottom of this pot

176
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:47,700
I thought he had some but I actually uh

177
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:50,459
was wrong he has none this guy does he's

178
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:52,440
draining just fine and there is space

179
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:56,360
underneath where water is getting out

180
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,360
but this guy is just

181
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:02,940
just literally waterlogged and so

182
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,680
yeah we're gonna go ahead and all I'm

183
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,940
gonna do is kind of bring him to the

184
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,760
edge

185
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:13,220
and I'm going to try drilling a whole a

186
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,220
few spaces in the bottom of this box

187
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:20,160
wish me luck

188
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:22,740
I'm sure there are

189
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,820
eight million better ways to do this but

190
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,820
this is the one I'm doing

191
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,780
[Music]

192
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:44,060
there we go

193
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,300
is one

194
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,519
honestly I'm going to go ahead and let

195
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,060
this drain completely as much as it can

196
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:59,160
and then I will drill two more holes on

197
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:01,200
the other two sides

198
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:05,120
hopefully this guy will be much happier

199
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,120
when he's not drowning

200
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,100
let's go ahead and just leave this guy

201
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,100
and we'll be back

202
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:52,200
[Music]

203
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,420
all right that is three new drain holes

204
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:57,180
for our lavender you can tell that he is

205
00:10:54,420 --> 00:11:00,360
really wilting even more than yesterday

206
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:01,920
at the beginning of this video I was

207
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,040
drilling the holes in the bottom of this

208
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,779
guy and he took so long to drain that we

209
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,540
lost the light so it is now the second

210
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:12,540
day but we've got three drain holes in

211
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:15,120
the bottom and hopefully he will be

212
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:17,459
fixed before you know it but that is the

213
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,980
second problem that I often find with

214
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:23,040
drip irrigation if it is not too little

215
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:26,279
water it's too much water so if your

216
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,600
plant is not is wilting but you really

217
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:29,220
can see

218
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,279
this guy's starting to have the same

219
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:34,140
problem water sitting on top of the

220
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:36,660
surface and not draining down through

221
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,560
then the problem is probably too much

222
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,120
water

223
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,820
you can solve this a couple of different

224
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,560
ways in a pot like this one you can

225
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,660
drill some drainage holes so I will

226
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:48,660
probably do some for this guy

227
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:51,660
just in a second thought he had some

228
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:54,240
maybe he doesn't have some either

229
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:57,180
I think I would check these things

230
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,339
don't do as I say not as I do

231
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:01,800
in the landscape if you are over

232
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:04,019
watering with say an emitter of some

233
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:07,260
kind you can always remove a few

234
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:09,360
emitters near that plant or turn down

235
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,040
the emitters if you're using a

236
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,839
adjustable emitter

237
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,360
some plants especially once they're

238
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:17,279
established are very drought tolerant

239
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,380
and need a lot less water in years two

240
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,019
three four five than they did in their

241
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:24,899
first year so they start wilting and the

242
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:27,480
problem is not not enough water problem

243
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:30,120
might be too much water

244
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:33,480
cut some out and see if that helps

245
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:36,660
we're gonna go ahead head up The Path

246
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:41,360
over near our brand new Popstar hydranda

247
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:41,360
and work on the third issue

248
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:47,820
okay so the third issue I am always

249
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:50,399
having with my drip system is adding

250
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:53,760
drip to a new location

251
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,500
if like me you already used three or

252
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,380
four different zones off your front

253
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:01,860
faucet two zones off your back closet

254
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:05,160
you may not want to add a new Zone a new

255
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:07,800
filter a new project for every single

256
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:11,579
area in your garden we're at my front

257
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:13,980
garden I have one Zone on the left of my

258
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:16,980
front door one on the right

259
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:20,639
this area around my tree is a third Zone

260
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:23,279
and my fourth zone is all of the pots on

261
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:27,420
my porch the two white pots that we just

262
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:30,600
did by my bid and all of my window boxes

263
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:32,100
so when you're running a drip system you

264
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,339
want to keep the area you're doing

265
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:38,940
fairly concise the further you run your

266
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:41,000
drip tube the harder it's going to be to

267
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:45,000
get the water all the way to the end

268
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:48,000
anytime you can run a closed circuit the

269
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,459
easier the water will have from going

270
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,740
from point A to point B instead of going

271
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:55,260
all the way along one line and having to

272
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:57,660
reach the end it can go down two lines

273
00:13:55,260 --> 00:14:00,560
meet in the middle and the constant

274
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:03,779
pressure will keep the water going so

275
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:07,019
when I added these little plants to the

276
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:10,740
right of my oak tree garden bed I went

277
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:13,019
ahead and I trenched right here a line

278
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:17,760
through the rocks and I brought my water

279
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:20,040
over to these four plants in doing so I

280
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,560
have reached the end of a line so the

281
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,820
water comes from my faucet all the way

282
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,120
along my house

283
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:30,000
trenched underneath to my garden bed I

284
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,579
did trench it in two places so it comes

285
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,740
all the way across the front of my house

286
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:37,560
splits and goes in two places and comes

287
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:40,139
in at the top and bottom of this garden

288
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:44,040
bed to completely cover the entire guard

289
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:46,940
event at the moment it's only going from

290
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,940
right down here

291
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:53,399
across

292
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:55,800
and then it hits one two three four

293
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:57,720
plants I still want to add one more

294
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:00,000
planter to the top of this little

295
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,920
grouping if you haven't watched the

296
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,320
video for these plants I am trying to

297
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:07,199
create just a little hedge right here

298
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:10,560
that will stop your eye fill in with big

299
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:12,779
plants these get six by six ten by four

300
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,180
these are big plants that will create a

301
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:18,860
hedge but that also means big plants

302
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:21,600
they need lots of water so right now

303
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:24,480
instead of continuing to get all my

304
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,540
water from this one spot all the way

305
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:30,180
over and instead of putting four plants

306
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:32,940
on a whole new drip system I'm going to

307
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:35,760
go ahead I'm going to tap in right here

308
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:39,120
I'm going to trench across and I'm going

309
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:42,240
to make this another circuit so that the

310
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,699
water can come from this circuit all the

311
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,339
way around with even pressure or come

312
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:50,519
across meet in the middle and that will

313
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:54,060
help my plants get more water use easily

314
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:56,579
without the system working so hard and

315
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:59,760
that is my third tip when you are adding

316
00:15:56,579 --> 00:16:01,579
a new system to an existing system or a

317
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,899
pot where you didn't have a pot before

318
00:16:01,579 --> 00:16:06,000
instead of creating a whole new system

319
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:09,120
and you have to work with what you have

320
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,160
work smarter not harder

321
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,720
and you can only put in one drip line

322
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,339
goes on the top

323
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,320
I don't know why I trenched out the

324
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:18,240
bottom of the hill going uphill is

325
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,459
always hard

326
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,800
so we're gonna go ahead I'm going to

327
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:25,260
move some rocks I'm going to trench

328
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:28,260
across and we will lay black quarter

329
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:31,079
inch tubing from our system all the way

330
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:33,660
across and then we will connect in good

331
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:35,699
job biddy to the tubing by our brand new

332
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:39,920
pop star hydrangea

333
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:39,920
then we will have water for days

334
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,759
well it is so humid out here today

335
00:16:51,030 --> 00:17:10,440
[Music]

336
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:26,629
[Music]

337
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,020
all right so we've got our trench dug

338
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:39,660
and now

339
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:43,799
we've used our little tool here to pop a

340
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:45,900
hole in the large half inch drip tube

341
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:49,220
and we're going to pop our quarter inch

342
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,220
drip tube right into that hole

343
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,299
ta-da connecting the two pieces

344
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:02,280
we've trenched underneath my edging

345
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:04,320
now we're going to lay the quarter inch

346
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:06,360
tube all the way down where we will

347
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,799
connect it to the pop star

348
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,799
and fill in the trench

349
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:28,620
and as much as I want all of my drip

350
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:31,320
tubes covered by dirt eventually I do

351
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:33,120
leave the ones with emitters exposed at

352
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,799
least for a little bit until I'm sure

353
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,480
that they are working all the plants

354
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:39,000
aren't getting enough water and that

355
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,320
I've added emitters or New tubes like

356
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,480
this

357
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,740
everywhere they need to go

358
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,559
now we're gonna have to work a little

359
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:48,660
faster because uh this water just turned

360
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,280
on

361
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,900
let's go ahead and get it connected and

362
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:55,640
then we will get it buried

363
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:58,740
let's go start coming out in this box

364
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:02,280
there we go yep

365
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:05,220
now all we need to do here is we can

366
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:08,900
we should be able to yeah cinch it

367
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,900
at least for now

368
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,860
all right

369
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:21,380
sometimes

370
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:27,799
have really good plans

371
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,580

373

[Music]

374
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:13,449
[Music]

375
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:21,299
all right so I've got this guy trenched

376
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:23,520
in all the way over here my very last

377
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:25,320
step will be to connect it to the

378
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,919
existing drip

379
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,919
so

380
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:35,280
[Music]

381
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,620
right over here

382
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:40,640
I have a drip tube with a two gallon

383
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,640
drip emitter

384
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:48,080
we are going to Simply cut into that

385
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,080
splice this guy in

386
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,520
let's go ahead and add in a tea

387
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:12,720
we'll add this section right back to the

388
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:15,620
other part we cut and our new piece will

389
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,620
attach right here

390
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:32,659
thank you

391
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,260
I did have to turn the water off for

392
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,600
this or else

393
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:42,620
we'd be getting one

394
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,620
that's all right

395
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,340
turn it back on in a second

396
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:11,100
I am using landscape staples to kind of

397
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:15,240
hold the the drip tubing down in place

398
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:17,520
so that it doesn't get all moved around

399
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:21,020
but for the most part the dirt in these

400
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,020
areas will hold it in place

401
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,100
and since this is a walking area not a

402
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:35,120
driving area

403
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,120
it'll be fine

404
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:42,679
got our tube

405
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:42,679
and connect it

406
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:02,340
all right so now I have my two gallon

407
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,020
emitter going right to the root ball

408
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:06,960
of my plant

409
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:10,620
I've got my tea that is going to lead

410
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:14,400
right in to the drip tube for my other

411
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:17,240
plants you can see the emitters there

412
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:21,059
at the base of the Rose of Sharon

413
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:26,299
and we will simply cover over

414
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:26,299
the strip tube so that it is not showing

415
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:30,020
and we're good to go

416
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:36,600
like we were never here

417
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:38,520
and there it is my top three tips for

418
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:41,340
fixing problems with your drip

419
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:43,380
irrigation you are troubleshooting make

420
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:46,080
sure you have eyes on your system every

421
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:48,299
day watch your plants listen to what

422
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:51,419
they need so they have too little water

423
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:54,179
too much or do you need to add a bit

424
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:56,220
more irrigation a few more emitters to

425
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:58,799
have your system work easier and your

426
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:01,620
plants get the amount of water they need

427
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:03,780
I hope this helped you good luck in your

428
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:05,880
garden I will see you in the next video
