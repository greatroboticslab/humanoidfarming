2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:08,340
this farm has been passed down through

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,470
the family for a long time it's a part

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,080
of us it's a part of our family it's a

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:17,340
part of me it's a part of my kids so it

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,860
means a lot to us my great-grandfather

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:22,890
started and he had Hereford cattle back

8
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:27,920
in those days and cattle have always

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:32,009
been a part of this area in this farm

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,780
back in the early years cattle had their

11
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,270
places in the past year and they'd be

12
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,820
put in a pasture as the grazing season

13
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:41,820
began and that would be where they would

14
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:45,450
be at until it was time to come off and

15
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:48,210
I think now it's totally away from that

16
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:51,090
we start according to the grasses that

17
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,710
are available and indifferent and we're

18
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,110
gonna call them traps instead of

19
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:58,260
pastures now because we we've cut them

20
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:00,780
down into smaller acres we will graze

21
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,520
early season grasses earlier in the

22
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,519
spring and then the warm season grasses

23
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:08,340
during the summer time and then we go in

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,969
and start utilizing some aftermath

25
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:14,399
grazing and some cover crop grazing on

26
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:16,340
into the fall and maybe even into the

27
00:01:14,399 --> 00:01:18,920
winter months

28
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:21,320
whether is a little in unpredictable up

29
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:24,680
here and I think everybody's getting a

30
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:27,560
lot more broad-minded about being able

31
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,479
to utilize not just the production of a

32
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,420
cereal grain crop but also the

33
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:34,490
byproducts that can be utilized from not

34
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:37,400
only the production of that crop but

35
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,290
opportunities for cover crop maybe after

36
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,510
that crops harvested and especially

37
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:44,000
useful when they enhance each other and

38
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:46,610
in the system where your corn wheat and

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,340
beans is your rotation you graze say you

40
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:52,520
plant a cover crop or even the residue

41
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:55,160
of say the corn and you're grazing your

42
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:58,520
cow herd out there increasing microbial

43
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:02,140
activity through the whole system to me

44
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:04,940
resilience longevity enters into that

45
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:06,740
quality of the environment and that goes

46
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:09,739
right along with water holding capacity

47
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:11,180
of the soil and microbial activity and

48
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:13,760
the soil and the production you're

49
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:17,180
getting off of it and still maintaining

50
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:20,720
the level of quality in the soil along

51
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:22,260
with also being a profitable entity for

52
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,340
the farm
