  "text": "[Music] Just when I thought spring had arrived for good, we woke up to a blanket of snow. The kind that doesn't stay long, but reminds you that the seasons change slowly in layers, not all at once. that hill. Head high and shoulders [Music] back. Watching you was such a [Music] thrill. All [Music] from the beginning of the April, I started working at our local garden center. Again, it's a small place full of green life, soil, and that quiet hum of people who love plants. It's still early in the season, and the mornings are cool, sometimes even frosty. But there's something special about watching the place come back to life. Most of the work is simple. Moving plants, sweeping gravel, tiding displays. It's physical in the best way. Your hands stay busy, but your mind gets to breathe. There's a quiet written to it. Birds hung in the background. The smell of soil and wood. A little green signs of life all around. I learn something new every day here. About plants, yes, but also about patience, presence, and the pace of nature. It's a kind of slow magic, and I'm grateful to be part of it. [Music] Hold [Music] back. We were running on that open shore. No saddle's [Music] back. I never felt so free before. All that I could do is laugh. I couldn't hold it back. I couldn't hold it. I couldn't hold it back. I couldn't hold it back. I couldn't hold it. I couldn't hold it [Music] back. They're lay beneath the canopy. on the gilded forest path when an ecasy came over me. And all that I could do is laugh. All that I could I couldn't hold it. I got to hold it back. [Music] How can I hold it back? How can I hold it? How can I hold it back? [Music] From our head to toes, we are standing in the overflow. On the weekend, we took a trip to the city. We've been wanting to plant a row of tuya trees for a while now. Something about evergreens feels like a quiet protection. They grow slowly but steadily, just like we do. [Music] the silver moon, dancing like a [Music] maniac. Then we raced each other to the room. All that I could do is laugh. All that I could I could back. I couldn't hold it. I couldn't hold it. I couldn't hold it back. [Music] We also picked up a few other small things. Oil for the terrace, crocs, cleaning supplies I was running low on, and a few gardening tools. I love this part of spring when everything feels like a fresh start, even inside the home. Then we loaded up the car and headed home. I was already imagining how the toyas would look once planted. How they'd sway in the wind and stand tall over the years to come. I hold [Music] it. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] I've been trying only crying a time do telling myself somehow we will make it through. I believe you and me, we're going to be fine. [Music] You've been saying maybe we should just be friends. All this whole black knots of rope has made a mess in between everything that we have. [Music] Back home, we got to work the next day. We've been dreaming about planting this for a while now. A soft little green wall along the edge of the driveway. There's something so grounding about planting trees. They ask you to think long term to believe in the years ahead. It's a quiet kind of hope. We spaced them carefully, gave them deep holes, and tucked them in with fresh soil, a lot of water, a pat on the root ball, and they were home. They don't look like much yet, but that's the magic of it. You plant something small, and with time it becomes something you couldn't imagine not having. [Music] It's hard to believe that we're coming undone. Getting over our fears while we're under the [Music] gun. There's no making sense of the things that they [Music] say. I know it better than that. [Music] Anyway, I've been thinking maybe you should come back home. We can tell them we're just seeing how this goes. Everyone thinks that they know better. All along we had it all again. [Music] It's hard to believe that we're coming undone. Getting over our fears while we're under the [Music] gun. There's no making sense of the things that they say. I know we're better than that anyway. [Music] I've been thinking maybe you should come back [Music] home. The places that be you cut through the noise. I wish I knew. I wish I knew what you were thinking of. One last drink before it's time to go home. I had my chance, but I screwed it up once more. It's been years and it still kills me. Your time might be pretty. Hold on. Don't let me down. Hope you feel it. Just give me a sign. I don't know. I know it over. You feel it right. So until next time. Hold on. Don't know. Let me go. I want to see through the sto. So until next time. Lost in the crowd, but yeah, you drown out the sound. I wish I knew. I wish I knew what you were thinking about. Is this thing in my head delusion or till I die? Babe, at least wasted a chance, right? It's been years still kills me. Your time might be pretty. Hold on. Don't let me down. You feel it too. SC over. You feel it too. So until next time. Hold on. Let me go. I want to see through the [Music] slo. So until next time, I'll leave alone just like that. I'm back to being sober. We'll leave it all inside cuz this way will never be over. You leave alone just like that. You're back to being sober. you feel it. There's something about pansies that feels like a gentle invitation to spring. They're small but bold, braving the last chills of the season with their little faces turned up towards the sun. They're one of the first flowers I always reach for this time of year. Hardy enough to handle a surprise frost, yet bright enough to bring real color back into the garden. I love tucking them into containers by the front door or slipping them into bare spots in the garden beds. It's such a simple way to live up a space and remind yourself, yes, the gold days are ending. They come in so many shades, deep purples, soft yellows, gentle whites, and somehow they always look like they're smiling. A little joy blooming early. For me, they mark the true beginning of spring. Not when the calendar says so, but when there's color in the dirt again. Pansies are such a cheerful little things, but they do have their preferences. They love cool spring air and can handle short frosts, even down to around minus 5. It's part of what makes them such a good early bloomer. They like a drink about once a week, depending on the weather, but not too much. Their roots don't like to sit in soggy soil. A little plant food every other week can help them bloom their best. And if you pinch off the spent flowers, they'll keep making more. Their happiness in sunny or partly sp sunny spots with well draining soil. But when the heat of summer rolls in, they start to fade. The muggy air is just too much for them. So, for now, while the days are still mild, I let them shine. A short but beautiful season. That's part of their [Music] charm. It gets me almost every time. In the midst of [Music] summer, watching it in full bloom always makes me wonder when we were when we [Music] were just kid one as fall. We held our dreams within our [Music] hands. It happens every time. I wonder how. But I can see my life so clearly [Music] now. Dared ourselves away from home. Further out each passing day. Gravel road towards the sea. I blink and I remember you. You and me. You and [Music] me. It happens every time. I wonder how. [Music] But I can see my life so clearly [Music] now. I only miss you when I close my eyes. It's amazing how much can sift in just a week. The snow melts, the soil softens, and suddenly your hands are in the dirt, your eyes on the horizon. This season is waking up slowly, and so am I. One planted tree, one flower at a time. There's still more to come. More seeds, more soil, more simple choice. But for now, this feels like enough. These early spring days are full of motion, but not rush. Growth is happening everywhere slowly. Surely, and I'm learning to move with it. Thanks for spending some time with me in the garden. See you again soon in part two. [Music] [Laughter] [Music]",
