00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:12,860
Many landowners and homeowners around Wyoming
choose chemicals to help them manage weeds

2
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,719
and insects around their properties.

3
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:18,770
Chemicals can be used effectively when we
manage them effectively.

4
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:22,110
One of the things we want to think about when
managing chemicals is storage.

5
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,350
The first thing we want to think about is
limiting access.

6
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:29,849
We don’t want humans and animals to interact
with this unless they need to, especially

7
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:32,759
youth, children, we want to keep them away
from chemicals.

8
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,160
One of the things we really want to focus
on when managing chemicals is the label.

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,059
The label is going to tell us how toxic a
chemical is, what the chemical’s used for,

10
00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:42,190
and how to store it.

11
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:48,430
So, the University of Wyoming has a fact sheet
online at the University of Wyoming Extension webpage.

12
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,640
It has 15 focus points to think about and
to utilize when storing chemicals.

13
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,420
You know, it talks about storing chemicals
by category.

14
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,829
We want our insecticides in a different place
than our herbicides.

15
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:02,019
We want to certainly keep all chemicals in
their original containers.

16
00:01:02,019 --> 00:01:06,700
We certainly don’t ever want to see them
in food containers or anything like that.

17
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,440
And the last thing we probably want to think
about is not to store our personal protective

18
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,860
equipment, our gloves, our glasses, the things
that we’re thinking about keeping us safe

19
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,020
from chemicals.

20
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,060
We want to store them in a different place.

21
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,020
If you have more questions, you can certainly
look at that fact sheet online.

22
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,080
This is Hudson Hill with the University of
Wyoming Extension.

23
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,080
You’re watching From the Ground Up.
