  "text": "welcome back everybody today we're going to use an all-purpose plow from dirt dog on a 10 25 r we're going to keep it going with the spring tilling for some seed prep later this year going to help with the the preparation for the screening plot that we're going to put in along kind of the perimeter so we used a ripper previously the ground was a little bit too frozen i think we're probably close to a month beyond that date now we've had plenty of warm temperatures i don't think we'll have an issue and now this is not going to go down into the earth as far as that ripper or that subsoiler would do so i don't think we're gonna have as big of an issue i've never used one of these before i've always kind of been a tiller guy right but i'm trying to branch out try some new things give it a shot see how it works as always we're sponsored by borah wheel spacers they are made in america have a lifetime warranty if your tractor feels tippy side to side especially if you have a cab on it then adding a set of wheel spacers can make a big difference get more information on them at the link down below now dirt dog makes these apps all-purpose plows in various sizes so this is a smaller one about four foot wide maybe my hair over that but it's going to be three shanks or three rippers they're all spring loaded too so as you're going along it's going to have some give to it some flexibility so if you hit a a rock or a root or something else or just have some resistance it's going to it's going to kind of give and go over top of it a little bit and come back down i think we'll probably have to do multiple passes now i'm excited to play around with it see how it works you can see this is quick hitch compatible you can also hook it up directly to a category one three-point hitch we are a dirt dog dealer we sell and ship all over the country this is a made in america product so if you're looking for something pretty affordable to cultivate or till up prepare your earth this could be a good option for you to consider oh yeah and one last thing dirt dog does recommend seven horsepower per shank so three shanks here 21 horsepower off the top of my head i can't remember if that is engine horsepower or pto horsepower this is not using a pto so i would tend to think they're referencing engine horsepower so we should be just fine i can't envision this having a problem but i guess we'll find out soon enough hey really quick not to interrupt but this is part one of a two-part video all right we're gonna compare the results of an all-purpose plow versus a tiller let you make your own decision on what works best what has the best finished results we're going to use a subcompact tractor a 1025r so this could apply to any tractor out there but we're talking about the sub compacts right now there are attachments out there sized appropriately for small tractors medium tractors big tractors you name it so make sure you're subscribed to see part number two [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right so we're part way through i have a down and back and a down and back so four passes total but we're going to go over it again kind of figuring this thing out thought it was going to be just to drop it down and go uh right out of the gate but started hitting a few roots and it would actually bog this thing right down its track so you do have to feather that three point depending on your terrain a little bit up and down when it would really hang up and i'd be sitting there spinning if i let let go of the throttle let my foot off the gas it would actually these spring loaded ties would actually slightly pull the machine backwards it was kind of funny other than that it's a piece of cake you know so just keep your hand on that that three point or maybe don't go down all the way just go down part way something like that and you're gonna be okay this is what it looks like with one pass it doesn't well there's a lot of until ground in between where those furrows are at so we're going to go through and try to dissect the difference there maybe one additional pass can get it done it could take multiple passes i don't know but this isn't very hard this took maybe 10 or 15 minutes to go down and back a couple times really easy to do nice day to do it we're learning as we go [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] now you guys may have noticed this sweet looking canopy right up above me and this is a rhino hide canopy all right mr don mccoy founded this company and my brother and i were privileged enough to be able to purchase this from him at the beginning of the year so now rhino height is something that we can sell you directly now this canopy is unique for several reasons number one it's very lightweight all right so this is a one person job to take it on to take it off you have a couple of wing nuts here that you just loosen up you can slide it right off so if you want to take it down the road if you want to put it in your garage it's easy enough to do with one person all right it weighs how much does it weigh yeah it weighs 15 pounds so it's very lightweight but rhino hide that name suggests something this thing is tough as nails i'm telling you we drove over it with a 5000 series tractor so that thing weighed over 10 000 pounds don has shot this thing with a shotgun uh we dropped 40 or 70 pound weights on this thing it didn't break this thing is meant to be indestructible all right that's a downside of a lot of canopies they're big and bulky they're heavy and they're going to get damaged if you hit a tree limb or a tree branch or something else so this is meant to solve all those pain points it's made out of similar to that bed liner type material like a drop in bed liner in your truck so if you know what that is you know those things can take a beating so can this [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] do do [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] okay lessons learned from pass number two this first one i'm a little bit embarrassed about and i kind of let you guys down at some point four wheel drive early on i think disengaged so i was in two wheel drive and i think that's why i was spinning my wheels literally i wasn't even paying attention to the front wheels not spinning but just on the way back down and back on the second pass the first time back i noticed the front wheels weren't spinning i was like what that's going on i disengaged the four wheel drive somehow so i re-engaged that that seemed to make a world of difference being able to put that plow deeper and just carry on a lot easier but this is a very rough ride that's what i'm finding out very hard to stay on line where i want to go the first pass was easy the second pass was very challenging with all these big clods all around who knows maybe the third pass will be a little bit easier as it kind of breaks them up a little bit i don't know but i gotta try to get in between these rows and that's been a challenge hopefully this third pass knocks it out [Music] so [Music] do [Music] do [Music] so [Music] all right so third pass three more observations for you number one this ride does not get easier that was like riding the broken buck there for a while it just constantly wants to go back into the same furrows that have already been created so it's very hard to try to keep it aligned and and dig up more earth i found it was easier i was trying to use the outside of the of the tire to line up with this outside tine but i found it easier to use the center line of the hood to try to stay in the middle of a row instead and then match up with the center tine here the third observation is actually i didn't bottom out in my seat once and i noticed it late in the third pass and i had forgot i had this little air bladder thing that i put in here a little um inflatable shim it is and i put that in here and it's really helped prevent bottoming out completely on this seat and it kind of just sprung into my head that was the reason why because i was hitting some major bumps this whole time this whole machine was rocking and rolling that was a pretty uncomfortable experience after the first pass and we don't have a lot of big boulders here there's a lot of smaller rocks that are strewn throughout and this was an overgrown field that had a lot of automotive and other things in it too so i think we're hitting some routes there but this is pretty easy conditions to work in overall now i can't say this is my number one tool pardon me wants to go grab a tiller and just make a pass right next to it to see how it looks but maybe we'll do that in another video now i don't want to make it seem like it's all bad i mean it's a decent tool it's cheaper than a tiller there's less moving parts there's no gear box pto shaft anything like that it's a lighter piece of equipment so i mean overall you can see the results here this is what my grandpa's fields used to look like every year it seemed like so this will work but i just think personally a tiller does a lot better job with just one tool where we've tilled virgin ground all over out here in just one pass or even a second pass and it's just a completely level even consistent seed bed that's prepped and ready to go without doing anything else this just doesn't quite hold a candle to it so anyway if you are looking for something to help till up your ground whether it's a plow a disc a tiller we're happy to help we sell and ship all over the country check out goodworkstractors.com and if you enjoyed today's video we'd love to have you tag along hit that subscribe button right down below i want to thank you for taking time out of your day to stop by and until next time stay safe we'll see you soon [Music] wow [Music] [Applause] [Music]
