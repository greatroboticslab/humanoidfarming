00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,000
Africa is fascinating as it integrates

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,359
traditional farming techniques with

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,439
meticulous care and a deep connection to

00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,680
the land quality banana production

8
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:27,119
begins with planting a banana seedling

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,000
known as a sucker rather than from seeds

10
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,759

00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,559
existing banana plant

12
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:34,680
we're about to delve into the African

16
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,879
exciting Farmers regularly remove weeds

17
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,640
that compete with banana plants for

18
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:50,840
nutrients and water but they also ensure

19
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,520
that the plants receive ample water

20
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,399
through irrigation

21
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:58,120
systems a new airspring technology has

22
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:00,160
been particularly helpful in this regard

23
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,600
as bananas grow Farmers monitor the

24
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,559
closely until they reach the ideal stage
