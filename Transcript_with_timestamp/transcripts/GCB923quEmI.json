Charles Porter I've been a real estate agent broker since 1978 that's almost 40 years I have a PhD in economics in business I've written a number of books about water rights nor do I teach it say in every University but also I've been named as an expert witness and testified in over 600 cases around the country of 30 years I think one of the big reasons that farmer Ranch products have soared so greatly since 2007 2007 is really the time that our our world kind of changed so much as far as in New York and finances at that point even though we see this 2008 2007 when the money started to really tighten up as interest rates were suppressed especially the tenure to bill rate went down based upon interest rate controls by the government all of a sudden farming ranch became not a safe haven for money but also a position that that you couldn't get returns anywhere else the other thing is there's a tremendous tax advantage if you are able to acquire an agricultural valuation in places like her County reduces your Avalon tax obligation by 97% fiduciary duties are also found actually three times in the a real estate commission first in the canons of ethics secondly under five thirty five point two of the rules a broker has the very highest fiduciary that ought to wake everybody up the third time trek tells you we have fiduciary duties is five thirty five point one five six in the rules which says all agents have to be sure you do so I've always understood in been talk today they say you tell you three times your fiduciary duties you've got fiduciary duties above all else we'll put our clients interests above our personal interests and I think that's why we're very unique and people can tell me for those of you that want further makes about farming ranch or a more extensive class that's for credit I teach two classes one a for an out for our farmers class another seven-hour credit class I have published a book sharing the common Google water rights in the everyday lives effects of Texans and AM University Press another great book for farm and ranch practices in buying land in Texas is dr.
