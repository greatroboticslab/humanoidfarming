1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,080
folks how we doing welcome to good works

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:06,319
tractors we have a mess to clean up

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,520
today you can see all this dead timber

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,080
here

5
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,759
kind of in a precarious location all

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,759
right you have a a power line going

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,480
through on the backside a road on the

8
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,840
front side dead trees in general are not

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,760
something i really like to mess with a

10
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,680
lot so i called in the professionals to

11
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,119
have this taken down you may have seen

12
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,599
them doing work in the background in a

13
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,279
previous video and it was essentially a

14
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,640
i get it down safely and i'll handle the

15
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,320
cleanup from there so that's exactly

16
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,920
what they did dropped everything down

17
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,320
now's the time to get it out of the way

18
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,840
and i think for now i'm going to

19
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,680
probably just kind of chuck it off into

20
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,040
the tall stuff here

21
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,879
you know maybe i'll burn it or something

22
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,760
at a future date but most of the stuff

23
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,559
is really

24
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,239
it's really dried out um

25
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,600
not a lot of heft i mean this is you

26
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,520
know one hand lifting this thing up so

27
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,039
there's not a lot of weight here um but

28
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,320
we're just gonna get it out of the way

29
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,480
take it over there for now and then

30
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,399
maybe we'll chop it up and burn it later

31
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,840
on or or do something else with it later

32
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,520
but job number one today is to get it

33
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,840
out of the lawn okay so this is a brush

34
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,159
crusher

35
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,040
bc4215 so you're gonna see bc 4200 on

36
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,040
here

37
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,560
it's pretty simple basically so the 4200

38
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,000
does not have this middle set of teeth

39
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,040
on the top and the bottom

40
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,400
it's just going to have some cross

41
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,119
braces that go in there and take up that

42
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,640
space so basically if you want a 4215

43
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,400
it's just taking out those cross braces

44
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,920
and adding on the center sections of

45
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,920
teeth like you see here so the brush

46
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,600
crusher does not use any other hydraulic

47
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,200
or electrical connections no extra

48
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,040
hydraulics that are required a diverter

49
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,960
or third function nothing like that

50
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,400
nothing electrical you hook it on the

51
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,159
same way you would your bucket or pallet

52
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,799
forks that kind of thing and the way

53
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,040
that this works is this this top jaw is

54
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,040
going to be controlled by the the curl

55
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,799
roll cylinder all right so imagine your

56
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,320
bucket was on here and you roll it to

57
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,159
dump it out or you curl it back to scoop

58
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,159
something up and hold on to it same

59
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,399
thing this top jaw is what moves the

60
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,159
bottom jaw is essentially stationary i

61
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,520
can get it to move here

62
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,600
it's going to be on a hinge point as you

63
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:57,119
can see and these stops are going to

64
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,119
rest on the bottom side of the loader

65
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,920
had a kubota interrupting us

66
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,840
kubota owners you know

67
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,520
but as you can see you have all these

68
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,280
holes down here for adjustment and if

69
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,720
you reference the manual

70
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,200
you'll see why because every loader's

71
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,959
geometry is a bit different and

72
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,720
i did not adjust this specifically for

73
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,959
this tractor it was set up for another

74
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,400
machine but i've got it set up right now

75
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,840
so that the bottom jaw is fairly

76
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,840
parallel

77
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,120
if you look in the manual you want to

78
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,599
typically set it up so that when you

79
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,280
have a full closure on here you're just

80
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,440
kind of clamping tight against it not

81
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,840
putting unnecessary pressure against

82
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,920
that so there's been a couple random

83
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,160
reviews on youtube amongst all the good

84
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,360
reviews these random bad reviews seem to

85
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,040
get all the attention but i want to go

86
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,840
ahead and just briefly explain why that

87
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,440
happens is if you have

88
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,959
significant clamping force and you're

89
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,239
not paying any attention to what's going

90
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,400
on and where you're just allowing the

91
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,840
tractor cylinder to to really clamp as

92
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,840
hard as it possibly can against that

93
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,440
bottom jaw you're going to create extra

94
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,599
stress around the back of this plate

95
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,120
here and i believe that's what happened

96
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,480
and caused those problems for those

97
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,599
couple of owners there that posted those

98
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,120
videos but

99
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,040
this design has been around for years

100
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,640
and years and years they've sold

101
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,560
tens of thousands of these units here

102
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,519
i've myself have sold over a thousand of

103
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,360
them

104
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,480
with really great feedback really great

105
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,080
results it's not going to have every

106
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,599
it's not going to have all the dynamics

107
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,000
i guess of a traditional hydraulic

108
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,519
grapple where they they lack is if you

109
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,760
want to stack really high or if you want

110
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,200
to load into a dump trailer

111
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,360
and essentially because you can see this

112
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,959
this lower jaw being stationary you

113
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,280
can't just tilt the whole thing down and

114
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,480
let it roll all off but besides that for

115
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,519
what we're doing here kind of just going

116
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,280
along the ground picking things up

117
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,879
moving from point a to point b it's

118
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,319
perfect for that kind of application but

119
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,920
again that limitation is if you want to

120
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,840
stack really high or dump over a high

121
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,040
side dumpster that kind of thing that's

122
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,120
where you're going to struggle with a

123
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,120
design like this and a hydraulic or

124
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,640
maybe even electric grapple like the

125
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,319
work saver mini grapple is a really good

126
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,840
solution for that alrighty folks so now

127
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,439
it's time to get to work i'll show you

128
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,360
how this thing does performs in a real

129
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,360
world scenario with kind of a tangled

130
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,360
mess here let's see if we run into any

131
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,360
snags

132
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:05,650
[Music]

133
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:25,789
[Music]

134
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,639
so

135
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:55,230
[Music]

136
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,960
so

137
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:29,319
[Music]

138
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:37,830
[Music]

139
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,360
so

140
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,509
[Music]

141
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:35,079

[Music]

144
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,840
alright folks a couple things going on

145
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,440
in the back side of this tractor and i

146
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,560
guess this tractor in general i've had

147
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,560
this this 2038r for a while um i had it

148
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,960
in at a local hydraulic shop you can see

149
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,039
i've got a hydraulic top link on here my

150
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,639
goal and it still is my goal is to try

151
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,639
to offer hydraulic top links and

152
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,199
eventually side lengths as well

153
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,639
for various compact tractor models

154
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,080
you know with supply chain issues it's

155
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,160
just taking a lot longer than i had

156
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,800
hoped it would do so this is a

157
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:14,080
custom-made hydraulic top link to fit a

158
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,400
2r series like a 232r 2038r anything

159
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,080
with a similar stroke length um that and

160
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,919
size machine that you have on your

161
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,280
three-point hitch category one so today

162
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,360
we're not really utilizing this

163
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,800
hydraulic top link so much but we do

164
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,240
have it hooked up to our versa bracket

165
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,319
bundle so this is our counterweight

166
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,000
system the versa bracket that you see on

167
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,520
here is category one it's quick hitch

168
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,839
compatible but you can see it fits

169
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,440
directly to a three-point hitch as well

170
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,800
uh any category one doesn't matter if

171
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,959
it's a john deere or a boat or anything

172
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,719
else we have eight 70-pound suitcase

173
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,159
weights on here it's kind of hanging out

174
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,599
weighing that back side there right so

175
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,360
this gives us as much counterweight as

176
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,120
we can possibly have and if you look

177
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,560
really close it's a used tractor but

178
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,000
this did come in with a couple of two

179
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,760
inch spacers that are on there too so

180
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
we've widened our footprint a little bit

181
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,200
you know i love wheel spacers borah used

182
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,360
to be our channel sponsor and they are

183
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,399
still a sponsor of ours as well

184
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,000
highly highly regarded in general

185
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,519
they're narrow and they're long with a

186
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,120
higher center of gravity and especially

187
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,880
if you have a cab on there it just

188
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,040
really gets tippy and so adding wheel

189
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,640
spacers even just two inches adds four

190
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,320
inches to the overall width it really

191
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,320
adds more stability in an area where you

192
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,320
need

193
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,360
so

194
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,120
this gives you a good look at uh taking

195
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,680
care of well i guess a tree that would

196
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,279
fall down in your lawn for example and

197
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,600
i want you to pay attention to how i'm

198
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,560
going through and grabbing these logs as

199
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,560
well

200
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,800
it's easy to get those lower tines to

201
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,120
dig down in the ground and i don't

202
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,480
i mean the ground the lawn's messed up

203
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,079
enough as it is i don't want to make it

204
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,079
any worse and rut it up and dig it up

205
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,920
and everything else so trying to take my

206
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,720
time and just kind of almost feather

207
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,480
that lower jaw to get right underneath

208
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,720
the log and then clamp down around it

209
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,079
and so um

210
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,839
there's no need to rush you don't really

211
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,839
want to rush with log work we have you

212
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,760
know stumps that kind of blend in with

213
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,120
all the fallen timber and branches and

214
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,320
everything else

215
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,640
you know there's some stumps on even

216
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,920
areas and ruts over in the kind of the

217
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,279
tall grass area where we're dumping

218
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,120
things out

219
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,040
log work is not a speed

220
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,399
application it's like most things with

221
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,600
the tractor you're just taking your time

222
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,519
you want to get it done safely you don't

223
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,760
want to hurt the tractor it'd be easy

224
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,959
for a stick to come up under the

225
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,040
undercarriage you know if i'm kind of

226
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,959
driving over it it gets wonky splits in

227
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,000
half and both ends go up and one sticks

228
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,680
up underneath the undercarriage

229
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,040
somewhere and and that would end my day

230
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,880
pretty quickly and i've had a good

231
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,200
friend that's had a stick go right up

232
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,720
underneath somewhere into the

233
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,160
transaction i can't remember where but

234
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,079
it was a couple thousand dollar repair

235
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,760
on his john deere i think it was three e

236
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,040
tractor that he had at the time

237
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,680
i know of a couple other folks that have

238
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,120
had issues too so be careful going over

239
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,560
all this debris that's why i'm kind of

240
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,480
one of the other reasons

241
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,000
it's a good idea to go slow i should say

242
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,360
now typically picking up logs another

243
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,560
debris you want to try to center that

244
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,519
load and that doesn't mean it's always

245
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,800
going to be picked up right in the

246
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,920
middle right you have one end of the

247
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,320
tree that's going to be heavier than the

248
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,399
other so your wall looks maybe

249
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,680
off center you know in the grapple jaws

250
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,880
it's it's more about balancing the

251
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,800
weight properly because you don't want

252
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,240
to tip over to the side and

253
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,920
this ground looks fairly level but

254
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,839
there's still inclines here and there

255
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,680
and awkward positions to be in and again

256
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,279
that's why something like the wheel

257
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,040
spacers make sense and having the

258
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,560
counterweight on the back not only makes

259
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,320
sense

260
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,920
to offset what's in the grapple up front

261
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,760
but to also just help keep that center

262
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,760
of gravity down lower and prevent

263
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,160
rollovers and so that's why at times

264
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,519
you'll see me kind of plucking out a log

265
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,880
or two just to separate it from the

266
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,240
others but then dropping it down and

267
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,040
repositioning and grabbing in a

268
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,040
different spot to have that balance load

269
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,040
so there's no chance of a roll over now

270
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,040
luckily our drop point was pretty close

271
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,800
so this whole job just kind of taking

272
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,480
care of all this smaller stuff

273
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,920
only took about 25 minutes you know less

274
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,920
than a half hour and again that's while

275
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,920
filming too which always takes longer

276
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,839
you know and as i was dropping all those

277
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,279
logs over there and kind of stacking

278
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,120
them up it dawned on me that you know

279
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:23,040
what maybe i'll just leave that stuff

280
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,399
there and use that as some some critter

281
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,600
cover for the rabbits and everything

282
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,360
else it's always good to have some more

283
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,639
hiding spots for them

284
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,920
and it's kind of out of the way behind

285
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,959
the other brush and everything else here

286
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,519
i want to get it away from the road

287
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,800
front and i think it'll fill in nicely

288
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,560
and of course the big cherry on the

289
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,680
other side of the driveway that was just

290
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,760
a joke that's well beyond the

291
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,639
limitations of this tractor we weren't

292
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,519
going to be able to tackle that i'm

293
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,720
gonna have to use the skid steer to

294
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,320
knock that out you know a common

295
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,560
question i'm always asked is what's the

296
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,560
right size brush crusher for me

297
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,240
and this 4215

298
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,920
is the most popular by far that we sell

299
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,920
but that's great for the john deere 1

300
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,839
series the john deere 2 series gender 3

301
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,519
series if you get to a john deere 4

302
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,399
series that's when i say start to

303
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:02,480
consider that bc 4255 that's going to be

304
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,240
built heavier more steel more support in

305
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,600
there it's a larger loader larger

306
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,760
stresses and everything else that can be

307
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,200
put on and applied to that grapple too

308
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,079
so that's when you want to transition to

309
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,760
that 4255 it doesn't have that center

310
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,440
set of teeth but overall that's the

311
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,519
right decision for the 4 series all

312
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,680
right folks so that is going to wrap it

313
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,279
up for us today i think that gives you a

314
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,800
pretty good look

315
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,120
at what this brush crusher is all about

316
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,279
the operation of it how it actually does

317
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,279
what it does and this is not a new

318
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,279
design this has been around for years

319
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,639
and years and years i i know well over a

320
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,560
decade maybe it's been two decades

321
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,480
they've been selling these things a very

322
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,880
long time and again so this is great for

323
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,639
an application or situation when you

324
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,920
don't have the extra hydraulics on your

325
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,160
tractor or you don't want to go through

326
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,399
that process of adding those on they can

327
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,839
be very costly to do so

328
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,120
it's just one look at things right if

329
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,480
you want to go through that process add

330
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,399
on the hydraulics there's a whole world

331
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,000
of grapples out there for you we've

332
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,079
shown a lot of those in previous videos

333
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,360
as well all over our website too if you

334
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,199
want to get an electric grapple they

335
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,720
have those also so there's there's

336
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,320
different takes on it different views

337
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,560
you just kind of have to prioritize what

338
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,800
you want this is the most simple version

339
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,560
of it as well so it's just easy to hook

340
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,480
up and get to work and i like simple

341
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,399
things it's just less chance of things

342
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,680
to go wrong which if you've watched my

343
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,440
channel

344
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,399
it's hard to avoid those things going

345
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,399
wrong so

346
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,440
keep it simple when i can but anyway the

347
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,720
brush crusher they're going to have it

348
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,240
for john deere quick attach they have

349
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,160
another version for skid steer quick

350
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,920
attach now the skister quick attach i

351
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,880
always like to point out a lot of the

352
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,000
loaders

353
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,399
are going to have brackets for your

354
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,040
stands on skid steer quick attach

355
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,360
equipment and so sometimes

356
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,760
these brackets here these stops will

357
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,519
well it takes more fine tuning so you

358
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,720
adjust this bracket up and down to find

359
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,079
that sweet spot where it's not going to

360
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,440
interfere with those loader parking

361
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,920
stands on there

362
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,279
just pointing that out so you know that

363
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,720
you got to make some more adjustments

364
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,160
there but other than that folks things

365
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,399
went pretty darn smooth for us today

366
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,920
that's always a good day in my book we

367
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,360
got this project done i'm have to come

368
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,920
back through

369
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,440
i think with a rake and uh and cleaned

370
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,440
all this up a landscape rake will

371
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,199
probably be the tool of choice

372
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,440
the downside is i did pack a bunch of

373
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,560
this stuff down into the ground um i

374
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,720
don't think that the thatcher will be

375
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,880
able to dig that out very well it's too

376
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,240
heavy materials also so i think a

377
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,760
landscape break is what i'm gonna have

378
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,680
to use it's gonna cause a little bit of

379
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,040
ground damage but you know a lot of this

380
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,320
damage has already been done but if

381
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,839
you're looking for a tractor tool

382
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,000
whether it's a brush crusher a different

383
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,440
grapple a landscape rake something for

384
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,680
the front end loader or the three-point

385
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,279
hitch we probably sell it and we ship

386
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,759

the back somewhere

400
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,639
