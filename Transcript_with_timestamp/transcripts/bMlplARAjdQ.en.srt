00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,000
hi i'm chris i'm here at the

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:08,240
experimental greenhouse at crop king in

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,480
lodi ohio to talk about hydroponics and

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,240
not just hydroponics we've covered the

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,000
process of hydroponics in previous

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,720
episodes but i want to talk to you now

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,480
about what can you grow hydroponically

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,359
that means what can we grow with just

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,840
water nutrients in the absence of dirt

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,560
and the answer is going to be almost

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,640
anything so we're in the lettuce house

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,279
right now but there's so much going on

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,440
here in addition to lettuce including

14
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,079
the varieties of lettuce we have iceberg

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,600
romaine we talked about the desktop nft

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,000
system and that's what we're using here

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,440
not the desktop but the nft or nutrient

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,160
film technique and from seed to harvest

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,680
we're talking six weeks let's talk about

20
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,879
some other things in addition to lettuce

21
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,559
that we can grow hydroponically

22
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,960
all right so we're here at the crop king

23
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,360
tomato house obviously one of the things

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,199
that are the predominant crop in here is

25
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,120
tomatoes these

26
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,280
are vine crops those are most of the

27
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,879
crops that we'll be looking at today and

28
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,720
you'll see that they are supported with

29
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,760
these this twine

30
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,600
um

31
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,119
to kind of make sure that they don't

32
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,400
snap or break under the weight of the

33
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,479
bearing the fruit that they're bearing

34
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,840
but they grow so well in here it's a

35
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,840
controlled environment it is a little

36
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,600
bright hence the sunglasses i'm not

37
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,520
trying to be too cool here for the video

38
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,439
but i am trying to make sure i'm not

39
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,080
looking at you squinting the whole time

40
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,200
but tomatoes are a huge crop here at

41
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,280
crop king

42
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,520
they're beautiful it's everything is

43
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,000
just uh absolutely gorgeous and you see

44
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,079
coming up behind me uh my sidekick jimmy

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,600
here hi jimmy to see what you're doing

46
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,880
oh well we're talking about all the cool

47
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,880
things that we grow here in the in the

48
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,720
tomato house it's unbelievable i just

49
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,640
walk them back through there yeah why

50
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,759
don't you go head back there and see uh

51
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,960
i thought i heard something fall over

52
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,960
there are you checking out time to hang

53
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,799
out for a little bit well see what

54
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,479
happened over there we'll be right back

55
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,079
yeah sure all right friends so we're

56
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,439
gonna take a walk down this aisle here

57
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,960
taking a look at some of the other crops

58
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,640
other than tomatoes that we grow here at

59
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,640
crop canyon

60
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,520
if you thought that you could not grow

61
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,280
melons hydroponically you are wrong we

62
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,600
have this gorgeous

63
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,599
vine of what looks to be cantaloupe i'm

64
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,120
not showing you the exact variety man do

65
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,440
they produce look at this

66
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,360
this is straight off of this vine i

67
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,440
can't figure out how to tell if a

68
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,280
melon is ripe or not so viewers if you

69
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,879
have a tip or trick to you got to look

70
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,640
for to determine if a melon is ripe

71
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,640
other than just cutting it open well

72
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,400
we'd love to hear from you

73
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,879
thump on it so we've talked about

74
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,080
tomatoes we've talked about melons

75
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,000
we're going to go down a little bit

76
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,760
farther to get into some other

77
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,280
produce that we're growing here and

78
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,200
we're also going to talk about the

79
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,959
manner in which we grow these we talked

80
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,440
about the lettuce and the nutrient film

81
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,560
technique that they use but these vining

82
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,560
crops use a little bit different

83
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,720
technique same principle we're using

84
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,239
water and nutrients to grow

85
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,840
but it's just a little bit different as

86
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,840
far as how we grow them

87
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,640
we're continuing our tour of the crop

88
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,239
king tomato house just to explore all

89
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,239
the different kind of vine crops we can

90
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,760
grow here hydroponically and i want to

91
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,800
talk a little bit about the system that

92
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,200
we use so nft systems are great for your

93
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,280
leafy vegetables herbs things like that

94
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,879
but over here we use what's called a

95
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,280
beto bucket or you might have heard it

96
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,519
as a dutch bucket system to grow our

97
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,319
crops that's the system that we use to

98
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,159
grow our vine crops versus the nft

99
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,000
system that is used for a lot of our

100
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,200
leafy crops and herbs and things like

101
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,680
that

102
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,480
the big difference is just the growing

103
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,360
medium that the plants are

104
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,360
are in so with these vine crops we want

105
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,959
to give it enough room to get a nice big

106
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,120
root and that's going to take place

107
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,280
inside this bucket that is filled with

108
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,959
the growing medium perlite

109
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,640
so perlite basically there's no

110
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,159
nutrients in perlite whatsoever it's

111
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,480
just basically

112
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,400
the medium that we use to allow the

113
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,239
plants to root and become stable but

114
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,239
plants here get so big that we still

115
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,200
have to use a support string to hold

116
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,519
them up

117
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,920
so the way this works we know our nft

118
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,200
system our nutrient film technique pumps

119
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,439
water in

120
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,280
it runs a small stream down the middle

121
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,519
of a channel that the roots sit down in

122
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,200
and it pulls out the nutrients with the

123
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,120
beto system

124
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:13,120
we pump water in using these drip spikes

125
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,200
the water then will be recirculated as

126
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,840
it comes down out of this channel

127
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,759
back into our recirculation pump and it

128
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,960
comes back through again so we don't

129
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,360
waste any water here in this system but

130
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,800
you can see what we can produce using

131
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,759
the bato system

132
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,680
these cucumbers are absolutely enormous

133
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,280
not only the the fruit itself and

134
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,880
hopefully you can

135
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,960
take a look at this one here that's not

136
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,320
too far off but just the height of the

137
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,280
plant alone

138
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,120
so i'm 5 10 reaching up to the tips of

139
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,960
my fingers and still i'm probably i

140
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,160
guess two and a half three feet away

141
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,720
from the top of this plant

142
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,000
[Music]

143
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,600
we've talked about growing in a

144
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,680
controlled environment such as the

145
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,759
tomato house here at crop king

146
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,759
we can control the amount of water the

147
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,479
amount of nutrients

148
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:03,280
and the temperatures to a certain degree

149
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,479
which is great by being indoors we can

150
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,479
grow

151
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,160
you know almost year round really extend

152
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,560
our growing season but one question that

153
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,680
comes up is well how do you pollinate

154
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,039
your plants

155
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:18,479
that's a great question now as a

156
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,600
an educator i have a hydroponics farm in

157
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,280
my school

158
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,280
and unfortunately my superintendent

159
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,800
won't let me have bees

160
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,600
in the cafeteria where our garden is

161
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,120
located why not well jim it's just a

162
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,800
safety concern i do believe it's

163
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,360
probably the best decision

164
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,039
but here at crop king we solve this by

165
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,039
these little natural pollinators right

166
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,960
here they're bumble bees

167
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,800
pretty uh pretty tame

168
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,639
they fly around the greenhouse here they

169
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,479
pretty much leave you alone but because

170
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,880
i'm not allowed to have bees i still

171
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,800
need a way to pollinate my plants

172
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,960
indoors and that's where this little

173
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,240
tool comes in this is called the veggie

174
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,280
bee and hopefully this will pick up on

175
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,560
our mic

176
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:01,520
it basically vibrates and all i would do

177
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,000
here is i would touch this to the flower

178
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,600
of my plant and this will help pollinate

179
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,840
it so essentially

180
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,120
we're getting the uh by vibrating we're

181
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,600
just disturbing the plant enough to

182
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,280
jostle loose that pollen uh to get it on

183
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,440
to the uh the plant that needs to

184
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,360
pollinate and uh by golly we're gonna

185
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,600
have fruit here before long prior to

186
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,039
this i use an electric toothbrush

187
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,960
because again this is the vibration

188
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,360
that's going to jostle loose that pollen

189
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,280
and get our fruit growing so this is

190
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,520
important because

191
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,600
if you're growing tomatoes and you do

192
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,039
not self pollinate them you're just

193
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,360
going to have some pretty little tomato

194
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:38,319
flowers and no fruit so you got to go

195
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,680
the extra step and pollinate those and

196
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,680
you'll appreciate the fact whether

197
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,180
you're indoors or outdoors this can

198
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,160
increase your yield incredibly

199
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,600

200
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,000

in the crop king tomato greenhouse to

202
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,240
explore all the things you can grow

203
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,840
hydroponically this is what's cool about

204
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,240
hydroponics and this is why i love

205
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,840
having it in my school you can try

206
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,680
anything you don't have to you're not

207
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,560
dependent on the growing season you can

208
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,160
try

209
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,120
just throwing seeds in and see what

210
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,639
happens

211
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,759
you'd be amazing the different things

212
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,599
you can grow hydroponically and

213
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,000
just how well it does

214
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:17,280
regardless of the season i've done

215
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,520
sunflowers i've done peppers cabbage i

216
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,080
mean the list goes on and on and that's

217
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,960
part of the fun is planting a seed and

218
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,360
see what you can do with it

219
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,639
hydroponically friends go out there

220
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,880
