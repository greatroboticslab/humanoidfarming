1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,080
it's actually a series of satellites in

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,040
partnership with the US Geological

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,439
Survey and we have more than 50 years of

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,880
records of this and it can tell you

5
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:11,519
where there are trees where there are

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,679
crops um and we've worked you know with

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,759
people like the US Department of

8
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:16,920
Agriculture to identify which crops um

9
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:19,080
you can tell from space what's growing

10
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,199
by when it greens the precise color that

11
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,160
it is we can also we have other

12
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,240
satellites that can tell us about plant

13
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,840
Health um so we have one an instrument

14
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,080
on the International Space Station

15
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,920
called ecostress that it measures

16
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,360
temperature at this really really high

17
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,120
Precision um and what it turns out you

18
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,680
can learn from that is when plants are

19
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,120
water stressed so when plants don't have

20
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,280
enough water they get a little bit

21
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,160
hotter so they get a fever um and we can

22
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,160
see that from space
