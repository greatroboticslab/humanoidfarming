1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,559
okay so today i want to show

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,759
the sleep production that means the

3
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,679
shoot production from the sweet potato

4
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,400
so there is a very nice and easy

5
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,560
techniques that we very quickly we can

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,199
produce the shoot from there so i have

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,519
collected three types of sweet potato

8
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,599
this is in malaysian variety so this is

9
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,119
called yellow yellow sweet potato

10
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,160
ubiquiladic

11
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,520
kuni and this is called the purple sweet

12
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,440
potato

13
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,320
will be keledek

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,800
and this is called a white sweet potato

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,120
ubiquitous

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,280
so these three types of potato i have

17
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,800
collected from the shopping mall so

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,480
today i want to show

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,800
how to do

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,360
or how we can set for the shoot

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,600
production our main purpose is to

22
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,120
produce produce the shoot from that

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,079
types of root

24
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,879
that means it is on type of root crops

25
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,199
the sweet potato so this you can see the

26
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,560
any i have used three types of different

27
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:10,400
cup plastic cup with water just some the

28
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,360
simple very simple the tap waters you

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,920
can use

30
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,360
so this is a water calf or any food or

31
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,280
food cuff or even through the water

32
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,920
office and it's a small one

33
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,799
so i have tried to explain that you can

34
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,159
use any type of waste plastic cup from

35
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,560
your house

36
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,159
i have used a transparent cup you can

37
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,240
use the non-transparent also okay the

38
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,000
transport is better you can show the you

39
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,960
can see the routing as well from the

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,040
shoot

41
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,200
so firstly our job is to produce the

42
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,439
shoot from there so after producing the

43
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,520
shoot then we have to separate the shoot

44
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,759
and we have to put inside the water

45
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,000
again for the root production

46
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,399
so from the root we can produce

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,119
so many shoot at a time so firstly our

48
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:54,479
job is to cut divide into two section so

49
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:57,360
in uh in a sweet potato there are two of

50
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,360
end this one is called the uh

51
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,880
top end and the end and this is the

52
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,479
another is what is called the uh

53
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,240
another end

54
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,239
so this end usually connected with the

55
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,479
mother plant and this is the growing

56
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,959
portion this will continue to grow so

57
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,319
from both side we can produce the shoot

58
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,920
but usually

59
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,000
the end portion is usually called this

60
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,040
is the top portion and this is the end

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,760
portion the lower portion but both side

62
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,520
we can use no problem but the top

63
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,640
portion is usually they produce more

64
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,040
shoot

65
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,879
and you need just the knife

66
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,000
and the toothpick normally you use the

67
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:36,160
toothpick so just to hold inside this

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,280
cuff so now i want to show you how to do

69
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,519
that

70
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,519
and how to cut and then how to set into

71
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,720
that watercraft

72
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,720
okay so now our first job is to cut the

73
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,360
root under the tuberous root this is

74
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,360
called the sweet potato from the middle

75
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,080
so use a knife and

76
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,599
just you can cut like that

77
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,519
so very

78
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:01,080
just make it half

79
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,080
so like that

80
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,879
okay

81
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,760
so just to half

82
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,239
so

83
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,159
we can set letter so i want one by one i

84
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,720
am cutting the portion so for this is

85
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:17,360
called the wider inside the

86
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,400
vessel is white color the flesh is white

87
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,640
color this one is purple color this is

88
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,879
one of the malaysian very popular sweet

89
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:29,440
potato

90
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,440
so they are flesh supposed to be purple

91
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,480
so this is very nice this

92
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,239
completely purple color so it's called

93
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,480
purple variety

94
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,040
and this one is the flesh supposed to be

95
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,599
yellow color

96
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,120
so cut carefully

97
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,720
during cutting

98
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,720
make it around there

99
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,840
it's easier so this is

100
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,480
yellow

101
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,040
color or yellow flesh

102
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,200
okay so now we have make it two section

103
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,599
so now you have to use the toothpick

104
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,400
this is the toothpick

105
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:04,000
so

106
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,519
usually is free toothpick for on

107
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,560
so because we have to dive into the

108
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,799
water

109
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,879
so you can take or we can

110
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:14,080
add the extra water no problem when it's

111
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:16,880
out also push like that

112
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,880
usually made three

113
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,359
goes like that there's another one

114
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,359
that's right

115
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,840
okay so

116
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,199
now leave here so when the is if water

117
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,080
level is very low

118
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,320
so you can add extra water

119
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,080
just about one one centimeter is enough

120
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,320
so dip into water

121
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,680
so then you have to keep it about two

122
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,520
weeks

123
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,280
this is white varieties we have to keep

124
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,360
it two weeks but

125
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,919
every day you have to check the water

126
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,320
level supposed to be one centimeter deep

127
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,400
into the water if you see the water is

128
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:54,160
already dried or what is called the

129
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,160
vapor rice so you can add extra water

130
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,680
so this is white variety so we can keep

131
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,440
like that

132
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,960
then this is a i mean

133
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:06,479
the uh the top space is very more

134
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,800
so maybe we can use four due to the

135
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,120
balance to make it balance

136
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,000
so we can use four toothpick here

137
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,000
three is okay

138
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,880
but to keep the purple balancer exact

139
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:22,320
balancing

140
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,320
because the space is bigger

141
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,919
okay sorry

142
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:30,080
you can use another one

143
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,639
okay so like that

144
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,120
as this is water is already low so later

145
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,759
we have to add extra water and you have

146
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,320
to ensure that the at least one

147
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,639
centimeter deep into the water more you

148
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,800
can do that because the suit will be

149
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,639
produced from the top

150
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,520
so this is purple

151
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,720
then this is the yellow

152
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,280
so as this is depending on the top

153
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,280
especially

154
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,919
so we can use the arduino program

155
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,919
okay

156
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,080
and another one

157
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,560
is that free

158
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,919
so now dip into water so this one is

159
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,160
almost okay

160
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,400
so now you have to check every day the

161
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,400
water level and you have to wait

162
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,240
within one week supposed to be they will

163
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,120
start the

164
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,919
shooting

165
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,080
so

166
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,800
after that within two weeks we can we

167
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,720
can see the so more many many shoots

168
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,520
already produced from the

169
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,160
this route then later when the the shoot

170
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,160
is about 10 centimeter five or this cut

171
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,639
eight to ten centimeter or more can also

172
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,880
okay then you have to sleeve that miscut

173
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,360
from the root then the shoe you have to

174
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,199
dip into the water again for rooting

175
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,400
so that means it can confirm after

176
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,800
transplanting

177
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,280
that is that means there is no loss or

178
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,000
there is no dead uh

179
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,240
or the gap from the transplanting so

180
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,560
whatever should you are transplanting so

181
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,759
you can assure that more than 90 percent

182
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,960
they will be survived so this is the way

183
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:09,039
that how we can do for the shooting from

184
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,400
the sweet potato this is the most

185
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,199
easiest way

186
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,240
and

187
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,479
in any types of convenient uh one in

188
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,479
your house you can do that no need any

189
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,880
the what is called the cold room or

190
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,960
whatever is nothing just

191
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,560
we can dip into water then we have to

192
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,560
wait about two weeks

193
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,880
to produce the shoot from there after

194
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,440
that we have to set for the routing

195
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,960
so this is the silly production or shoot

196
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,560
production from sweet potato

197
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,039
okay so this is how it looks like after

198
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,560
completion so all the three roots is

199
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,400
inside the

200
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,280
water cup with the water and dip into

201
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,800
water is usually you can use more than

202
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,520
one centimeter but minimum you have to

203
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,639
maintain minimum on centimeter deep into

204
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,720
the water

205
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,800
so this is how it looks like

206
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,360
then you have to leave it in any place

207
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,759
at your house but please avoid the

208
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,360
i mean the what

209
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,120
kitchen place or some there is the

210
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,360
temperature is very high in normal

211
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,199
condition you can keep it and just you

212
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,120
have to wait

213
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,840
about two weeks then after that you can

214
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,240
see

215
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:15,680
the huge suit is already produced from

216
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,680
the top portion of that sweet potato

217
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,000
as very nice techniques and easy

218
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,520
techniques that we can produce shoot

219
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,160
from here

220
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,160
okay that's all

221
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:32,399
okay so this is exactly after two weeks

222
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,120
so two weeks before i set for the

223
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:38,240
shooting up this capsule production

224
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:41,599
so today is already

225
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,440
day 15 actually so that means two weeks

226
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,240
later so

227
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,880
is uh profuse you can see profuse number

228
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,279
of shoot already produced from here and

229
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,200
extra long enough so now

230
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:56,080
what we can do now we have to sleep that

231
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,640
means remove details the shoot from here

232
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,640
and we have to defend water again for

233
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,640
a reshooting from the

234
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,320
individual shoot

235
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,959
so very nicely there this one is a

236
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,680
little bit solo but it's still very nice

237
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,320
so

238
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,320
this is the way so you can see

239
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,480
how the roots has been grown up

240
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,000
huge number of roots

241
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,519
from the

242
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,360
i mean cutted root of the sweet potatoes

243
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,560
and this is all through the

244
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,320
every single shoot and very nicely grown

245
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,920
and this one is still growing little bit

246
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,000
solo this one

247
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,920
and this one is also okay this is

248
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,360
different variety this one is a

249
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,200
yellowish color

250
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,600
basically the huge number of roots is

251
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,080
already there this is supporting root

252
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,680
just to help the for the shooting

253
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,880
and this is uh the purple varieties

254
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,959
these both are perfect varieties and

255
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,800
there is one other another one was white

256
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,959
so these are already fungal affected so

257
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,920
i have removed that on from here

258
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,120
so you can see the huge number of shoot

259
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,839
that means

260
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,360
sleep production from sweet potato just

261
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,880
by two weeks

262
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,800
then today

263
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,760
what we have to do we have to sleep

264
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,839
remove

265
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:07,440
just by hand we can remove that truth

266
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:10,240
and we have to agree in re have to uh

267
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,360
set for the shooting routing from that

268
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,279
shoot

269
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,880
so then uh by one week so just for one

270
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,279
week is enough so balls to one x then we

271
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,320
can transplant in the main field

272
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,000
so this is the called

273
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,399
the should production

274
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
from sweet potato quick shoot production

275
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,880
actually very quick

276
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,040
uh so just for tweaks and even by one

277
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,040
week i have tried to see

278
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,040
huge number of this another week just

279
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,240
for the proper growth and development of

280
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,040
the shoot

281
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,120
and we have to do the another week for

282
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,399
the shooting from the special or

283
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,839
individual

284
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,480
this should

285
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,560
so that i can show you now how to remove

286
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,399
the shoot from that route then we have

287
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:54,079
to set for the

288
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:58,079
routing from the that branches

289
00:10:54,079 --> 00:11:00,560
okay so now i want to show how to

290
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:02,399
remove this produce shoot from the main

291
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,040
route then we have to

292
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,519
reset for the

293
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,800
routing from that so just remove by hand

294
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,600
is okay

295
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,600
so just like that you can remove

296
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,000
so this one then you have to soak into

297
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,680
another new water again so they will

298
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,320
produce new wood just by one week they

299
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,079
will produce the roots like that

300
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,079
just remove from the

301
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,760
mother root then

302
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,279
dip into the water

303
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,959
those are

304
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,800
sufficiently grown

305
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,600
so all these sufficiently grown so like

306
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,320
that

307
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,760
we have to remove every individual shoot

308
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,320
from here

309
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:41,600
then we have to

310
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:44,399
resolve for root production from that

311
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,640
special or individual shoot like that so

312
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,600
just remove all and this one you just

313
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,720
keep

314
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,200
to see

315
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,680
another new shooting from there

316
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,519
so this is also properly grown

317
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,200
just remove

318
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,560
you can see

319
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,560
they have already started to produce

320
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,120
ruda this small small rooting in its

321
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,959
root initiation from here so very nicely

322
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,720
it's very small small so they will

323
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,200
produce the new root again so when you

324
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,040
can see just by one week is enough so

325
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,320
after one week you can see

326
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,800
they have produced

327
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,560
some of the new roots and the initiation

328
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:20,079
of would already happen

329
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:22,240
so now just you have to dip into water

330
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:26,639
as this one is two different brightest

331
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:28,240
better use two different uh pots or calf

332
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,920
for the different variety if you have

333
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,000
different varieties this all single body

334
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,079
then you can keep all together in one

335
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,959
cup for the

336
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:38,880
root

337
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:40,800
proper root growth from that uh new

338
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,639
shoot

339
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,800
okay there is the some dry leaves so

340
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,200
just remove so this fresh one just dip

341
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,040
into water

342
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,279
okay this one is still growing so i am

343
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,200
not removing that one so that's all so i

344
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,240
am i want to show you the

345
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,920
router

346
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,920
very nice

347
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,079
huge number of routes and the supporting

348
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:03,200
route that is helping to

349
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:06,880
produce huge number of foot from there

350
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,800
so this is the overall way or methods of

351
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,519
quick shoot production from sweet

352
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,440
potatoes just by two weeks you can

353
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,399
produce huge number of

354
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,720
new shoot so they should have only given

355
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,399
to water just wait for another one week

356
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,959
so by one week they you can see they

357
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,360
have produced new route from here then

358
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:27,440
you can transplant into the main field

359
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,279
or whatever you have a special body you

360
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,160
have so just

361
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,920
true

362
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,519
and we have to wait for the root

363
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,480
production from there the remove from

364
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,760
there so that's all about the quick

365
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,839
methods

366
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,839
the shoot production is another term is

367
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,160
called silly production from sweet

368
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,160
potato

369
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:51,279
okay so just one week before i

370
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,920
set the newly produced shoot into

371
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:56,480
another fresh cuff for the routing from

372
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,800
there so you can see very nicely they

373
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:02,240
have produced huge number of roots

374
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:05,199
now this is completely ready to transfer

375
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,360
into your main field but wherever places

376
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:10,480
or whatever media you want to grow for

377
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:13,839
the final grain so meaning is that

378
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,800
one week before i detest that shoot

379
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,600
newly grown shoot from the mother root

380
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,480
and

381
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,040
i

382
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,440
replace into a fresh cup

383
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,920
for the rooting from there

384
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,800
so you can see you can see just by one

385
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:31,600
week just by one week how nicely they

386
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,360
have produced the huge number of roots

387
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,639
so now you can

388
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:39,920
transplant this newly grown

389
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:42,639
shoe root with the shoot so you can see

390
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,399
completely ready to transplant into your

391
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,160
desired media

392
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,920
or in the main field whatever you want

393
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,519
to grow so they can see

394
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,800
very nicely produce the root this is

395
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:54,880
enough so now you can transplant

396
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,959
so for this this is the easiest method

397
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,880
and we can say this is very confirmed

398
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:01,279
that while you're transplanting into

399
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,360
your main field this already have huge

400
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,440
number of roots so

401
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,079
it will not die normally if there is any

402
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,240
other environmental stresses there

403
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:12,480
so this is the nice process very quick

404
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,000
process the slip production or shoot

405
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,800
production from

406
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,760
the

407
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:20,639
mother root of the sweet potato

408
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:23,120
and just you can set the root

409
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:26,079
you can decide for the full or the full

410
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,160
size of the sweet potato into the water

411
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:31,199
or you can make it to half

412
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:34,320
and set for the root shooting and after

413
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:37,440
two weeks you can remove the shoot from

414
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:40,399
the mother dude and soak into water for

415
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:43,920
rooting from that newly grown shoot so

416
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:46,399
very nice very quick and confirmed that

417
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,680
after transplanting it will continue to

418
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,079
grow

419
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,000
okay this is very nice and grow and you

420
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:54,720
can try at your home and if you have the

421
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,560
planning to grow sweet potato and in and

422
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,440
very well grant that you are confirmed

423
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,079
that

424
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,360
your plant is will be survived

425
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,600
nicely

426
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,600
okay
