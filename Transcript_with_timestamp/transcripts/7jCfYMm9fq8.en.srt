00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,040
the future of farming a sustainable

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:07,399
whole Farm approach farming has always

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,200
been the backbone of human civilization

4
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:11,679
but as we Face growing challenges like

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,759

scarcity and an increasing global

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,960
population the way we Farm must evolve

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,880
sustainability in agriculture is no

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,519
longer just a trend it's a necessity for

10
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:27,000
survival today we'll explore the concept

11
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:29,359
of a whole Farm approach a strategy that

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,719
promises not just productivity but also

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,920
single changes like planting cover crops

16
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,719
or switching to organic fertilizer it's

17
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,280
about treating your farm as a connected

18
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,160
system where every action benefits the

19
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,079
whole let's dive into what this means

20
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,039
and how adopting the system can set

crops grown in a field over Seasons or

50
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,320
years instead of planting the same crop

51
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,680
repeatedly a farmer May plant legumes

52
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,200
one year cereals the next and cover

53
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,759
