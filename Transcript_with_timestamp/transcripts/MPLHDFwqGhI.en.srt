00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:13,789

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:29,169
1,000 cars an hour food for 100 million

00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:44,110
people half the largest cities in

00:00:29,169 --> 00:00:50,679
America trade center of the nation more

6
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:56,350
universities more freshwater ways more

7
00:00:50,679 --> 00:01:00,839
industry more agriculture than any other

8
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:04,979
region in the world this is the Midwest

9
00:01:00,839 --> 00:01:04,979
heartland of the nation

10
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:25,310
from the Mesabi Range in Minnesota to

11
00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:27,200
the cold fields of Kentucky from the

12
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:30,229
steel mills of Pittsburgh to the wheat

13
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:34,310
fields of Nebraska these of a long

14
00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:36,289
horizons of the Midwest most of the

15
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:40,189
world's population and wealth is found

16
00:01:36,289 --> 00:01:40,759
in regions near the sea why is America's

17
00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:45,049
Midwest

18
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:46,939
an exception to this general rule to

19
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:51,409
examine the wealth of this region we

20
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:54,939
must first look at its land thousands of

21
00:01:51,409 --> 00:01:57,469
years ago it was leveled by glacial ice

22
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:59,450
the vegetation which followed the ice

23
00:01:57,469 --> 00:02:03,399
left most of the land with a rich soil

24
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:03,399
ideal for agriculture

25
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,950
now the Midwest has a rich dairy belt in

26
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,560
the north to supply milk for the cities

27
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:15,950
of the region and cheese and butter for

28
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,599
export to other regions the southern

29
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:20,540
portion of the heartland is well-suited

30
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,730
to general farming but across the middle

31
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:26,239
of the region lies the most important

32
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:29,599
agricultural area in the nation the Corn

33
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:32,299
Belt and it is here in the Midwestern

34
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,400
Corn Belt that our story begins with a

35
00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:37,280
man who has seen remarkable changes over

36
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,419
the last half century when I came here

37
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:44,569
50 years ago 60 bushels to the acre was

38
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:48,919
considered a high yield today in

39
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:52,250
comparison 180 bushes is a high yield

40
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:53,930
mr. Charles Gunn an Midwestern scientist

41
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:58,450
who has devoted his life to improving

42
00:02:53,930 --> 00:03:07,280
the corn plant 85% of the corn grown

43
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:09,590
approximately is fed to livestock the

44
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:13,069
Midwest handles more beef and more hogs

45
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:15,169
than any other region in the nation this

46
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:17,329
morning John Piggott a progressive

47
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:20,169
Illinois farmer he's shipping some of

48
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:20,169
his animals to mark

49
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:34,030
good highways and the modern truck have

50
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:37,210
changed the farmers method of getting

51
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:39,340
products to market this slaughterhouse

52
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:42,430
40 miles from the farm is the

53
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:45,070
destination of mr. Pickett's beef when

54
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:47,080
John was a young boy almost all beef was

55
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:48,070
sent by rail to the large packing houses

56
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,950
of Chicago

57
00:03:48,070 --> 00:04:00,190
now the packing houses have moved out of

58
00:03:50,950 --> 00:04:03,880
the city we still just been out here

59
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:09,780
about four years now and it is a

60
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:09,780
convenience just ship over here

61
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:14,230
we still have to sell we can get the

62
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:17,410
best price we'll sell the Swift

63
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:19,420
we'll sell an Armour which is over here

64
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:21,420
at Sterling which is 60 miles away which

65
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:24,850
is about the same distance of Chicago

66
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:26,770
but we just have to sell the demand at

67
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:28,330
all that'll give us the most money for

68
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:31,800
the cattle that's about the only way we

69
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,800
determine who we're gonna sell to

70
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,740
Midwest farmers are so productive that

71
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:42,900
overproduction and the tougher market

72
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,900
competition have become serious problems

73
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:51,700
our big problem is that we don't really

74
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:53,860
have much bargaining power when we go

75
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:56,470
buy our cattle we have to buy them at

76
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:58,060
the price that the man wants to sell on

77
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:00,190
that if we can buy them a little cheaper

78
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:02,620
we try to but basically speaking we have

79
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:05,350
we give his price and when we turn

80
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:07,180
around to sell our product we take the

81
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,920
price again that they'll give us and

82
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,950
we're one of the few people that do this

83
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:13,480
we don't have enough bargaining power

84
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:17,080
we're going to have to organize as

85
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:19,360
producers and get in a bargaining

86
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:22,110
position with these chain stores and the

87
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:26,170
people that are gonna consume our meat

88
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:29,380
today the market was good but next month

89
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:32,110
prices may drop this is the problem

90
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:35,890
facing every farmer in America every

91
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:38,500
time he buys for the future we usually

92
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:43,420
buy in the south southwest majority I

93
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:45,520
cannot come from Texas my father and I

94
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:49,420
or either maybe just one of us will go

95
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:52,300
down there at least once a year and look

96
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:54,340
at these cattle and usually buying them

97
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,200
we may not buy them the day we see him

98
00:05:54,340 --> 00:06:00,010
we not may not buy him till two or three

99
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:02,520
months later over the phone hello John

100
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:07,270
Piggott a decal oh yeah

101
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:10,120
just fine say we're looking for some

102
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:12,580
campers weighing approximately five six

103
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:16,000
hundred pounds you have those heifers

104
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:19,600
that you spoke about earlier uh-huh

105
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,040
those are Hereford heifers

106
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:25,580
what what's the price you're asking for

107
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:29,270
those cattle now that's a little bit

108
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:31,840
higher than we want to pay our market

109
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:35,270
isn't that good

110
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,610
well we better buy him around twenty

111
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:43,570
four and a half cents at the highest

112
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:48,230
laid into us here at home that's right

113
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:50,630
well we'll we'll bid you twenty four and

114
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:54,920
a half cents a pound on those Hereford

115
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:58,400
heifers if you want to deliver them to

116
00:06:54,920 --> 00:07:17,540
the cow when one could we get those

117
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:20,930
cattle side 180 to 200 days that they'll

118
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:24,320
double their money which of course isn't

119
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:25,790
all profit about 75% of that doubling

120
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:29,030
money we're talking about will be feed

121
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:31,180
cost we would consider this a fair

122
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,180
return

123
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:36,730
the midwest has become the meat

124
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:40,440
tenderizer to the nation because of the

125
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:40,440
corn that it feeds the livestock

126
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:48,240
mr. Pickett's farm produces two and

127
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:49,020
one-half times as much as it did 30

128
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,270
years ago

129
00:07:49,020 --> 00:08:21,690
for the equipment necessary for this

130
00:07:51,270 --> 00:08:23,580
increased production in 1903 John

131
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:26,040
Pickett's grandfather and Irish

132
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:29,160
immigrants began a dairy operation on

133
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:31,710
this land the farm has remained in the

134
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:35,160
family through two world wars and a

135
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:39,270
Great Depression again there are new

136
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:40,770
faces on the farm my father's been in

137
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:45,780
the cattle business a good number of

138
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:50,160
years and I always did enjoy wanted to

139
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:52,080
be in it and as far as raising a family

140
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,740
there's just no place to raise a family

141
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:58,970
like in the country and it's a good life

142
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,970
there's no question about it

143
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:04,800
John's brothers have not gone on to

144
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:07,200
farming and throughout the Midwest and

145
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:11,850
the nation the farm population is just

146
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:13,950
half what it was a generation ago when

147
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:17,400
these children grow up they will face an

148
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:20,580
unusual situation constantly rising

149
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:23,180
productivity in the face of serious farm

150
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,180
problems

151
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:31,320
poor marketing methods high cost of

152
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:34,050
machines and labor rising land values

153
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,269
and taxes these are the problems which

154
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:41,250
face the children of the world's most

155
00:09:36,269 --> 00:09:43,620
productive land but farming is only half

156
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:45,060
the story of the Midwest for the land

157
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,740
which provided the agricultural

158
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:51,110
opportunities also gave us the

159
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:54,870
beginnings of a great industrial boom in

160
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:56,910
1837 and Midwestern er John Deere began

161
00:09:54,870 --> 00:10:03,750
to develop steel plows to work the

162
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:05,339
Midwestern soil a few years later Cyrus

163
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:09,529
McCormick began making reapers in

164
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:09,529
Chicago to be near his farm customers

165
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:19,320
now almost every need of the consumer is

166
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,269
provided by Midwestern industry the rich

167
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,480
topsoil may have attracted the farmer

168
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:25,800
but in the lower layers of earth

169
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:29,860
industry found the energy to run its

170
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:34,160
machines energy in the form of coal

171
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:36,470
[Music]

172
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:40,070
now almost half the nation's energy

173
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:42,110
comes from the Midwest in cadiz Ohio a

174
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:44,270
large-scale strip mining operation

175
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:48,830
provides coal to energy users in the

176
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:51,500
heartland and neighboring regions the

177
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:55,150
potential power from the earth had to be

178
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,150
matched by an energetic people

179
00:10:55,930 --> 00:11:05,940
I am Craig Robert I have been working

180
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:10,390
for the company approximately 26 years I

181
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:13,570
started as a ditch digger run tractor

182
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:15,430
and oiled and finally worked myself into

183
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:19,630
the position I am in now

184
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:23,950

00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:55,490
place in the cities because of the
