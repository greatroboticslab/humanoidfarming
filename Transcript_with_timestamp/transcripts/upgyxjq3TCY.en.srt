1
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,880
The safety and quality of the final

2
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,960
juice sold to the consumer ultimately

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,839
depends on the safety and quality of the

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,480
raw material. The raw materials include

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,720
the fruit and or vegetable, water, and

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,600
any additives used at any point in the

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,519
process. In addition, the environment in

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,000
and around the growing fields and the

9
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:30,640
packing house can affect the safety and

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,880
quality of the raw material. Microbial

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,600
contamination of produce can occur at

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,239
any point. One of the keys to reducing

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,559
microbial risks on the farm is the

14
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:43,200
commitment of the farmer and all farm

15
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,440
workers. The raw materials used to make

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,760
fruit and vegetable juices are grown and

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,039
produced in many different geographical

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,760
areas. Examples range from oranges grown

19
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,600
in Florida to apples from Washington to

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,280
carrots grown in California to

21
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,800
cranberries from the bogs of

22
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,719
Massachusetts.

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,199
In addition to materials grown in the

24
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,600
United States, raw material is produced

25
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,680
in many countries throughout the world.

26
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,159
This material comes in all shapes and

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,799
sizes. The processor may receive this

28
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:15,360
material as whole fruits and vegetables,

29
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,159
purees, or single strength juices and

30
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,799
juice concentrates. Containers used to

31
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,119
ship this material can be as varied as a

32
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:26,080
small wood basket to a very large

33
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,080
stainless steel tank. No matter what the

34
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,920
source of the raw material or the manner

35
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,400
in which it arrives at the processing

36
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,040
plant, the processor should be concerned

37
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,119
with the controls used to minimize the

38
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,000
potential contamination of the juice

39
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:43,119
components at all stages of growth,

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,759
storage, processing, and transportation.

41
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:48,320
Resources available to food companies

42
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,960
and growers include the guide to

43
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,960
minimize microbial food safety hazards

44
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,439

by the Environmental Protection Agency.

51
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,840
These documents provide examples of how

52
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,400
a processor can interact with a grower

53
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,480
to ensure the safety of the raw material

54
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,640
and may be used to construct grower

55
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,959
agreements, which could include water

56
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,440
quality issues, chemicals used,

57
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:26,239
commodity or variety grown, minimum

58
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,640
grades or standards, and other areas as

59
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,959
deemed appropriate. Growers should be

60
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,680
aware of the microbiological problems

61
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,840
that can occur and need to take steps to

62
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,920
help protect the public health. There's

63
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,480
no way to guarantee that everything

64
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,080
grown on the farm is free from harmful

65
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,560
microorganisms.

66
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,120
But by taking some preventive measures

67
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,640
during all phases of production, these

68
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,800
risks can be reduced. In this module, we

69
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,200
will be discussing the basic principles

70
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,920
and recommended good agricultural and

71
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,319
manufacturing practices for field and

72
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,640
packing house operators to minimize

73
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,879
microbial food safety hazards in the

74
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,200
production, packing, and transportation

75
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,200
of fresh fruits and vegetables.

76
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,440
Analyzing the risk of microbial

77
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:15,280
contamination includes several major

78
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:18,400
areas of concern. soil, water quality

79
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,959
and cooling, field packing facility

80
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,480
sanitation and transportation, worker

81
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,400
hygiene and pest control. Each operator

82
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,800
should decide which combination of

83
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,000
proper agricultural and manufacturing

84
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,080
practices are most appropriate for them.

85
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,080
By identifying basic principles of

86
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,560
microbial food safety within the

87
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,040
processes of growing, harvesting,

88
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,360
packing, and transporting fresh produce,

89
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,920
you will be better prepared to recognize

90
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,000
and address the principal elements known

91
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,760
to cause concern to microbial food

92
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
safety. These include principle one,

93
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,319
prevention of microbial contamination of

94
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,799
fresh produce is favored over reliance

95
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:02,400
on corrective actions once contamination

96
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:04,720
has occurred. Principle two, to minimize

97
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,519
microbial food safety hazards in fresh

98
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,439
produce, growers, packers or shippers

99
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,920
should use good agricultural and

100
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,879
manufacturing practices in those areas

101
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,280
over which they have control. Principle

102
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,519
three, fresh produce can become

103
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,240
microbiologically contaminated at any

104
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,000
point along the farm-totable food chain.

105
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,400
The major source of microbial

106
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,759
contamination with fresh produce is

107
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,880
associated with human or animal feces.

108
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,280
Principle four, whenever water comes in

109
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,520
contact with produce, its source and

110
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,120
quality dictates the potential for

111
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,199
contamination.

112
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,520
Minimize the potential of microbial

113
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,600
contamination from water used with fresh

114
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,479
fruits and vegetables.

115
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,199
Principle five, practices using animal

116
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:53,520
manure or municipal bioolid wastes

117
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,120
should be managed closely to minimize

118
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,440
the potential for microbial

119
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,320
contamination of fresh produce.

120
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,720
Principle six, worker hygiene and

121
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,440
sanitation practices during production,

122
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,840
harvesting, sorting, packing, and

123
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,240
transport play a critical role in

124
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,800
minimizing the potential for microbial

125
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,840
contamination of fresh produce.

126
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,759
Principle seven, follow all applicable

127
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,320
local, state, and federal laws and

128
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,960
regulations or corresponding or similar

129
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,039
laws, regulations, or standards for

130
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,759
operators outside the US for

131
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:30,960
agricultural practices.

132
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:33,600
Principle eight, accountability at all

133
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,240
levels of the agricultural environment,

134
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,400
including the farm, packing facility,

135
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,639
distribution center, and transport

136
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,360
operation is important to a successful

137
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,440
food safety program. There should be

138
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,759
qualified personnel and effective

139
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,240
monitoring to ensure that all elements

140
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,080
of the program function correctly and to

141
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,199
help track produce back through the

142
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,440
distribution channels to the producer.

143
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,600
There are many possible ways for produce

144
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,759
to become contaminated by harmful

145
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,800
microorganisms during production,

146
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:07,759
harvest, and handling. These may include

147
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,639
soil, irrigation water, animal manure,

148
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,960
inadequately composted manure, wild and

149
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:16,319
domestic animals, inadequate worker

150
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:19,199
hygiene, harvesting equipment, transport

151
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,520
containers, field to packing facility,

152
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,000
wash and rinse water, unsanitary

153
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,440
handling during sorting, equipment used

154
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
to soak, pack or cut produce, ice,

155
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,080
cooling units, transport vehicles,

156
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,319
improper storage conditions, and

157
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,479
crosscontamination.

158
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,880
Biological hazards can stem from the use

159
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,960
of manure as a fertilizer, improper

160
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,199
storage of manure, agricultural

161
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,759
chemicals, animal waste, and unclean

162
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,919
irrigation water. Fertilizing with

163
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,080
manure can cause cases of foodborne

164
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,639
illness. If manure is used for

165
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,520
fertilization and soil building, only

166
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,280
well composted manure should be used.

167
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,599
Also, the time between the application

168
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,800
of manure to production areas and the

169
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:05,360
harvesting of crops should be maximized.

170
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,120
Raw or inadequately treated manure

171
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,680
should not be applied to a vegetable

172
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,919
crop during the growing season. While

173
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,759
manure is stored or treated, it is

174
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,479
important to prevent contamination of

175
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:19,039
fields or water caused by runoff or

176
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,960
windblown particles from the manure.

177
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,440
It's also important to keep the manure

178
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,599
area far from vegetable fields and

179
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,319
packing houses.

180
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:30,319
To minimize exposure to animal waste,

181
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,800
livestock should not be allowed to roam

182
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,160
near the production fields. Growers

183
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,560
should determine whether surrounding

184
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,800
fields and farms are used for animal

185
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,120
production. Growers should ensure that

186
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,199
animal waste from adjacent fields or

187
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,120
waste storage facilities does not

188
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,759
contaminate the produce production areas

189
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,000
during heavy rains, especially if fresh

190
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,400
produce is grown in low-lying fields or

191
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,560
orchards. Measures might include

192
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,680
physical barriers such as ditches,

193
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:01,280
mounds, grass saw waterways, diversion

194
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,199
berms, and vegetable buffer areas. In

195
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,080
addition, high concentrations of

196
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,319
wildlife such as deer or water foul in a

197
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,560
field may increase the potential for

198
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,800
microbial contamination.

199
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,879
Control of wild animal populations in

200
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,879
the field may be difficult, especially

201
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,120
where crop production areas are adjacent

202
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:22,000
to wooded areas, open meadows, and

203
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,759
waterways. Federal, state, or local

204
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,080
animal protection requirements should

205
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,919
also be considered. However, to the

206
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,759
extent possible where high

207
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,759
concentrations of wildlife are a

208
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,399
concern, growers should consider

209
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:37,039
establishing good agricultural practices

210
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:39,360
to deter or redirect wildlife to areas

211
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,919
with crops that are not destined for the

212
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,839
fresh produce market.

213
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,839
Agricultural production chemicals should

214
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,920
only be used according to the label,

215
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,800
which includes the application rate,

216
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,640
re-entry date, and safe harvest date.

217
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,959
The prescribed use of these chemicals

218
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:58,800
will prevent any pesticide or chemical

219
00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:00,959
residues that pose a chemical hazard.

220
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,360
Water used in crop production involves

221
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:06,240
numerous field operations, including

222
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,399
irrigation, applications of pesticides,

223
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,040
growth regulators, and fertilizers, and

224
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:13,360
frost control. Post-th harvest uses

225
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,480
include produce rinsing, cooling,

226
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,640
washing, waxing, and transport. Water

227
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,240
can also be a carrier of many

228
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,320
microorganisms.

229
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,959
Wherever water comes into contact with

230
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,680
fresh produce, its quality dictates the

231
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:30,000
potential for pathogen contamination.

232
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,399
The quality of water, how and when it is

233
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,200
used, and the characteristics of the

234
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:38,000
crop influence the potential for water

235
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,560
to contaminate produce. In general, the

236
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,040
quality of water in direct contact with

237
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,680
the edible portion of produce may need

238
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,399
to be of better quality compared to uses

239
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,560
where there is minimal contact. Other

240
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,959
factors that influence the potential for

241
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,959
contact with waterbornne pathogens and

242
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,279
their likelihood of causing foodborne

243
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:59,760
illness include the condition and type

244
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:02,480
of crop, the amount of time between

245
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:05,120
contact and harvest, and posth harvest

246
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,120
handling practices. Produce that has a

247
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,440
large surface area, such as leafy

248
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,680
vegetables, and that with topographical

249
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,240
features such as rough surfaces that

250
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,640
foster attachment or enttrapment, may be

251
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,880
at greater risk from pathogens if they

252
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,279
are present, especially if contact

253
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,040
occurs close to harvest or during post-h

254
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,959
harvest handling.

255
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,440
Testing agricultural water for the

256
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:30,079
presence of indicator organisms such as

257
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,160
total colifforms or fecal cholifforms

258
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,160
allows a grower to build a history and

259
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,920
knowledge of the quality of their water.

260
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,000
It may also provide a grower with

261
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,000
information to use when planning and

262
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,680
implementing a corrective action plan

263
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,880
should high levels of indicator

264
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,800
organisms occur. The best quality water

265
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,839
should be used for crop protection

266
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,519
sprays and other water uses that contact

267
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,240
the edible portion of the crop,

268
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,640
especially close to harvest.

269
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,800
Water quality is even more important

270
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,360
when water contacts produce after

271
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,680
harvest, such as for cooling or washing

272
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,240
operations. Water should be safe and

273
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,240
sanitary for its intended use, both at

274
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,279
the start of and throughout all

275
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,360
processes. Not only is highquality water

276
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,519
important for safety reasons, but it

277
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,279
also increases the posth harvest quality

278
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:21,040
of produce by decreasing spoilage.

279
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,440
Various methods are available for

280
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,079
cooling produce, including water, ice,

281
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,920
and forced air. The method used depends

282
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,000
on the fruit or vegetable and the

283
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,920
resources of the operator. In most

284
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,240
instances, cooling with air such as

285
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,959
vacuum coolers or fans will pose the

286
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,959
lowest risk. Water and ice used in

287
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,959
cooling operations should be considered

288
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,519
a potential source of pathogenic

289
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:45,760
contamination. Further, reuse or

290
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,320
recycling of water to cool continuous

291
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,079
loads of produce increases the risk of

292
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,079
crosscontamination.

293
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,839
Contaminated produce from a single

294
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,240
container going through a cooling

295
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:59,040
process may result in the buildup of

296
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,399
pathogens in the cooling water supply.

297
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,640
Operators should follow good

298
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,880
manufacturing practices to ensure that

299
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:07,279
chilling does not introduce food safety

300
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,839
hazards. Practices may include the

301
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:12,560
following. Maintain temperatures that

302
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,480
promote optimum produce quality.

303
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,959
Maintain air cooling equipment and

304
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,720
cooling areas. Air cooling equipment and

305
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,279
cooling areas should be periodically

306
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,279
cleaned and inspected. Potential sources

307
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:26,000
of contamination should not be located

308
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,560
near air intakes. Consider the use of

309
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,399
antimicrobial chemicals in cooling water

310
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,920
when appropriate.

311
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:36,079
Keep water and ice clean and sanitary.

312
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,000
Consider periodic microbial testing of

313
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,880
chilling water and water used to make

314
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,880
ice. Operators should contact ice

315
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,839
suppliers for information about the

316
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:48,160
source and quality of their ice. Water

317
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:51,760
in hydrocoolers should be changed as

318
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:55,680
often as needed. manufacture, transport,

319
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:57,839
and store ice under sanitary conditions.

320
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,839
Chilling equipment such as hydrocoolers

321
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,079
and containers holding produce during

322
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,880
chilling operations should be clean and

323
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:07,360
sanitary. Field soil should be removed

324
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:10,399
as much as possible from produce and

325
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,480
containers prior to chilling. Interiors

326
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:16,000
of hydrocoolers should routinely be

327
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,079
cleaned and sanitized. If antimicrobials

328
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,079
such as chlorine or ozone are used to

329
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,320
maintain water quality, their

330
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,880
concentration and any other factors such

331
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,279
as pH and temperature that impact the

332
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,200
effectiveness of the antimicrobial

333
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,120
should be actively monitored and

334
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,959
managed.

335
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,880
Microbial contamination or

336
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,720
crosscontamination of fresh produce

337
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,120
during preh harvest and harvest

338
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,920
activities may result from contact with

339
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,160
soils, fertilizers, water, workers, and

340
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,200
harvesting equipment such as harvesting

341
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,920
machinery, knives, containers, tables,

342
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:52,639
baskets, packaging materials, brushes,

343
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:55,360
and buckets. Any of these may be a

344
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:58,000
source of pathogenic microorganisms.

345
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,399
Growers should consider the following.

346
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,560
Facilities used to store fresh produce

347
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,040
should be cleaned and as necessary

348
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,959
disinfected prior to harvest. These

349
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,199
facilities should also be inspected for

350
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:12,240
evidence of pests such as rodents,

351
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:14,480
birds, and insects. Discard damaged

352
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,079
containers that are no longer cleanable

353
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,160
in an effort to reduce possible

354
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:21,600
microbial contamination of fresh

355
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:24,720
produce. Clean containers or bins before

356
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:27,279
using to transport fresh produce. Ensure

357
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,199
that produce that is washed, cooled or

358
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,600
packaged in the field is not

359
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:34,480
contaminated in the process. Contact

360
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,199
with manure or bioolids, poor quality

361
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,920
water, workers with poor hygiene and

362
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:42,320
unclean packaging or packing boxes

363
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,160
greatly increases the risk of microbial

364
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,639
contamination.

365
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,639
Remove as much dirt and mud as possible

366
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,399
from the produce before it leaves the

367
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,560
field.

368
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,320
Operations with poor sanitation in the

369
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,240
packing environment can also

370
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,199
significantly increase the risk of

371
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,199
contaminating fresh produce. Pathogenic

372
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,440
microorganisms may be found on the

373
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:06,320
floors and in the drains in the packing

374
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:09,040
facility and on the surfaces of sorting,

375
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,600
grading, and packing equipment. Without

376
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,600
good sanitary practices, any of these

377
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,920
surfaces that come in contact with fresh

378
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,079
produce could be a potential source of

379
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,399
microbial contamination.

380
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,399
The design, construction, use, and

381
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,560
general cleanliness of the facility and

382
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:27,680
equipment can help reduce the risk of

383
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,920
crosscontamination of produce.

384
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,240
The proper transport of fresh produce

385
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,760
helps reduce the potential for microbial

386
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,079
contamination.

387
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:38,240
Microbial crosscontamination from other

388
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,800
foods and non-food sources and

389
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,800
contaminated surfaces may occur during

390
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,519
loading, unloading, storage, and

391
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,920
transportation operations. Wherever

392
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,519
produce is transported and handled, the

393
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,600
sanitation conditions should be

394
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,839
evaluated.

395
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,839
As previously mentioned, many pathogens

396
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,560
can be transferred to fresh fruit and

397
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:01,040
vegetables by ill workers who pick,

398
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,720
package, or handle the produce. Common

399
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,279
sense and training can reduce

400
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,680
contamination from humans. Frequent

401
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,920
proper handwashing is the most important

402
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,240
strategy to prevent food bornne illness

403
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,720
outbreaks. The importance of food

404
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,680
workers understanding and practicing

405
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:21,199
proper hygiene cannot be overemphasized

406
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:23,519
and are discussed in module three. Many

407
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:26,480
insect pests can be controlled through

408
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,399
integrated pest management, IPM, which

409
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,360
combines biological control with

410
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:34,160
chemical control. Multiple controls may

411
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,560
be integrated for maximum effect.

412
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,199
Insects by themselves can cause a great

413
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,759
deal of damage to any commodity if left

414
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,920
uncontrolled. In addition, secondary

415
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,320
damage to the commodity caused by

416
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,360
associated organisms can be of great

417
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:52,320
concern. One of the primary pests for

418
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,720
apples is the coddling moth. The larvae

419
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,279
burrows into the flesh, leaving an open

420
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,759
wound on the fruit. This wound can then

421
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,279
be infected with bacteria, molds, and

422
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,440
fungi.

423
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:06,079
Patchulin, a toxic product of mold

424
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,640
growth, can then be formed in the wound.

425
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:11,199
Patchulin is heat stable and will not be

426
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,000
removed or inactivated by intervention

427
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:16,079
techniques applied to the final juice.

428
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,640
Reducing or eliminating the amount of

429
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,640
insect damage to the apple in the field

430
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,360
will reduce or eliminate the amount of

431
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,520
patchulin found in the final juice.

432
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:28,240
Therefore, appropriate levels of insect

433
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,960
control on the farm can help ensure a

434
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,280
safe and consumable product. Pests can

435
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,440
also be a source of and a means for

436
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,160
spreading microbial pathogens in the

437
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,480
field and packing facility. Pest control

438
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,120
management is discussed in detail in

439
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,360
module 4.

440
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,440
The ability to identify the source of a

441
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,600
product can serve as an important

442
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,760
complement to good agricultural and

443
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,919
manufacturing practices intended to

444
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,320
minimize liability and prevent the

445
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,240
occurrence of food safety problems. The

446
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,640
source of all raw materials should be

447
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,280
well documented in case a trace back is

448
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,360
needed. In addition, documentation on

449
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,840
any water or additive testing,

450
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,000
certificates of analysis, minimum grades

451
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,919
and/or standards met, lot

452
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,320
identification, date received or

453
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,799
shipped, agreements, and processing

454
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,280
documentation will help investigators in

455
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:22,160
the event of a problem and may limit

456
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,720
your liability. Documentation of date of

457
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,640
harvest, farm identification, and who

458
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,400
handled the product from grower to

459
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,960
receiver should be part of the shipping

460
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,280
manifest. Information that needs to be a

461
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,039
part of the manifest can be specified in

462
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,520
the agreement between the supplier and

463
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:41,720
the processor. Trace back is further

464
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,720
discussed in module six.
