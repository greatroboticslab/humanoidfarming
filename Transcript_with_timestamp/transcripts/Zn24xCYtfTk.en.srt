2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:11,470
good afternoon guys today we're going to

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:12,730
just be moving cows but but really why

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:15,550
we're moving cows I'm just gonna kind of

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:18,369
tell you about rotational grazing and

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:21,160
what we do here compared to what some

7
00:00:18,369 --> 00:00:23,710
farmers do around this area also tell

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:26,860
you why we rotational grazing tense of

9
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:29,980
graze and really the purpose of it you

10
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:32,079
know for the longest you've always heard

11
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,989
especially big cattlemen say it's

12
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:37,840
impossible to have a cow unless you have

13
00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:39,760
acre per cow or two acres per cow and if

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,199
you're running a big farm and you're you

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,199
don't have a lot of cross fencing or do

16
00:00:41,199 --> 00:00:47,320
some kind of rotational grazing plan

17
00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:50,140
that is very that is true however if you

18
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:54,550
learn to manage your your your grass and

19
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:56,559
manage your paddocks the right way a lot

20
00:00:54,550 --> 00:01:00,010
of times you can take that that plan and

21
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:03,339
put a lot more cows in a certain area we

22
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:06,399
have about 35 to 36 acres in front of

23
00:01:03,339 --> 00:01:10,060
our house and to be honest with you we

24
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:12,430
don't use it you can see all over there

25
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:15,369
it's all pines in front of house so it's

26
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:18,100
a pine thicket if we needed it you know

27
00:01:15,369 --> 00:01:19,570
we could cut it I guess but we really

28
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:22,479
don't need it we have five head of

29
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:25,659
cattle and we run through six rotational

30
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,770
grazing paddocks now I want to walk you

31
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:27,939
through the packs we have because we're

32
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,009
going to be moving them off so you'll

33
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:32,619
see what they've done to one paddock and

34
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:34,689
how we allow it to heal for for about

35
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:36,670
five to six weeks and then we'll they'll

36
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:38,920
be back on it but you see how it'll grow

37
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:40,750
great so let's start off with um kind of

38
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,009
where we're gonna move them so as you

39
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,409
look right here you see it's just piles

40
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:47,369
of grass all through this little paddock

41
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:49,899
now this paddock is not big enough for

42
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:51,430
three or four or five cows probably not

43
00:01:49,899 --> 00:01:54,640
even really big enough for two cows to

44
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:55,869
stay full-time but that's not what we do

45
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,719
and when you talk about rotational

46
00:01:55,869 --> 00:02:00,250
grazing the whole purpose of rotational

47
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,200
grazing is you're gonna take this little

48
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:03,609
paddock and put them in it for a while

49
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,990
and then you're gonna move it to this

50
00:02:03,609 --> 00:02:07,479
one now you see this one is more

51
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:09,520
splotchy it's got some grass but it's

52
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:11,230
really not where it needs to be well

53
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,080
this is the paddock that they came out

54
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:15,010
of before we moved them across to the

55
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,860
other side of house so this

56
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:20,860
the third week of it healing now the

57
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:22,810
grass that's here is is a winter grass

58
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,459
that's kind of leaving from here but

59
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,099
you'll start seeing you can see some of

60
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:28,299
the clover and you see some of the

61
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:30,010
really some Bermuda and Scott some old

62
00:02:28,299 --> 00:02:32,560
field behavior growing back up in here

63
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:35,530
but it's not ready to put cows back on

64
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,690
so what we do is we will let it heal for

65
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:41,260
about another three weeks and then by

66
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:43,569
then this field will really look like

67
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:45,730
that feel but it's because we're

68
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:48,430
allowing it to heal you know here here

69
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:50,230
we are we have cows who are who are not

70
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:52,030
tearing the grass up but we're letting

71
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:54,190
them eat the grass and then ultimately

72
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:55,780
they're they're fertilizing the grass

73
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:57,760
because they're using the restroom here

74
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:00,459
and have them fresh manure and as it

75
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,980
just sits here and the rainfalls ends up

76
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:05,019
making a great paddock so we'll move

77
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,609
them into this pack now so we've got

78
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:09,010
this one here that's about three weeks

79
00:03:06,609 --> 00:03:11,560
from healing they will stay in that

80
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:13,239
paddock they're the pretty one for about

81
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,260
a week to week and a half however long

82
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:17,549
it takes them to eat it

83
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:19,750
now here's the pros and cons to

84
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:22,180
intensive grazing or rotational grazing

85
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:24,819
or whatever you want to call it a lot of

86
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:26,139
that grass there is beautiful grass some

87
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:29,109
of us winter grass some of it spring

88
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:31,389
grass coming back through pros when you

89
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:34,060
put them in a place like that they have

90
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:36,519
to eat with what's there meaning they're

91
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:38,199
not gonna pick and choose when when you

92
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:41,290
don't have cross fencing or you don't

93
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:43,000
have an intensive grazing plans and you

94
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,349
let cows just go because hey you have

95
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,150
enough acreage for the cow

96
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:49,269
it's just like us when we're at a

97
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:52,150
potluck or a buffet we may all this food

98
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:53,799
may be okay for us to eat ultimately we

99
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:57,160
may pick and choose what we want to eat

100
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:59,139
so what what anticip grazing does is it

101
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,459
says not only do you eat the good the

102
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:02,109
good grass and the high-protein grass

103
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:03,459
we're gonna make you eat kind of the

104
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:06,099
junk grass or some of the older grass

105
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:07,840
too if you don't make them eat it

106
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:09,310
they're not gonna eat it so then you

107
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,840
have fields growing with a lot more

108
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:13,510
weeds with a lot more mature grasses

109
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,769
that are no good for them so what we do

110
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:17,289
is when we put them in this and you'll

111
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:19,989
see on this other side we normally don't

112
00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:21,789
split our herd however we have split our

113
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:23,349
herd this last few weeks because we're

114
00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:24,729
trying to get one of our cows bred with

115
00:04:23,349 --> 00:04:26,530
a bowl so we've got a bowl with a cow

116
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:28,810
and then the other three are in another

117
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:30,520
paddock which I don't even like

118
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,440
but in this case we are trying to breed

119
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,850
her but but what we're going to do is

120
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,500
we'll put them in here and if they

121
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,910
they'll eat all this rye grass real

122
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,100
quick because it's a winter grass it's

123
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:40,600
beautiful it's got heavy protein but

124
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,520
some of this new grass is coming up I

125
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,430
see some red clover and and even some

126
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:48,280
junk grass they may not want to eat it

127
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:50,080
however if we leave them here they

128
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,060
really kind of have to eat it now does

129
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,710
that mean no because ultimate they're

130
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,720
gonna get their nutrients and they're

131
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,400
gonna have hay and things like that but

132
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,350
what it does is it makes all the grass

133
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,389
maintain one level and that's what we

134
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:03,490
want so once they finish that they'll

135
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:09,880
move to the next now let me kind of get

136
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:12,040
you over here if you look in this field

137
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:15,160
over here across the little gravel drive

138
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:17,260
now that that grass right there it has a

139
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,700
lot of weeds in it it's got some good

140
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:20,200
summer grass growing through it looks

141
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,870
like a lot of behavior that's starting

142
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,910
to come up you can see the sprigs now I

143
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:27,790
did not plant that in rye grass

144
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:28,419
whatsoever so it's never had winter

145
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:32,800
grass

146
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:34,120
so as these grasses here start dying and

147
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,460
they start healing and trying to grow

148
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,740
summer grass I've got this paddock over

149
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:41,080
here that has not been touched that's a

150
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,120
pretty nice paddock but then all behind

151
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,430
it if you look on the other side of

152
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,740
these this fence but before you get to

153
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:49,600
the pond we'll have temporary fencing

154
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:51,910
hot wire fencing like poly wire fencing

155
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,380
up and then we will do the same plant so

156
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:56,020
we will make another rotation on

157
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:59,620
temporary fencing while all this other

158
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:01,720
ground heals now the reason I say all of

159
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,700
that is to say when people tell you you

160
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,860
can't have enough you can't have cows on

161
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:08,260
a smaller piece of land you can you just

162
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:10,510
got to learn how many is too many but

163
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:13,479
then you need to learn how to control

164
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:14,860
your grass a wise man once told me that

165
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:16,419
you know when your cattle farm you're

166
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,850
actually a grass farmer and that is so

167
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:21,190
true and look I'm no expert I'm trying

168
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:23,169
to learn as I go but ultimately if you

169
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:25,270
get them on a good paddock rotation and

170
00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:27,970
you make them eat the the paddock that

171
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:29,710
they're in ultimately it's gonna help

172
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:31,479
them thrive you're not gonna have to do

173
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:32,919
a lot of supplement feeding and you can

174
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:37,330
have a few more cows than you thought

175
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:38,860
you could have had now cons I mean one

176
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:42,370
of the cons right now or was a few weeks

177
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:43,660
ago with rotational grazing

178
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,330
it's got to be perfect weather well

179
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:48,190
there's no such thing as perfect weather

180
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:50,680
now when in the south of Mississippi we

181
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:53,169
had about four or five weeks of just

182
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,240
just rain I mean just rained and rained

183
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:57,970
and rained and rain and of course I know

184
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,590
it's for a purpose but what it did is

185
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:01,660
the paddock they were in they pretty

186
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:03,520
much destroyed just because they were

187
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:05,229
they were slopping around in the mud it

188
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,790
hurt the ground because the grass quit

189
00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:10,389
growing in those areas that they were on

190
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:13,389
so what what we did was we had to

191
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:15,100
supplement a lot more hay now we have

192
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:17,530
hay and we're happy to give them hay

193
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:20,919
however we were giving them a lot more

194
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:22,930
hay because the grounds tore up so that

195
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:24,789
paddock now had to heal a lot longer so

196
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:26,620
ultimately then it allow it so that

197
00:07:24,789 --> 00:07:27,789
feels hurt then we had to move into

198
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,560
another field that we kind of had to

199
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:31,210
hold them in for a little bit so they

200
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,370
wouldn't tear up any other fields so a

201
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:36,610
con to making sure rotational grazing

202
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:38,020
works is weather when the natural

203
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:40,270
elements happens you've got to be

204
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:43,300
prepared to either supplement with the

205
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:45,160
hay and have the hand accessible or be

206
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,510
willing to put them in a paddock and

207
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,010
kind of let it get hurt a little bit

208
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:51,400
until that other one kind of grows back

209
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:53,080
so it's a learning curve but like I said

210
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,580
I messed up probably one paddock that

211
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,840
took me a little bit more time to heal

212
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:58,180
it now I'll show you that paddock

213
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,229
because this is fine now but um so

214
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,750
elements can hurt it so if you have

215
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:03,250
droughts that grass for those patran are

216
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,919
gonna grow as quick so it's important to

217
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:08,440
have maybe like I had like I was showing

218
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,150
you back here those paddocks that have

219
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,220
not had rye grass on them and they have

220
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:14,229
not been disturbed at all so say for

221
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:15,880
instance I get a drought or I get major

222
00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:18,520
weather and it's stead of tearing up my

223
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:20,680
paddocks that has fertile ground and

224
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,750
seed that's already in it I may put them

225
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,599
in poly wire out in the middle over

226
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:26,349
there just to get them off this land to

227
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,349
let it heal

228
00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:32,860
so the good thing about digital grazing

229
00:08:29,349 --> 00:08:35,200
is it can it can help your land and make

230
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:36,669
it more fertile however if you abuse

231
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,900
that it can really hurt your land

232
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:40,089
because if you leave them too long on

233
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:41,500
this paddock instead I haven't grass at

234
00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:43,330
two or three inches you have dirt

235
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,310
because they've ate it all so make sure

236
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:47,950
you're taking care of rotational grazing

237
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:49,870
and making sure they're eating but don't

238
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:52,480
let them eat it to the ground because it

239
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:54,680
won't grow back nearly as fast so again

240
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,080
this is where we're moving them

241
00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:00,839
all right summer over there that's why

242
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,370
we will move on why these heal one they

243
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:04,500
came out of about two or three weeks ago

244
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:06,510
so you see it's it's it's a lot more

245
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,820
dirt a lot the grass is not growing

246
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:10,440
heavy and all the areas yet but it will

247
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,270
come back but we've got another three

248
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,360
weeks of healing so let's go look at the

249
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:17,580
other side if you remember my aspiring

250
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,270
bull rider that I brought the bull over

251
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:22,410
and you saw the video of him going crazy

252
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:23,940
after that we say you know what we may

253
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:25,490
want to figure something out because we

254
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:28,110
have some young casts and also a ball

255
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:29,279
and with our kids out we want to make

256
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,600
sure they're safe and make sure the ball

257
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,850
don't get away or either the little

258
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,410
casket away so we built this we got a

259
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:37,350
guy that was a good friend of ours build

260
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:40,320
this uh this run basically it's like a

261
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:41,700
true cattle run so it's it's it's gonna

262
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,470
be a way that we can get from paddock to

263
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:49,370
paddock and still be in a closed system

264
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:53,339
we have one little angus who I tell you

265
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:55,950
he's a handful he will not listen he's

266
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:56,100
stubborn he's actually a very smart you

267
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:59,400
know

268
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:02,970
bull but he won't listen he won't get

269
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:04,680
close to us so this little walk instead

270
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:06,330
of us having to put him in a trailer our

271
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,279
chance walking him and all sudden

272
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:09,570
something happening to him or he gets in

273
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:11,160
the woods and we got tried track him

274
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:13,020
down we built this little walkway

275
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,810
through so you see look at this how cool

276
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:18,120
it is it's awesome so at least to the

277
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:19,800
other three paddocks and so basically

278
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:24,870
we're gonna go look at those and now

279
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:26,640
here's another thing I have three dairy

280
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:29,400
cows or actually two dairy cow and a

281
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,600
deer bull when we talk about grazing and

282
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,360
we talked about homesteading a lot of

283
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,310
times we most home stores will have

284
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:38,700
dairy animals well if you're doing

285
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:41,370
paddocks remember their animals need a

286
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:44,270
lot more grass and a lot more food a lot

287
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:46,830
more substance than sometimes even meat

288
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:49,620
cows or meat goats and the reason being

289
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:51,779
is because hey they're giving you a lot

290
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:54,180
of milk this is water they're nutrients

291
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:57,570
but luckily you want to do is drain them

292
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:58,800
so you have to watch your cows to make

293
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:00,839
sure they're getting enough nutrients

294
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,820
but if you do a good intense cruising

295
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:05,280
plan they won't matter if their dairy

296
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:07,020
won't matter if they're beat but it will

297
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,890
they all do fine okay let me show you

298
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:11,070
this

299
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:12,630
this is our dairy field as you see we

300
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:15,230
have a stanchion right there now my

301
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:18,170
daeryuk health that I'm milking Elsa

302
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:20,490
stays in these fields these two paddocks

303
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:23,880
just because it makes it easier for us

304
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:26,100
to have her here now most of the time

305
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,270
I'll put the cows with her and then

306
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:31,440
she's the only one that kind of stays

307
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:34,260
back but as you can see over here in the

308
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,540
far corner right there

309
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,790
we've got her with with our bull because

310
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:42,360
again we were trying to breed her back

311
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:44,130
she had a calf in January so now as we

312
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,440
get closer to April she's starting to

313
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:49,290
come back and heat she could have been

314
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,540
bred this last time but I don't know I

315
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:53,640
didn't see it so we're putting them back

316
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:56,610
together now let me show these two

317
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:58,890
paddocks this paddock here you see it

318
00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:00,830
looks like I've cut grass you see if

319
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:03,840
they've taken it down to Harley nothing

320
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:05,760
still grass not dirt because we don't

321
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,590
want dirt showing but you see how they

322
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,170
have maintained it now so that means

323
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:12,900
they're ready to move so now this one

324
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:14,940
this field right here will have about a

325
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:17,910
five and a half to six and a half week

326
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:21,420
healing process on that land now I've

327
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:23,340
got rye that they pretty much ate which

328
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:25,290
is a winter grass and fall grass my

329
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:27,330
spring grass is all starting to really

330
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:30,480
come back up in this field so now it

331
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:35,550
will have six weeks of growth and

332
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,810
healing that's awesome so again intense

333
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:39,410
crazing we want to make sure they're

334
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:43,590
eating everything now let's talk about

335
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:44,940
this paddock you see I don't know if you

336
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,920
tell by the video there's some grass

337
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,600
that's getting a little thicker that's

338
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:51,000
growing better here I'll show you some

339
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:54,060
let's look you see you see these little

340
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,740
I'm sorry it's windy so excuse the noise

341
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,790
and also the movement home but you see

342
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:00,000
it's starting to grow right here in the

343
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:01,950
middle this is the dairy field we only

344
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,050
bring her in to eat and then we bring

345
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:06,450
the bull in with her when I do milker

346
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:08,550
but ultimately they were here about two

347
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:10,710
weeks ago too so they were over there

348
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:12,090
three weeks ago over here two weeks ago

349
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:16,170
so you see this one's a little bit

350
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:17,880
behind that one over there so again this

351
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,680
one's still got about four weeks for it

352
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,690
so they're going they jump back and

353
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,280
forth and it is you got to make sure you

354
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:24,810
you remember where they were and make

355
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,310
sure you have a good plan because

356
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:28,320
ultimately you don't want to skip a

357
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:29,580
field and all sudden you you heard

358
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,960
another field and abused it because

359
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:33,030
they've been there too long or you heard

360
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,730
another field because of the rain look

361
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:37,200
right here see that dirt that is that's

362
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:39,690
that's the passage between this gate

363
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,490
yeah I told you the bad rain of the that

364
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:44,610
came for about five weeks this was the

365
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:47,250
field they heard now as you see it's

366
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:50,550
healing it's healing all next to the

367
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:52,110
barn but right here under me it needs

368
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:54,090
some help you see some sprinkling grass

369
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:56,250
starting to grow but they've heard it

370
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:57,960
now there's nothing we can do it was

371
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,760
rain so that's one they actually have

372
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,230
not been in here and won't be in here

373
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,850
really for another four weeks we'll see

374
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:06,330
how it goes I may even bring a disc in

375
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:07,800
here disc it up lightly and put a little

376
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:10,680
extra seat in here just to make sure

377
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:12,390
it's gonna thrive we try not to have any

378
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,710
kind of fertilizers unless they're

379
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:15,390
they're natural and organic

380
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:16,860
we do have an organic fertilizer we

381
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:19,740
can't throw out we just choose not to

382
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,940
again because our dairy cows eating this

383
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,650
grass and turn around we're milking

384
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:25,670
nurse I'd rather not do that if we don't

385
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:29,100
have to but but you see where they're at

386
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:30,360
the grass is down so we're going to go

387
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,740
ahead and take them out of this field

388
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,320
and we'll take them across to the other

389
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:36,660
side now as I said I true I really don't

390
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,030
like splitting our herd however since

391
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:42,660
I'm milking her and also I'm trying to

392
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:44,820
breed her with our bull we've allowed

393
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:47,040
them to stay away from the Angus and the

394
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,790
other two jerseys or other Jersey excuse

395
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,610
me

396
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:52,260
the other Jersey is bred she is a

397
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:54,450
beautiful little Jersey she's my

398
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:56,130
low-lying Jersey and hopefully the one

399
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:57,960
will start milking by the year in when

400
00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:00,030
she casts but she's a beautiful

401
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,260
first-time heifer and and she's on the

402
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:02,580
other side with the anguses but I'm

403
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,920
going to show you their fields because

404
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:06,240
they're being very choosy they're not

405
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,740
eating on the grass they're supposed to

406
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,050
be eating so guess what I'm gonna leave

407
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:12,180
them there probably for another at least

408
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:15,180
3 to 4 days to make them eat the grass

409
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:16,350
that they may not want to eat and the

410
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,970
whole purpose of that is just to make

411
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:19,710
sure they're taken care of because it

412
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:21,600
guess what if you leave it what's gonna

413
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:24,150
happen is either I'm gonna have to bush

414
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,520
hog the junk down or either it's gonna

415
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:28,550
have hey buddy

416
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:31,610
hey buddy

417
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:33,080
he always wants to rub it here but if

418
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:34,490
you don't let them eat it you're going

419
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:37,520
to mature grass well guess what they

420
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:39,980
want fresh good immature grass to eat

421
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:42,680
they don't want this big thick kudzu

422
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:44,090
style weeds and heavy grass so I'm gonna

423
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,260
make them eat it because if they don't

424
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:46,940
that means they're gonna be more weeds

425
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:48,140
over there that means I'm gonna have to

426
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:50,150
get in there with some kind of disc or

427
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:51,590
bush hog and there's no purpose because

428
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:54,500
there's a good grass for them to eat so

429
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:56,090
let's go look at it right quick all

430
00:15:54,500 --> 00:16:00,140
right now we're at the other paddock

431
00:15:56,090 --> 00:16:02,210
it's a get to where we're at eight they

432
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:03,800
meet up across our roads that's where

433
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:07,550
the two cows are for the paddock they're

434
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:09,530
in right now the paddock they were in

435
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,850
which is the dairy barn side and then

436
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:13,100
basically on the other side of the house

437
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:15,530
right here is where that that little

438
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,480
crossover is so we'll go over there and

439
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:19,640
take all the cows from these fields over

440
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,170
that crossover and get them to the other

441
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:24,800
fields but let me show you this field

442
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:28,190
now do you see how they've taken some

443
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:32,210
grass down but not all of it it's kind

444
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:34,610
of patchy now I'm gonna make them stay

445
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:37,550
here for a little bit longer but

446
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:40,790
ultimately they need to they need to eat

447
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:43,070
this grass and that way when this heals

448
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:50,120
back up this field look great so this

449
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:52,880
again once I hey girl hey girl so again

450
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:55,190
once this field and once we move them

451
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,780
completely out of here once these come

452
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:58,910
over to the other side probably the next

453
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:02,750
three or four days with the ball and

454
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:04,130
with them the milking cow this this

455
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:06,380
field baseball except for another five

456
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:08,270
to six weeks so it will heal back up

457
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,890
with no problem now you see the taller

458
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:11,270
grasses some of the winter grasses left

459
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:12,890
and there are some weeds in there too

460
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:14,150
but the shorter grass is where they've

461
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:15,620
already ate but we're already starting

462
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:17,450
to see some spring grass Pro back

463
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:19,730
through so that's another thing about

464
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:22,910
the cons of this time of year of

465
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:26,510
paddocks here in the mid season going

466
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:29,180
from spring going to spring from winner

467
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:29,550
are either coming out of summer going

468
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,260
into

469
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:32,610
all kind of go into winter when you're

470
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,960
planting your ride you got to make sure

471
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:37,170
they're still on some good summer grass

472
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:40,080
or either they have some hay again

473
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:41,430
coming out of winter rise gonna start

474
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,740
dying especially if we have some hot

475
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:44,910
days and so that spring grass may not be

476
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:47,190
coming up because we may still have some

477
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:48,450
frosty nights so you got to make sure

478
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:49,890
that you're leaving some grass that's

479
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:51,600
untouched start out making sure you have

480
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:52,710
a good bit of supplement hay and then

481
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,150
that way you're taking care of them

482
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:57,810
while you're going through these seasons

483
00:17:54,150 --> 00:18:04,320
as well so as you see we've got the

484
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:06,990
little anguses the and of course the

485
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,850
Jersey Ally this is the one that we know

486
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:12,360
is bred

487
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:15,600
she is probably three two or three

488
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:17,100
months bred and she's looking she's a

489
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,080
just a beautiful beautiful church she's

490
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:25,200
a low-lying Jersey then we have the two

491
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:28,770
anguses then we have of course that EO

492
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,780
is a registered miniature New Jersey and

493
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:33,900
then of course Elsa is a full-size

494
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:37,310
Jersey alright I hope you've learned a

495
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:40,590
little bit again the pros and cons to

496
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:42,570
rotational grazing we love it it allows

497
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:44,280
us to have cows if we put all these

498
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:46,560
fields together we'd have enough

499
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,060
probably for the cows but ultimately you

500
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,290
would not be able to control and they

501
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,210
would pick and choose what they wanted

502
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:54,420
to eat so then we'd be wasting a whole

503
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:55,710
lot of grass and really it would kind of

504
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,750
hurt the ground cuz ultimately they'd be

505
00:18:55,710 --> 00:19:00,330
all over it when you put them in a place

506
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:03,210
even if you use poly wire fencing poly

507
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:05,430
tape fencing wire hot wire fencing are

508
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:08,280
either true barbed wire it's good to

509
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:09,810
make them stay in one spot eat it down

510
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:13,440
and then move it over

511
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:15,300
don't let them up use the ground but let

512
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,440
them eat it and then move them over

513
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:19,270
because ultimately it's gonna help your

514
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:22,299
head will stay fertile and keep it going

515
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:25,290
hope this videos been good thank you

516
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:27,350
happy homesteading y'all

517
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,350
you
