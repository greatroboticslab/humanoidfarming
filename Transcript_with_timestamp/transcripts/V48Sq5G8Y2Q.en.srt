1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:04,020
hey guys it's Anne welcome to the

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,480
channel if you're new here this is a

3
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:09,480
indoor worm farming Channel and this is

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,960
my experimental bin that I am trying to

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:16,260
see how many inputs it takes to get to

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,820
my final batch of castings so right now

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:23,880
what we're looking at is

8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:26,340
21.3 pounds and I'll put kilograms down

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,800
there below so we're going to jump right

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,800
in and I'll put below what the weight

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,260
was when we left last time in general

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,840
we've been losing about a pound and a

13
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:39,660
half of water probably I mean there

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,040
could be carbon dioxide losses

15
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,200
Etc

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,200
so yeah there could be carbon dioxide

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,420
losses ammonia losses whatever

18
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,539
um but for the most part we have noticed

19
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,520
that it has been moisture related at

20
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,379
this moment everything looks very very

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,440
wet I think the bubble wrap has been

22
00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:01,079
doing more than its job to keep this

23
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:05,100
nice and moist for the worms so they can

24
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:07,320
reproduce and eat properly

25
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:10,140
so let me kind of dig in here I am

26
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,000
seeing cocoons in here so they are

27
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,760
reproducing

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,960
and the worms are looking nice and

29
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,799
Wiggly

30
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:22,320
this is a mix of my red wiggler and

31
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:25,500
European Nightcrawler and Blue Worms

32
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,840
that is in blue and nowhere else except

33
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:31,500
for this one right now last time we came

34
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,240
in we actually fed a liter of pumpkin on

35
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,360
each side now I'm not saying anything

36
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,520
over here maybe a few little orange

37
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,619
flecks

38
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,020
uh but now we're gonna go over to this

39
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:45,420
side where we fed all of the new leaves

40
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,400
to give them some bedding

41
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,500
now put in the comments below what do

42
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,960
you think it's going to take in the

43
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,360
amount of

44
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,979
inputs over the course of the next

45
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,780
I don't know it's it's been a couple of

46
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:59,159
months since we started this

47
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,780
I'm probably going to go all the way to

48
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,960
Spring

49
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:06,000
and uh we'll see you know the weight of

50
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,740
the castings at a particular moisture

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
and I'll check to see what percentage of

52
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,180
moisture it is

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,500
and then we'll see what we get in the

54
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,060
way of

55
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,940
castings

56
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,160
so I have been measuring everything

57
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,739
separately so I've been measuring the

58
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,239
volume of the food as well as the mass

59
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:27,420
of the food

60
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,940
and the water and the bedding so

61
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:32,120
everything should be accounted for and

62
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:34,700
then when we come in week over week

63
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:38,099
actually month over month at this point

64
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:40,920
and looking in on the worms what we're

65
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:43,260
doing is seeing what did we lose

66
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,120
as far as weight goes over the course of

67
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:48,660
that time and it's been nearly a month

68
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,340
since we checked in on this bin so I'll

69
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,860
put all the numbers below but they did

70
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:55,200
eat almost all their food they've got

71
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:58,920
quite a bit in the way of

72
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,140
shredded coconut choir and leaves in

73
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,340
here and I do still see a little bit of

74
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,099
potato

75
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:08,340
but it looks like other than that the

76
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:09,900
moisture is doing really well which uh

77
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,700
I'm going to have to drain off some of

78
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,739
the moisture on the food that I brought

79
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:16,860
down for them because I don't really

80
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:20,280
think it needs it it's quite wet

81
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:22,920
okay so this is what they're getting and

82
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,379
this should total about one gallon of

83
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:28,019
food or about four liters

84
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:30,840
and this is going to be a combination of

85
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:32,340
avocado and tomato

86
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,420
and we'll put that on this side now

87
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,000
they're actually getting the whole

88
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:39,540
avocado I had purchased some that never

89
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,920
did ripen after about a month so it they

90
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,500
might have been picked a little bit too

91
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,599
early or something so we're going to put

92
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,760
that over on that side

93
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:51,900
and then the rest of the gallon of food

94
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:55,200
will put back over on this side and then

95
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:57,659
we will weigh what everything is next

96
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,599
yes I did forget to weigh this

97
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:02,519
separately but with a little bit of worm

98
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:04,739
math I can

99
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:08,220
figure out what I've put in here so this

100
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:11,220
is bananas and bread and more avocados

101
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:15,079
no water additions this time so let's

102
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:18,239
see what the weight is up to now

103
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:21,120
26.5 pounds so we've added about five

104
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,919
pounds of food in one gallon

105
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,080
and I'll put the metric conversions in

106
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:27,240
there I'm going to add a little bit of

107
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:30,419
grit because I don't think that avocado

108
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:33,000
is going to be easy to eat

109
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:37,280
I do tend to forget

110
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,280
to do things like this for some reason

111
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,340
but I am going heavy especially on

112
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,540
something that's going to be as hard to

113
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:47,940
digest as the avocado flesh

114
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:50,580
so hopefully that will be enough food to

115
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,800
get them going for the next three weeks

116
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:55,699
or so until I can get back in here again

117
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,199
here we are the final weight of

118
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:59,880
27.1 pounds

119
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:01,320
so if you're thinking this is a very

120
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,300
cool experiment I have a whole playlist

121
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,919
just for this experiment which I will

122
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,300
link over there and if you've already

123
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:09,000
seen that YouTube thinks you're gonna

124
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,139
like that video right over there alright

125
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,940
guys thanks for hanging out with me and

126
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:13,940
my worms and everybody have a good day
