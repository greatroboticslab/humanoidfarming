1
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,560
figured i'd show this to you

2
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,800
because it's very easy to see where i've

3
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,080
had the chicken tractor with the rabbits

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,400
in it

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:30,400
um every time i plant anything

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,079
it's in some sort of a raised bed so

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,000
i've got a spiral herb garden which

8
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:37,680
technically is a raised bed

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,800
on the other side of that is my orchard

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:44,160
which everything is in race beds

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,000
in my garden everything's in raised beds

12
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,360
and matter of fact the fruit trees that

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,320
are back there

14
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,039
and all of the berries are also all in

15
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,039
raised beds

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,600
and a lot of people keep asking me why i

17
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,199
keep spending money on this soil that

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,440
i'm unloading

19
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,320
out of my truck sitting there and with

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,680
the ground

21
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,240
for the grass being so small

22
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,080
now i can show you why now one of the

23
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,159
things you got to keep in mind

24
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,159
is it rained this week so the cracks are

25
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,520
actually smaller

26
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,520
but there's this one right here

27
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,439
which is indicative of clay soil

28
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,720
this stuff is hard as a rock like you

29
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,920
you just couldn't be

30
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,920
you just can't dig it up

31
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,159
see that do i have a knife i have a

32
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,840
knife

33
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,079
which what am i carrying today victoria

34
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,720
knox

35
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,040
let's see we'll just use the end of it

36
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,600
there of course it breaks it up

37
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,560
but you got to use some force this is

38
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,119
really hard clay soil

39
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,159
and these cracks will get so big that i

40
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,920
can literally

41
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,840
do my fingers like this and stick my

42
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,640
whole hand into the ground

43
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,159
so they'll get an inch and a half wide

44
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,479
the reason why they're so small right

45
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,240
now

46
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,920
is because it rained earlier this week

47
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,200
several inches of rain as a matter of

48
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,840
fact

49
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,280
and let me show you something else the

50
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,640
rabbits start digging

51
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,680
and if you got rabbits you know how

52
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,000
sharp their claws are they just give up

53
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,959
they they dig a little bit and they just

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,360
give up because

55
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,000
they know the ground's just too hard for

56
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,120
them to do anything

57
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,599
in so

58
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:32,879
that is why i have to go

59
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,560
and keep buying soil now

60
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,640
i would prefer to be able to buy the

61
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,360
soil in bulk

62
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,599
the problem is i can't find any bulk

63
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,200
places around here to buy soil

64
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,879
or compost mix or you know a soil

65
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,879
compost mix or something like that

66
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,160
so i have to keep just going and buying

67
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,920
bag soil

68
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,760
and then it takes about a year for

69
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,120
the sterile soil there's another place

70
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,280
where rabbits tried to dig and they dug

71
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,840
down a little farther there

72
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,959
and this is mostly a shaded area so the

73
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,840
ground was probably a little softer

74
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,840
there and i still gave up

75
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,200
but what i was getting at is

76
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,959
the sterile soil you buy from a store

77
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,599
takes about a year to acclimate to your

78
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,000
soil

79
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,840
for all the beneficial microbes to move

80
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,760
up into it

81
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,760
for you to add nutrients to it it takes

82
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,879
about a year

83
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,519
and uh that's actually why that you

84
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,280
see people that build raised beds and

85
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,000
use store-bought soil why their gardens

86
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,640
usually don't do

87
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,920
very good the first year it's because

88
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,680
all the

89
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,519
beneficial microbes are missing from the

90
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,519
soil but anyways

91
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,760
this is just a quick video i wanted to

92
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,159
show you

93
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,959
why i buy bag soil and kind of go over

94
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,599
that

95
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,319
and i'll go ahead and let you uh watch

96
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,720
me

97
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,720
unload the last half of the soil

98
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
when working outside when it's 95

99
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:15,840
degrees always make sure you got a

100
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,840
bottle of water out of the refrigerator

101
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,240
you
