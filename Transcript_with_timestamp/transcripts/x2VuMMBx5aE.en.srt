1
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:05,790
yeah ever wish you had a list of

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:08,340
equipment and supplies for post

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:11,490
construction cleanup well I actually put

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:14,160
one together for you and you'll be able

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,859
to find it in the janitorial store in

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,560
the Donald library but here's the what I

7
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,240
did is I actually created a list of for

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,619
general cleaning you know this this here

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,740
is the equipment and supplies that you

10
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:27,060
would use on just about any type of post

11
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,580
instruction cleanup that you would do

12
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,890
you know you know all your knees an

13
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,320
extension ladder pull a stepladder of

14
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:37,260
some sort backpack or a vacuum you know

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,090
dustpan broom you know different things

16
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,469
like that there you know just all the

17
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:45,270
con con come items that you would use

18
00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:47,129
trying to also eat the supplies you know

19
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,750
it's always good to have a tote for your

20
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:52,320
supplies because once this stuff is all

21
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:55,079
just you know handheld items so it's

22
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,510
good to have you know I listed some of

23
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,760
the chemicals that you would use you

24
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,500
know and some of the other supplies that

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,149
you might have to brush grout brush and

26
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,210
so on and so forth

27
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:08,549
also then what I did because I went

28
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,320
ahead and I did one for hard floor care

29
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:12,299
because in some of the cases when we're

30
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,220
doing post construction cleanup they're

31
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,100
gonna ask us to go ahead and strip VCT

32
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:20,220
tile and apply one or two coats of floor

33
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:23,130
finish so here I listed the types of

34
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,540
equipment that you may use so in most

35
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,420
cases maybe you're going to use a floor

36
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,380
machine either a rotary or cylindrical

37
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:31,229
you know that's just a personal

38
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:34,350
preference I like rotary I can do a much

39
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:36,420
more with that type of equipment and I

40
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:39,299
always have brush drives I use brushes I

41
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,530
don't buy any pads anymore then if

42
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,659
you're doing any searching the ceramic

43
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:46,590
tile and grout you know recommend that

44
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:49,979
you use a you know a 1200 PSI extractor

45
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:52,920
with an X X 15 one that's just the way

46
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:55,530
to go it's just a much much better

47
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,170
system to have I listed some of the

48
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,829
supplies on the other side here you know

49
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,040
for you

50
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:05,790
floor strippers neutral pH floor cleaner

51
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:08,039
razor knife knee pads floor finish etc I

52
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,119
left room for you to expand this to four

53
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:12,959
items at

54
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:14,250
my thought of I am putting also here for

55
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,250
carpet care

56
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:18,989
you know sometimes majority time

57
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:22,230
probably will do is they'll ask you to

58
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:24,239
do some carpet spotting but there I had

59
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:26,069
a job one time where they didn't do put

60
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,739
any protector on the carpet and then it

61
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:30,120
got trashed and they hired us to go

62
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:32,400
ahead and clean the carpet so I brought

63
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,069
in our hot water extractor you know did

64
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,580
a hot water extraction on it and dry it

65
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:39,450
and everything and it looked great so

66
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:40,860
some of the things like I listed your

67
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,390
foot equipment is you know the three

68
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,360
gallon pump up sprayer you know those

69
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:47,459
are just great for applying your your

70
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,569
neutralizers and your pre sprays you

71
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,519
know some of your supplies that you'd

72
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:52,170
have is obviously a carpet spotting kit

73
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:53,720
within that kit you can have the

74
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,860
different chemicals that you'll need for

75
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,730
spotting the carpet to remove whatever

76
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,209
it might be

77
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:02,760
there'll be a tapping brush in there

78
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:07,160
you'll find you should also have in your

79
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,160
carpet spying kit you know some kind of

80
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,760
carbon spider so it kind of walks you

81
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:17,930
through what you the steps that you want

82
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:21,780
to do for various types of stop spots

83
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:24,060
I've got window cleaning too so on this

84
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,819
side again I've got the equipment so you

85
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,319
know you may have a window cleaning

86
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:31,260
pocket you might use a five-gallon

87
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:35,220
bucket you might have a hip bucket on a

88
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:37,410
belt so for any of y'all set I have done

89
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,870
a lot of window window cleaning them

90
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:41,940
then I bought a stepladder and or a

91
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,440
extension ladder you know a hip bucket

92
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,060
on a belt is the way to go because now

93
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,579
you got all your tools right there on

94
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:49,230
your belt you'll be able have your t-bar

95
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:51,720

96
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:54,690
your sponges and your cloths and

97
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:58,829
everything on your belt some of the

98
00:03:54,690 --> 00:04:00,930
other things that I put in here was the

99
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:03,780
t-bar applicator obviously extension

100
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:07,680
poles they're always handy then I put an

101
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:09,569
adjustable offset adapter so for for use

102
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,450
uh for those of you that don't know what

103
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:15,389
that is this is it this is an adapter

104
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:18,390
and what it does is it connects onto

105
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:21,030
your extension pole and this one here is

106
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:22,570
a longer then you have an actual swivel

107
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:24,640
you can adjust the

108
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:27,130
angle of this here to whatever angle

109
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,780
that you need for for when you're

110
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:30,670
washing and overhang or something like

111
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,420
that this here you're in a hall you're

112
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,610
going to go ahead and put your

113
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:36,460
applicator on there or your squeegee or

114
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:38,590
fixie clapper or some you know whatever

115
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:41,710
it is that you're that you're trying to

116
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:43,360
do but that's all this is it works great

117
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:48,100
so you should have these in your arsenal

118
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:52,450
if your window cleaning what I put on

119
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:55,090
the supply side was some of the you know

120
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:56,830
dish just soap that's probably one of

121
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,340
the best things I always used done dish

122
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,490
soap

123
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,740
you don't need no fancy window clean

124
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:04,150
solutions or anything like that

125
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:07,150
microfiber cloth chamois is sea foam

126
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:09,340
sponge you know for our steel wall hard

127
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:11,800
water remover you know and lint-free

128
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:14,860
gloves and microfiber pads now the

129
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:17,920
microfiber pads are for a telescopic

130
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:20,470
handle with a microfiber pad holder when

131
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:24,610
you're doing that oh let's say you got

132
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:29,380
two story windows or some that are kind

133
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:31,450
of kind of difficult to to wash where

134
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:33,220
you don't want to drip water on anything

135
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:35,140
well you're gonna use a telescopic

136
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,300
handle with a microfiber pad holder on

137
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:39,880
it and you're gonna attach a microfiber

138
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,590
pad to it that you pre sprayed with

139
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,440
glass cleaner and then you just raise

140
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:45,970
that up and take it to the window and

141
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,860
you clean the window that way so you

142
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,960
really minimize the amount of water that

143
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:52,090
you put on put on the pad and and apply

144
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:56,020
to the window and that's really the way

145
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:58,090
to go so I hope you found this helpful
