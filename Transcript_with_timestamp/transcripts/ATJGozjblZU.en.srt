1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,240
so this grand project was funded by usda

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,920
nrcs

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,000
under the umbrella of cig the

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,639
conservation innovation grant

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,400
so this is a systems project where we

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,560
are going to evaluate

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,279
uh the adoption of cover crop the

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,680
economics of cover crop as well as

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,840
uh irrigation systems um and we are

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,560
gonna look into or investigate

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,240
the effects of cover crop and irrigation

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,200
and how these two practices

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,360
help reduce the nutrient losses uh into

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,079
the environment mostly nitrogen and

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,200
phosphorus

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,640
this grant is a unique grant and is

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,000
going to help us

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,239
understand not only the economics are

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,480
the economics part but we are going to

20
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:51,440
look into the social aspect

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,879
of adoption of conservation practices

22
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,120
one of the goals of the

23
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,120
grant is to work on co-development to

24
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,039
bring networks of farmers together

25
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,359
and i think when growers get together

26
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,440
and they can learn from the struggles

27
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,879
and the successes that other farmers

28
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,040
have had in their area

29
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,960
it really builds a community to learn

30
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,119
from each other

31
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,720
this grant project consists of six

32
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,479
objectives with the overall goal of

33
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,320
increasing co-development of knowledge

34
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,320
about the adoption of sustainable and

35
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,720
resilient production practices

36
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,799
these objectives include increasing the

37
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,560
knowledge and skills needed to implement

38
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,640
and manage cover crop systems

39
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,560
irrigation scheduling and variable rate

40
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,240
irrigation

41
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,920
increasing the knowledge of the impact

42
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,640
of cover crop and irrigation water

43
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,000
management

44
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,720
as it relates to efficient nutrient use

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,240
evaluating documenting and disseminating

46
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,680
the agronomic economic

47
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,439
and environmental impacts of

48
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,119
implementing and managing combined

49
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,159
practices of cover crops

50
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,560
and irrigation management

51
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,320
establishing a network of learning sites

52
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,399
in which farmers and researchers

53
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,600
work together to increase adoption and

54
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,680
improve management

55
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,520
of sustainable and resilient production

56
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,520
practices

57
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,560
and determining the barriers and

58
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,479
limitations

59
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,560
to implementing and managing cover crop

60
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,560
systems and irrigation management

61
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,239
through frequent farmer engagement it's

62
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,040
all about working to

63
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,879
promote practices that we know have a

64
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,200
positive impact on

65
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,000
soil and water quality so practices like

66
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,599
cover crops

67
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,840
precision irrigation nutrient management

68
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,680
so incorporating some of these practices

69
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,360
into one large

70
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,280
group of demonstrations throughout the

71
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,319
state of alabama

72
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,480
i hope that together with the research

73
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,599
team we will be able to see the power of

74
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,920
collaboration

75
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,680
with the growers that we're working with

76
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,920
and to be able to learn

77
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,599
from them about their most important

78
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,160
problems but then we'll also

79
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,879
learn new techniques for engagement with

80
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,160
producers

81
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:52,800
i think for the producer a lot of times

82
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,680
they are very removed from research

83
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,319
unless they're

84
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,920
part of the research and so i'd like the

85
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,720
idea that we're going to have multiple

86
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,319
agencies

87
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,000
that are going to work together as well

88
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,760
as the own farm trials

89
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,040
and so everybody's going to share in

90
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,159
this project they're going to share the

91
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,440
data we're going to learn and we're

92
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,519
going to make some mistakes

93
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,040
but hopefully we'll move the needle as

94
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,070
far as what

95
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,360
is capable production-wise on the farm

96
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:18,080
[Music]

97
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,159
the farmers would like to see positive

98
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,440
impacts on their farms in terms of

99
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,920
volatility

100
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,040
and perhaps return on investment but

101
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,640
farmers would like

102
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,680
also to see a positive impact to the

103
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,400
environment

104
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,760
as a result of the adoption of these

105
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,599
practices

106
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:40,640
so if we are able to show

107
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:43,760
to the farmers and the farmers will

108
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,239
see that these practices are going to

109
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,360
have

110
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,840
an impact to the environment there will

111
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,120
be

112
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,120
more ecosystem

113
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,519
services there will be more

114
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:59,120
environmental benefits

115
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:02,959
and economic benefits that

116
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:05,439
will be reflected on the communities

117
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,280
around those demonstration sites it's

118
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,200
good for everyone it's good for the

119
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,959
environment it's good for the farmer

120
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,000
because he's going to save money

121
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,920
it's good uh is is good for uh

122
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,400
from a social aspect because there are

123
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,199
several taboos that are associated with

124
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,600
the nutrient runoff and losses so we are

125
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:29,840
going to

126
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:29,840
tackle several problems at once

127
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,000
you
