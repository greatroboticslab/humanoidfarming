2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:10,500
okay we're here with dr. Mike Lehmann at

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:15,870
the Air s in Brookings South Dakota and

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:18,720
like you have a talk that you like to

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:21,840
give about an underwear demo an

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,000
underwear experiment you did the summer

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,820
we'd love to hear about it

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,580
well sure I guess I'm gonna backtrack

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,040
just a little bit before I introduce the

10
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,710
Younger wear which everybody's waiting

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,320
for and talk to you a little bit about

12
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:42,000
this field experiment behind us is a

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:45,719
field experiment with plots containing

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,820
different rotations of corn and soybean

15
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:51,539
either corn and soybean by itself or

16
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:53,789
corn and soybean with other crops in

17
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,949
terms of a four year rotation and this

18
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:59,039
experiment has been going on for 16

19
00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:01,410
years so 16 years these rotational

20
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,439
treatments have been in place and in

21
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:06,590
this case by adding diversity and taking

22
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:11,189
a two-year corn and soybean rotation

23
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:13,680
which is this plot right here and over

24
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:17,310
here this plot of corn here is a four

25
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,310
year corn pea winter wheat soy rotation

26
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:23,369
we've added diversity into the system

27
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:26,270
and this diversity is diversity of crops

28
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:29,549
but it's also diversity of crop residues

29
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:32,640
diversity of root exudates from these

30
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:38,369
crops diversity of root architecture in

31
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:40,829
the soil and so diversity is really the

32
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:44,130
focus crop rotational diversity is the

33
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:47,130
focus of this experiment and why do we

34
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:50,220
care about rotation crop rotation we've

35
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:52,500
done a number of long-term Studies on

36
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:55,680
these particular plots and what we've

37
00:01:52,500 --> 00:02:00,299
shown is the four year rotation actually

38
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:03,920
produces about 25% less nitrous oxide so

39
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:07,140
you lose 25 percent less nitrogen as

40
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,390
nitrous oxide from the plots so that

41
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:12,000
nitrogen stays in the ground where the

42
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,950
plants can use it later

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,500
they also

44
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:18,210
with the forward rotation we were able

45
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:22,410
to increase the soil organic matter

46
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:24,810
about 25% over a two-year corn and

47
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:27,660
soybean rotation and I forgot to mention

48
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:30,660
all these plots are no-till so they're

49
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:34,200
all no-till and then they've had they

50
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:39,840
have a treatment crop cropping system

51
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:42,930
treatment of rotation and so then the

52
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:46,190
third finding we have the nitrous oxide

53
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:48,570
and the soil organic carbon are all

54
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:50,970
better situated with the four-year

55
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:55,470
rotation but also the soybean in the

56
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:57,900
four-year rotation has 25% higher yields

57
00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:01,110
than it does in the corn soybean meal or

58
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:05,430
tation so all across the board whether

59
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:08,850
it be nutrients soil organic carbon or

60
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:12,180
yields we're seeing better performance

61
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:15,030
by the four-year system you know I can

62
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:17,130
tell you about this stuff and I can show

63
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:20,519
you the data but there's not very many

64
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:22,680
visual displays or I can show you the

65
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:24,450
difference between a porn and two-year

66
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,320
rotation and so it'll give you an idea

67
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:30,650
of how fast decomposition occurs in the

68
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,650
soil

69
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,540
you
