2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,759
so do you think your garden might need a

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,519
little boost this spring one of the best

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,000
ways to tell is to do a soil test a soil

5
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,960
test will tell you what nutrients you

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,559
may need in the garden and how much the

7
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,119
spring is the best time to do a soil

8
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:18,400
test before you add any fertilizer the

9
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:22,199
tools you'll need will be a

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:25,199
Trel a screwdriver or a similar tool a

11
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,359
clean bucket and some and a bag to put

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,000
the sample in a Ziploc bag would be fine

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,920
or a paper bag sometimes the soil labs

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,600
will provide you a container to use to

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,399
collect a sample you'll take the trowel

16
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,840
and put it into the ground to loosen the

17
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:42,559
soil you'll then use the trowel to

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,680
collect a thin slice of soil the goal is

19
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,719
to have a narrow strip of soil down the

20
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,960
center of the trowel so the screwdriver

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,559
is a useful tool to help clean up the

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,280
edges ideally you will sample to a depth

23
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:54,399
of about 6 in and you'll put that in

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,559
your

25
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,280
bucket then you'll repeat that step

26
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,480
about 10 times for your garden to get a

27
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,199
good composite sample once you've

28
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,559
collected your 10 samples from across

29
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:06,840
the garden you will mix them thoroughly

30
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,360
in the bucket and then you will collect

31
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,920
about two

32
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,600
cups of this soil into your sample bag

33
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,960
the lab will provide you with a form to

34
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,320
fill out which includes the type of soil

35
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,479
analysis that you would like to have

36
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,920
done and that what you'll be growing in

37
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:23,640
your garden your local County Extension
