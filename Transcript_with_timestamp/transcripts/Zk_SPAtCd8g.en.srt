00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:10,380
crops practical information hello my

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:14,490
name is Michaela and I breed cover crops

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:16,770
and green manures in this video you will

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:20,820
learn how to grow cover crops and green

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:25,230
manures and why they are an important

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:27,390
tool in improving soil health cover

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,670
crops are cultivated between the harvest

9
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:32,669
of one main crop and the sowing of the

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,800
next main crop the main reasons to grow

11
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:37,230
cover crops are to protect the soil

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,860
against erosion to increase soil

13
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:43,590
fertility to improve soil structure to

14
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,629
facilitate water infiltration and to

15
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,989
retain nutrients in the upper soil

16
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:51,360
horizon there are several terms for this

17
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:53,640
growing practice and they can be used in

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,460
more or less the same sense however

19
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,010
there can be some specific differences

20
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,870
in crop management depending on what

21
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,899
your primary reason for growing the

22
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:06,210
cover crop is when cover crops are

23
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:09,990
incorporated into the soil they are

24
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:11,909
usually termed green manures catch crops

25
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:15,900
are used to avoid nutrient loss

26
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:18,030
particularly nitrogen leaching many

27
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,909
different species are used as cover

28
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,979
crops each has specific advantages and

29
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:24,960
requirements

30
00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:25,439
some are frost resistant and survive the

31
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,520
winter

32
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:31,650
others freeze down easily nutrients

33
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,470
taken up by green manure crops are

34
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:37,560
returned to the soil to be utilized by

35
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:40,020
the following crop a well-informed

36
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,130
choice of cover crops improves crop

37
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:45,600
rotations cover crops with a pathogen

38
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:48,240
susceptibility different from the major

39
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,110
crops in the rotation decreases the

40
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,840
overall potential of soil borne diseases

41
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:57,270
the best for soil databases are powerful

42
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:02,430
tools to determine which cover crops

43
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:03,450
best fit into a crop rotation root

44
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,060
exudates

45
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:08,610
and additional organic matter provided

46
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,370
by cover crops can stimulate soil

47
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,680
microbial activity and influence the

48
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:17,310
composition of the microbial community

49
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,280
in the soil both factors stabilize and

50
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:22,650
boost the microbial community which in

51
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:26,430
turn may reduce pressure from soil borne

52
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:29,790
diseases one major group of cover crops

53
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:32,760
are grass species including some closely

54
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:35,280
related to cereal crops they are

55
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:38,340
fast-growing and some species will grow

56
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,950
even at low temperatures seed for these

57
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:44,939
crops is easily available in all regions

58
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:47,579
of Europe grass cover crops can not only

59
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:50,579
be used as green manure but also for

60
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:54,329
grazing or feeding animals most grass

61
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:56,129
species are winter hardy another

62
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:58,889
important group of cover crops are

63
00:02:56,129 --> 00:03:01,470
Brassica species they are especially

64
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:04,680
fast-growing and are therefore good at

65
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:07,260
suppressing weed populations some are

66
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:10,260
used to decreased disease incidence in

67
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:13,560
cereal rich rotations some to avoid

68
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:16,260
nitrogen leaching some of the brassicas

69
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:20,699
cover crops are winter hardy while some

70
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:23,280
are frost sensitive another advantage of

71
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:25,859
Brassica species are their deep rooting

72
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,879
tap roots which help improve the soil

73
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:31,949
structure the Jumana species have the

74
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:33,720
advantage of fixing nitrogen and

75
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:36,109
therefore providing this important

76
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:39,449
nutrient to the following main crop

77
00:03:36,109 --> 00:03:42,329
several legume species are used as cover

78
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:45,510
crops ranging from small seeded clover

79
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:49,260
to medium-sized veg up to farber beans

80
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:51,599
with big sized seeds the zoomed

81
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:53,909
performed best when established early in

82
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:57,449
the season and are mostly used in a

83
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:59,909
mixture with other cover crops there are

84
00:03:57,449 --> 00:04:03,139
several fast-growing species commonly

85
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:06,510
used as cover crops such as phacelia

86
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:08,970
buckwheat or marigold detailed

87
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:12,349
information on all of these species is

88
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:15,299
published in a best for soil fact sheet

89
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:17,539
cover crops require the same careful

90
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:20,549
cultivation as main crops a

91
00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:24,479
well-prepared seed bed is essential for

92
00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:27,540
a successful cover crop nitrogen

93
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,930
application is particularly important

94
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:32,850
guaranteeing a vigorous cover crop

95
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:35,520
however similar to main crops the

96
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:38,570
nitrogen left by the previous crop has

97
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,570
to be taken into account

98
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:42,849
the preparation of the seed bed is

99
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:45,699
essential to ensure a rapid and

100
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:47,919
consistent establishment of the crop it

101
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:51,669
should be adapted to the specific needs

102
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:54,099
of the seed healthy seeds with a high

103
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:56,289
germination rate should be used to

104
00:04:54,099 --> 00:04:59,560
ensure successful establishment of the

105
00:04:56,289 --> 00:05:02,080
crop irrigation might be needed for

106
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,870
crops grown in summer especially for

107
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:09,039
fast-growing species such as mustards or

108
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:11,620
sorghum selected cultivars should be

109
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,539
resistant to the most relevant diseases

110
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:15,420
and pests in the region where they are

111
00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:19,020
cultivated

112
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:21,210
some cultivars have specific traits such

113
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:24,080
as containing secondary metabolites

114
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:27,180
which can have a bio fumigation effect

115
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:30,030
more information on biofilm ocation are

116
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:34,380
available in a specific video and fact

117
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:36,630
sheet some cover crops or cultivars will

118
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:39,090
die off during winter which helps

119
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:42,480
facilitate their incorporation into the

120
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:44,730
soil the following spring such cultivars

121
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:47,190
are not suitable as green manure in the

122
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:50,490
spring as they will decompose before

123
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:52,830
their incorporation in spring on the

124
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:55,620
other hand cover crops grown in summer

125
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:58,710
especially in southern Europe have to be

126
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:01,050
heat tolerant therefore the choice of

127
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:04,670
cultivars adapted to the local climatic

128
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:07,770
conditions is critically important as

129
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:10,530
cover crops can also be host plants for

130
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:12,720
soil borne diseases their selection has

131
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:16,160
to fit the crop rotation of the major

132
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:19,320
crops cultivated to generate income

133
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:22,170
grass species fit especially well in

134
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:24,920
vegetable production systems where no

135
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:27,900
grass related species are grown

136
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:31,050
Brassica species are better suited for

137
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:33,960
rotations with arable crops where with

138
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:36,810
the exception of oil seed rape normally

139
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:39,270
no Brassica species are grown in

140
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:41,760
contrast they don't fit well in

141
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:44,580
vegetable production systems especially

142
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:48,300
in northern europe where many Brassica

143
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:51,060
vegetables are grown finally and most

144
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:53,700
importantly the choice of cover crop or

145
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:57,840
green manure depends on the primary

146
00:06:53,700 --> 00:07:01,350
