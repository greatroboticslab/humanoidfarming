  "text": "[Music] what are you guys doing here what am I doing here well I came out to just practice hooking up the three-point attachments that's not crazy you guys don't do that in your spare time huh well since you're here you want me to show you some tips all right let's get into it all right I apologize I think quarantine has me going a little crazy but I do want to show you some tips on how to hook up attachments to your three-point hitch and maybe we'll get one or two in there on the PTO as well but should be a good overview and as I usually do I learn some things simply by looking in the manual a little bit harder than I normally do so you know let's go ahead and go through this will give you a good lay of the land here on how to have everything set up properly at least my interpretation of it you know your mileage may vary as they say but I want to give you some advice here because it could make your life a lot easier I absolutely used to hate hooking up the three-point attachments but it's pretty much a piece of cake anymore so I've got several tractors here and that's intentional you know I want to give you some different setups here some different versions that you can see because all the tractors are different out there and this doesn't clearly represent everything that's gonna be on the market but it gives you a good idea and a good basic understanding so we do have a forty sixty six R right here gonna have a thirty thirty nine are right here and then a twenty thirty two R as well over there and you can't see it in this footprint right here but I do have my 10 25 R as well we might get that into the mix also I've talked about this rate of drop or speed of drop control before which is essentially opening and closing a valve that's gonna be tied into your three-point hitch or your rock shaft control system and looking in the manual surprisingly it's underneath the section of attaching and detaching your three-point-four asian all that kind of thing surprisingly it says you want to set this so that it takes two seconds to lower to the ground otherwise you could you know potentially damage or injure or whatever else you know so good note there to in or two seconds to get all the way down to the ground from a fully raised position that means it's gonna have to be almost completely closed maybe just a hair backed off from that but I'll show you what I mean so I've got this valve completely closed right now I'm gonna pack it off just a little bit and we'll see how long it takes to lower what was that like three seconds three and a half seconds open it a little more that's about two seconds right there okay so while we're out here looking at the 1025 R I want to take a quick second show you how to make attaching to this PTO shaft that much easier so if you have a machine that's equipped with both a mid and a rear pto what I want you to do is go ahead and take your PTO lover here okay this is your PTO select lever it's going to control which PTO you're operating whether it's the rear the mid or both at the same time so I've gone ahead and moved my PTO select shaft to the rear PTO alright and so that means that if I had this machine on and pulled out the the knob for the PTO or flipped a button that the rear PTO would be spinning and engaged okay say I had a tiller or a brush hog attached so if I come back here and try to spin this PTO shaft it's not gonna spin you can hear it kind of rattling as it's locked in place there so now if I move this PTO lever to the mid PTO position okay so only the mid PTO was running and it would not be the rear PTO if I had the machine on let's go ahead and see what happens see how it freely spins so if I move this back to the to the rear there we go it's gonna be locked in place if I move it back to the mid it's gonna freely move and that will help you align your splines that are on your PTO shaft with the splines that are on here on the output shaft on the tractor hey and as we go through this video today keep your eyes on these quick itches here because I'll get to it later in the video but if you think that this sounds like a major chore attach and detach them from the three-point hitch then you might find that a quick hitch is what you need and if you haven't done so yet hit that subscribe button below right there underneath the video hit subscribe make sure you read the description a lot of links a lot of good information down there as well and go to good works tractors com2 would love to help you with a tractor or an attachment delivery and financing as well you know to set your tractor up right on your three-point hitch it's actually a little bit more involved than you might think and if you've ever wondered why there's three positions up here well so today so finally what do you know I looked into it a little bit further and these three different positions totally mean something okay there's a reason for those so let's go through it so before we actually hook up to the three-point hitch it's important to know which pin position you should put your top leg okay you're sent a link right here and this all mean something different these three different locations now not every tractor has three locations but for those that do there's a reason for it I have to break off the manual to show you let's take a quick peek okay this is a John Deere 2032 our 2038 manual we are opening to our positioning center leaks links section right here and you're gonna see for light and medium loads install Center link and the bottom hole B okay down here medium and heavy loads see ok the middle one for very heavy draught loads D the top one okay also notice you're gonna see a category one implement hey there mister fly tilts forward while raising in this position category I wanna implement tilts forward varies slightly while raised in this position and category one raises but angle remains constant okay so important note there depending on the tool that you're using I can't believe that fly is just doing what he wants I get distracted too easy anyway pay attention to that because that can mean something could mean a difference to the implement that you're using and hooking up to your three-point hitch okay so the first thing that you need to do is gonna be to put your tractor in park turn that sucker off for the initial hookup okay so we may need to turn the machine on it at a certain point in time here but get your tractor off get it in park in neutral that kind of thing so safety first as always I want to make sure that's above and beyond everything else that we do next thing after that you're gonna see I am on a completely level section of ground here you know that's gonna make your life so much easier you know there's a point in time when I had a lot of attachments stored in my back yard and it has just a slight slope you know it's not significant it's enough to notice but it's nothing crazy and I always used to Park attachments in the back edge of my lawn on my yard there along that slope and it was just a nightmare to constantly hook those things up and detach them and everything else and I just absolutely hated it so if you can park on a piece of level ground your attachments it's gonna make life so much easier next thing you're gonna see I do have all my attachments typically gonna be stored on a pallet and that's for a couple of reasons one you know you can move them around easier if you need to move them from point A to point B if they're already on a pallet and set up and ready to go it's a lot easier that way - it gets that attachment a little bit higher off the ground it's not fun you know the older you get the less you want to be bent down hunkered over and everything else so you know even the four or five inches that you see here makes a big difference the other reason that I find a pallet useful is because on a machine like my forty sixty six are the three-point hitch doesn't always drop down far enough to allow like the quick hitch for instance here to release from underneath these pins and so if I have an elevator a little bit higher and makes that process a lot easier so there's several reasons there to use pallets or something else to raise up your attachments it's also nice just to keep them off the ground from moisture corrosion that kind of thing as well you know so it's much easier to focus on one point rather than trying to focus here and here and here all three points you know so the biggest thing that I try to do when I'm backing up to an implement is lining up the center link with the top pin position here on the three-point hitch don't worry so much about the sides down here as long as you feel like you're pretty square it's gonna come out all right you'll be able to have enough adjustment there typically or you can get on the tractor and slightly go back further or forward after you have one pin attached focus on the center link getting it aligned up here in the middle because that way you know your spacing is correct and your top link is correct as well typically what I like to do is start out with my three-point hitch as low as possible and then I'll raise it down up from there so let's go ahead and get that done now and this is something you can do with the tractor off in the park position so if it's not in the lowest position right now you can just go ahead and move that rock shaft lever all the way down and it'll naturally do its thing if there's nothing on the three-point arms for example then you might just need to give it a little bit of a push in order to encourage you to go down but it will go down okay I should probably open up this rated rap a little bit more now if you're lucky enough to have a model of tractor that has this style of sway arm down here okay with just a pin where you can pull it out and position it in different areas now is the time that I would say to release those do it on this side as well see how much flexibility that gives you the other style is gonna be this turnbuckle style of sway arm down here as well typically once they're set up there's not going to be a whole lot of adjustment that's required but there is a tightening nut on here or sometimes a pin that goes through to hold this little Center link in place you undo that and then you can loosen it up and it'll shorten this gap here or lengthen it out to give you more adjustment that way so at this point here I'm just going to go ahead and back up to it and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna attach these lower links first and so as I'm backing up you can see you can pick up on on the the arms here okay and so I'm gonna keep them just slightly lower than what the elevation is here and then once I get back here I'm gonna attach the lower link first whatever one appears to be just slightly lower I know it's level ground but there's still gonna be one that's probably not perfectly level you know so I'm gonna put the lower one on first and then if I need to I can lift up I can turn the machine on lift up just slightly and get the other side link to match up and slide over the pin so you can see at this point we're just about there all right and with an attachment that's a little bit lighter like this you can actually just kind of scoot it forward a little bit you know and get it into place there if you needed to you could actually just have it go right underneath those pins completely and then you can pull out to the side you see how they're gonna go out to the side a little bit and give yourself some more room that way so what I'm gonna do in this situation is just scoot it slightly forward here get these pins off of here throw it over there and now let's lift up you can see how I'm just lifting up just like that and we'll just give it a little jiggle and it's on so to make the connection over on this second lower pin over here I'm gonna go ahead and turn the machine on just a little bit and raise it up so that way this arm is raising a touch to slide over here easier and I'm guessing that's all that's gonna be needed give it a little jiggle like that and I have this here just in case because feel free you know if you just need a centimeter more or whatever else give a little whack like that and that's no problem at all put that lower link there now we're on to the top link here so with the top link here you're gonna see it is adjustable got this locking or Jam nut on here too so if it is tightened down you're not gonna be able to lengthen out this side once it's attached but you can loosen that up too and then we'll get this attached and you'll see that sometimes if these don't have any grease on him they're a little stiff okay so you have two ways that you can level this three-point attachment out okay so first is you're gonna have your top link that will level this way okay or pitch if you want something to you know to get a more aggressive dig or line if you want or to have it ride a little bit more smoothly and evenly all the way across so depends on the attachment that you have on how you want it set up by giving that angle or levelness forward to backwards is gonna be with the top link here now what gives you level side-to-side okay this way in this way is gonna be with these two arms here and that's so much with this arm over here but you are gonna have adjustment right here in this arm and so in the same way that you can adjust a top link you know you can put your set of channel locks or wherever else on here and you can rotate this and adjust it along this threaded rod here to either level it out if you want or if you want to say you're grading with a with a back blade or a box weight or something else and you want one side to dig in more for instance you can offset it that way to allow for that to happen what you will see on some fancier setups like this one here are gonna be a little bit of an easier adjustment that you can make with this contraption right here whatever you want to call it and so but a little bit you're that way to do and you can just slot it right back down in there and make that adjustment a little bit easier but let me show you an even easier way yet okay so yeah this is definitely as easy as you can get it all right and so this is also the most expensive way there's no doubt about it but it is pretty cool so I wanted to show it to you you know there's a there's a lot of money that's tied up in something like this set up here because you need to have two functions okay like a fourth and a fifth remote right here dedicated to operating the setup in addition to that you have to buy you know your hydraulic top link here and your hydraulic side link over here so instead of having to mess with the monkeying around you know manually threading the rods in and out and trying to get a level and everything else you can simply after you have this whole system set up you know use a couple levers right from your operator station and make those adjustments on the fly or if you need to if you're detaching from one and then going up to hook up to another one even on those uneven surfaces because you can just simply angle your you're quick hedge here or your three-point hitch this way for instance and then hook up to it level it out and away you go now the other really cool feature found on the 4-hour series and I think some larger series as well is called hitch assist and with this knob right here I can raise and lower the three-point hitch from right back here off the operator seat and with these functions right here I can actually move the tractor slowly forward or backwards to just allow it to slowly creep backwards and hook up or slowly go forwards and hook up that way with or without a quick edge doesn't matter if it's just the three-point arms itself or a quick hitch either way I have done an entire video on this system and how to operate it I'll post a link above but I don't want to spend too much time going through the ins and outs of it right now you know so if you think that hooking up to a three-point hitch is a real pain in the butt then you're not alone and that's why these quick hitches have become so popular with everybody you can't actually do any work with it but it takes so much of the frustration and just the horribleness about hooking up to a three point attachment out of that process so I'm gonna go ahead and show you really quick here how to put one of these on once it's on it's on right so it's good for any attachment you just hook and unhook as needed and it's just a lot simpler process I can sell one of these to you as well I can even ship them for a really reasonable rate so go ahead and get a hold of me and go to good works tractors comm and check them out they're gonna come with three pins here all the hardware you need to hook them up and these quick hitches are built to a standard a SAE specification which is just a dimensional spacing requirement for quick hitches and for quick hitch compatible attachments it can make it easier for some of the heavier ones like this is a pretty heavy footage here you know if you want to have another person helping you out but otherwise once you get it on there it's pretty straightforward it's just a matter managing it all by yourself your top link in here and boom there you go you do have adjustments here for the top hook okay so you can see the different positions you can raise it up and down if you need to in there you know these are just spring loaded on the arms here again you do need a set of bushings for every attachment that you put that you plan to hook up to your quick hitch here but really sweet piece of equipment here again you can't do any work with it specifically but man it makes work more efficient and more enjoyable so really quick just go over how to hook up a three-point hitch attachment or the rear shaft of a three-point hitch attachment to your rear pto you can see there's the splines in there okay and these simply it's just like a keys just got to fit right with the splines that are on the back of your tractor the output shaft there for the rear pto and so typically what you need to do after you get to a certain point you're gonna have a little button like this or you're gonna have a collar to pull back okay it's gonna help it seat on there and then lock into place so it doesn't fly off while you're actually using the implement you'll be able to get the shaft on partway but then before you get it the whole way you're gonna have to hit that button there or again pull the collar back to get it to go all the way on and then pull back a little bit get it to seat you'll be good to go so this is gonna be the collar style instead of that little push button you just have a collar to pull back on and so same thing when you're releasing the pto chef and you want to take it off the tractor you got to either pull back on that collar or we have to push on that button and then pull back at the same time okay same concept for a mid pto as well for you folks with mower decks so I'm a pretty realistic guy I know that a hydraulic top and tilt kit and this whole setup here is just not gonna happen for most of us you know it's just a cool thing it's it's the cat's meow you know the creme de la creme the kind of the best setup you can get for that the worst setup is your traditional three-point hitch right so a good middle ground there and actually a pretty reasonable price point is gonna be that quick hitch there if that's the route you want to go I can definitely help you out with it again go to good works tractors comm I can ship them to you if you're not too far away you know seven eight nine hundred miles I can ship them really cheap and not a whole lot more even a little bit further than that so don't hesitate to reach out I'd love to help you out with one of those another attachment as well if you haven't done so yet hit that subscribe button below right down below there make sure you check out all those links head on over to the Amazon store go to good works komm stay safe we'll see you soon",
