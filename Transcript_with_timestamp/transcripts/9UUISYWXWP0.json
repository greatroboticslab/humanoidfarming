  "text": "[Music] welcome everyone to our farm scale composting workshop our presenter today is jeff andres chair of yahara pride farms incorporated he's the board he's out he serves as the chair on the board of directors which in this yahara pride farms is a farm-led not-for-profit organization working to improve soil and water quality thank you jeff so thank you for having me and thanks to the sponsors for sponsoring this segment of of the conference uh once stephanie first approached me about speaking um she was talking about the composting and sharing some things with the with the conference and after i committed she said i needed to talk for 90 minutes so hopefully i've got enough information here and uh and good information that keeps everybody energized and and uh into this program and and uh hopefully we all can uh get something out of it uh we've been doing this for a while and uh but uh you know still a lot to learn so um anders barry ridge farms is uh i'm in uh the uh uh would be the fourth generation um farmers or third generation fourth generation moving to the fifth generation um this picture here on the farm uh was the the house and the original dairy barn was built by my grandpa and in 1913 the land has been in the family since excuse me since uh the late 1800s our farm is uh is located in the ohio watershed and as uh my bio says uh we uh i also chair the higher pride farms farmer-led organization um with the uh where we uh try to [Music] improve water quality as well soil health in this region working directly with the farmers and and we've been in existence since 2012 and the organization has had some great success our farm is located in the northwestern part of the the watershed uh with the state capitol uh right in the center of the isthmus of the five lakes um very good farmland in this area uh also very uh very a very uh populated area as well um vast majority of the farmers are dairy mostly in the northern part of the the watershed southern part of the watershed is more crop land and more more maybe some more of the beef and swine down in that area andrus berry ridge farms three equal partners myself my brother steve and randy and their families uh milking 500 cows approximately 400 heifers 1100 acres of land grow alfalfa grass soybeans wheat i guess we also sell genetics uh registered herd of cows uh have some high genomic cows um we've all showed all three families that showed at the local fairs and the dairy expo so uh well-rounded farm one of the things that we concentrate on the farm is being good stewards of the land we use a lot of cover crops we do a lot of minimum tillage our housing of our livestock calves up to six months are in group pens we bed with primarily corn stocks ground corn stouffer that corn stover is normally chopped twice before we bale it so it's not look overly long and stringy uh it's sized and particle size you know three to four inches we do use a little bit of wood shavings with the calves heifers that are seven months and older are then introduced to freestalls and we are bedding with uh ground corn cobs and sawdust in those stalls and then all our lactating cows are are on sand bedding six months all the manure is i should say the manure to six months and younger and older manures all the all the manure from the heifers from baby calves until they have their first calf is now being composted on the farm in one way or another uh the manure that from the heifers that are in the freeze stalls is hauled daily to a local um um what am i saying local manure digester where they harvest the methane out of it we bring back the separated fiber and that goes into the composting process we have enough liquid storage for six months for the lactating cows what is composting and this is a very basic definition and it's combining carbon and nitrogen sources together and decay the deco composition uh uh of the organic matter into a simpler form by introducing these two two uh sources together and by the decaying organic materials then is used for plant fertilizer it's been around for centuries why farm scale composting number one thing is just drink volumes and concentrate nutrients you also kill pathogens and break down carbon the carbon bedding and you make nutrients more available to the growing crops and one of the reasons you are making it more available is by breaking down the carbon bedding which normally in some cases takes up nutrients out of the soil to break it down in the field can be an alternative way to handle manure other than liquid because the composting process uses a lot of moisture you can you can use you can take some higher moisture manures and introduce it to the composting process minimizing the amount of liquid storage one thing that is became very evident in our research and the work that we've done here is that it converts the soluble phosphorus in manure to a more stable particulate form that binds to the carbon in the compost therefore making it a safer product to take to the field when you have runoff events it doesn't tend to move as quickly off the field uh manurepo manure composting and renaults is also an alternative way to store and stack manure um utilizing your headlands and your fields actually for the storage versus a manure pit or a structure allows a wider window for applying livestock nutrients back on the field we got more ability to spread on on growing crops in the summertime a lot of times when you spread liquid manure it's a fall and and and spring application only a couple weeks to get it done compost allows us to get that nutrients out there and more often more days of the year than say liquid compost has a less less risk to enter groundwater because of the organic nitrogen tends not to move as easy and better avoids potential water quality issues by minimizing the risk of runoff better utilization of nutrients in the farm system this is something i learned early on is now we have all this nutrients that we have tied up out in our farm field some are higher than others and some fields get manure more often than others in the form of liquid manure this way we can get manure out to those fields that don't for instance if they're highly erodible we can get manure to those fields more often in the form of compost therefore using the higher fertility fields of the farms to actually feed the lower fertility fields in the farm history of of composting on at barry ridge farms the first time i was approached about composting was our tenant we have a hog facility that we rent out was the summer of 2000 2014. got a little misprint there um pvp dv uh was moving through the country at that time and they no longer could render mortalities so they were looking for an alternative way to dispose of their mortalities and they approached me about getting some corn stock bedding to make some windrows to embed the the mortalities in to to compost them and i said i could do one thing better i could supply them with a all the betting pack manure they wanted and therefore um we started that process and i was amazed after a month's worth of time of that mortality being in that windrow house how it disappeared with very minimal smell ore or attraction of flies the summer of 2015 we were awarded a sare grant and managing summer we were managing summer packed uh betting pack manure strictly in the summer we we received the grant to offset some costs and experiment with composting with two other local farmers and that was to to help understand a little bit more about what we could do with the composting what were some of the alternative um well first of all could we make good compost second of all what are the what are some of the things we could use the compost for one of them was uh potentially some livestock uh bedding at at some point at a certain point of the of the process as well as we moved some compost off the farm to another farm that did not have a history of manure or or compost in their farming operation in 2017 we received a community grant to continue composting and to build we also built a new heifer facility in compost shed so the idea of that grant was more on the water quality side of things being involved with uhera pride and our organization and the community this area is very concerned with the five lakes of the water quality and what comes off these farm fields mainly in the form of phosphorus we were wondering if there was a way we could potentially make compost move that nutrients to farms that need it and our our watershed is a perfect example with the livestock being in the northern part of the watershed and very few livestock in the southern part of the watershed how could we potentially work together and move that nutrients from the farm from those livestock heavy livestock areas to areas that are not getting manure and or organic fertilizer 2018 we designed and built a compost turner with a local equipment manufacturer or i should say a fabricator welding shop that complemented our composting process and allows us to be much more efficient 2019 we worked with a number of different carbon sources in our manure uh we we did a trial with the mmsd the madison metropolitan sewer district uh with some of their class a bile solids we worked with some with grass and straw um betting pack manure separated fiber all those types of carbon sources and we did a study as far as how how how they performed in the composting process 2020 we started working with local the local manure digester to allow us to increase composting to all our livestock which i said earlier other than the milk and cows and what that really did was allowed us to get a little additional moisture out of that manure before we introduced it to uh the composting process and now we have all of our young stock manures being being treated or you could say being processed through the compost system currently we continue to try other ideas that might add value to the agronomic value of compost and how it performs in the field again the sarah grant we the outcomes uh for the idea of it was to improve the long-term sustainability of each farm through the marketing of value-added soil amendments and moving nutrients out of the phosphorus impaired watershed uh we did that uh with that trial we had one of the farms that uh again we hauled the finished compost to a farm in the southern part of the watershed that did not have a manure history and we had seen some some results there we also were looking at the possibilities of using it for betting and the the trial included daily temperature carbon dioxide accumulation moisture percentages visual evaluation of the leachate and runoff and steam generated and one of the things that we are learning with the composting out in the fields on headland stacking or field edge is there's very little leachate and and that is very important as far as worrying about contaminating contaminating groundwater um it seems like the the compost when you're turning the compost regularly it actually burns up that extra moisture in the water in a lot of cases actually draws moisture out of the ground as i said we uh we learned in the sarah grant that at a certain point in the process three or four weeks in that the compost uh was in a state that we thought it would actually make pretty decent bedding at that time it probably was turned four or five times uh had good pathogen kill and we used it in our freestyles for our heifers one of the problems we had though because we did we only scrape once a day our freestyle alleyways we had some issues with hairy hoof warts with the with the heifers uh they were drawing a little bit too much moisture into the into the freestalls and seemed like those hairy hoof it's flourished um in our facility at the end of the day uh it didn't work well for us uh as far as car cow comfort it was great i think in a situation where you had alley scrapers or a slatted floor i think this could be a pretty good potential practice or at a minimum being able to mix that with another carbon source as bedding the community compost grant from 2017 to 2018 was funded and retrieved through the clean lakes alliance worked with uw madison on the research side of things evaluate the potential runoff of pea loss on farms during the manure composting process and the application to crop fields this is where we found out that there was a transition from from from soluble phosphorus to particulate phosphorus that binds to the carbon within the compost that was something that we didn't realize prior to this and and [Music] we feel is pretty beneficial for the environments again we used we also use bedding from the six months and younger the corn stalks straw some wood shavings a little bit of sand mixed in some of that as well we were able to get a little better handle on the expenses of what it was actually costing us at that time to do the composting process that i'll be sharing later the outcomes of the growing of the compost grant the summary the growing awareness of the spreading of pack manure and melting snow is not the best way to manage and use nutrients in the manure so the idea of this was could we take manure off the farm fields at particularly this time of the year when people are needing to get manure off out of the out of the pens it's thawing can we put it into a windrow and turn it into compost rather than spreading it out on the fields where it is highly soluble phosphorus would potentially move with the melting snow and get into our waterways we also learned that the compost dries down saving a lot of a lot of hauling costs we're generally seeing a reduction of anywhere between 40 and 60 percent in volume we also learned that composting compost could be spread on growing crops like alfalfa hay and through our yield monitors on our chopper uh where we harvest the the uh hey we were able to see a little bit of a yield bump um i was looking more so to see if we'd see a yield drag if we were doing any damage so being that we've seen a little bit of a yield bump and we could detect it with our our own yield monitoring i felt pretty good about that nutrients being used out in the hay fields the other concern when you put it on hay fields is you want the pathogens to be reduced you don't want to be re-harvesting pathogens especially pathogens that potentially could lead to herd diseases like yoni's again the compost was more flexible for land application and now we have the potential of selling off the farm our some of our excess nutrients headland stacking a convenient way to start composting you could you could headline stack this time of the year another way of being uh uh minima by bit another way to minimize the risk of nutrients leaving the field and it would just be a matter of bringing in the compost turner to aerate that that headland stack or that windrow on the edge of the field these areas when we sight them we're usually looking for areas that maybe are high traffic areas that don't have the yield potential therefore you're not necessarily taking land out of production that that could be a net gain to your farm operation or your your feed needs the compost turner uh obviously you need to introduce that oxygen and liquidate the waste gases uh to allow the composting and speedy decompress sensation the composting process how are we going about composting on our farm as of as of today and i guess the the main thing is when we compost on our farm we do do it two ways we do some of it on a controlled environment under a roof and we do some on an outside pad cement pad where we uh are a little bit more exposed to the elements of of uh of the weather and uh to the picture to the right i got actually got a caught a bald eagle uh checking in on what we were doing uh one day uh i thought it was kind of kind of interesting uh he must have seen it from a bird's eye view and had to take a closer look so there is there is interest in composting out there and uh even this fellow was willing to check it out where can you compost so the the uh compost is we are doing it under a roof uh and that roof is uh um not cemented underneath it's a three foot a clay base that was built for this specifically nrcs approved and then we also do an outside composting pad uh that we uh have a little bit more more material than what we can do under the roof that's our our overflow both work well uh both have some challenges i do see a couple questions here uh first one being uh any permits needed uh for in and nutrient management plan and um no we we are actually allowed to do up to 4 500 yards one particular site if you do it on headline stacking based off of nrcs rules and was there any analysis done of the microbe composition of the finished compost we have not yet we do have some i do have some tests of trace elements within the compost on the fertility side moving forward here's another example of where you compost though some of these trials we were doing out in the fields here's a example of field edge windrows that were in the field and if you look at the fields there is no in the field here in the grass growing next to the compost you're not seeing any signs of leeching or burning of the grass that's coming out of these wind rolls the types of manure that we are now putting into our compost on the left hand side we've got the freestall scraping so that's the manure that we are actually taking to the digester right now that's you can see it's got a a little bit of a slump to it it's not straight water by no means we can handle it with the the tractor loader bucket we can load it with the tractor loader we it's not pumpable so it actually works quite well for the the digester manure we're actually taking a fair amount of methane capability within that manure because it is a little on the thicker side that helps offset some of the cost of transportation to make it uh viable betting pack manure that's our main carbon source that's where a lot of the energy is coming from to make the compost here's a picture of the separated solids notice that's that's very stackable that's the the separated um solids parts that come out of the the liquid that goes to the to the digester when we build our windrows we are loading the different types of manure and what you're seeing here in this picture is um the tractor or the spreader that we load this uh this um manure into is kind of a multi-faceted machine for us that that same spreader is used to haul the manure the scrapings to the digester on a daily basis hauls the fiber back also builds helps us build the windrows as well as spread the finished compost so we're this machine we're getting a lot of use out of on our farm very important when you add the extra steps to the composting process so that you have that you're not adding a lot of equipment cost that's not being used the the loader then we load the three different the two ingredients system we're really only using two ingredients here now is the bedding pack manure um and the separated solids after that's loaded in the spreader the mix we are using right now is three parts fiber one part uh bedding pack we then build our windrows so you can see this we back the spreader up to the windrow open the back gate and as we spread it it makes this perfect pyramid uh this this this uh that is uh basically what we want to make a good compost windrower or to start the composting process uh we get a good mix of these two materials uh early on we don't have to turn it to get this mix usually we are building a windrow week we are finishing a win roll week based on the amount of manure we have and so this this win roll will sit for about a week before it gets actually turned with the compost turner once we start the compost turning uh process uh we'll turn uh usually weekly we will hit that sweet sweet spot of when we're got good temperatures we'll turn five times in the matter of uh two weeks process to maintain that 135 degree temperature at all times here's a site of the finished compost we've got compost outside here you can notice the strength the the color the size of the reduction obviously in volume uh and then under the shed roof here or the compost building the windrow farthest to the right is the one that's the closest to finish and the other two are you know got a couple weeks to go yet transportation and staging of the compost so our farm we we have land that varies from two miles to ten miles from the home farm so we have to transport some of this compost some a fair distance and when we do it we try to load it as efficiently and haul it as efficiently as possible haul it to the field it's going to get spread on so when we get into that field to spread it that we're not wasting any time that we're basically loading and spreading and making full um efficiency of both the loader and the spreader when we go into the spreading process but here on the right hand side you can see what a windrow looks like in the field this time of the year scrape away the snow so we can put it on basically on top of the dirt and in our situation we don't take it to uh to a finished compost state like you'd put in a bag so it will heat a little bit yet out in the field and i guess you could say it can condition it or or just do the last finishing in the field and then the spreading uh here you see the same machine we put spinners into the under the back of the spreader able to spread up to about 80 feet real consistently with this spreader and this picture shows us spreading it on grassy hayfield and the biggest thing that i've noticed when we're spreading compost is that you don't paint the ground like you do with when you're typically hauling a manure with like a slinger spreader or um or a box spreader it's just you don't have the you don't have the volume to do that but yet you're getting probably as much nutrients if not more onto the field and being a lot less visible visible for the byspan the public as well any questions here or some questions to catch up on okay how do your costs compare to the traditional soil management so one of what we're finding is here is that we're actually we're going to get into it a little bit later but our nutrients i can haul compost to the field much further than i can liquid manure and to get the value out of it so for instance a load of compost on a straight truck could probably worth about 600 bucks in fertilizer value the same payload and liquid might be about 65 to 80 a load so therefore i can haul that nutrients further before the value of that of that nutrients is gone we also are seeing reduction in the amount of fertilizer we have to put on to the purchase and put onto fields because we are used better utilizing the nutrients within the farm system the challenges with winter composting is moisture and that's one of the questions here as well and we tend to to in our our setup here is we try to go in with drier carbon sources to begin with if if possible um art of compost generally runs higher in moisture in the winter months um there are some uh opportunities out there to put aeration under the windrows if you want to spend the money we turn more often in the winter we also try to do it in a way that the moisture leaves the pile so i don't like to turn on days where where it's cold real cold if we don't have to uh just so that moisture gets away from the pile uh the npk analysis of the finished compost i'm going to share that a little bit later we have some variation we have some carbon nitrogen ratios that i'll be sharing later as and as well so now the economics this is probably this is something that's really important to understand and we we performed some economics early on with the community composting grant i went through this winter and and i've kind of updated that to what we're able to be how those economics are working for our farm right now um now that we've ramped up our our production so if you look at the cost analysis of traditional manure handling we have here we have a chart or a cost breakdown in a couple different categories i'm going to start with the top one here so in this cost analysis we've actually took the value of the of the betting stock or the betting that was going into the manure and the amount of bales and so forth and in this case it showed it was 504 uh dollars in value that's probably going up a little bit this particular cost analysis was done on basically 467 cubic yards of betting pack manure coming out of the facility we go down to the actual cost of scraping and cleaning the barn and the labor and then we look at the total cost of the manure so the total cost to clean out that barn and build the windrows in this situation uh or we're just cleaning the barn i should say in this cost scenario and hauling it directly to the field so the total cost was over three thousand dollars um but the cost per yard was six dollars and 51 cents so that's what it would typically cost to in our if we would be hauling this cleaning this barn and hauling it directly to the field and that's more of the typical way of of handling betting pack manure if we add the com compost process to it you know we're going to we've got the turning expense we have there we should actually have the facility cost um so um and then we have the cost of the turner in the top box here loading the compost at the barn again to move it further out reloading the compost on the tubby spreader for spreading that's what we figured the cost there total cost the total cost to produce haul and spread the compost it was like forty eight hundred and seventy seven dollars you noticed on the page before it was right around three thousand dollars just to haul it directly to the field if we take that on a on a on a per cubic yard uh price to spread the compost to the field at that time we were estimating it was costing 21.77 cents per cubic yard to to haul or to make and haul that compost on the field if we were to load that compost and not take it to the field and just sell it we were figuring the cost net cost of production would be about 18.97 so 1897 if we convert that to a per ton cost because most of our analysis are done on a per ton basis for when you send your compost off to get an analysis on it comes back the nitrogen the phosphorus and the potassium are tabulated as a per ton basis being that a yard of compost doesn't weigh a ton it comes out to 32.31 cents per s per ton spread on the field under this scenario if we were to just uh sell it uh and put it on a truck it would be 29 18 a ton for those costs so those those costs have to be made up somewhere so the compost uh comparison direct call to the field versus finishing compost we are seeing about six dollars right now six dollars and fifty cents a yard to convert the manure into compost or ten dollars a ton for the finished compost mold it's costing ten dollars more a ton to do it if rather than just haul it directly to the field now some cost analysis based off of where we are today now and now as of now as you the shed the interest appreciation and principle i figured i based this all on a per yard basis i figured it was 244. uh building the compost windrow that would be as i showed you in the pictures earlier the loading of the manure the different ingredients onto the spreader and running it back out i figure it's about two dollars per yard turning the compost eight times two dollars and fifty cents per yard loading the finished compost for field spreading or sale uh we have we're a little more efficient with that now we got a bigger loader uh a dollar fifty per yard so our totals as of what we're making now is about eight dollars and 44 cents per yard to make it into compost just to make the compost and load it the cost of spreading the compost we figure up to two miles which is three dollars and eighty cents per yard so therefore we've got it delivered and spread to the field for twelve dollars and twenty four cents a yard or 18.83 cents per per finish ton cost analysis then versus now we're looking at 32 tons uh 32.31 cents a ton spread on the field uh versus the 18.44 per ton for now so here we're here we are looking at a value of the compost that's the questionnaire what are the np's and k's uh in this situation this uh this was done in 2016 um on a per ton basis on this particular analysis we figured the value of the nitrogen uh was 12.87 cents per ton the phosphorus was 6.92 cents per ton the potassium was 7.99 per ton the sulfur was a dollar 51 a ton calcium was 5.05 per ton magnesium was 350 per ton and then if you take all the others less significant numbers for analysis but it's still important to the crop the boron the zinc the copper the magnesium the maliburum um the total value of that compost comes up to 41.79 per ton so there's still some extra value above and beyond the production for that that particular compost there's a difference in compost um now here we've been playing around with different feedstocks going into the compost some are create higher compost numbers than others moisture has a lot to do with it uh if you look at the upper left-hand column here we've got a compost sample that runs 69 moisture that's a little on the high side you're looking at the nitrogen at nine nine point three nine per ton uh total phosphorus at eight point five four ton potassium 9.94 and sulfur 1.79 you take the sample in the lower right hand corner now this is 41 percent moisture considerably drier all of a sudden with the feedstock in this particular case we've got nitrogen at 3181 we got phosphorus at 2846 and potassium at 56 16 and sulfur at 783 there's a couple things that could play into this the carbon the nitrogen ratio obviously the moisture is number one the carbon the nitrogen ratio of the first sample was 14 to 1. the carbon and nitrogen ratio of the second sample is 11 the one so the one in the lower right is more finished and drier uh the feedstock going into it might have been higher in np and k to begin with as well so that's why now in our um recipe we've kind of got it zeroed in to just that three three to one ratio then we uh we got a more consistent product coming out um that also has been made better because we are making our windrows with the with the spreader uh versus a loader tractor we have a much better job of having a consistent windrow from end to end we don't have that inconsistency of maybe we have a hot spot in in the middle of the wind roll where it got a little bit more of this uh higher higher uh uh fertility feedstock to begin with and all of a sudden we've pulled a sample out of out of that area so we're more we're more consistent now than than we were previous compost analysis is by the season so what this is is what is how are our compost uh testing by the season the one on the left i think as i break down him you have the average moisture the actual heist so this is a series of samples we sample every windrow so we took the high windrow and the low windrow and then we have an average so if you got the moisture content you know the average is 56. uh organic matter 24 ph 9.5 our ph is seem to run a little bit higher even on the real finished compost and then you can see the average is for the n p and k um and then on the bottom you can see uh how the nitrogen and ammonium and uh the organic end and so forth and the carbon to nitrogen ratio spring now the spring compost would be the compost that would be being made right now in the months of january and february uh the summer compost would be basically the compost that's being made in early spring and then the fall compost would be the compost that's being made in the summer and the winter compost would be what is being started in the fall if you look at the summer compost the moisture goes down six percent have a little bit higher numbers as far as the potassium nitrogen is down [Music] this particular case the phosphorus is is a little bit lower but then that spring compost we had and that we had a ingredient in that uh high one that really pushed the phosphorus so that one's a little a little out of whack there so um again then on the bottom in this particular case uh we didn't have uh as much of a breakdown on the organic and but the total carbon or the carbon nitrogen ratio was 13.26 for an average we take the fall now here here is that that material that's being made in the summer notice it's drier on an average we had a high of 56 and a low of 38 if you look at those numbers we have a variation there ph again is still still up there nitrogen on the high one was pretty high the phosphorus is is relatively high on the high one as well but uh um if if we can duplicate that in a mix now we got something that we can justify hauling even further out than than uh your standard compost so there are ways to to spice this compost up a little bit to have a little more value in it based on the feedstock that's going in it and how we treat it again on the bottom carbon and nitrogen ratio on these we're averaging 11.47 now winter there's the moisture there's our big that's my biggest challenge is the winter compost is dealing with the moisture and not having that pile go stagnant on us and 68 is getting up there i always kind of fall on the rule of thumb that making compost is like making silage um if it's too wet it doesn't work well in a ration if it's too dry it doesn't work well in the ration so if you can keep it somewhere between 55 and 65 you've got a really good working range here you can see the averages on that you know our high had a had a carbon to nitrogen ratio at the bottom of 16.36 that's probably not finished real well that was 72 percent moisture that's probably why the one that was 61 had a carbon to nitrogen ratio of 11.2 that's more acceptable and you know the average was 13.83 now that was a lot of stuff do we have any questions on that okay okay so are the carbon nitrogen nitrogen ratios from a start or end of the compost process so carbon and nitrogen ratios on ours are usually start around at 30 30 to 1 when it's fresh made in the windrow we always kind of figure the way we're using it out in the field not necessarily selling it as a class a compost anytime it's below 15 to 1 i feel it's time to move it out um we're getting the value of the the uh pathogen kill at that point we have a pretty good carbon number there um the shrink is there um and we just i just don't want to put any more time and money into it than i absolutely have to if i was to sell the compost we would probably then have to spend a little more time with it the ideal carbon and nitrogen ratio is uh from what i understand is anywhere 15 and lower it's very hard to get carbon to nitrogen ratios uh under 10. so when she's getting down to that 11 range you've got a pretty good finished compost that's when it's really black in color the texture is his uh particle size is real small it's got that real earthy smell um those are what that's to me is some of the best uh based on the visual and the smell can you explain about the compost turner i would like to know what model you use to have it custom built so our compost turner that we built um uh it is it does a complete turn of the of the compost um we back into the compost it's there uh there's a beater that uh flings it up in the air and onto a conveyor belt that re-stacks it and this uh this turner i i can't talk too much about it i'm i'm in the process of potentially patenting this turner um but uh it's been working quite well for us and i think part of the reason we're able to do some of the things we're doing uh in a timely fashion is because of the turner itself the question here is i don't see any line in your cost analysis for the cost of not turning soluble n and p into the insoluble or into other words taking organic and and pee and turning it into organic therefore making it insoluble until root extratulates call for it real value yeah and that one um that's true but how do you come up with that number that's one of some of the things that we still have to that i don't quite understand yet maybe some of the people that are listening in maybe have some answers because uh there are definitely some hidden values there that we are do not label in our numbers a question here is i came in late what do you see as a carbon what what do you oh what do you use as a carbon source to manage your carbon and nitrogen ratio um our main carbon source in our in our compost here is corn stocks um actually betting pack manure taken right out of the out of the out of the barn and with either straw or or corn stalks has the almost the perfect nitrogen carbon and nitrogen ratio to start the composting process all right caught up on the questions and we're going to move on to the next section we got another one uh what equipment used to measure the temperature for legal compost i am just taking temperatures at this point right now um we'll probably have to invest into some more sophisticated equipment if we are actually going to start marketing compost but i'm pretty much falling back on temperatures and watching temperatures to make sure we're turning in a timely fashion and then when temperatures tend to drop and the carbon and nitrogen ratio goes down that's what we're basing our our time to move it out or finish turning conclusion that's what i was saying composting unknown value and here's a list of things that we don't know and i have a hard time putting a handle on what is the value of adding compost to the soil for soil health purposes so we know by taking compost to the southern part of the watershed back in 2015 and 16 the farmer applied four ton to the to the acre at that time a one-time application the fir from that point the following years moving forward up until this year even he's seen a yield bump in the area within the field where he spread the compost in soybeans and corn both were you know pushing close to 10 bushels to the acre at the high he was still seeing a couple bushels this year so there's something going on in the soil there by introducing compost and it's not just the the the np and k that carbon and and organic matter and and the biology of that compost is doing something uh significant and i'm open to anybody that has any more information on that uh that could share with us and then it's definitely something we'll be working on here closely uh with trials that come to see if we can um actually figure out what's happening what is the value of the additional carbon from the compost add it back to the soil when you spread it how do we put a number on that value and what is the value of the organic makeup of the compost when compared to conventional fertilizer obviously this farmer was using conventional fertilizer he was getting good yields we introduced the compost to it and within a year's time you had even better yields so there's definitely something going on there better utilization of nutrients in the farm system i talked about that earlier how do we how do we uh utilize best utilize the nutrients that we have paid for on the farm and sharing it from field to field convenience of the value of moving and staging manure to farm fields before hauling this time of the year we don't i shouldn't say we don't have a lot to do but we have we have a little more time to actually stage that manure get it to those fields taking the transportation part out of the equation at the time when you need to be out there spreading the ability to manage betting pack manure all months of the year that was a challenge for us you know uh when you have bedding pack barns that need to be cleaned out in the summer months um you you're limited on fields where you can spread it you can't spread it on hay fields uh you'll smother out the alfalfa or the grass you take the potential of reharvesting it again therefore composting and breaking it down allows us to do that select days for hauling that are best for the field conditions there's a value there uh you're not out there compacting the soil uh your can pick your dry days um or or days when the uh the weather is is uh better for spreading uh manure or nutrients out on the field spreading manure compost on fields that won't have received manure there are fields on our farm because of the landscape that we cannot put liquid manure on uh it just it's too hard we do most of our liquid manure application in the form of drag lines you get on some of these steep fields and it's hard to pull a hose on a steep field with their high slopes it makes some challenges problems with potential of kinking hoses and things like that allows for redistribution of nutrients within the farm system to all fields as i talked about cons of composting costs costs more to compost you know even though it come only doesn't look significant but 6.50 cents a yard or 10 a ton um doesn't seem all that big but if you put four ton to the acre on all of a sudden you're looking at forty dollars an acre more uh to to put that nutrients out in that field that same nutrients granted it's in a different form probably more usable those are the types of things that we have to be able to offset the expenses of the production some way somehow to justify the extra time and the commitment uh [Music] uh for for the composting process time time commitment is is big it takes time to to stage this manure takes time to make the wind rolls takes time to turn the manure some farms don't have that time that labor force some do the nice thing about the turner that we are working with here on our farm is it's completely mobile some of our trials we're doing working with with farmers uh we uh we're as far as five miles away we're able to move that turner with the tractor and a minimum amount of time to turn their wind roads so there's a potential that that compost turning and making could be could be a custom custom applica application or a custom customly done by somebody that wants to move from farm to farm if it picks up in in popularity equipment and facility costs the equipment isn't cheap the spreader isn't cheap the turner isn't cheap we have we we have uh most of our manures being composted under the the roof the more of a controlled environment i believe it's that's well worth it um the consistency of the product coming out uh saves in time potentially if you have a a windrow that goes dormant on you halfway through the process of being outside if you get a heavy rain or something then you you gotta either introduce more carbon to it or you have to wait it out to get revitalize that compost windrow so it takes a little bit of that risk away with the facility cost lack of equipment and availability um when i started looking for compost turners that would work well in our in our shed uh that's what brought me to the idea of building a compost turner i think uh we we the uh the equipment uh that is needed at a farm level is uh is is maybe not there uh yet or maybe it's coming um seems like most of the compost turners that were out there were either too big for what we wanted or or too small weather challenges in this region northern you know we're we're in the southern part of wisconsin we have some cold weather in january and february as we well recognize here coming out of the the cool weather we had here recently uh those challenges um add that adds a challenge to the compost uh process especially when you're in the deep freeze i don't like the turn if i don't have to in those those uh temperatures because it seems to thin out my my uh bug count or my bacteria count the good bacteria also i'm turning frost and moisture back into the windrow that normally would be volatile up in the air ability to dissipate the moisture into the compost in the winter months just talked about that getting that moisture to actually leave that wind roll if we're going to do this in a large scale um we may have to introduce some form of ventilation or air in the floor systems to potentially drive that moisture away from the windrows at this time of the year what we have learned uh we have learned that we have the ability to make a high quality compost product um you know we've we've got some compost that's very high value um depending upon the feedstocks it's a matter of zeroing in on your recipes and your your sources to to make a consistent product uh compost process works well if you have raw products and multiple types of manure uh we are we have proven that uh we've even taken it one step further as i've talked to you earlier about with some of the class a product coming out of the madison metropolitan sewer district can shrink manure volume considerably by composting i think we've seen anywhere from 40 to 60 percent in volume uh reductions uh that's huge when you gotta offset the costs of the extra time and investment to make compost can make nutrients much more available and stable for composting with composting versus conventional pack manure i think we've seen that in our what we've seen out in the field with our yields we've we definitely know that if you haul a lot of uh straw and and corn stock uh carbon based fresh manure out in the field that it can sometimes suppress the uh the yield or or potential of that crop that year just because of the tying up the nutrients that's in the soil vibrate to break down the carbon in that manure we can spread product on growing crops alfalfa grass we even did some on soybeans last year for a farmer that's that's a positive can transport nutrients further in the form of compost before the economic value of the product becomes a net loss you can manage processed manure on field edges it's perfectly legal to do that um it's a good way of uh saving some time and at the hauling time we can dispose of livestock mortalities i started out my presentation and that's where we learned what composting was all about so to speak was working with with the mortalities and how it shrinks how we're able to decompose that that mortality and that that one roll of manure and and and shrink shrink that manure at the same time uh pretty uh safe and efficient way to limit yourself to exposure to other diseases and pathogens with the with the rendering truck coming onto the farm can reintroduce carbon back to the farm fields in the form of compost that's that's a given can mix other things with compost um you know we can we can potentially add lime uh wallboard municipal mixes that that is important that spreader that i i have here and showed you on the screen has the potential of spreading lime um you could mix lime with your compost on a field that you wanted to seed into alfalfa and and spread the lime and the compost at the same time a lot of wall board down in this area with the amount of housing and building in in this region the southern part of the state has a lot of gypsum in it um some value in that in our watershed here the municipal uh municipality sewer districts they're they're they've got a challenge they they're actually competing with farmers for land to spread the human waste on there might be a potential to commingle our products to make a product that works uh for for the farmers and and work together could that's a possibility it may not fit the organic world but it might fit the conventional systems convert soluble phosphorus from raw manure into more stable particulate form through the composting process we've we've seen that in our work with the with the university and and the community grant what we need to learn how does finnish complain compost interact with the soil um i guess that's something that i would really like to get into more depth now and understand what's happening in those farm fields when we put that compost out there can compost be another saleable commodity coming off the farm and off our waste stream so if if we if we can and i and my i have a enough um experience with this now that i feel that it can be um i think it i think that would be very very important for the future of of the livestock industry if we can uh somehow make a product coming off of their waste stream that could form an another form of income there's farms out there that need that organic fertilizer and they need those nutrients so how much compost do we need to put on per acre to to get the benefits of this that you need in the soil uh that kick so to speak uh to get that kick uh is it four ton is it maybe a thousand pounds if it's a thousand pounds i've got all kinds of compost that i can share with people if i need to continue putting four to five ton on my hay fields then maybe maybe i don't we can pool resources to engage a larger number of farmers i mean can we do this um i'm starting to think we can um it's just a matter of how does that all work and how can we work together to do that how much composters need to apply to be applied to obtain maximum soil health benefits i just touched on that a little a little bit early but uh what is that um what is that magic number how much compost do we need to apply per acre to get the full value of compost working in the soil can the rest be marketed and that's that's the bottom line why manage manure by composting any size farm can successfully compost um that's that's been proven better utilization of nutrients in the farm system i've talked about that a number of times mobilization of nutrients needed in specific fields um you know i do my own snap plus nutrient management planning and i got a pretty good handle on fields that are low on phosphorus and need phosphorus i try to build those fields within the system with the phosphorus that's in the compost get the nutrients to the fields that are highly erodible tend to be the hardest ones to get the minor spreader to or the drag line to some of them fields aren't getting corn that is often so it's hard to hit them on a regular basis uh liquid manure storage costly to store hauling comes because of the volume um no no secret in that i mean um manure structures are costing more and more a year every year that goes by to build um and how can we shrink that again to shrink that volume of manure uh so that when we put wheels under it that it's more concentrated and and more condensed so that we can move it move it out more efficiently and further allowed to headland stack and stage compost on fields in winter months when liquid manure can't be spread um those headlands don't aren't costing you much more than the taxes in the winter months for them to be sitting there on the farm field might as well make use of them some of these field edge you know tree line areas they're not growing the best crops to begin with maybe we should be utilizing them for staging our nutrients out there earlier pathogen removal another one how do we put a value on that but but uh that is the reason why that we should be composting kills kills a number of pathogens uh allows for spreading on growing crops and then reduces that potential for these disease spreading example would be like yoni's our herd is pretty well eradicated uh yoni's and we've been able to do it with with good management practices and i guess we're at the point here where we can field a few more questions and maybe even have some dialogue so uh so the first question in other words what is the benefit or not containing the groundwater and surface waters with p and n would you not agree that it is priceless yeah i agree it's it is uh but even though it's priceless somebody has to pay for it there's a cost in it so um you know my farm this is there's no doubt about it i am spending more money on our farm making compost right now than if i was directly hauling that material to the field and so to ask other farmers to do the same thing we really got to know the benefits and the values of those things so we can justify making the change and the things that lead to um better soil health and better utilization of nitrogen and and the nutrients within the compost all those things are wind winds i always call them the wind winds and when you win for the environment and you win for the farmer's bottom line those are easy to adopt and adapt to but the ones that that are just flat costs to the farm them are harder to sell would not an easy justification for added costs be the simple fact that 70 of your non composted nitrogen from the manure is leaching to the groundwater only 30 percent plant utilization 100 of nitrogen in your compost is being utilized by the plant huge i would agree um being able to have that in organic form slow release and tying it up i think is big those are things those are the messages that need to be told with this what is the width length and height of your windrows our windrows generally start out at about six to seven feet high the width at the bottom is about 12 feet generally when they're done more more on the finished side they shrink down to about three feet um and in some cases we actually combine windrolls to keep to keep the composting uh process going a little longer is there any thought to compost some or slash all the milk and cow manure um the challenge that i would have with the milk and cow manure is is the excess water that's in the liquid manure from a dairy cow dairy cow drinks a lot of water so she's she's putting out a lot of a lot of moisture in her manure um there are some facilities in europe where they're where they are taking a liquid manure and and high volumes of water in it and are composting it i not up to speed on them i don't know that particularly the answer um but i know the more things that i have to build and add to the farm the more costs that's going to be for for for doing it so um if we can do it someday i'm sure we will uh it's a work in our case it's a working progress what effect does your composting process have on greenhouse gas emissions well that's a good question um so there's no lie there we're emitting some greenhouse grasses through gases through the composting process um now there is the potential of adding some some things to the compost that could alleviate some of that i'm going to be working with some people moving forward on that idea i can't reveal what the product is yet but we are going to be testing that so any time we can keep some nighter excess nitrogen into that compost um that should help with the vaultation of greenhouse gases what is the size of your building and how many yards and tons can it handle so our building is 65 for 60 by 220. i have four windrows in there at a time i always figure a windrow per foot approximately a ton [Music] a ton half a third of a ton per foot the building is actually quite high it's i think it's 16 or 17 feet to the truss height that gives us plenty of room to use the spreader open the end gate in there and not hit the bottom of the trusses [Music] do you",
