closer look at the evolution of cotton

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,040
harvesting we're talking about cotton

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,359
harvesting a process that's been around

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,279
for centuries deeply rooted in our

8
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:21,600
agricultural history for a long time

9
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:24,320
picking cotton was backbreaking work

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,439
done entirely by hand it was a labor

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,880
intensive process that required a lot of

12
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:31,279
Manpower can you imagine spending hours

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,640
under the hot sun separating delicate

14
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,600
fibers from prickly plants it was

15
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,120
grueling work that tested the endurance

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,079
of even the toughest laborers it was

17
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,920
tough but essential the livelihoods of

18
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:45,559
many depended on this painstaking

19
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,840
process cotton after all is a miracle

20
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:50,239
crop its versatility and utility are

21
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,000

22
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,399
fabrics and countless other products

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,719
that we use in our daily lives it's hard

24
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,719
to imagine a world without cotton but

25
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,519
the demand for cotton grew faster than

26
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,039
human hands could keep up

27
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:04,360
something had to change to meet the

28
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,600
increasing needs enter the cotton

29
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:09,320

inventions changed the game entirely

31
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,600
these mechanical Marvels revolutionized

32
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,080
agriculture taking on the tough task of

33
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,119
picking cotton so we didn't have to they

34
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,479
increased efficiency and productivity

35
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:22,360
dramatically join me as we explore the

36
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,200
fascinating world of cotton harvesting

37
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,280
machines and learn how they transformed

38
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:30,640
this crucial industry making it more

39
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,640
sustainable and less labor intensive

40
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,920
the story of the cotton harvesting

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,399
machine is a journey of innovation and

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,880
Ingenuity a tale of human creativity

43
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:41,840
meeting agricultural necessity it all

44
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,920
started in the 18th century with simple

45
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,200
devices like the roller Jin which helped

46
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,079
remove seeds from the cotton fibers

47
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,320
making the process less labor intensive

48
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:52,880
but the real game Cher came in the 20th

49
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,799
century with the development of

50
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,240
mechanical cotton Pickers which

51
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,200
revolutionized the industry these early

52
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,000
machines were far from perfect often

53
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,439
breaking down in the field they were

54
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,560
bulky prone to breakdowns and often

55
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,119
damaged the delicate cotton fibers

56
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,360
causing frustration among Farmers but

57
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:12,800
despite their flaws they represented a

58
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,400
huge leap forward promising a future

59
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,440
where machines could handle the heavy

60
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,440
lifting and reduce manual labor over

61
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,640
time inventors and Engineers continued

62
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,040
to refine these machines making them

63
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,040
more reliable and efficient they added

64
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,239
features like spindles and moistening

65
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,280
systems to improve efficiency and

66
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,080
protect the quality of the cotton

67
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,400
ensuring a better yield and so began the

68
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,560
rise of the Machines forever changing

69
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:41,319
the landscape of cotton farming making

70
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,319
it more productive and less labor

71
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:47,200
intensive so how do these mechanical

72
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,319
Marvels actually work imagine a giant

73
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,680
vacuum cleaner moving through a field of

74
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:54,319
cotton okay it's a bit more complicated

75
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,440
than that but you get the idea modern

76
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:59,480
cotton Harvesters are equipped with rows

77
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:01,640
of rotating spindles or brushes these

78
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,000
spindles reach out and gently twist the

79
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,920
cotton fibers separating them from the

80
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,080
plant without damaging the precious crop

81
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,080
the detached cotton is then drawn into

82
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,680
the machine where it's cleaned and

83
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,480
compressed into large Bales some

84
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,680
Harvesters even use air suction to pull

85
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,440
the cotton from the plant a bit like

86
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,000
that giant vacuum cleaner we talked

87
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:25,120
about it's a fascinating process to

88
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,640
watch a blend of brute force and

89
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,640
delicate

90
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:34,080
Precision now let's take a break from

91
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:36,080
the machinery and talk cotton trivia did

92
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,680
you know that a single cotton plant can

93
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,760
produce up to 50 cotton bowls that's a

94
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,879
lot of fluffy goodness and speaking of

95
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:45,200
fluffy did you know that cotton is

96
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,080
naturally hypoallergenic that's why it's

97
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,040
often used in bedding and clothing for

98
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,040
people with sensitive skin here's

99
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,560
another fun fact the average cotton

100
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:57,760
t-shirt requires about 2,700 L of water

101
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,560
to produce that's a lot of H2O which is

102
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,840
why sustainable cotton farming practices

103
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,720
are so important from its incredible

104
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,079
versatility to its surprising water

impact on agriculture and Beyond before

111
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,280
these machines cotton farming was

112
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,960
incredibly labor intensive it took

113
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,040
hundreds of workers to harvest a large

114
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,039
field and the work was slow and

115
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,000
physically demanding but with machines

116
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:34,160
doing the heavy lifting Farmers could

117
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Harvest vast fields of cotton with fewer

118
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,720
workers and in a fraction of the time

119
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
this increased efficiency led to a

120
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,759

debris that may have been collected

137
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:23,680
during harvesting next the cotton fibers

138
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:26,520
are aligned and straightened through a

139
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,600
process called cting then comes spinning

140
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:31,720
where the fibers are twisted together to

141
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:34,120
create yarn this yarn can then be woven

142
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,800
