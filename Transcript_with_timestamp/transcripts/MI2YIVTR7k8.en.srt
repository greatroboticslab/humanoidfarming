00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,240
Want a beautiful garden without breaking

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,240
the

3
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:08,280
bank? Building a DIY trellis is easier

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,120
than you

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,880
think. In just under an hour, you can

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,680
create a stunning structure for your

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:20,119
climbing plants. First, gather your

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,560
materials. Wood, nails, and some wire or

9
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:24,119
twine. Cut your wood to the desired

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,199
size. Keep it

11
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:28,720
simple. Now, start assembling the frame.

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,199
Don't worry, it's just a matter of

13
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,440
nailing it together. Once your frame is

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,079
ready, add horizontal slats for the

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:40,480
plants to climb. Next, secure it in your

16
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:42,960
garden. A sunny spot works best.

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,360
Finally, plant your climbers at the base

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,440
and watch them grow. This not only

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,000
beautifies your space, but adds value to

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:53,199
your property, too. Ready to elevate

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,160
your garden game? Grab those tools and

22
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,160
let's get building
