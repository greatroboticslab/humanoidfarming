  "text": "today i'm going to demonstrate a simple way to attach a lay flat header pipe to a regular garden hose begin by using a clamp to attach a gray barb connected to a leg flat header if it is hard to get on use some food grade lubricant like vegetable oil tighten the clamp wrap teflon tape around the threads on a two inch male pvc coupling keeping in mind the tape must go on clockwise so that it doesn't bunch up when you screw it into the grey bulb connector use pipe wrenches to make sure it is tight then apply pvc glue to the outside of the three-quarter inch female reduced threaded piece and the inside of the two inch male pvc cover now we will wrap the threads of a 3 4 inch female connector with teflon tape and screw it into the reducer next apply more pvc glue which will attach to a short two to three piece of pvc three quarter inch pipe apply more pvc glue to attach the valve to the pvc the valve has to flow in the right direction so double check the direction the arrow points use more pvc glue to attach another short piece of pvc pipe and then a three quarter inch female connector then make sure the water hose or faucet is clean and add teflon tape to the threads if you choose to add fertigation to the irrigation system it should be attached in the center of the pipe we hope this video was very useful please check out our video series to learn all the steps in installing a simple irrigation system on a small phone thank you you",
