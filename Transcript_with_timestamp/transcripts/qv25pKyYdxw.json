  "text": "words the silent superheroes of healthy soil champions of the vermicompost who with the right conditions turn scraps into the black gold gardeners dreams are made of it's a style of composting that can be done in any space big or small and costs very little to get started welcome to the first video of my firma composting series where I help you get started with Verma composting and answer your questions along the way today's video is all about starting a simple vermicompost the single total fit now before we really hop into things here I just have to say what's up to all 400 plus new subscribers here hello Amanda from nova scotia Lika from Holland Anita from Bulgaria this is so cool I love knowing where you guys are tuning in from so tell me my friend where are you watching from and what should we do to celebrate our next milestone a 5000 I don't know tell me what you guys think in the comments down below alright the moment you've all been waiting for it for a composting 101 in this video we are gonna talk about how you can get your vermicompost set up really fast and easy from a composting does not have to be hard it does not have to be complicated and here to help you overcome the overwhelm fellow beginner gardener you can become an expert from a composter so let's hop into things [Music] so first step you're gonna need something for your worms to live in bedding today I'll be using some soil that you can use compost it's Fagen peat moss coco coir anything that would be a good substrate next step you're gonna need some worms I have some worms on hand for my worms in the garage but you can use my links down below to get some worms from Uncle Jim's worm farm that's where I purchased them in the past and I've always been really happy next up you're also gonna need some source of carbon I'm using leaves because it's what mimics nature but you can use anything from shredded up grocery bags to shred it up packing paper to cardboard anything that's been dried up basically next up you'll need some food scraps this is what I have on hand I usually try to go for things that are a bit more broken down but here's the list of foods that you'll want to include and here's a list of foods that you'll want to avoid adding to your vermicompost you'll also need some form of grit which is why I've got coffee grounds with us today it's a great source of great you can also use egg shell or oyster shell and last up you will need a bin of some kind there are so many different ways to vermicompost but for today's video I want to show you just a really simple one that you can do in just any old storage tote so we're using this one hello this is my worm bin now you might be wondering aren't worms photosensitive is clear really the best option and he's in the clear bin because it's not a stinking have right now quarantine life you know what I mean but something that might be cool to use the clear bin and then you can actually see what's happening inside it's kind of a fun science experiment for kids you actually see what's going on inside to see all the layers and all of that so it might be a way to go but just keep it somewhere dark so that the worms aren't you know overwhelmed or anything now on top of my worm bin I've got a homemade sieve this is literally just one by two very poorly nailed together here with some quarter-inch mesh screen on top I use this to make my potting mix for my seed starts and I literally will rub the peat moss on the top leg and just I'd make it really really fine and that's actually important for worms too this smaller the component that you add the better your worms will do so I would recommend breaking things down for worms when possible it's not necessary but if you're really excited to get compost quick you can help them along by breaking it down for them alright so time to make some lasagna and by lasagna I mean a worm in but we are going to make lots of layers as if we were making the lasagna but with dirt and stuff we're gonna get your vermicompost bin set up right now [Music] so this this soil is nice and fluffy and the worms are gonna be really happy to live in this this is really good stuff and it's a little bit moist which is perfect for worms so something like this texture is really good [Music] [Music] so something to remember here is that the more you break this down the easier it will be for your worms to break this down and the quicker you'll get compost I didn't do a very good job of crunching down these leaves but you get the idea so by squishing this banana out of the peel I'm hoping that the worms be able to break this down just a little bit easier it was kind of a sticky mess if I'm honest so it was kind of gross I don't really recommend doing it like this but you get the idea the more broken down it is the easier it is for them to break it down so that's what I tried to do even if it made my hand disgusting Here I am just using my homemade sieve to add another layer of getting another layer of leaves make sure you take out any Trader Joe's precedes our worms really likes juice scraps avocado and banana but this is all I had on hand so I'm adding these apple and this carrot [Music] this parts pretty easy just sprinkle some grit in there and you're good to go [Music] right and just like that we have a very very very simple firma composting system set up all that's left to do is drill some holes some quarter-inch holes around the top and put a lid on this thing and you're good to go now let's talk about some common things that could happen in this first 24 hours your worms could be a little distraught worms like any living creature need time to adjust and so you're gonna want to give these worms 24 to 72 hours to get used to their new environment now with that said you want to make sure that their environment is what they like want you to know how to troubleshoot just a little bit here in the beginning we're gonna go nose dive into troubleshooting more issues later but just in the beginning I want you to know that the texture and the moisture in your bin should be that of about a wrung out sponge too much and the worms can drown too little and the worms don't have enough moisture so you want to get it just a little damp but not too damp you need to add a little water you can i soil and so I know that they're gonna be happy with that you can do the same thing and also use moist soil and I'm sure that your worms will be happy with that as well thanks for joining me today you guys that is all I have for you a very simple introductory video to verbum composting I hope this video helps you guys get started of course if you have any questions leave them in the comments down below I'd love to help you I do
