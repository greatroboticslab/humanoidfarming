1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,599
I joined the 1/6 one project just for

2
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:12,000
more information as far as in what else

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,830
there are other options to do now let's

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,450
see an opportunity to get someone else's

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,630
opinion and have a different perspective

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:21,779
on growing cane the success of our p16

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:24,960
one is really around being our able to

8
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:27,470
tailor the recommendations and present

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,490
them back to the growers so that they

10
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:30,660
any doubts about what they're trying to

11
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,669
do is being removed so they can

12
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,040
understand the recommendations are

13
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:38,520
suited best practice for their

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,890
particular farm and then they're quite

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,530
happy to move forward and and put them

16
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,270
into place yeah I thought I was doing

17
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,770
everything correctly but I'm with the

18
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,440
one six one program we were just stand

19
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:52,559
before my fertilizing program hell of a

20
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,520
lot and and just just have this but yeah

21
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,570
I have a piece of morning back here

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,090
monitor you're doing it I'm doing

23
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,859
everything correctly to the best of our

24
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,960
knowledge of the information that we got

25
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:03,480
the moment we can see a big difference

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,240
in our property and the work that we do

27
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:09,900
we Shay is leading to better better

28
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:13,049
crops better CCS good risotto around

29
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,640
every girl is different and so we work

30
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:17,310
specifically with what those growers

31
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,860
needs are some girls have needed a lot

32
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,229
more advice on one topic than others so

33
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,030
we sort of try and tailor our on-farm

34
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:26,040
advice and activities to suit that

35
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:29,189
particular file in the enterprise we

36
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,810
focus on the runoff that's leaving farms

37
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,729
and entering the reef obviously it's

38
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,920
important for us to focus on what's

39
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:36,450
going on on the farm and ensuring that

40
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,119
what's being put on with the fertilizer

41
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:42,119
rate is actually what the crop demands

42
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,220
the main specific change that we've made

43
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:46,860
by being in the project is dropping

44
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:49,049
nitrogen levels so far it's been really

45
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:51,180
good haven't had any problems that we've

46
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:53,430
conceived by dropping nitrogen rates

47
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,649
quite happy looking forward to what's

48
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,780
going on especially from a financial

49
00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:00,479
point of view as well as anything else

50
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,939
so as well as doing it on farm work we

51
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,200
also like to run a few workshops one of

52
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:05,700
the main point is to get growers

53
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,619
together because growers learned a lot

54
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,599
from talking to each other the Google

55
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:12,319
Earth training was useful as we give

56
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,849
each grower a USB in

57
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,430
that's all their farm data we bought

58
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:19,430
yield maps on their locating of their

59
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:21,200
soil samples any EC mapping that they've

60
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,930
done and also their actual nutrient

61
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:27,260
management plan any of the workshops or

62
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:29,569
programs or or seminars or field trips

63
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:31,099
they have whatever us try to get to even

64
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:32,180
if you go to I'm going to only learn one

65
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:33,920
thing that's one thing you didn't know

66
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,019
yesterday and it's one more thing you

67
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,200
can put in to maintain and sustain a

68
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:42,139
better crop better farm working with

69
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,299
pharmacist gives you someone else who's

70
00:02:42,139 --> 00:02:47,900
hasn't got a vested interest in selling

71
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:50,810
your fertilizer and also is on your side

72
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:54,680
as far as productivity goes the project

73
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:58,400
gives us confidence that our farm

74
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,799
management is the best it can be and

75
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,639
that as well as working through the BMP

76
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:08,160
project has given me the confidence that

77
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:11,250
my operation can withstand any scrutiny

78
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,250
[Music]

79
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,819
