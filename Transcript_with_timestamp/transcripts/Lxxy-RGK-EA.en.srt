how air pollution threatens natural pest

00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:07,759
control methods in sustainable

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:10,200
farming few individuals are aware of the

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,599
dangers that air pollution poses to both

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,960
people and the

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,600
environment humans who breathe polluted

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,960
air are more likely to get cancer heart

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,560
disease and even birth

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,720
defects Additionally the disruption of

10
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,279
the natural ecosystem caused by air

11
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,000
pollution from different human

12
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,640
activities such as industrial

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,279
manufacturing car emissions and power

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,239
plants reduces biodiversity by altering

15
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,800
the migratory patterns of plants and

16
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,320
animals and affects wildlife

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,520
habitats this could jeopardize Farmers

18
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,520
usage of non-toxic non-GMO natural Pest

19
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,960
management techniques genetically

20
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,280
modified

21
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,360
organisms here is how air pollution

22
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,760
endangers organic pest management

23
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:55,079
techniques used in sustainable

24
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,239
agriculture air pollution has been

25
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,120
recognized as an increasingly major

26
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:00,559
Hazard to the environment in recent

27
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,960
years

28
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,960
for instance a research reported in the

29
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,000
journal science indicated that both

30
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,280
indoor and outdoor air pollution

31
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,280
contribute to up to 8 million premature

32
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,759
deaths

33
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,040
annually both natural and man-made

34
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:17,680
sources such as car emissions and

35
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,520
Industrial Waste gases directly release

36
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,079
pollutants into the air

37
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,159
outside air pollution's effects on

38
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:25,520
organic

39
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,920
farming natural Pest Management

40
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,600
strategies in sustainable agriculture

41
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,920
are under danger due to the growing

42
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,079
issue of air

43
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,360
pollution the health of plants is

44
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:38,079
impacted by higher levels of pollutants

45
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,320
including ozone particulate matter and

46
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,399
nitrogen dioxide because they cause

47
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,240
premature fruit ripening which can

48
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,439
reduce yields in quality due to

49
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,759
decreased pest defenses when crops are

50
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,719
stressed by air pollution they are also

51
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,200
more prone to bug

52
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:56,920
infestation this may lead to lower crop

53
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,439
yields and a higher need for

54
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,680
insecticides the danger of organic pest

55
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,399
control

56
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,399
techniques one of the most

57
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,399
environmentally friendly ways to care

58
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,599
for crops is through natural pest

59
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,560
control

60
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:13,239
methods however a recent study indicates

61
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,160
that the pollution from factories farms

62
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:17,319
and Autos may be endangering these

63
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,680
organic Pest Management

64
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:21,959
strategies researchers discovered that

65
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,040
ladybugs struggle to locate their meal

66
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:26,680
when there is a lot of air pollution

67
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,800
around additionally it prevents them

68
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,400
from having

69
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:33,400
Offspring a healthy environment depends

70
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,480
on ladybugs which also help keep insect

71
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,400
populations in check and potentially

72
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:41,599
save Farmers a lot of money on

73
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,959
pesticides future of sustainable

74
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,280
agriculture sustainable farming is

75
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:48,280
gaining popularity as a means of feeding

76
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,560
a rising population well while

77
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,959
preserving the

78
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,120
environment the use of natural Pest

79
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:57,000
management techniques such as crop

80
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,440
rotation or chemical-free fertilizers as

81
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,440
opposed to pesticides is one of the main

82
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,000
benefits of sustainable

83
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,879
farming Recent research has revealed

84
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,159
that air pollution may be endangering

85
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:10,599
these organic pest management

86
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,560
