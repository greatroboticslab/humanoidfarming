hi i am adam krall veterinarian and

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,599
nutritionist for pioneer today i want to

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,320
talk to our cow calf producers about

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,240
weaning how we can do this successfully

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,800
to do this successfully we want to try

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,880
to make as few changes to this calf's

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,760
environment as possible

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,000
so

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,279
having a place where our calves can can

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,480
go and eat ahead of weaning that will be

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,399
where they were

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,640
eventually be weaned into

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,120
is is an ideal situation

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,360
the use of a creep gate to allow the

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,200
calves to to go into their own area

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,920
where they can be fed a supplemental

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,039
feed such as a commercial creep feed or

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,719
a feed with highly digestible fiber such

20
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,079
as soy hulls or soy health pellets is

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,840
really important

22
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,239
another thing that can make

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,559
weaning very successful is having a high

24
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:02,399
quality alfalfa to wean our calves onto

25
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,720
this should be an alfalfa that is

26
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,840
at least 20 protein

27
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,799
and at least 180 of relative feed

28
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,159
quality

29
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,479
it's important when we're looking for

30
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,880
alfalfa to start our calves on

31
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,280
that we really pay attention to relative

32
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,479
feed quality and not just relative feed

33
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,000
value

34
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,200
the big difference is relative feet

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,159
value

36
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,320
just quantifies the amount of fiber that

37
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,479
is in these alfalfa bales and the

38
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,360
relative feed quality

39
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,840
determines how digestible this fiber

40
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,720
actually is and this is really important

41
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,040
as

42
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,000
our calves brewman is not

43
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,640
as efficient as mature cow and so we

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,119
really want a highly digestible

45
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,840
forage to start our caps on for more
