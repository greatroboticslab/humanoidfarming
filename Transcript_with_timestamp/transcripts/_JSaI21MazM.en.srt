tractor and show you some setting so we

26
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:46,120
used to use the big tractor but he

27
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:50,000
acquired this little tractor last year

28
00:01:46,120 --> 00:02:06,129
and it works perfect for this

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:06,129
[Music]

30
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:12,260
so first three days of its life its

31
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:16,130
first three days of life

32
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:19,670
if this camp is not nursing its laying

33
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:23,270
under this tractor and I really hate to

34
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:25,820
break its little heart but I'm about to

35
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:29,930
have to go rake and I'm gonna need my

36
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:33,290
tractor back little buddy so the time

37
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:37,490
has come for the best most important

38
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:42,950
part of the hay making process which is

39
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:46,610
raking and bailing raking because it's

40
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:50,440
my job and because if you don't rake

41
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:53,660
right then you don't have good bales and

42
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:56,600
in the end that's like the most

43
00:02:53,660 --> 00:03:02,090
important thing so the pressures on

44
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:05,959
today my rod has new bigger wider tires

45
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:09,410
I haven't driven it yet and the pressure

46
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:12,130
is on because I'm not going to be able

47
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:15,140
to turn as tight as I usually do and

48
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:20,390
sometimes I've been known to turn too

49
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:24,560
tight anyway and you know like sometimes

50
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:29,090
blow hoses and like hit the rake and

51
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:35,300
stuff so today I can't do that I'm gonna

52
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:39,380
royally mess something up so here's

53
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:43,370
hoping that I don't really mess

54
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:46,530
something up we'll see going back home

55
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:51,370
because I forgot the radios

56
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:55,799

57
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:55,799
