1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,080
box I think that's probably the best way

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:07,520
to because you uh otherwise would have

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:10,280
to sign out and sign back in so if you

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,400
could just in the chat box of some place

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,320
indicates your name your full name and

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,920
your CCA we'll make sure that you get

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,240
recorded well in our presentation today

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,080
we want to cover three main topics the

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,640
first will be evaluating plant stands

10
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:29,119
followed by weed identification control

11
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:31,880
by Kirk howt he's uh in the department

12
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:34,399
of plant science NSU and the final

13
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,760
speaker will be Blake

14
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,680
vandor uh with Ducks Unlimited we'll

15
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:44,000
talk about disease and nitrogen

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:46,879
management I think after uh Kirk's um

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,800
presentation we'll certainly take time

18
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:52,039
for him to answer some questions he'll

19
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,399
have to leave um if I finish in good

20
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:57,920
time I might take a few questions on my

21
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:00,440
section but uh please feel free to hold

22
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,600
questions to the end as well uh we'll

23
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:07,720
take whatever time needs we do plan to

24
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,040
finish in general terms after an

25
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:13,439
hour so I'm Joel Ransom extension

26
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,320
Agonist for serial crops my uh part of

27
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,520
my presentation I want to talk about

28
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:20,240
evaluating plant stands and as you all

29
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,920
know having a good stand in the spring

30
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,600
is key to a productive winter wheat crop

31
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,200
and I've got a glow graph there that

32
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,360
shows the relationship of percent winner

33
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,680
survival and yield and so ultimately we

34
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,640
want to have a reasonable plant stand so

35
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,119
we can work with the question is how

36
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,479
much do we really

37
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,399
need and what are some of factors that

38
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:42,799
are going to affect survival and I think

39
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:45,200
this is one of the reasons we want to

40
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:49,280
talk about this today is because uh we

41
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:51,560
did make we did start uh our winter

42
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,439
wheek crop last fall in pretty poor

43
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,240
conditions but the factors that are

44
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,719
going to impact the amount of winter

45
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,320
survival are going to be the environment

46
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:02,560
um we have little or no control over

47
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,560
that temperature at the crown is

48
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,920
probably the most definitive of

49
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,239
environmental factors that we're going

50
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,440
to talk about the second would be the

51
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,680
state of

52
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,599
hardening uh which is a time of year

53
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,040
we'll talk a little more detail about

54
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,519
that the briy

55
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,080
S and the size and bigger of the plant

56
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:21,200
and the fall so these will be the four

57
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,800
main factors that are going to be uh

58
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,319
influencing the amount of winter

59
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,519
survival that we

60
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:30,480
have and if we look at the the general

61
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:33,440
graph that was indic to what

62
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:37,599
temperatures our plants can tolerate

63
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:41,360
cold you can see this top graph uh

64
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:43,599
is some data from Kansas State we see

65
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,959
that we start uh as the plant is

66
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,760
emerging it is not able to tolerate cold

67
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,680
it's kind of like spring weed in that

68
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,760
state and as we go through a period of

69
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,440
cold it will harden off and it gets to

70
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,519
the point where it will be able to

71
00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:00,680
withstand cold temperature down to about

72
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:03,640
10° fah minus 10° fah

73
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:07,200
and it will persist in that level of

74
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:09,760
winter hardiness uh until about February

75
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,519
and at that point the reserves uh start

76
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,360
to diminish and it becomes more

77
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:18,799
susceptible to coal and we see that as

78
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:20,959
we move into to much uh where we are now

79
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:22,480
the ability to withstand cold is is

80
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,200
significantly reduced and it's not

81
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,840
uncommon to have plant stands that had

82
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,760
made it through the winter up to this

83
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:32,519
point actually be lost when you have go

84
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,879
through a cycle of treason and thigh and

85
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:38,480
you can see that there's a pretty wide

86
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:40,640
band of of uh of temperatures that can

87
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,840
be tolerated it really depends on the of

88
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,439
plant the the reserves in the plant the

89
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,280
variety of its own and the kinds of

90
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:50,480
fluctuation of temperature so it's

91
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:54,200
pretty hard to predict precisely what

92
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:56,959
kind of you know

93
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,680
uh what what the plant is going to be

94
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,079
able to to

95
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,000
withstand let me just uh review with you

96
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:06,640
some data from last year this was a

97
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,720
winter survival model that was put up in

98
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,560
Canada just one to they don't actually

99
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:15,280
get to see the mouse come through there

100
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,600
okay so if you want that's okay you want

101
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,239
in

102
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:23,280
here

103
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:23,280
and and that Arrow will move

104
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,720
around all right so last year sorry

105
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,680
about that little uh intervention it was

106
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,840
a hopefully a use one I was having all

107
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,840
kinds of fun with my cointer and you

108
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:38,360
weren't seeing it but last year we did

109
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,320
have a winter of wheat survival model

110
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,840
was very descriptive in in kind of

111
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,960
showing how the winter wheat plant uh

112
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:49,479
tolerates cold and uh and depending on

113
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,520
the variety you can see that like Falcon

114
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:56,520
and and seator were able to tolerate

115
00:04:52,520 --> 00:05:00,280
just about minus four Fahrenheit and as

116
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:02,600
you get further into the spring

117
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:05,400
uh you can see that there were cases

118
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:08,440
where we actually had winter kill as a

119
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:12,120
result of plant being less winter hardy

120
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:14,000
and and temperature being too cold for

121
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,400
it to

122
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,440
survive we look briefly at where we're

123
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,520
at here this is some data that John

124
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:25,440
nosky has been recording and the top

125
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:31,280
this top graph shows the winter Golden

126
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,590
Valley and U if we look at the

127
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,479
uh

128
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:36,120
[Music]

129
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:39,520
the soil temperatures under a short

130
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:41,759
stubble we can see that certainly the

131
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:45,000
temperatures are less haven't captured

132
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,120
as much snow but in general I would say

133
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,120
that those temperatures none of them are

134
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,960
below what we would say as a critical

135
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,479
Lev level for winter winter kill we go

136
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,160
to Cass County the the bottom graph you

137
00:05:55,479 --> 00:06:00,520
can see that we have had some uh

138
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,400
temperatures so temperatures I think

139
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:05,639
these are about 1 inch depth where our

140
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,720
Crown would likely be down 10 degrees

141
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:11,120
but again probably because of the snow

142
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:13,199
cover we've had that our temperatures at

143
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,120
least in these areas haven't been

144
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,720
excessively low so we have to be too

145
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,840
concerned about winter kill

146
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,759
yet um I talked about variety being

147
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:25,880
important and this is these are some

148
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:27,360
data I collected in 2003 and four that I

149
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,560
haven't been able to replicate it was a

150
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,039
perfect year for having some we and uh

151
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,319
looking at the soybean residue you can

152
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:39,960
see that our variey coming from More

153
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:43,520
Southern locations we we have a very

154
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:45,000
high level of mortality uh whereas uh

155
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,360
with a little bit of snow cover under

156
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,599
the seats we residue all of our

157
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:54,160
varieties were able to

158
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:55,840
tolerate winter and so variety choice is

159
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,199
really critical and I know we've

160
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,080
introduced a lot of Southern kind of

161
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:03,160
winter wheat varieties in into our

162
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,400
system and so this might be a year um

163
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:08,840
where we see some of those failing

164
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,960
because of the lay planting and other

165
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,720
factors where in the last couple years

166
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,479
we've had really good survival because

167
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:19,039
of the snow cover and other

168
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,879
things I mentioned the size of the plant

169
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,560
going into the fall can have an impact

170
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:26,160
on the winter hardiness and here's just

171
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:30,199
an example of uh you know very late

172
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:32,080
planted small plants very few reserves

173
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:35,280
it's going to have less ability to

174
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,080
tolerate prolong Cal than this plant up

175
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,840
here and and you can actually plant too

176
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,919
early and have too big a plant generally

177
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,599
we don't have that problem in North

178
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,960
Dakota very often because by the time

179
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:49,039
you get in and plant that recommended

180
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,360
date you don't get a plant that's much

181
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:54,280
bigger than kind of that what that first

182
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,479
one looks like so I think this is one of

183
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,039
the issues we're a little concerned

184
00:07:55,479 --> 00:08:00,879
about we had very late emergence because

185
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:03,720
we planted late got the rains didn't

186
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:07,039
come until much later than normal and

187
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:10,599
and so um we probably have the plant

188
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:12,800
that just kind of set set there and

189
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:15,360
very where got to

190
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,800
start so let's talk about what

191
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,240
constitutes a reasonable stand uh you

192
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,879
want to go out and count several areas

193
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,759
um uh probably I've mentioned two foot

194
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,800
length probably 5 foot would be more uh

195
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,520
realistic and you want to do it in

196
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,159
representative areas of the field you

197
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,680
may have some parts of the field where

198
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:36,880
you have big gaps and you w't count

199
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:39,880
those differently than say uh other more

200
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:43,880
normal Fields you want to evaluate for

201
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:46,200
Vigor and we have a kind of a general

202
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:49,000
recommendation that we can

203
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,399
tolerate plant stands down to as low as

204
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,880
five plants per foot I mean that's

205
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:55,519
probably on our lower end for winter

206
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,200
weat if you compare that to Sprint you

207
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,360
can see that we can tolerate about half

208
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,640
the stand that we can with winter wheat

209
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,519
or with spring

210
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:08,320
wheat um here's just some data uh

211
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,959
showing you uh that bottom graph would

212
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:14,279
be coming from Mandan that you really

213
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:17,160
start to see a yield reduction when the

214
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:18,839
plant stand is below probably seven or

215
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:23,920
eight

216
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:26,040
but we probably are able to to maintain

217
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,680
yield sufficient to make it profitable

218
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:33,079
to keep that stand if even when we're in

219
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:33,079
that CL plants per square foot

220
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:39,279
range um this is some data that I showed

221
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,240
you previously showing you the

222
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:44,200
relationship between yield and plant

223
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,880
stand and here you know we had down as

224
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,519
low as

225
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:51,160
20%

226
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,360
survival this would have been kind of a

227
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:55,519
objective subjective

228
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,640
evaluation uh that we were getting up to

229
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:01,120
60 bushes which would indicate that

230
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,120
you'd probably want to hang on to that

231
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,680
um some other data this is put together

232
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:11,800
by Steve dorak looking at uh some of the

233
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:14,399
you know a range of of varieties over a

234
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:18,279
number of years uh and you can see that

235
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:20,720
again probably about that 30 to 40% uh

236
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:23,040
stand in the spring is going to be a

237
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,079
critical level uh where you want to keep

238
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,480
it uh versus where you want to think

239
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:31,040
about uh chilling it up and planning

240
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,040
something else

241
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:35,120
I'm G to skip the slide and that slide

242
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,440
but basically just showing you the same

243
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,440
relationships as you get into that 55

244
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:43,040
and above is not so

245
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,680
problematic but what this is might be

246
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,480
what your field will look like in the

247
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,560
spring if you're evaluating your plant

248
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,519
stand and you can see that in this case

249
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,320
the leaves have all burned off and and

250
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:55,639
you know some years we keep green leaves

251
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:58,399
throughout the winter but uh just

252
00:10:55,639 --> 00:11:01,000
because leaves have been frosted off

253
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,519
doesn't mean plant is dead have a really

254
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,959
nice technique for determining uh

255
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,200
quickly whether your plants are dead out

256
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:12,160
there you can dig them up nice to wash

257
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:14,440
the dirt off clip back uh The Leaf tips

258
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,920
put them in a bag keep it warm and and

259
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:20,360
usually within 24 hours you can you can

260
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,120
see something emerging if you don't need

261
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,760
by two days then you can be a little bit

262
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:28,040
wored you can see in this case a nice

263
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:31,480
little grein shoot starting to emerge

264
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:34,760
after probably after 24

265
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:36,399
hours so in summary I think our Optimum

266
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,639
for winter wheat would be to have a

267
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:42,680
stand in that 20 to

268
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:45,079
25 plants per square foot uh but stands

269
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,560
between 12 and 15 per square foot or

270
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:49,480
more than

271
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:52,120
adequate most years and stands as low as

272
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:55,320
even five per square foot have yielded

273
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,760
well if feel if conditions are conducive

274
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,959
to tiller

275
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:01,760
development and you want to consider how

276
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,639
uniform the stand is across the fields

277
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,360
uh certainly you can have big patches

278
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:07,839
and it's not uncommon to have big

279
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,800
patches where you lose stand and other

280
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,839
parts that be normal um and you may have

281
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,760
to develop a strategy for how to fill in

282
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:16,360
those patches not a good idea to leave

283
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,639
patch is just a

284
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,760
wheat others have plants and spring

285
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:23,240
wheat but you can imagine the challenges

286
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,480
of also harvesting two classes of weed

287
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,720
at the same time and so you know you

288
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,959
kind of have to have a strategy in place

289
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,959
as to how you might handle those patches

290
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:33,920
I think the bag test is really useful

291
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:36,880
for they a little worried about whether

292
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:39,000
they their crop made it or not and it's

293
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,839
as simple as going and getting a few

294
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,360
plants taking the dirt off soil off the

295
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:47,160
plants cutting back the tissue and and

296
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,920
observing any

297
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:53,279
regrowth um this this fall as I

298
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,600
mentioned previously we planted late the

299
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,480
plants got emerging late and so these

300
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,800
small ceilings are very difficult to

301
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,519
evaluate um they're going to take some

302
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,959
while before they'll start to emerge and

303
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,839
Sh green and I think the message here

304
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:10,199
would be we'll probably have to be

305
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:12,120
patient and and see how things get going

306
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:14,639
once we have the snow mes and

307
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:17,399
temperatures uh we don't want to dis up

308
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:21,079
a crop that's that in a week later will

309
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:23,079
show some real uh grein and vigor and I

310
00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:24,720
think their question that might have

311
00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:26,560
coming our way is the Vernal

312
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:31,000
vernalization take place in this late

313
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:33,480
planted material and I think that most

314
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,800
folks that I've talked to would say it's

315
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:39,680
very unusual that we didn't get enough

316
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:42,920
inition and and start the germination

317
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:46,279
process in the fall and maybe even this

318
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:48,880
spring if that's the case we won't we

319
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:51,480
won't have enough accumulated cold

320
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,600
weather to do vernalization so I I don't

321
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,240
think that's going to be as big a

322
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:59,560
concern as whether we actually have an

323
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:02,320
adequate adequate stand in the spring

324
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:05,240
so with that uh I think I'm kind of

325
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,079
probably have time for one question if

326
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,959
somebody wants to ask a question then

327
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:15,120
I'll turn it over

328
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:15,120
to for the uh topic on WE control and

329
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:26,000
identification I can't see any hands up

330
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:26,000
there I think KK turn it

331
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:34,240
over

332
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:36,720
thanks Joel good morning

333
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,920
everybody this work in

334
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,279
here Joel and Blake had asked me to come

335
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:45,240
in and talk a little bit about the wheat

336
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:49,160
control especially the winter annual

337
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:51,399
wheed complex and I had opportunity to

338
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:54,680
stick a few other things in there as

339
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:56,240
well especially towards the end some of

340
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,639
you may have been involved with the

341
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,839
kosher monitoring the sample collection

342
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,800
ctions that we did over the winter and

343
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:07,880
I've got some information there relative

344
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:10,800
to glyphosate as well as the response of

345
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:13,839
the plant samples to floxy

346
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,160
here I think we you know thinking about

347
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:20,399
winter wheat and definitely the winter

348
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:24,360
annual grass complex is causes conations

349
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:26,079
for all kinds of people TR sheet being a

350
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,319
species that we don't see in North

351
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,759
Dakota very often definitely more of a

352
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:33,800
Mont 10 a

353
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:35,720
weed but areas where it is an issue it

354
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,920
definitely

355
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:41,759
is occurs in enough population to where

356
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:44,360
it definitely reduces yield and as you

357
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:47,040
can see the the heads there kind of

358
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:50,440
describe those as a an open football

359
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,800
shape as opposed to Japanese ver be

360
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,720
looking at a little

361
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:57,600
bit relatively little pubescence on the

362
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,600
leaf tissue membranous short membran is

363
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,600
Lial

364
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:07,680
and if we compare that with Japanese bro

365
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:09,959
Japanese bro does have a very short liil

366
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:13,600
it has a very

367
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:16,120
dense mat of hairs along the the sheath

368
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,199
of the leaf as well as airs on Leaf

369
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:21,759
surface itself on the

370
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:23,560
blade still fairly small so it's not

371
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,560
easy it's not like yellow fox tail where

372
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:28,040
you see those very long

373
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:31,600
straggly hairs at the base of the leaf

374
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:34,199
blade but it creates a shroud around the

375
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,639
plants so you can see plants kind of

376
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:39,839
have a Halo up to them or a

377
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:45,360
gall and as you see this in this next

378
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:47,800
slide that dense mat very very heavily

379
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,959
pubescent and the amount of pubescence

380
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:53,480
is related to the temperature regime

381
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:55,800
that it's been exposed to as well as

382
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:59,600
some of the environmental conditions

383
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:02,560
related to moisture so have

384
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:06,640
very densely pubescent you can have

385
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:11,000
fairly sparse pubescent but they tend to

386
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:12,679
be quite long relative to the to

387
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,480
relative to the Downey

388
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:20,839
BR surface and then with the seat head

389
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:24,439
there you can see it's more of a compact

390
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:28,559
football shape the Floric individual

391
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:30,919
seeds do not open up nearly as much as

392
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:34,280
as true

393
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:36,799
sheet but Downey bro is really the the

394
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:39,320
one that causes us all of our problems

395
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:42,600
North Dakota it is more difficult to

396
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:44,760
control with herbicides and is able to

397
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:48,559
germinate and emerge in the

398
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:52,160
spring along with Japanese and easily

399
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:55,440
produ seed talked briefly previously

400
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,960
about vernalization of winter wheat crop

401
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,159
that can have that needs to happen with

402
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,720
these plants as well and and even the

403
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:06,559
cooler spring temperatures at in the

404
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,120
evenings is enough to initiate seed

405
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,919
production for these plants so just

406
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,320
because it emerges late in the spring

407
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:14,320
doesn't necessarily you're going to

408
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:18,039
avoid seed

409
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:21,720
production this also has a dense sheath

410
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:25,159
paars but they're quite a bit shorter

411
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:29,039
and I think the entire field of the

412
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:30,919
plant has a lot more of a velvety touch

413
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,880
Downey brone tends to be a little bit

414
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:36,360
more prone to the purple

415
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:39,039
coloration that's brought on by the C

416
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:41,000
through the winter and you can see dowy

417
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:44,039
bro in

418
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,960
wheat The Tint of purple coloration

419
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:50,440
reddish coloration and then also one of

420
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:53,919
the seeds with the long on that will

421
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:55,760
give the dowy Bro inflorescence a much

422
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:59,080
more feathery appearance as you see on

423
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:02,360
the right as opposed to the tight

424
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:05,919
clusters the football shaped thas of the

425
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,919
Japanese bro seed

426
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,720
fls dowy bro like I said before is

427
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:17,600
definitely more difficult to controll in

428
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:20,760
Japanese brome and when it establishes

429
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,840
in the fall to wait until the spring it

430
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:25,360
can create very difficult control

431
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,200
situations it is controlers tends to be

432
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,080
more metal in the fall the plants are

433
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:33,480
smaller they haven't initiated as many

434
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:38,000
tillers and there's just not as much

435
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:41,799
tissue to try to get controlled with the

436
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,600
herbicide control options before the wi

437
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:46,039
is in the ground of course include

438
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,960
glyphosate which has provided very

439
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:51,880
exceptional control and we do have two

440
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,600
products LI or prepair that are

441
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:57,440
registered before wheat and both of

442
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,840
those can provide some suppression I

443
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,679
would not necessarily

444
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:05,360
expect complete full season

445
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:07,799
control but they will help reduce the

446
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,000
early season competition so that you

447
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:11,720
have smaller plants later on with

448
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,679
postemergence

449
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:18,000
treatment as far as post Emer

450
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:20,720
then if you have clear field wheat

451
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,760
Beyond is definitely a good option and

452
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:26,720
I've also found Olympus power Flex to be

453
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:30,159
very good options for control of these

454
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,159
winter anual PRS

455
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,159
Maverick can provide a very good level

456
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,919
of control however in North Dakota with

457
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:42,480
our high soy we definitely have issues

458
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:46,120
with carryover as there probably not a

459
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,880
lot of Maverick used except for areas

460
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,480
where you know that you're going to be

461
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:54,159
coming back to cereals in The Following

462
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:57,159
season and then Cera for Everest ribf

463
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,840
fire Max do provide good suppression and

464
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:01,400
if the plants are small enough will

465
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:03,360
provide adequate control of Downy broom

466
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,400
and those are strong enough to they

467
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,880
should provide excellent control of the

468
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,880
Japanese

469
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:13,880
broom foxtail barley is another plant

470
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:18,679
that's becoming an issue throughout the

471
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:22,240
state and in the seing stage it is very

472
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:25,400
small very thin leaves also has puesd

473
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:28,120
along the leaf sheath but the leaf

474
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:30,320
blades are a bit narrower and at the

475
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,640
seeding stage is when you really need to

476
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,600
control this because as a perennial once

477
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,840
it truly establishes it is difficult to

478
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,400
control with

479
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:41,520
anything and when we get to that stage

480
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:44,520
for the Post emergence treatments

481
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:47,559
Olympus uh has provided the best

482
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:50,039
activity can kill some of the plants but

483
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:52,679
more there we're just trying to prevent

484
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:54,960
suction for the following seasons and

485
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:57,600
other products tend to be a little bit

486
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:00,000
weaker on it power Flex I haven't had

487
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,400
enough experience to know whether it

488
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,039
controls well or

489
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:07,320
not perley lettuce would be one of the

490
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:09,320
broadleaf winter annuals look like

491
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:13,000
dandelion if you turn the leaf over you

492
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:14,159
have the long row of of spiny growths

493
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,159
off the mid

494
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:19,320
rib prickle lettuce is a composite

495
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:20,880
species it is controlled very

496
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:23,559
effectively

497
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,039
by by many of the growth Regulators but

498
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:28,880
especially poiry type products such as

499
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:32,360
ctail CM o White

500
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:35,840
match horse weed I see

501
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:38,520
my Z fell down below as they moveed from

502
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:41,559
one system to the other but horse weed

503
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:45,159
is comom a larger issue in North Dakota

504
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:47,559
because of the resistance that has

505
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:50,080
developed to glyphosate we have

506
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:52,840
confirmed that in Cass County there are

507
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:55,200
other areas of L more Pierce and

508
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,960
Macintosh for samples have come in where

509
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,240
we suspect there could be some

510
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:02,960
resistance C been tested

511
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:06,440
yet with the without use of glyphosate

512
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:08,360
really on controlling young rosettes

513
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:11,000
plant growth regulators and ALS

514
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:14,320
Inhibitors at those early growth stages

515
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,320
tend to be fairly

516
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:21,960
effective fi Penny Crest we get into the

517
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:26,240
on the mustard side of things recognized

518
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:28,440
by the penny shaped seed pods that

519
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:31,400
enclose the seeds

520
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:34,440
it takes off very early in the spring

521
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:36,840
and ALS Inhibitors are very effective

522
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:39,080
even once this plant starts to Bol

523
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:41,000
another couple of other mustard family

524
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:44,039
Tans and mustard flicks meat and very

525
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,400
finely divided leaves and they're also

526
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:49,200
control at the early rosette stages is

527
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,919
important for control so that it does

528
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,200
not extend to the stage flowers are

529
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,279
being produced you may still be able to

530
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,159
get control with ALS

531
00:23:56,279 --> 00:24:00,760
Inhibitors especially with with

532
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:03,240
combination of a phoxy type herbicide

533
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,559
but control definitely starts to get

534
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:08,240
more

535
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:11,440
limited comparing this with a perennial

536
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,640
this is false chamomile false chamomile

537
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,799
once it is established as a perennial

538
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:18,679
again very difficult to control

539
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:22,039
combinations of ALS products plus a

540
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:24,279
phoxy have done quite well but a lot of

541
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:27,080
the herbicides used in cereals that are

542
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:28,480
based on contact type products will not

543
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,919
be very effective

544
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,919
on this

545
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,640
weed there we see false C meal once it

546
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:39,240
starts to flower you get that typical

547
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,240
daisy flower head on

548
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,480
it the other thing that I wanted to talk

549
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,840
about for a little bit was the kosher

550
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:50,559
monitoring we have several fields that

551
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,679
people sent in samples last year this

552
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,880
was initiated because we had two

553
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:57,440
specific sites one up in Pierce County

554
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,640
and one in the corner of stutzman County

555
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,760
that glyphosate resistance was suspected

556
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:03,799
in

557
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:06,240
2011 through Greenhouse testing we did

558
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:10,120
that both of these locations had very

559
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:13,360
elevated level of resistance where even

560
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:16,200
a gallon more than a gallon of Power Max

561
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:19,279
was not controlling all of the plants

562
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:21,080
and compared with that with 11 ounces

563
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:23,520
that would control every plant in the

564
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,799
susceptible check definitely indicated

565
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,440
that we had a

566
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:31,000
problem the same seed block was

567
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:33,960
we've treated with Clarity and staran

568
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,520
Ultra trying to identify some of the

569
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,039
other control options that might be

570
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:41,360
available for cereals and we were not

571
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:45,840
pleased with the response indicating

572
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:48,760
here definite survival and very vigorous

573
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:51,480
growth after full labeled rates of

574
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:55,000
clarity even in corn or the starting

575
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:59,679
rate the high use rate 5.7 fluid ounces

576
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,679
was not killing all of the plants

577
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,279
so we had several samples coming in from

578
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,440
around the state mostly from the eastern

579
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:09,559
half as you can see on the map here we

580
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:14,200
did have a few Coosa samples coming in

581
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:17,440
from the Far Western I95

582
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:19,320
Corridor and these were seated into two

583
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,360
pots in the greenhouse we had a

584
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:23,799
susceptible check in the upper right

585
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:27,279
hand corner and resistance check in the

586
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:30,520
lower leftand corner and spraying these

587
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:32,760
pot with glyphosate a typical response

588
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:35,159
and more than 50% of the populations

589
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:39,000
were controlled easily with that

590
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:41,360
standard rate of Power Max the Green in

591
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,120
the corner there of course with the or

592
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:46,919
the resistant check from Pierce

593
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:49,080
County but we did have several of the

594
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:52,840
flats that had different amounts of

595
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:56,600
regrowth depending on if it was a 1x

596
00:26:52,840 --> 00:27:00,960
or essentially a 3X

597
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:03,960
rate in some of those pots the control

598
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,760
was almost non-existent we also sprayed

599
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,840
all of the with for ox up here and

600
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:11,360
typical response before Ox appear would

601
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:15,159
not be complete plant death but these

602
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:18,360
plants that are very injured however can

603
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:21,240
start to recover after a couple of weeks

604
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:25,880
and start to produce growth this is a

605
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:28,039
serious concern for our late season weed

606
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,840
management because those plant that

607
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:32,720
remain down to the canopy all season

608
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:35,279
long once you remove the wheat canopy

609
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:38,399
they can start to produce new choots and

610
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:41,600
produce several thousand seeds per plant

611
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:42,919
even after harvest so on the kosa side

612
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:46,080
of things what are some of the other

613
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:48,799
options we do have very effective use of

614
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:51,919
glyphosate or thox appear still in much

615
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:55,279
of the state however we do have thox

616
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:57,720
Pier looking as well as it should from

617
00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:00,480
essentially every area where wece

618
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:02,960
samples in those areas and cereals of

619
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:06,200
course will rely on Buck tril with

620
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:09,200
either peroxyl any kind of

621
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:11,760
verox CAC product seems to be working

622
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,640
quite well yet in other crops where you

623
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:19,000
can use atrazine that has been very

624
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:21,159
effective po Inhibitors the aim is very

625
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,919
effective in crop if the plants again

626
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:27,159
are less than two inches tall sharpen

627
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:30,559
Can Be an Effective pre-plant burndown

628
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:33,159
at it's a moderate use rate however we

629
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:35,519
cannot expect very much soil residual

630
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:38,799
from sharpen for managing kosher into

631
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:40,720
the season essentially it comes down to

632
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:44,919
making sure that you don't have plants

633
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:49,000
there when your crop is established and

634
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:51,200
trying to manage those emerging plants

635
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,600
before they get Beyond about three Ines

636
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,720
in height with with the sweet products

637
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,039
that we have available I know there's a

638
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,080
lot of areas

639
00:28:58,039 --> 00:29:04,000
that are listening are probably no till

640
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:06,000
or minimum till but cold hard steel is

641
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,080
still probably the most effective and

642
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:12,080
reliable oan management tool tool

643
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:14,760
because of the short soil residual of

644
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,799
the seed and the susceptibility of the

645
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:19,880
plants to

646
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:25,799
cultivation I believe that might be the

647
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:25,799
end of my slide set so if you have any

648
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,880
questions you might be able to answer

649
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:34,760
some on issues or other topics that

650
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,760
might be pressing in your

651
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:55,760
mind see a couple on there that I

652
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:58,919
recognize good morning

653
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,880
everybody doesn't look like we have many

654
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:03,960
questions coming in I will be able to

655
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:07,840
stick around for a little while so maybe

656
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:10,279
if you type in questions for me as as

657
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:12,760
Blake is doing some of his discussion

658
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:15,559
then before I have to leave I can still

659
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,559
maybe answer

660
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:23,600
those thanks Joel Kurt and I want to

661
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:26,679
thank NDSU and particularly Scott for uh

662
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,960
helping coordinate uh the webinar and

663
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:32,440
and for all support we've had in in the

664
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:37,000
promotion of it let's

665
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:37,000
see oops I went back up to one didn't

666
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,840
IO start

667
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,430
over

668
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:55,430
[Music]

669
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:02,080
still

670
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:02,080
still

671
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:07,039
oh got be right in

672
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,080
here okay here we go yeah so you can

673
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:12,039
click on the

674
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:14,760
name Arrow just one by one all right

675
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:18,440
thanks let's get started here and try to

676
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:19,960
move uh rather quickly if I can and what

677
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,200
we're going to talk about a little bit

678
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:24,080
this morning is a little bit on nitrogen

679
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,840
management and then some on on disease

680
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,840
management some of the research that

681
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:31,080
we've been doing with NDSU and SDSU and

682
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,639
ourselves if we just look at at that

683
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:34,760
first slide you're you're taking a look

684
00:31:32,639 --> 00:31:38,279
at there The Soil Test Plus the applied

685
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:40,960
in and this is over trials be conducted

686
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:43,240
in North Central Northeast South Dakota

687
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,080
and then through the central range of of

688
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:47,080
North coot all the way from Crosby to to

689
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,799
Jamestown to Allendale kind of on that

690
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,720
kind of a line and probably about 80 to

691
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:53,279
100 miles either side of it and what

692
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,399
you'll see there is you you look at the

693
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:57,960
maximum levels were probably coming

694
00:31:55,399 --> 00:32:02,039
someplace between 180 and 20 120 pounds

695
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:04,639
of total available and uh if you look at

696
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:08,679
at John LC's data from North East North

697
00:32:04,639 --> 00:32:10,360
Dakota you'll see that from 2009 to 2011

698
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:12,279
since John has started working on winter

699
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:14,840
week you'll see it probably pretty close

700
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:18,080
to that same amount of nitrogen uh maybe

701
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:19,440
slightly higher on on the top end uh the

702
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:22,159
one thing that was was kind of

703
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,880
interesting and when we added the 2012

704
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:28,159
data into the DU sites we added another

705
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:30,120
five locations and you'll that that

706
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,360
bottom line is is shifted a little bit

707
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:34,679
to the left to a little bit less

708
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:36,600
nitrogen and the reason for that we

709
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:39,039
believe is if you remember the winter

710
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:41,679
was open we were warm most of the winter

711
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:43,919
and then March was about 15 degrees

712
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:45,519
noral and we think there was probably

713
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:48,200
quite a bit of extra conversion going on

714
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:50,600
in the soils from the organic matter and

715
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:53,039
so we had actually two sites that

716
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:55,039
responded to end additional end we had

717
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:57,159
two sites that that showed no response

718
00:32:55,039 --> 00:33:00,559
to additional end once we got to that

719
00:32:57,159 --> 00:33:02,039
per 60 Bush yeld goal plane and then we

720
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:04,480
had one site

721
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:06,559
where actually every level of end that

722
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,000
we added decreased yield further and

723
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:10,519
that was due to the fact that the

724
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,279
additional end caused lodging so the

725
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:14,799
more end we put on the more lodging we

726
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:17,200
had and the lower the yields became with

727
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:19,399
that nitrogen and we we knew that to be

728
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,159
the case uh through Farm experience and

729
00:33:19,399 --> 00:33:22,679
and past yield experiences but in

730
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:24,440
actually now in the 13 years we've been

731
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:25,960
doing these trials this is the first

732
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:30,399
year we've been able to document it in

733
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:32,519
trial setting and so that that does

734
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:35,240
happen so if we look at the amount of

735
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:37,720
nitrogen talking with Ron gelderman

736
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:41,399
South Dakota State SDSU is still at 2

737
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:43,880
and a half pounds NDSU is is at still at

738
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:46,200
2 and a half pounds per bushel axal

739
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:48,639
nitrogen and uh they're working on new

740
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:51,679
wrecks some data that we've been using

741
00:33:48,639 --> 00:33:54,120
in our DU studies from ARS that was

742
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:57,120
conducted for a long period of time

743
00:33:54,120 --> 00:34:00,600
winter weat at Mandan North cord at

744
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:03,279
Sydney Montana was was 2.25 pounds of M

745
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,960
for bushel for 12% protein we're pretty

746
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:07,200
comfortable with that we think at some

747
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,639
point in time hopefully with more data

748
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,000
we'll actually be able to reduce that

749
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,240
number further and I think as some of

750
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,240
these new breeding programs and

751
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:16,919
techniques come online now you'll start

752
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:18,359
to see groups focus on greater

753
00:34:16,919 --> 00:34:20,720
efficiency with nitrogen as well in

754
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:22,679
these new Vari one thing I just wanted

755
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:25,079
to point out I I showed this slide last

756
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:26,560
year is that we just need to remember

757
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:29,079
and working with our producers or if you

758
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,879
are prod producer is that winter wheat

759
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:34,320
has a higher yield potential than the

760
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:37,040
spring seated Wheats by 20 to 30% so you

761
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,679
need to take that into account when you

762
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,359
design your nitrogen programs for this

763
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:43,720
spring or if you've already done it last

764
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:46,359
fall uh the other thing that remember in

765
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:48,000
that is I think winter week probably can

766
00:34:46,359 --> 00:34:50,440
get by with that quarter pound less per

767
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,200
Bushell than than the spring grains can

768
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:54,000
so you do gain some efficiencies there

769
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,359
but probably not enough to make up the

770
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,879
fact that you need to add more into to

771
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,879
your wi week to attain those yields

772
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,839
uh one thing is is we talked about the

773
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:07,240
maximum end needed for for maximum yield

774
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:08,440
to be in that 180 to 220 230 range

775
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:10,960
obviously

776
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:13,000
economics play an impact on that and

777
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,640
what that Final End rate will actually

778
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,920
be and you can see on this slide I'm

779
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:19,520
going to see if I can make this point at

780
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:22,240
work over on the left side you've got

781
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,839
four and and $6 wheat so you got two

782
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,839
sets of lines obviously if you got

783
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:29,640
higher priced wheat you can afford to

784
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:31,560
put more nitrogen on on uh on the crop

785
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:33,920
the other thing that you've got is is if

786
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:36,079
you look on the the far right you've got

787
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:39,040
50 Cent In which is the blue lines and

788
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:41,640
the 75 cent which is the green lines

789
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:44,599
with the $6 we so the cost van is going

790
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:48,520
to impact where those where that line is

791
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:51,440
at the other issue that you have is the

792
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:54,079
in protein discounts or notebook or and

793
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,800
and no protein discounts obviously if

794
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,960
you're you're looking at the where

795
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:00,599
there's there's no discount on the

796
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:02,880
protein on the top or the blue we reach

797
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:05,119
our maximum end level at an earlier

798
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,640
stage but if you have

799
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:10,480
discounts you you'll notice then that

800
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:13,440
that you actually need more nitrogen to

801
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:15,280
to reach your uh top net profit

802
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,920
potential for the winter week so you can

803
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:20,160
take a look at this slide more and and

804
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,520
as we uh will post these our websites at

805
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:25,560
NDSU and and du and study these a little

806
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,640
bit but uh they're they're kind of

807
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:30,800
interesting and someday hope we can can

808
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:33,319
develop a a table that will allow us to

809
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,079
plug in the discounts plug in the the

810
00:36:33,319 --> 00:36:37,240
cost of the nitrogen the cost and the

811
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:39,000
price of the wheed and and be able to

812
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:40,280
predict more closely the amount end that

813
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,839
we should probably be looking at on a

814
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:45,280
given

815
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:48,280
year if we look at placement uh Steve

816
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:50,480
pulled together some data for me uh from

817
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,880
our last two years of of end trials that

818
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,400
incorporate timing as well and you'll

819
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,599
note that there's really no difference

820
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,359
in yield from the seating time

821
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:02,520
application will replace the end B of

822
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:06,240
the soil surface to the the surface

823
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:07,520
applications of 28% with stream bars and

824
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,440
so if you look at it which would be

825
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,839
breaking dormy and then we've got the

826
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:14,800
combination of seating plus which is the

827
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:17,680
Ura down uh below the surface at seating

828
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,440
times long with the early stream bar and

829
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,560
then the last one is the seating with

830
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,000
the late stream bar you can see there's

831
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,800
there's less than a bushel difference in

832
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,400
those over the 2-year period and this

833
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,760
follows a very similar pattern to the

834
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,720
number that we generated from 04 to

835
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,880
through 07 in North and South coota in

836
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,880
our

837
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:39,119
Tri if we look at the proteins this

838
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,359
pattern of the last two years in our end

839
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:43,200
trials follows that that same time span

840
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:48,520
in North and South Dakota when we did 04

841
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:48,520
to8 but that that ball seating

842
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:53,119
application actually uh does have a

843
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,560
tendency to have a little less protein

844
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:57,599
than than the spring applic and it

845
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:00,160
generally runs anywhere from 3/10 all

846
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,480
the way up to 6/10 less uh than the

847
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,880
spring

848
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:05,640
applications and I I think that that

849
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:07,480
graph basically tells you to that the

850
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:11,040
more n you put on the later you put it

851
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:11,040
on the higher the protein levels will

852
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,880
be just uh one site this year where we

853
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,079
we did see response to the full rate of

854
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:21,400
nitrogen rates was at Crosby North

855
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:23,160
Dakota and we had application versus

856
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,400
spring application and then nitrogen

857
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:27,000
rates as well but if you look at

858
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:29,040
treatments in two three and four on the

859
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,880
left those were Ura out seating time

860
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:35,079
placed in a deep band and then N5 six

861
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:39,119
and seven were stream bars uh N2 was a

862
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:42,560
60 bushel yield goal rate three was 85

863
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:44,800
and four was 110 and five six and seven

864
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:47,119
were corresponding to one thing you'll

865
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:50,280
note was that there was

866
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:52,119
probably slightly higher yield to the

867
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:54,079
fall application with the Ura when you

868
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:57,520
average those three at

869
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:59,720
91.5 versus the the stream bar in at

870
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,880
89.5 statistically obviously not

871
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:03,760
different but we were noticing that

872
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,400
pretty consistently this year we think

873
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,640
that was probably due to the fact that

874
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:10,160
we had the urita placed below ground we

875
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:12,160
we did not have we did have excess

876
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,599
moisture obviously following seating and

877
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:17,119
and during the course of this growing

878
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:18,520
season and where we looked at the uan

879
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:20,839
sometimes the rainfall didn't come

880
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:22,480
following the uan application for

881
00:39:20,839 --> 00:39:24,760
anywhere from two to four weeks

882
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:27,119
following U applications so there was

883
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:30,079
some delay in in availability of the the

884
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:32,319
U and if you look at the proteins on the

885
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:34,760
right hand side you'll note that with

886
00:39:32,319 --> 00:39:37,760
the ining fertilizer rates within the

887
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:40,200
n234 and then within the n56 7 you'll

888
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:42,599
see increasing levels of protein which

889
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:44,599
you would expect the other thing again

890
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:47,839
just showing the protein on the right

891
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:51,119
the average of 11.6% for the Ura in the

892
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:52,720
ball versus the 12.2% for the uan in the

893
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:55,160
spring just pointing out to the fact

894
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:58,800
that some spring nitrogen has the

895
00:39:55,160 --> 00:40:02,079
ability to increase your protein LS for

896
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:04,119
you then looking at at our watery stage

897
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:07,359
nitrogen application in other words

898
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:09,040
applying 10 gallons of 28% with 10

899
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:11,119
gallons of water for a total of 20

900
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:13,160
gallons per Acer with a with a flat fan

901
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:15,800
nozzle uh trying to increase your

902
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:18,280
proteins right after flow but before the

903
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:20,960
kernel leaves that watery stage and

904
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:22,240
hasn't re reached the milk stage but if

905
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,000
you look at the

906
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:28,920
yields of the uh let me get the pointer

907
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:31,599
here comparing the the watery stage and

908
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:34,000
versus the no watery stage and you can

909
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:36,319
see that the yields were identical in

910
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,160
some cases depending on how the

911
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:40,240
applications go some people do worry

912
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,160
about the water stage application

913
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,640
reducing yields due to Leaf burn but we

914
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,920
did not have any issue with that the

915
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:48,440
last two years if you look at the at the

916
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:51,440
apprach levels on the right side you'll

917
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:53,200
note that for the 60 Bush yield goal

918
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,400
when you increase those nitrogen levels

919
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,720
for the 85 Bush we increase the amount

920
00:40:55,400 --> 00:41:00,160
of protein from 12.1 to

921
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:03,040
13.1 and uh you can see that that

922
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:05,560
similar Trend under the no watery stage

923
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:08,000
uh nitrogen applications or excuse me

924
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:09,319
with no actual application at the

925
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,520
lottery stage you can see that the

926
00:41:09,319 --> 00:41:13,680
increased levels of an increas the

927
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,720
protein but I think the important thing

928
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:18,560
here is if you look at the the yellow

929
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:21,880
shaded area in the bottom the watery

930
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:24,680
stage application gave 12.8% potation

931
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:27,400
versus none at 11.7 for the average so

932
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:30,040
we picked almost a full point of protein

933
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:33,800
up this year from that application last

934
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:33,800
year those numbers were at about a half

935
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,359
percent we look at some some information

936
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:44,040
that Ron gelderman shared with us in

937
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:46,960
December and want to thank Ron for these

938
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:48,720
Ron had done some trials with ESN on Ura

939
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,839
and its influence on on winter week

940
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,240
yield the thing that that I want to

941
00:41:50,839 --> 00:41:54,520
point out as you'll notice these are two

942
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:56,520
locations Fort pier and wall and you can

943
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:59,920
see there are some tremendous yields at

944
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:01,960
at Pier and 102 with the fall

945
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,960
application of your in 107 with the

946
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:05,400
spring application of your in the thing

947
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:08,839
that you'll notice though is he added

948
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:10,880
the ESN they were both 102 and with that

949
00:42:08,839 --> 00:42:12,520
spring application he lost about five

950
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,160
bushels and you'll see that he lost

951
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:18,599
eight bush with a spring application uh

952
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:23,200
at wall and my guess is is that this was

953
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:24,920
100% ESN treated Ura that that ESN that

954
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:28,400
Ura to a point where it didn't benefit

955
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:30,559
yield then you noticed in in the next

956
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,240
slide that you'll see that the the

957
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:34,280
protein levels actually increased a

958
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:36,960
little bit and that would probably fit

959
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:38,800
that reasoning then is that the ESN held

960
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:41,079
that that nitrogen so if you're going to

961
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,720
use ESN with your winter weat uh

962
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:44,559
application just remember winter week

963
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,839
needs that nitrogen early you're

964
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:49,119
probably definitely not going to want to

965
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:52,680
put 100% youra spread out there in the

966
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:52,680
spring of the year on your winter

967
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:59,520
we we look at this this next slide

968
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:02,319
looking at aggain this was some work

969
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:05,280
that John lukach has done uh up in

970
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:10,079
Northeast North Dakota he actually had

971
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:11,559
six sites in in 2010 and 2011 and I I

972
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:14,599
dropped the one site I was a little

973
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:17,400
uncomfortable with with the gray the the

974
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:18,839
URI agotan was had had dropped its yield

975
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,680
pretty substantially I think it's one of

976
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:23,440
those outlier type situations uh but at

977
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:25,319
any rate you can you can take a look at

978
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,599
the yields at the various locations for

979
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:29,240
10 and 11

980
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:32,000
and you know in in several cases there's

981
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:33,880
no difference in yield but in two or

982
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,880
three cases there are some some

983
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:37,480
differences in yield and if you look at

984
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:40,720
the averages on the far right you can

985
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:44,000
see the Ura was was basically 80 buels

986
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:46,480
the Ura plus agane was 83.8 or about 84

987
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,280
and then the ammonium nitrate is not to

988
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,079
have any volatility because it's it's

989
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:53,119
100% nitrate had

990
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:56,359
83.3 so it's kind of a check to to the

991
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:58,359
agrian um as John says it's not meant to

992
00:43:56,359 --> 00:44:00,160
work every year because you hope you're

993
00:43:58,359 --> 00:44:01,880
going to get rain that Ura on the

994
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:04,040
surface and it's going to take it in and

995
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:07,000
I agree with John so it's in those

996
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:08,800
circumstances where maybe like in 2012

997
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,960
we apped the Ura early we had an early

998
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:13,520
spring we didn't get any rainfall for

999
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:16,079
two to four weeks so you'd hope expect

1000
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:18,319
to see a response I know on some of the

1001
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:21,359
trials that we did in 2012 we did not

1002
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:22,760
see a response uh to the agine and again

1003
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:25,640
I think it went back to the fact that we

1004
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:28,800
were getting sub of organic matter uh

1005
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:29,839
that we uh it wasn't an issue I think

1006
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,960
this is probably the most important

1007
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:33,680
thing I'm going to show in my portion of

1008
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:36,559
the slides today Joel talked about

1009
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:38,720
stands and stage of winter week and if

1010
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:40,960
you look at the the top leftand

1011
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:43,319
picture uh you'll notice that the

1012
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:45,160
development here is is from below the

1013
00:44:43,319 --> 00:44:47,880
soul surface all the way up to one Le

1014
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:50,680
stage and this was actually in the1 at

1015
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:52,440
our Min not location at Windfield and

1016
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:54,280
then if you look at the bottom slide on

1017
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:57,440
on the right this was actually a little

1018
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:59,920
foul strip plot area that that hadn't

1019
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:01,240
been seated the prior year we seated

1020
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,480
right through those areas you can see we

1021
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:05,760
had two and a half Lea whe there versus

1022
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:07,960
the stage that we had one of the things

1023
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:11,720
that we tell Growers is our goal is is

1024
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:14,040
to have approximately 50 to 70 in per

1025
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:17,240
square foot when we come to that Harvest

1026
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:20,000
stage now obviously if if we're seating

1027
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:22,000
and we're seating at rates of 25 to 35

1028
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,800
plants per square foot we're going to

1029
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,119
need to make up some time here so we're

1030
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,839
going to need to want to encourage some

1031
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:29,559
King and so we're going to want to

1032
00:45:26,839 --> 00:45:31,599
probably put some nitrogen on early uh

1033
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:34,800
to enhance

1034
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:36,920
that the chillery prospect so if you

1035
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,400
look at the the two pitchers in the two

1036
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:40,240
corners we got good Viger on the field

1037
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:43,000
on the left but we got very poor Vigor

1038
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,559
on the field on the right and what you

1039
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,800
want to do is just as soon as you can

1040
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:48,920
traffic that field once the frost is out

1041
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:52,920
you probably to get 15 to 25 pounds of

1042
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:54,319
an on some point Ura or or 28% or

1043
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:56,000
whatever form you can get it on and

1044
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:58,160
hopefully get some rain and help

1045
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,119
stimulate the

1046
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,960
children just thing I'm going to cover

1047
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:04,000
now is just a little bit on on disease

1048
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:06,119
management and mainly it's on on funas

1049
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,559
site timing applications and and on

1050
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:11,359
response in 2012 we saw the least

1051
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:14,079
response we've seen in the past three to

1052
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:16,119
four possibly five years uh to fungicide

1053
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:19,359
application as you recall it was dry

1054
00:46:16,119 --> 00:46:21,200
early so can spot wasn't a big issue and

1055
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:23,520
scab was not a big issue we did have

1056
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:26,119
some stripe rust in some locations in

1057
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:28,720
the Eastern Dakota uh but you can see

1058
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:30,079
that in our 2012 variety trials which

1059
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:32,520
are scattered across North and South

1060
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:34,559
Dakota we had a 3.8 Bush response across

1061
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:36,520
all varieties that obviously varied from

1062
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:39,960
location to location and from variety to

1063
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:43,359
variety with about a 5% return increase

1064
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:46,280
in yield I should say we looked at 2009

1065
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:50,839
it was a 10.2 bushel response and about

1066
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:53,400
15% increase in yield uh 2010 was a 14.2

1067
00:46:50,839 --> 00:46:57,160
bushel with about a 20%

1068
00:46:53,400 --> 00:47:00,480
response and 2011 was was a 12.9 or 13

1069
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:02,800
bushel with about a 24%

1070
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:04,760
increase and and so we look at that

1071
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,920
average across all those years with 12

1072
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:10,520
included it's been about a 10 bushel

1073
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:13,119
response with about a 15% increase

1074
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:14,520
in John gas and data I'm not going to go

1075
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:16,680
through this slide but I just wanted to

1076
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:18,760
show it to you and you can go back to

1077
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:20,960
again to the websites and dig into this

1078
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:24,280
if you want but this is John's data from

1079
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:27,319
Northeast North Dakota from 9 10 11 and

1080
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:29,839
12 and from that data these next three

1081
00:47:27,319 --> 00:47:32,720
or four slides are summarized from that

1082
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:36,119
data but if you look at at the sites

1083
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:38,520
there was 22 experiments that contained

1084
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:40,800
the pasaro application at early flower

1085
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:42,880
in the sto with the herbicide and then

1086
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:46,000
the pasaro at at the early plow and then

1087
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:48,920
the check and you can see that in in

1088
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,520
those years in Northeast North Dakota uh

1089
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:53,880
he's getting most of this benefit from

1090
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:55,760
the pasaro application at the year CL so

1091
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:58,040
in three out of 22 experiment

1092
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:00,040
experiments as indicated below he had a

1093
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:03,839
five Bush greater yield increase the

1094
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:05,319
trip herbicide time with the fungicide

1095
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:07,599
so if you look at the next one you you

1096
00:48:05,319 --> 00:48:10,079
broke that further apart and he's

1097
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:12,079
indicating that in five out of 14

1098
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:13,800
experiments uh there was a five Bush or

1099
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:17,520
greater yield increase due to the flag

1100
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:20,480
Le Fungicide and then in 12 out of 14

1101
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:23,960
experiments it was due to the early FL

1102
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:27,359
fungicides so for John in that area uh

1103
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:29,200
that is pretty evidence that that

1104
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:31,280
application at that early flower stage

1105
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:32,520
is really important then he went on to

1106
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:34,280
further break out a few other

1107
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:37,040
comparisons and indicating that in four

1108
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:39,040
out of 10 experiments bisaro treatments

1109
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:41,079
yielded five bushels or more than the

1110
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,480
fure treatments I think many of you

1111
00:48:41,079 --> 00:48:44,559
probably remember Marsh McMullen the

1112
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:47,200
NDSU plant pathologist that retired last

1113
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:49,680
year always indicating that she felt

1114
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:51,480
that the parar will P for the difference

1115
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:54,040
and cost between that and the FK here

1116
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:56,640
and the generics and John's data here is

1117
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:58,559
indicating the same now if you look at

1118
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:01,240
the next statement in seven out of 10

1119
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:02,480
years poer increased yield by five

1120
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:04,960
bushels are greater over the no

1121
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:07,000
fungicide treatment and in the case ofar

1122
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:09,640
it was eight out of 10 experiments in

1123
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,760
that particular series I think if if you

1124
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:14,720
look further south say South of Highway

1125
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:17,640
2 and west of Highway uh there you'll

1126
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:18,960
see those early herbicide treatments or

1127
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:21,040
the combination of the herbicide and

1128
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:23,680
fungicide pay more than they do in

1129
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:25,839
John's area because handspot is a bigger

1130
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:27,640
issue as you move into to a different

1131
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:30,839
climate compared to what John has up in

1132
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:30,839
the north east corner of

1133
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:36,599
nor uh just in closing to open it up for

1134
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:38,680
questions uh we're thinking about

1135
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:40,559
conducting a webinar in July or August

1136
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:41,760
again uh to talk about a number of

1137
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:44,119
different things but to prepare

1138
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,640
proceeding in the fall U some of the

1139
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:47,520
stuff we'd like to probably share then

1140
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:50,240
is we're getting quite a bit of new data

1141
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:52,359
with with starter trial research with p

1142
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:54,520
and potassium chloride and sulfur and so

1143
00:49:52,359 --> 00:49:57,319
we're going to share some of

1144
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:58,960
that

1145
00:49:57,319 --> 00:50:00,720
also want to share some information on

1146
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,680
some of the noil rotations that are

1147
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:05,119
going on around around the country this

1148
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:07,799
is just a slide from the ccsp farm that

1149
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:09,240
is kind of jointly LED between rers and

1150
00:50:07,799 --> 00:50:11,280
Northeast South Dakota and Southeast

1151
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:14,440
North Dakota and what you have there is

1152
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:16,400
a blue lines is the yield for corn you a

1153
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:19,480
corn corn rotation where the corn is

1154
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:21,520
stripped till uh the second bar the rose

1155
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:23,599
colored bar is is a wheat wheat a spring

1156
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:26,240
wheat winter wheat and then corn

1157
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:29,640
following that and if a strict no till

1158
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:32,079
set til and then the third one the elar

1159
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:35,079
is is a spring wheat winter wheat and

1160
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:36,599
then corn but the winter weed is strip

1161
00:50:35,079 --> 00:50:38,520
tilled and fall and then the corns

1162
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:41,359
planted into that and then it's a

1163
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:42,760
soybean corn rotation where the soybean

1164
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:44,599
ground of strip till and the corn is

1165
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:46,119
planted into that and you'll just notice

1166
00:50:44,599 --> 00:50:48,920
the fouryear average I did not include

1167
00:50:46,119 --> 00:50:51,720
2011 because of hail uh but you'll note

1168
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:53,920
that that the uh the strip Heat and the

1169
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:55,240
soybean strip till are both very

1170
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,760
competitive one another over the long

1171
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:59,480
term term and you'll note that the corn

1172
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:02,520
on corn even using the strip till uh

1173
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:03,880
cannot compete with those two and then

1174
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:06,720
the other thing you should point out is

1175
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:08,240
actually in 12 and 08 you'll note that

1176
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:10,680
the corn has done a little better in one

1177
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:12,599
year and then that the the noil wheat

1178
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,839
without the strip actually done the best

1179
00:51:12,599 --> 00:51:15,440
and that's when we're in a drier

1180
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:17,319
environment and warmer environment in

1181
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,680
those and I think the one thing we

1182
00:51:17,319 --> 00:51:20,720
should remember is we've been in quite a

1183
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:21,960
period of wet years and I'm just kind of

1184
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:24,720
wondering if we're not transitioning

1185
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:25,920
back to drier climate and if we do uh

1186
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,599
some of the things and some of the

1187
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,599
practices that we look like we may need

1188
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:32,200
to go back and evaluate where we're at

1189
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:33,520
prior to this web period so those are

1190
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:35,040
some of the things we'd like to probably

1191
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,880
take a look at the next webinar some of

1192
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,200
the rotation impacts on economics and

1193
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:41,040
some of the things dealing with

1194
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:43,559
rotations on leader

1195
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:46,640
resistance I'm going to quit with that

1196
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:46,640
and we're going to open it up to

1197
00:51:50,359 --> 00:51:54,680
questions well we're waiting for some

1198
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:57,400
questions again I just remind you that

1199
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:59,520
um we'll be uh posting these to the

1200
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:01,119
websites and if the South Dakota state

1201
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,640
folks like us to ship it to them and

1202
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:05,200
have them posted on their website we can

1203
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:06,680
do that as well number of the pieces of

1204
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:09,400
data that that we used in our trial

1205
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:11,400
things are from South Dakota um the

1206
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:13,119
other thing what we did also indicate

1207
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:16,839
that we were going to give out a little

1208
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:19,920
prize and uh Joel picked out a number

1209
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:22,319
for us and uh then Scott figured out who

1210
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:24,319
who the login was and it was Sue raisin

1211
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:26,440
and I believe Sue is the writer for the

1212
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:30,960
farm and ranch guy bismar so Su will be

1213
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:30,960
getting you to that little GI later

1214
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:44,359
on okay I see there's a a comment there

1215
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:46,160
about that there's less than 10% of the

1216
00:52:44,359 --> 00:52:49,200
winter weed in our area has emerged what

1217
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:53,359
are the hopes for a decent

1218
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:53,359
CR we can Joel and I both

1219
00:52:54,240 --> 00:53:01,200
respond yeah that that really is a a

1220
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:03,440
point of concern

1221
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:06,280
um because we really don't know what the

1222
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:08,319
status of that seed is I mean it it's

1223
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:10,440
quite possible that it imbibed and

1224
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:12,760
started the germination process and that

1225
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:15,720
process will continue as we get into the

1226
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:17,760
spring and uh that seed will obviously

1227
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:19,680
have bur so that's not a critical issue

1228
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:21,400
it's just kind of how much Vigor and how

1229
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:24,280
much stand we're going to likely get

1230
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:26,839
from a a crop that really just started

1231
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:28,520
the process of germination in the fall

1232
00:53:26,839 --> 00:53:30,040
so that would be one scenario I guess we

1233
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:32,000
could have a scenario where those seats

1234
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:35,480
sit there dry and never did germinate

1235
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,839
they'll germinate in the spring and uh

1236
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:40,280
and then you know I guess in a worst

1237
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:42,240
case scenario they'll they'll act like a

1238
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:44,720
winter wheat crup was planted in Spring

1239
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:49,200
and will not have been vernalized

1240
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:52,400
but my my sense would be that in most

1241
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:55,480
locations we probably had enough uh

1242
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:58,559
moisture to get this germination uh

1243
00:53:55,480 --> 00:54:00,559
process started and that we'll have to

1244
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:03,520
keep a close eye on the fields as we

1245
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:05,640
come into spring and to see if they're

1246
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:07,559
survived you know that's one strike

1247
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:10,960
against them being lady

1248
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:13,559
mergers um in small plants in the

1249
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:16,960
fall and

1250
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:18,400
um and hopefully that they'll we'll have

1251
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:20,000
the kind of weather that will allow

1252
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:22,160
those things to express themselves and

1253
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,359
get out of the ground before it gets too

1254
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:26,920
late in the season to where we have to

1255
00:54:24,359 --> 00:54:29,480
make some kind of determination for

1256
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:33,040
determining the crop and plant something

1257
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:36,240
but I think generally we would say that

1258
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:39,200
that it's not a hopel situation that uh

1259
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:41,359
that uh often we have success when

1260
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:44,400
fields we planning the fall really

1261
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:46,680
didn't emerge completely in the fall but

1262
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:49,520
we're able to get a start and and then

1263
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:49,520
develop into the

1264
00:54:52,599 --> 00:54:57,520
spring I just com I've been working with

1265
00:54:55,280 --> 00:55:00,480
winter weat since 1977 and you know it

1266
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:02,520
seems like one location every year

1267
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:05,000
either with research or with my actual

1268
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:07,760
Fields Farm as well was

1269
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:10,520
that we would have a location someplace

1270
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:13,240
where witer we either was underneath the

1271
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:15,640
so surface or slightly above the soil

1272
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:18,440
surface um but so much of the WEA it

1273
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:20,200
makes it or not depend on obviously over

1274
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:22,480
winter but this period we're in right

1275
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:25,079
now if we can get some moisture to Reet

1276
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:27,440
that surface if the crown is still alive

1277
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:29,520
anyway uh there's still a very good

1278
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:31,400
chance that this crop will make it I

1279
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:32,319
think we've only lost one research plot

1280
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:35,480
since

1281
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:37,160
1999 uh due to poor emergence and we've

1282
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:39,319
had quite a few of them that were either

1283
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:42,039
below the Sol surface or half Leaf to

1284
00:55:39,319 --> 00:55:43,960
Leaf stage of grow uh don't be

1285
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:45,359
completely discouraged by it I guess the

1286
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:49,319
other thing I'd encourage you to

1287
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:51,280
consider is the fact that if you're dry

1288
00:55:49,319 --> 00:55:53,240
and you take this crop out what crop are

1289
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,599
you going to plant and what crop is that

1290
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:57,119
crop going to have any better chance of

1291
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:58,319
making so I I'd encourage you

1292
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:00,280
particularly in those areas where you

1293
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:01,640
don't have any subsoil moisture to give

1294
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:04,160
this crop a little bit of time before

1295
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:04,160
you get too

1296
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:19,039
anxious

1297
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:21,119
okay okay I just want to one comment if

1298
00:56:19,039 --> 00:56:24,440
if you're seeing mold uh on the plants

1299
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:26,119
is probably dead so that is generally a

1300
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:29,720
pretty good sign that that plant has

1301
00:56:26,119 --> 00:56:29,720
sued what was the next

1302
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:44,599
question 32 degrees start toow yeah Joel

1303
00:56:40,119 --> 00:56:47,440
says 32 degrees so in end I agree with

1304
00:56:44,599 --> 00:56:49,119
that as far as vernalization I'm not

1305
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:51,640
worried about vernalization at all if

1306
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:53,079
you've had that seed in the ground my

1307
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:56,240
guess says there's been enough moisture

1308
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:57,640
went for that seed to swell and that uh

1309
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:59,319
that's all it takes then once then it

1310
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:02,359
gets cold again then the vernalization

1311
00:56:59,319 --> 00:57:08,200
process is is taken play care

1312
00:57:02,359 --> 00:57:08,200
of responded to you were talking before

1313
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,319
there yeah and that be the next

1314
00:57:16,119 --> 00:57:21,520
question and as far as how long is it

1315
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:23,680
the temperature required to to be cold

1316
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:26,440
again Joel I can't remember what that

1317
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:29,000
time period is you know it's it's

1318
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:32,039
probably about a 30-day

1319
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:34,720
period yeah Joel saying it's about a

1320
00:57:32,039 --> 00:57:36,760
30-day period that you need for that

1321
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:39,359
cold one of the things that you can do

1322
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:42,400
is if you go to our website or the DU

1323
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:45,319
Canada website or this is just catch one

1324
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:47,240
there's a Dr fer has winter Cals manual

1325
00:57:45,319 --> 00:57:49,920
there and there's a really good section

1326
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:52,119
on cold and vernalization and I would

1327
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:53,799
guess that NDSU and SDSU probably have

1328
00:57:52,119 --> 00:57:56,240
that in their materials as well

1329
00:57:53,799 --> 00:58:00,480
someplace

1330
00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:00,480
and just bear in mind it doesn't have

1331
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:06,440
crazy yeah and Joel pointed out and and

1332
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:08,720
that's true that it doesn't have to be

1333
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:12,520
below freezing for the vernalization to

1334
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:12,520
occur it's just temperature

1335
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:28,520
Circle ser and then Becky actually

1336
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:30,880
answer Aon answered okay so then just

1337
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:32,480
okay next question from Evan is when we

1338
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,920
planted into broken

1339
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:38,680
CRP and am most concerned with the

1340
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:42,559
volunteer Gras mostly Timothy what

1341
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:42,559
herbicides would you recommend

1342
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:47,460
[Laughter]

1343
00:58:49,039 --> 00:58:52,160
Jo I

1344
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:58,839
think yeah I think unless it's one of

1345
00:58:55,640 --> 00:59:01,480
those winter annuals generally the

1346
00:58:58,839 --> 00:59:04,319
normal you know grass wheat control will

1347
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:05,640
take out most of grass just want to get

1348
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:07,359
good

1349
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:10,839
timing

1350
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:12,440
start goals goal's response is you know

1351
00:59:10,839 --> 00:59:14,760
if it's it's your Ann your winter

1352
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:18,079
annuals or your your annual grasses you

1353
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:20,480
know we've got some tools to select from

1354
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:22,559
with if pral which I think Timothy is

1355
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:26,240
and I'm not familiar with with control

1356
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:28,960
on on Timothy uh but my guess is is is

1357
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:31,599
you probably don't have much choice in

1358
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:33,599
terms of that control but I tell you

1359
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:36,599
what if you want to go to our website

1360
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:38,799
and drop me an email Evan uh I'll do

1361
00:59:36,599 --> 00:59:41,119
some research on that and and try to get

1362
00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:41,119
back to

1363
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:48,760
you okay we think we may have missed a

1364
00:59:47,559 --> 00:59:50,880
question here I'll get to the ice

1365
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:52,960
question here in a couple seconds I

1366
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:57,079
can't remember now was that the first

1367
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:59,119
one you went to yep what about that okay

1368
00:59:57,079 --> 01:00:02,960
no that was the first

1369
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:06,000
one and there's the okay where we at so

1370
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:09,400
ice okay ice can have a very detrimental

1371
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:13,559
effect on win uh particularly as we we

1372
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:16,799
get closer to uh breaking dormy is that

1373
01:00:13,559 --> 01:00:19,280
plant is is needing more oxygen but uh

1374
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:21,480
if you get get a layer of solid ice over

1375
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:24,319
top of that plant and it stays there for

1376
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:25,319
probably four to seven days uh it can

1377
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:26,240
actually

1378
01:00:25,319 --> 01:00:29,480
cause

1379
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:32,839
desiccation and and the most the worst

1380
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:34,079
situation would be is that surface is is

1381
01:00:32,839 --> 01:00:36,039
probably a little dry and you get some

1382
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:38,200
melting going on and then you get a

1383
01:00:36,039 --> 01:00:39,880
solid layer of of water around that

1384
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:42,920
crown and all the way to the surface of

1385
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:45,760
the soil and that that it becomes

1386
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:47,400
probably the most desal children yeah so

1387
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:48,880
it's it's not what you call typical

1388
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:50,520
winter kill this would be ice en

1389
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:52,200
casement it's very deadly there's

1390
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:54,160
nothing you can do about it I mean it

1391
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:56,640
it'll doesn't take long to kill the

1392
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:58,640
plant but that common except in your low

1393
01:00:56,640 --> 01:01:01,440
spots typically that you would have your

1394
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:04,520
whole field covered with ice but it's

1395
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:08,359
yeah it's anytime from now

1396
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:13,480
until uh things get too big to be iced

1397
01:01:08,359 --> 01:01:16,559
up uh ice encasement can be a real uh

1398
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:18,480
lethal kind of scenario one of one of

1399
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:22,359
the things we've experienced is is that

1400
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:24,839
if the ground is warm underneath the ice

1401
01:01:22,359 --> 01:01:26,240
layer that ice can actually will

1402
01:01:24,839 --> 01:01:29,240
actually granu particularly if you've

1403
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:31,400
got a snow layer above the ice and uh

1404
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:32,480
sometimes it it will gruiz fast enough

1405
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:34,000
that that there'll still be enough

1406
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:36,440
oxygen movement or if you've got stubble

1407
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,280
sticking through that ice that can also

1408
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:40,599
act as a conduit for oxygen as well and

1409
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:40,599
that can

1410
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:57,599
help well I think we're going to wrap up

1411
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:57,599
um unless we have a quick

1412
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:02,880
question well thank you folks for

1413
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:04,680
attending uh looks like we had pretty

1414
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:06,960
close to 70 folks on and I think there

1415
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:09,680
were some groups in the session so if

1416
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:11,720
you find us effective way to communicate

1417
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:13,680
some timely issues let us know and we'd

1418
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:15,160
also appreciate feedback on the type of

1419
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:17,520
information you'd like to see in these

1420
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:21,079
webinars so thanks again for your

1421
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:21,079
participation thank you very

1422
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:24,160
much
