00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,609
hi everyone I'm Emily and our dairy

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:07,890
parlor here at Farm Park and this is my

3
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:10,590
friend caramel caramel is one of our

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:13,290
dairy cows here specifically she's a

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:16,199
milking short horn and her job on the

6
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:18,420
farm is to make milk for us now before

7
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,939
caramel can make any milk she has to eat

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,970
a lot of food as you can see she's a

9
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:27,720
really big animal she weighs around

10
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:31,019
1,300 pounds or so her diet consists of

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,540
hay grass and grain all together she's

12
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:36,120
gonna eat around 100 pounds of food

13
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:38,579
every single day and she's going to

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,489
drink about 30 to 40 gallons of water

15
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,980
every day so she needs all that food and

16
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:46,890
water to make some for us but she will

17
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,710
only make milk if she's a girl and she's

18
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,420
a mom so when we say the word wow that's

19
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,420
actually what we mean a girl that's a

20
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:57,690
mom now caramel had her last calf in

21
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,430
February or her last baby so she's

22
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,710
making a lot of milk for us right now

23
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:04,019
and she keeps me right here on her udder

24
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,000
now we can either get that milk out

25
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,799
facing our hands or right using the

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,560
machine now I'm going to show you how to

27
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:13,380
use our pants so the first thing we do

28
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,990
is we want to put some teeth dip on her

29
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:18,290
this is basically just a sanitizer for

30
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,290
the cow

31
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:29,300
after that sits on there for a little

32
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:31,340
bit we can go ahead and wipe it off so

33
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,770
the way we milk is we take our pointer

34
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:35,690
finger and our thumb we wrap it right

35
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:37,640
around the base of her udder where it

36
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:40,040
meets her teeth squeeze those together

37
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:43,310
and then just squeeze our fingers around

38
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,530
a lot of people think that you have to

39
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:47,240
pull down to get the milk out but

40
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:50,030
actually we just squeeze our hand around

41
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:52,640
almost like a fist that sound you hear

42
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:54,860
right now is our milk machine rather

43
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,140
than trying to handle our cows twice a

44
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:59,030
day every day and suddenly use our milk

45
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:02,120
machine it's a lot faster and a lot

46
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:03,890
easier so before we put the machine on

47
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:06,110
it what we want to do is get a little

48
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:08,330
bit of milk out of each section up for

49
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:10,810
other so on the inside for utter is

50
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:14,210
divided up into four different sections

51
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:16,430
we just hand over to make sure that her

52
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:19,270
mouth looks alright and that her udder

53
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,270
feels okay

54
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:44,310
after that we put some pizzas on each

55
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:46,740
one of her teeth and we leave that on

56
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:49,860
for at least 30 seconds make sure sure

57
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:51,930
we kill any germs or bacteria so after

58
00:02:49,860 --> 00:03:04,830
it's been 30 seconds we can go ahead and

59
00:02:51,930 --> 00:03:06,990
wipe it keep it off each seat then we

60
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:10,590
can take our milk machine we call this

61
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:14,100
piece the claw we flip it over and once

62
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:16,080
we push in this button it turns on our

63
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:18,830
suction and that's what's gonna suck the

64
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,830
milk out of the cab

65
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,510
