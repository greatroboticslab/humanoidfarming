00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,219
good morning I'm David Kuhn I'm a

2
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:10,440
Regional Extension agent with the

3
00:00:08,219 --> 00:00:12,480
Alabama Cooperative Extension system and

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,610
as part of our grow more give more

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,390
series we're going to talk a little bit

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:20,700
about crop rotation today what is crop

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:24,270
rotation was one of the oldest

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:25,890
agricultural practices that we have and

9
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:28,170
it involves changing the planting

10
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,510
locations of different crops throughout

11
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,360
each growing season and we do this to

12
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,949
reduce damage from insect pests limit

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:40,860
the development of vegetable diseases

14
00:00:34,949 --> 00:00:43,200
and also manage soil fertility so why is

15
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,060
it important each vegetable can be

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,850
classified into a particular plant

17
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:50,550
family plants belong to the same family

18
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,770
often are susceptible to the same insect

19
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:55,800
pests and diseases and have similar

20
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,989
nutrient requirements when vegetables

21
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,940
classified in the same plant family are

22
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:02,309
grown year after year in the same area

23
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:05,189
of a garden they provide insect pests

24
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:08,009
with a reliable food source and disease

25
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:10,709
organisms pathogens with a continuous

26
00:01:08,009 --> 00:01:13,950
source of host plants that they can

27
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:17,119
infect over time insect pests and

28
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:20,009
pathogens numbers build in an area and

29
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:23,609
damaged vegetable damage to vegetable

30
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:25,170
crops increases using crop rotation

31
00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:27,899
helps keep insect pests and pathogens

32
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,700
numbers at low levels in addition the

33
00:01:27,899 --> 00:01:32,670
type of vegetable grown in a particular

34
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:35,420
area in a garden has a direct effect on

35
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:38,399
the fertility of the soil in that area

36
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:39,990
each vegetable is unique in the type and

37
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:43,590
amount and nutrients that it strikes

38
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:45,959
from the soil so crop rotation can even

39
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:49,999
out the loss of different soil nutrients

40
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:53,009
in allow time for nutrients to replenish

41
00:01:49,999 --> 00:01:56,700
so when we talk about plant families we

42
00:01:53,009 --> 00:02:00,119
divide those families down to four major

43
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:03,899
areas is when we're talking about garden

44
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:06,239
vegetables crucifer or cool season leafy

45
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:09,319
crops include cabbage collards kale

46
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:12,900
mustard broccoli and turnips our

47
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:15,340
solanaceous crops nightshades include

48
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:21,160
tomatoes potatoes pack

49
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:24,069
and eggplants q'bert's include cucumbers

50
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:26,290
cantaloupes squash watermelons and

51
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:29,019
pumpkins and our last category is

52
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:33,370
grasses and did you know that corn was

53
00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:36,069
actually classified as a grass when we

54
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:37,629
talk about rotation in a garden we're

55
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:40,450
simply saying we're going to change the

56
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:44,470
locations of rows every year for each

57
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:46,330
plant family for plant families where

58
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:48,519
you only grow a half of a row or a

59
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:50,590
quarter of a row of its particular type

60
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:52,750
of plant you can simply change the end

61
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:55,209
of the row that you start those plants

62
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:57,730
on you need to plan for a four year

63
00:02:55,209 --> 00:03:00,160
rotation meaning where you planted your

64
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:02,560
solanaceous crops this year will not be

65
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,680
planted with that same plant family for

66
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,260
the following three years if size

67
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,120
permits plan for a fifth year where you

68
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:13,180
allow a portion of your garden to lay

69
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:18,099
fallow for that planting season and then

70
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:20,019
add it back to the rotation when we look

71
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:22,989
at raised beds we're gonna treat each

72
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:26,290
bed as an individual row plant different

73
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:29,079
plant families at each bed each year if

74
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:30,940
you only have one or two raised beds try

75
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:33,730
to divide the beds in half and plant

76
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:37,150
different plant families in each half of

77
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:39,489
a bed each year if you need more space

78
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:41,799
you can also supplement your raised beds

79
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:46,540
with an in-ground garden space if

80
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:48,819
possible and when we look at growing in

81
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:52,349
containers we want to treat those

82
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:55,180
containers the same as raised beds

83
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:57,609
rotate crop families between containers

84
00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:00,069
each planting season if you only have

85
00:03:57,609 --> 00:04:00,639
one container replace the soil in that

86
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:03,099
container

87
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:06,639
each planting season and sanitize the

88
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:08,349
container before refilling thank you for

89
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,750
joining us today to learn a little about

90
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:13,150
crop rotation if you have any other

91
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:16,090
