1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,379
farmer Brad here and I'm out in the high

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:08,910
tunnel trying to get some work done on

3
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:14,900
clearing got out here in the high tunnel

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:18,330
to help me so out here I ended up

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:22,500
putting the chicken tikka and the other

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:28,519
side had some vegetation growing aka

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:34,079
weeds and this seems like it will be

8
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:37,950
okay so I've also been trying to work

9
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:41,239
all the brush down that way and I don't

10
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:44,460
know if I'm gonna mess with with

11
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:46,730
landscape fabric just partly because I

12
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:53,250
want to be able to continually add

13
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:54,690
manure and things to it and really once

14
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:59,370
you put down landscape fabric you're

15
00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:02,340
basically committed to that I also have

16
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:06,360
a couple more holes that I need to fix

17
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:12,090
in the roof there's one over here and

18
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:13,770
then there's one run along there and I'm

19
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:18,240
debating whether or not to just frame

20
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:20,570
out this side it's a frame out this side

21
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,590
for the door and just keep it solid

22
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:26,990
since this is where most of the wind

23
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:30,890
comes from and let me show you over here

24
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:36,420
over here is where I plan to put the

25
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:40,350
water sprinkler system right there so

26
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:42,780
the idea is that the water tank would be

27
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:47,159
outside of there the water would come in

28
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:54,960
here and I think I would may just attach

29
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:56,909
the pipe along there on the inside but

30
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,430
I'm also thinking about putting

31
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,049
electrical long there because I have to

32
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:05,070
get the electrical all the way over to

33
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:08,149
there to power the solenoids that I'll

34
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:08,149
be using for

35
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:20,840
watering the drip tape and then the

36
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:23,150
other concern that I have is since this

37
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,849
plastic up here has a hole can I really

38
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:29,150
seal that off enough because what I was

39
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:33,260
going to do is put my electrical panel

40
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:37,459
in here from the solar so in the

41
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:38,750
comments if you can leave me any

42
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:41,660
suggestions what I'm what I'm

43
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:47,060
envisioning is I have a uniball you know

44
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:49,069
strut or that I'll span between here and

45
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:54,920
then I'll be able to put like a piece of

46
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:57,049
plywood in order to keep basically to be

47
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:02,720
able to mount stuff to and then that's

48
00:02:57,049 --> 00:03:05,900
where the power panel will be and then

49
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,690
I'll store the batteries below right now

50
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:12,170
I just have one battery and this is kind

51
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:16,579
of where the solar would come in part of

52
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:18,889
the reason for that is I plan on putting

53
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:21,170
the solar just out this way and I don't

54
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:23,060
want to have to put it out too far but

55
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:25,340
if you look at these three trees there

56
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:27,829
I'm worried that those are gonna block

57
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:30,829
the Sun from the solar panels so what

58
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:35,480
I'm thinking about doing is cutting that

59
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:37,669
was about five feet off the ground level

60
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:41,239
and then I'll take the straighter part

61
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:44,319
of the top and make raised garden beds

62
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:46,970
out of that and then those three tree

63
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:52,280
stumps I might be able to make like a

64
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:57,169
kid's treehouse platform out of it well

65
00:03:52,280 --> 00:04:00,919
that's at least the thought and I have

66
00:03:57,169 --> 00:04:04,389
my littlest helper out here she's having

67
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:04,389
fun roaming around

68
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:14,380
and then here's the Kubota tractor it's

69
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:16,810
done majority of the difficult projects

70
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:22,090
here on the farm and then I got the

71
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:26,470
trailer and the generator and then I I

72
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:32,380
take that generator most places and it

73
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:36,300
ends up powering a chainsaw another

74
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:39,730
thing that I'm thinking about doing is

75
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:43,180
sort of flattening out this and putting

76
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:45,940
a 450 gallon water tank on there that

77
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:48,040
then I could put a gutter off the side

78
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:52,060
of this and have it collect rainwater

79
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:57,460
and then use that rainwater to water the

80
00:04:52,060 --> 00:05:00,040
chickens in the pasture and that would

81
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:02,250
just be a way of saving me from having a

82
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:09,070
cart

83
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:12,180
fresh water back here so those are some

84
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:16,810
thoughts I think I'm gonna get some

85
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:21,940
concrete tubes or cardboard tubes sort

86
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:24,660
of build a foundation of where those pet

87
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:28,360
those feet on the tower would go and

88
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:31,150
then I would be able to get that secured

89
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,850
to the ground and then get the IBC tote

90
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:37,530
up on top of there and then I can have

91
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:37,530
that water tank taken care of

92
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:48,069
so I just wanted to hop on and show you

93
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:51,729
what I've been doing in the high tunnel

94
00:05:48,069 --> 00:05:55,330
I still have a lot of work before I'm

95
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:59,289
able to plant and stuff I also have some

96
00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:05,650
compost that I'm going to add and I'm

97
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:10,830
gonna add the brooder pine chips to help

98
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:10,830
as a fertilizer as well for the ground

99
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:19,199
but yeah so thanks for watching and have

100
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,199
a good night
