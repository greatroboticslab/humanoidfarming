7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:40,520
is now for me to harvest my baby green

8
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:44,039
spinach and as you can see it is really

9
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:46,760
healthy and it is ready to be Harvest so

10
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:50,199
I just wanted to take you along and show

11
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:52,199
you how to harvest baby green spinach in

12
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:54,960
containers now there are two different

13
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:58,359
ways you can Harvest baby green spinach

14
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,399
you can actually cut it from the

15
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:04,040
outside and work your way

16
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:08,439
inward but oh my goodness it would take

17
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:11,840
forever for me to harvest each leaf and

18
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:14,600
work my way inward or another way to

19
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,600
harvest is just to cut it right off at

20
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,600
the top like

21
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,479
this now you don't want to cut it too

22
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:27,240
far from the base because you want to

23
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:30,240
come again so this is going to be cut

24
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:33,040
and come again and as you can see I

25
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:37,439
still am leaving a

26
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:40,640
base in the container as I'm harvesting

27
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:43,759
the spinach and I'm dropping a few on

28
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:47,159
the ground and you can see some of the

29
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:50,119
baby spinach is still being left and

30
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:50,119
this is a quicker

31
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:58,759
way so I'm going to go

32
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:58,759
ahead and harvest all this

33
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,709
[Music]

34
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:09,720
and again this is a quicker way to

35
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:13,959
harvest the baby green

36
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:16,840
spinach and I did not cut it all the way

37
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:18,640
down at the base because I want to be

38
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:23,400
able

39
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:28,519
to harvest my baby green spinach

40
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:30,680
again so if you would look inside the

41
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:34,480
container and you you can see there's

42
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:38,319
still a lot of the stems left which will

43
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:42,560
allow the spinach to grow

44
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:44,640
again so here's my first harvest of the

45
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,400
baby green

46
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:52,200
spinach and I am growing baby green

47
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:55,480
spinach which is a cool season crop in

48
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,640
the dead of Summer and you would ask how

49
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,959
am I doing this let me show you I have a

50
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:03,319
screen that I put over the container

51
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,319
like

52
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:14,360
this and I have

53
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:18,319
two large steaks on the end very thin

54
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:22,560
that I hold up and then I curl these

55
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:26,200
down and and um and um clip them and

56
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,560
then I also clip the sides over here

57
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,720
this container of baby green spinach

58
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,680
only gets Morning Sun

59
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,360
about 11:00 I know this my patio is no

60
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,040
longer receiving Sun so it's getting

61
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,799
Morning Sun and it's getting filter sun

62
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,400
it's allowing me to grow a cool seasoned

63
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:48,519
crop in the middle of the summer it is

64
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:51,840
now July 1st and as you can see I just

65
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:56,879
have a large bowl of spinach that I just

66
00:03:51,840 --> 00:04:01,879
Harvest another benefit of using a shade

67
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:04,799
mesh covers is it keeps the insects off

68
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:08,040
the spinach the air wigs the butterflies

69
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:11,200
that want to lay their eggs on the Brasa

70
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:14,480
crops it serves many purposes and so it

71
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:17,359
allows me to be able to harvest grow and

72
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,400
harvest baby green spinach for the

73
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,400
remainder of the summer I have about

74
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,800
another

75
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:27,600
week before this spinach grows

76
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,919
again and allows me to harvest and

77
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,479
hopefully I may be able to get a third

78
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:35,039
Harvest before the end of the season so

79
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:38,720
hopefully in the next 7 days I should

80
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:40,680
have another container full of spinach

81
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,759
and therefore I am going to fix a

82
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,720
spinach salad for dinner

83
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:47,320
