1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,760
guys i've got a question for you is

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,440
there anything better than a tractor

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,960
well it turns out

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,639
there just might be well i think that

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,000
question has a lot of answers depending

6
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,080
on who you ask but we're going to

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,920
compare a tractor versus skid steer i'll

8
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,839
give you my take on it the pros and the

9
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,600
cons the strengths the weaknesses let's

10
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,760
go over it now and you know what to do

11
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,039
if you do enjoy the video please take

[Music]

19
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,600
okay let's talk about price first

20
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,680
because that is the overwhelming

21
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,680
consideration between these two machines

22
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,079
pricing is probably the most difficult

23
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,079
thing to try to quantify between a skid

24
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,000
steer and a tractor the simplest way to

25
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,680
sum it up is that a skid steer is going

26
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,760
to cost you more money than a tractor

27
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,760
but not just the machine itself also the

28
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:57,360
attachments now again just for a couple

29
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,079
of actual values this john deere 333g

30
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,239
behind me with the bucket on it with a

31
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,559
cab it's got the hvac cab so you have

32
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,159
heat and air conditioning it's high flow

33
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,840
it's pretty well decked out has about

34
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,720
400 hours on it now

35
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,479
three years old i'd probably sell that

36
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,640
for about seventy five thousand dollars

37
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,439
now my john deere 4720 that's going to

38
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,960
be nine years old about 800 hours on it

39
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,920
does have a cab with air conditioning

40
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,439
and heat

41
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,400
if i sold it with just a loader on there

42
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,320
i'd be at about 45 000

43
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,080
ballpark now that's not a perfect

44
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,159
comparison i'm not saying this versus

45
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,840
that machine in particular this is 100

46
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,840
horsepower skid steer

47
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,040
66 horsepower tractor you know there's

48
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,880
differences there but it's just a couple

49
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,720
data points for you to kind of paint a

50
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,360
picture now that's all about the pricing

51
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,600
for the base machines themselves but if

52
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,520
we're talking about an attachment like a

53
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,840
grapple what you see here something

54
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,920
outfitted for a good sized tractor again

55
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,720
66 horsepower tractor this loader will

56
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,079
lift over 2000 pounds this grapple here

57
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,759
is going to cost you close to three

58
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,439
thousand dollars however the grapple

59
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,479
that i'm using on my skid steer and it's

60
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:03,119
been the 333 g it could be the 330g even

61
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,880
the 324e that i had before that i'm

62
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,399
going to use a bigger heavier duty

63
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,160
grapple on here and you're going to be

64
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,479
more in the range of four to five

65
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,160
thousand dollars because these loaders

66
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,920
have more capacity there's more weight

67
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,319
behind there you have to size things

68
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,280
appropriately and with a bigger machine

69
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,040
even though

70
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,720
the footprint doesn't physically look

71
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,560
bigger it's just more weight more

72
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,480
hydraulic capacity so you need beefier

73
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,640
attachments to go along with that one

74
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,560
other interesting point on pricing is

75
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,160
going to be in general maintenance i

76
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,720
don't have nearly as much experience in

77
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,120
skid steers but my personal experience

78
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,720
so far is that skid steers are actually

79
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,400
a little bit cheaper on regular

80
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,080
maintenance and that's not talking about

81
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,760
things that may break and need repair

82
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,920
because i've been fortunate not to

83
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,920
really need any of that but i'm talking

84
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,680
air filters and greasing and just oil

85
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,319
changes and whatnot the service

86
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,560
intervals are much longer or more spread

87
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,720
out on a piece of machinery like this

88
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,400
versus a tractor and the reason for that

89
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,720
from what i've been told from people

90
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,480
smarter than myself is that construction

91
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,879
equipment like this skid steer is meant

92
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,400
to be operated by a full-time operator

93
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,959
right 40 hours a week and you're going

94
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,480
to rack up hours a lot quicker typically

95
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,800
in that kind of a situation versus a

96
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,879
tractor that's going to be used

97
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,800
maybe for some guys 10 hours a week

98
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,560
maybe 5 hours a week so that makes sense

99
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,480
for a guy in a skid steer that's working

100
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,319
it full time you don't want to have a

101
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,159
200 hour service interval like you would

102
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,920
on a tractor because you'd just be

103
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,599
changing oil all the time and so because

104
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,599
you have those longer intervals it means

105
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:32,599
you have less maintenance to do less oil

106
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,599
changes to do which i find pretty nice

107
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,040
one of the big differences between these

108
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,280
two machines is going to be how you're

109
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,280
using them with attachments and so while

110
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,640
it's pretty obvious you have your front

111
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,560
end loader on both of these machines

112
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,400
you're only going to use front end

113
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,000
attachments on your skid steer you have

114
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,920
the option to use the three point hitch

115
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,760
or the front end loader on a tractor now

116
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,159
this comes with its own set of pros and

117
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,760
cons and i love front end attachments i

118
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,040
mean who doesn't it's a lot easier to

119
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,519
see when you're looking forward a lot

120
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,120
more comfortable however there's a big

121
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,799
difference between sitting on a tractor

122
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,239
and looking forward or sitting on a skid

123
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,080
steer when you're sitting on a skid

124
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,920
steer you feel like you're just right on

125
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,080
top of the action you have very good

126
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,840
visibility to see what is going on up

127
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,439
here and depending on the attachment

128
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,720
you're using you know if it is a bucket

129
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,799
like i've used one of these to help

130
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,040
grade out and smooth a driveway or if

131
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,560
you're grappling to have a good idea of

132
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,880
how to get underneath that log or that

133
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,880
pile of debris you have just excellent

134
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,040
visibility to do so now on a tractor

135
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,040
while it is still nice to have a view

136
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,720
right down in front you have the big

137
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,240
engine compartment that's in the way so

138
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,000
you're trying to look around to either

139
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,520
side of that engine compartment in

140
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,680
between the loader arms there to see

141
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,280
what's going down below you simply don't

142
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,520
have the same kind of visibility that

143
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,800
you do from a skid steer now on the flip

144
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,080
side depending on what kind of

145
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,400
attachments you're using i'm going to

146
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,000
use a mulcher head for example if you

147
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,759
have that on the front end loader here

148
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,360
on the skid steer there's a lot of

149
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,280
debris that's getting chopped up mulched

150
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,919
up and flying around so

151
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,520
there's a inherent danger with something

152
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,120
flying back and wanting to whack the cab

153
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,479
door if you have a cab if you have an

154
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,560
open station that's a whole other

155
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,120
scenario which is not a good one so

156
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,639
between a mulcher and maybe a disc mower

157
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,720
there's a couple attachments i probably

158
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,960
wouldn't even use unless i had a cab and

159
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,800
except for a couple fairly uncommon

160
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,160
exceptions there's not anything like

161
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,759
that for the front end loaders of these

162
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,800
tractors you'll see a couple little

163
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,560
mowers that are out there that are

164
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,320
hydraulically driven but they're not

165
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,400
very common and they are quite a bit

166
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,919
further away as well the danger just

167
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,160
isn't there like it is in a skid steer

168
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,919
now on tractors of course it's standard

169
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,560
these days anyways to have a three-point

170
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,800
hitch and a rear pto now we talked about

171
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,720
price earlier being a lot cheaper for

172
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,320
attachments on a tractor versus a skid

173
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,240
steer and a lot of those are going to

174
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,000
mount to your three-point hitch whether

175
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,400
they're using the rear pto or not but

176
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,479
that could be for a tiller a land plane

177
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,800
it could be for a post hole auger even a

178
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,720
snow blower forward or rear facing and

179
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,320
those mowers or those mulchers that we

180
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,479
talked about that are kind of dangerous

181
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,919
to operate on a skid steer those are

182
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,080
going to mount on your three-point hitch

183
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,919
and run off of your rear pto and so no

184
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,199
matter what one of those options you're

185
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,639
going with if you're mounting them on a

186
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,560
three-point hitch and using it compared

187
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,240
to a skid steer you're gonna save some

188
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,840
money now there's a couple downsides

189
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,680
that go along with that so this is going

190
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,840
to be behind you so from the operator

191
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,520
station you need to keep an eye on it or

192
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,600
you want to keep an eye on it so that is

193
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,120
going to require you to turn around

194
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,880
maybe not constantly but you have to

195
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,039
frequently peek behind you see what's

196
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,639
going on we actually use some mirrors to

197
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,160
try to get a decent look at what's going

198
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,479
on there so we don't have to turn around

199
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,000
as often but some of these attachments

200
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,440
like a mulcher that you would mount on

201
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,280
the three-point hitch or like a

202
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,720
rear-facing snow blower you have to

203
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,000
actually drive backwards while you're

204
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,400
using it so you are going to have to

205
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,840
turn around and face kind of well be in

206
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,520
an awkward position there while you're

207
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,960
using it which is just really

208
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,720
uncomfortable now getting back to

209
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,520
visibility while you're using those

210
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,039
attachments we talked about kind of

211
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,639
being a little hard to see what's going

212
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,600
on up front here you got to peek left or

213
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,000
right

214
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,000
but the rest of the tractor has really

215
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,319
good visibility you can easily see all

216
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,080
around you behind you on both sides it's

217
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,520
easy to see what's going on in every

218
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,599
direction

219
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,280
for operator safety machine safety and

220
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,520
the safety of everything around you a

221
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,440
skid steer on the other hand has amazing

222
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,120
visibility with what's going on up front

223
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,440
i mean it's incredible you're right

224
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,599
there you can see everything you need to

225
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,440
the flip side is you have these loader

226
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,800
arms that are blocking the view on

227
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,400
either side

228
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,400
you can't see what the heck's behind you

229
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,160
fortunately i do have a camera so i can

230
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,919
have a pretty good idea what's behind me

231
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,759
but if you don't have one of those most

232
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,199
skid steers don't

233
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,120
it's almost like a truss system that

234
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,560
you're just hoping nobody's around you

235
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,720
there's nothing to run over no trees no

236
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,280
bushes now even with all the stuff the

237
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,039
backup camera the visibility up here

238
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,560
there's big blind spots look at this

239
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,840
whole section this whole back corner on

240
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,599
either side

241
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,599
i've whacked a few trees it's hard not

242
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,199
to sometimes and as i'm getting ready to

243
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,800
step out of this

244
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,400
there's a difference in access getting

245
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,319
in and out of a tractor versus a skid

246
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,160
steer personally we have used a skid

247
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,000
steer a lot with pallet forks on there

248
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,840
which means we have something that's

249
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,919
partially picked up or we're trying to

250
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,080
get it maneuvered to pick up and if i'm

251
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,919
on a tractor i can easily hop on and off

252
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,440
from the side and kind of shift

253
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,160
something around get it situated

254
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,599
whatever i need to on a skid steer you

255
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,280
have two things you can do you can have

256
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,199
it all the way down or you can have it

257
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,120
all the way up but if you have your

258
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,879
loader part way up you can open your

259
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,639
door and you're kind of trapped inside

260
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,240
now for the longest time that just

261
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,080
bothered the absolute heck out of me

262
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,840
thinking what if the whole system froze

263
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,120
up part way up and i'm just trapped in

264
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,479
here i can't get out of the front door

265
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,360
well our buddies over at western

266
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,840
equipment slash 24 7 parts

267
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,360
brent did a great video actually showing

268
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,440
how you take this rear window out it's

269
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,560
an emergency exit so you can get out if

270
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,159
you need to

271
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,159
obviously you don't want to but it's

272
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,839
good to have a backup option and by the

273
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:41,120
way what kind of lousy salesman would i

274
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:43,440
be if i didn't mention that 247parts.com

275
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,959
they are an authorized john deere dealer

276
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,560
they can get you any parts you need for

277
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,760
john deere you can save money with code

278
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,000
gwt you go to 247parts.com place your

279
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,000
order enter the code save some money

280
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,080
can't be found anywhere else now you can

281
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,279
see it's a side load or a side entry on

282
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,720
a tractor

283
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,720
if you have a cab i mean same thing if

284
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,080
you have an open station it's typically

285
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,080
going to be easier to

286
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,519
load up or climb in from one side than

287
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,160
it is the other side normally have a

288
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,920
joystick and oftentimes it's too high to

289
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,360
step up and there's no intermediate step

290
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,880
on a tractor

291
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,080
but it's just totally different than a

292
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,800
skid steer

293
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:20,080
there is a jcb telescope i think it's

294
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,920
called that is side entry which i almost

295
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,680
bought one of those simply because of

296
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,880
that fact that you could get in and out

297
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,120
from the side you didn't feel like you

298
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,120
were trapped however as one person

299
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,560
recently pointed out in a post i had

300
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,920
loaded my skid steer into my dump

301
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,320
trailer you know a high side dump

302
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,080
trailer and it just barely fit there was

303
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,160
like three quarters of an inch on either

304
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,279
side it was really tight and a guy said

305
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,200
man it's a good thing you didn't get

306
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,480
that jcb because

307
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,360
i would have

308
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,549
never got out from the side

309
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,549
[Music]

310
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,320
there's a few critical specifications

311
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,560
dimensions weight that are going to make

312
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,240
a big difference on where you store your

313
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,000
equipment maybe how you tow your

314
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,519
equipment and where you can use your

315
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,360
equipment now in a lot of these

316
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,360
scenarios i think for

317
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,360
most folks watching my channel the

318
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,640
tractor is going to come out on top

319
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,399
but there could be

320
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,240
a flip side to that as well so try to

321
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,640
get some perspective on

322
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,480
how a strength can be a weakness and

323
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,839
vice versa depending on your situation

324
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,200
all right a couple data points again

325
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,120
we're just using these pieces of

326
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,800
equipment so your numbers will most

327
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:25,120
likely vary but this john deere 333 g

328
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,680
weighs about 12 000 pounds that's a

329
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,720
chunk of weight if you compare that

330
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,480
to the 4720 you're at about 5 000 pounds

331
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,560
with the cab tractor now i can think of

332
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,320
a couple areas in particular where that

333
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,160
weight difference is going to be very

334
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,839
critical now the first scenario will be

335
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,600
if you need to tow or haul your

336
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,000
equipment number one you need a bigger

337
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,680
truck more power right and number two

338
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,040
you need a bigger trailer and so think

339
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,600
about that you have twelve thousand

340
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,760
pounds versus five thousand pounds so if

341
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,000
the gvwr is ten thousand pounds for

342
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,000
example you can't just haul ten thousand

343
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,360
pounds of weight on that trailer you

344
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,200
have to deduct

345
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,600
the trailer weight itself if you have a

346
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,880
spare tire on there or an equipment box

347
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,480
something else that's driving the weight

348
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,480
up take that off too but let's just say

349
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,079
three thousand pounds ten thousand minus

350
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,880
three thousand leaves you seven thousand

351
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,800
pounds of carrying capacity in ideal

352
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,720
circumstances i'm not one for pushing

353
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,240
the limit so deduct a little bit more to

354
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,839
give yourself some safety this doesn't

355
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,360
account for extra attachments you might

356
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,040
want to take along with you which of

357
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,560
course are going to then require a

358
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,480
longer trailer which are going to weigh

359
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,640
more than and then reduce the carrying

360
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,320
capacity so for a lot of folks a 10 000

361
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,320
pound trailer will work pretty well for

362
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,920
a compact tractor like this depending on

363
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,399
how long you need to go now something

364
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,720
like this 333g is going to require a

365
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:39,440
beefy trailer and so you may have seen

366
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,480
my pj trailer it's a gooseneck that's 15

367
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,880
000 pound gvwr this skid steer is too

368
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,360
big to haul safely on that trailer so

369
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,360
between adding the 333g and we also have

370
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,000
a manitou telehandler that is i think

371
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,000
it's about 16 000 pounds i had to add on

372
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,720
a couple extra trailers to my arsenal so

373
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,839
we got another gooseneck that's 24 000

374
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,480
gvwr and we do have a triple axel dump

375
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,079
trailer that is 20 000 gbwr that i've

376
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,240
hauled this around in and it works quite

377
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,920
well now maybe one small advantage to a

378
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,839
skid steer over a tractor is that you

379
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,600
can typically get by with a shorter

380
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,279
trailer for a skid steer than you can

381
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,720
with a tractor another time when weight

382
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,880
is really important is if you're going

383
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,120
to be traveling across your lawn

384
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,760
a skid steer is of course extremely

385
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,360
heavy a tractor is a lot lighter so the

386
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,360
footprint is typically going to be

387
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,120
easier on your lawn and while a track

388
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,200
will spread out the weight distribution

389
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,240
lower the psi going to work to your

390
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,600
advantage

391
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,040
when these things start turning and

392
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,120
shifting and swinging around they are

393
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,120
going to rip up a lawn in no time if you

394
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,279
get a wheeled skid steer you know with

395
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,880
tires on it like a tractor has those

396
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:43,200
things again because of how they turn

397
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,600
they can basically zero turn around you

398
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,480
can easily and quickly rip up a lawn a

399
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,000
tractor is typically a lot safer maybe

400
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,200
the four series is getting a little

401
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,360
large for a long if you're gonna do a

402
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,279
lot of repetitive use but all your

403
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,200
smaller tractors too the three series

404
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,959
the two series the one series and and

405
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,720
similar models from other brands are

406
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,560
going to be much safer on your lawn

407
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,320
versus something like this on the flip

408
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,079
side of course right more weight can

409
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,839
work to your advantage you know i'm big

410
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,079
on safety with tractors they're just

411
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,200
naturally a little light so you want to

412
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,800
have a lot of counterweight on the

413
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,200
backside in order to safely and

414
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,200
efficiently use a front end loader feel

415
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,639
more planted to the ground so those

416
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,399
extra seven thousand pounds that you

417
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,760
have over here that comes in pretty

418
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,920
handy i mean this machine is safe secure

419
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,760
stable efficient i can lift whatever i

420
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,200
want never feel like i'm maxing it out

421
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,120
it's actually an incredible feeling but

422
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,320
it's just painting a picture of the

423
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,560
night and day difference between these

424
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,720
two pieces of equipment and really along

425
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,639
those lines kind of the

426
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,800
the feeling of safety or or comfort

427
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,480
while you're operating there is no piece

428
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,199
of equipment that i feel

429
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,360
safer and more secure and more confident

430
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,440
in than in my skid steer so that feeling

431
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,519
of safety has resulted in me taking my

432
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,000
skid steer places that i would never

433
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,920
take my tractor and in fact we've

434
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,240
actually used the skid steer to create

435
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,160
new trailways throughout our property in

436
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,600
order to safely use the tractor because

437
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,120
we just didn't have a safe way to get

438
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,040
from point a to point b there's a couple

439
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,120
big requirement differences between

440
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,199
these two machines here let's take front

441
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,279
end loaders for example a lot of us need

442
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:13,279
to lift a certain amount of weight and

443
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:16,160
when you have to lift that weight that

444
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:18,399
number can be misinterpreted very easily

445
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,839
online there's so many different data

446
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,160
points so many different ways that they

447
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,760
measure that weight so i would urge you

448
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,920
to not push yourself up against the

449
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,279
limits of what you read online give

450
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,480
yourself some margin give yourself

451
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,320
twenty percent of margin you're going to

452
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,000
be a lot happier that you did you're

453
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,360
going to use your tractor a lot

454
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,600
differently instead of

455
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,839
maybe being very ginger or delicate with

456
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,920
it trying not to tip things over or get

457
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,600
it all cattywompus and and maxing it out

458
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,440
pushing it to the edge so for a little

459
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,639
fun comparison here i used to have a

460
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,040
john deere 324e skid steer it was 74

461
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,120
horsepower this is 66 horsepower on this

462
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,480
tractor you know it's a few horsepower

463
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,320
different i get that but it's fairly

464
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,839
close so let's run with it so this front

465
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,199
end loader on the john deere is gonna

466
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:01,680
lift about 2 300 pounds to full height

467
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,839
which is around 9 foot if we take the

468
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,320
rated operating capacity i'll explain

469
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,720
that in just a minute on the 324e you're

470
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,079
going to lift about 2 700 pounds to over

471
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,480
10 foot high so you're going to lift

472
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,160
about 10 percent more with the 324e and

473
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,240
you're going to lift it about 10 percent

474
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,399
higher that term rated operating

475
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,639
capacity or roc is something you don't

476
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,959
really hear in the tractor world more of

477
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,360
a construction equipment type of term

478
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,720
tied into that is called tipping load so

479
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,000
tipping load is

480
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,079
what you might think the amount of

481
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,079
weight it's going to take lifting up to

482
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,399
to tip the machine over and so on that

483
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:38,000
same machine the 324e

484
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:40,399
the tipping load is about 5400 pounds so

485
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,040
your rated operating capacity which is

486
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,600
kind of used as a safe limit to move

487
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,120
around with is going to be about 50 of

488
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,560
your tipping load so while that 10

489
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,720
percent difference between the two

490
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,720
machines didn't seem like much on the

491
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,800
tractor you're basically maxing it out

492
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,279
doing that and on the skid steer you're

493
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,959
about 50 percent so we talked about a 10

494
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,839
percent difference in lift capacity

495
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,000
between

496
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,920
the tractor and the skid steer

497
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,920
but the tractor basically is reaching

498
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,000
its tipping load to get to that number

499
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,519
whereas the skid steer is about 50

500
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,160
percent of its tipping load putting you

501
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:14,340
in a safer situation

502
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,340
[Music]

503
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,639
if you are using one of these machines

504
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,560
then you're using hydraulics but how you

505
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,399
use them what you can use them for are

506
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,240
going to vary greatly now we're in the

507
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,079
biggest end of the compact tractor

508
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,079
market right now so this is going to be

509
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,759
hydrostatic drive you can get a power

510
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,680
shuttle or some sort of a gear drive if

511
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,440
you want to you step up until the

512
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,279
utility tractor is a little bit bigger

513
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,600
and there is no more hydrostatic drive

514
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,680
it's all gear driven in one form or the

515
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,279
other but for the sake of comparison

516
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,959
you're going to drive a hydrostatic

517
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,519
transmission in this tractor when you're

518
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:47,199
operating it the same thing can be said

519
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,759
about the skid steer as well it is

520
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:51,519
completely hydrostatic there is no gears

521
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,120
that you're changing you may have a

522
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,680
button to push from a high to a low

523
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,360
range electronically but there's nothing

524
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,600
that you're going to be doing

525
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,199
to push in a clutch change direction

526
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,800
other than moving a handle or pushing a

527
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,480
foot pedal now same thing for your

528
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,000
loaders right both of these loaders are

529
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,079
going to be operated

530
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
with a joystick controlling hydraulics

531
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,000
to raise them and lower them to tilt

532
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,520
them and curl them if you have a third

533
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,360
function on there like with a grapple

534
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,039
for example to open and close the jaws

535
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,880
of the grapple now most of the time if

536
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,640
you want to run a grapple or something

537
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,880
that requires additional hydraulics on

538
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,000
your tractor you need to add on a third

539
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,000
function that's not going to come

540
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,160
standard now in my experience in owning

541
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,600
and operating skid steers i've never

542
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,760
seen one without those additional

543
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,480
hydraulics already on them i'm sure they

544
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,840
exist but they're not very common so far

545
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,120
pretty similar in how things are

546
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,960
operating between the tractor and the

547
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,039
skid steer but when we get to

548
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,600
attachments like the brush mulcher like

549
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,760
maybe a tiller or a mower for example

550
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,200
that's where there's a big difference

551
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,880
and that's also part of the reason why

552
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,640
the cost of these attachments and the

553
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,919
cost of the machine is a lot higher on a

554
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,760
skid steer you're going to have

555
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,520
hydraulic motors that are driving those

556
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,720
blades or that mulcher head or those

557
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,720
tines for the tiller versus a pto a rear

558
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,880
pto spline that's coming off the trans

559
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,640
axle and driving that attachment on the

560
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,400
back side part of the reason that these

561
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,720
skid steers cost so much is because of

562
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,960
that advanced hydraulic system that has

563
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,120
a lot more gpm a lot more hydraulic

564
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,760
power that is outputting all of those

565
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:18,640
attachments your mulchers your mowers

566
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,400
your rototillers your snowblowers those

567
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,120
all come with a hydraulic motor that's

568
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,039
on there which requires a large back end

569
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,720
system on your skid steer to operate

570
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:29,120
that so while they are extremely

571
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,280
effective they are also extremely costly

572
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,440
a tractor on the other hand is not going

573
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,559
to have nearly as large of a hydraulic

574
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,760
system

575
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:40,400
maybe 50 in the size ballpark but that's

576
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,080
where your rear pto or even a mid pto

577
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,240
depending on the tractor model comes in

578
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,160
handy that is a relatively cheap way to

579
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,320
get a lot of power you can slap a

580
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,919
gearbox on there you can run your mower

581
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,840
you can run your mulcher off the back

582
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,400
end you can run a snow blower off the

583
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,320
back end or off the front end as well

584
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,600
but it's a big difference because that

585
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,840
gearbox

586
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,240
is a lot cheaper the hydraulic system

587
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,919
isn't advanced so that's cheaper as well

588
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,760
i get a lot of questions about a couple

589
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,440
of different attachments wanting to know

590
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,520
from tractor owners if you can use them

591
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,280
on your front end loader like i do on my

592
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,039
skid steer the first one is going to be

593
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,120
that mulcher head and while it is

594
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,720
awesome on the skid steer it's simply

595
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,240
not going to work on the front end

596
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,480
loader of your tractor and that's for a

597
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,799
couple of reasons the first one they

598
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,200
weigh a lot they're very heavy so you're

599
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:27,280
going to eat up 50 or more of your lift

600
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,120
capacity the second reason is that these

601
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,760
tractors just simply don't have enough

602
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,679
continuous hydraulic flow to effectively

603
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,600
operate one of these mulchers the other

604
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,280
common example especially this time of

605
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,280
year as we get into winter is can i use

606
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,039
a snow blower on my front end loader and

607
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,440
the same premise applies there just

608
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:45,600
simply isn't enough hydraulic power on

609
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,520
one of these tractors and you will see

610
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,760
an option out there i've never sold one

611
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,520
because of the absurd price but you can

612
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,600
get something called a hydraulic power

613
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,880
pack that you actually tie into your

614
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,039
three-point hitch

615
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,440
run a hydraulic pump off of your rear

616
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:01,280
pto take some hydraulic lines all the

617
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,120
way up front and then have a front end

618
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,640
loader mounted snow blower let's just

619
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,720
say you could take your family to disney

620
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,480
world and hawaii and probably on an

621
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,480
around-the-world cruise for the price of

622
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,240
one of those setups so this wasn't meant

623
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,400
to be all inclusive it's just kind of

624
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,320
the the big things that jumped out to me

625
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,159
and i would love to know i think a lot

626
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,679
of others would too when they're trying

627
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,200
to make that decision right between a

628
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,799
tractor and a skid steer what are we

629
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,960
forgetting right i'm sure there's other

630
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,960
considerations other variables

631
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,640
everybody's situation is unique right

632
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,120
there's just a different list of

633
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,600
priorities that we're all going to have

634
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,280
now for me as we develop this 140 acres

635
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,720
that we have out here

636
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,039
i'm blessed to have both pieces of

637
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,799
equipment right now some of the big

638
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,880
heavy hitting stuff i find myself

639
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,480
leaning on the skid steer however i

640
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,720
think in the long run you know my heart

641
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,480
is kind of with the tractors i love them

642
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,559
you know for projects like mowing a

643
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,159
field tilling i just like a tractor a

644
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,240
lot better for that but there's some big

645
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,080
heavy duty tasks that

646
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,440
if you have the equipment why not use it

647
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,360
well that's going to wrap it up for us

648
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,960
