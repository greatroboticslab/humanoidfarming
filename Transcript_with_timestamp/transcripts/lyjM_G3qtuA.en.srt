00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,279
population growth and changing diets are

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,320
driving the ever-increasing use of land

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,320
for agriculture

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,440
we work at scale with commercial farmers

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,400
to understand the limitations of food

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,560
production

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,439
monitor the impact of agriculture on the

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,840
environment

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,519
and develop new sustainable farming

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,080
systems

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,199
healthy ecosystems underpin food

13
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,519
production

14
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:41,840
so we provide tools and data to plan

15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:41,840
future land use
