1
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,800
today's scenario what is the relevance

2
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,960
of organic food yeah

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,800
yeah see uh whether you call it as

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,600
organic there are different names to

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,240
organic you know the organic biodynamic

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,240
parma culture sahaja rishi natural

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,359
agriculture all lot of names under

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,239
various

9
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,600
you know

10
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:37,280
name categories it is being practiced

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,120
but you ask me whether what is the

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,239
relevance of organic why are we talking

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,160
today the relevance of organic we know

14
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,000
today that there are large scale

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,120
problems with current agricultural

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,840
practices

17
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,920
they

18
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,879
everybody knows that they simply cannot

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,920
sustain that we cannot live with toxic

20
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:59,520
residues both into our body out there in

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,440
the rivers and oceans and the large

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,640
scale input

23
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,840
that agriculture today consumes take for

24
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,439
example

25
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,520
no if i have to say the relevance of

26
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,479
organic or natural forming or more

27
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,799
eco-friendly forming

28
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,400
then we should know what is the problem

29
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,799
with the current system

30
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,880
the current system today we have is take

31
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,000
for example energy

32
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,159
now

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,640
in order to get one calorie we are talk

34
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:29,119
today talking about consuming spending

35
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,680
10 calories to produce one calorie of

36
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,840
food if you take a frozen green peas

37
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,759
they talk something like 15 calorie to

38
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,560
deliver one calorie

39
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,200
this is unsustainable system

40
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,640
and you say for example this this is

41
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,520
it's like uh

42
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,439
burning the house to get rid of a mouse

43
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,680
you know it just cannot sustain you

44
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,360
cannot be spending your body we know the

45
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,360
second law of thermodynamics that energy

46
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,360
can neither be created nor destroyed

47
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,159
okay but it can it can be

48
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:01,280
but at the same time you can convert

49
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,640
this one good form into another bad form

50
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,399
that's the problem

51
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,640
so whether the current system is

52
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,360
sustainable is a serious serious

53
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,160
question take for example shrimp

54
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,720
today to produce one kg of shrimp and to

55
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,840
export it to united states of america we

56
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,680
have to feed 4 kg of sea fish

57
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,360
is that the way to do it

58
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,480
should you be you know why not eat the

59
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,640
seafish itself why produce this exotic

60
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,200
variety and sell it to the united states

61
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,520
of america on foreign exchange at the

62
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,959
cost or the capital cost of natural

63
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,400
resources

64
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,480
and then you see

65
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,440
in our production system today

66
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,120
we have large number of pesticides large

67
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,120
number of fungicides

68
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,760
okay and

69
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,080
herbicide so large number of them you

70
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,319
know in order to produce this food we

71
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,160
have you know we have to dump large

72
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,560
quantity of chemicals

73
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,000
does it really help does it really today

74
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,400
if you talk about india we are almost

75
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
using 20 000 crore worth of pesticides

76
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,840
and harvard is exported of course there

77
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,560
people use also pesticides within the

78
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,800
household but the system is riddled with

79
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,040
all these toxicities take for example

80
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,959
antibiotics

81
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,280
why are antibiotics floating antibiotics

82
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,519
are not supposed to be given for

83
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,200
weight gain you know meat production

84
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,920
they are supposed to be used for

85
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,720
treating diseases but today we have they

86
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,040
say you have antibiotic resistant genes

87
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,959
even in antarctica see when you use

88
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,599
antibiotic in the animal farming in the

89
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,360
current system so what happens you

90
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,840
you okay you get the residues of it the

91
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,560
beet milk and egg and all that but then

92
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,480
this waste goes as manure to form to

93
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,319
grow fruits and vegetables

94
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,879
so you have problem of antibiotic

95
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,239
resistance going across and bacterias

96
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,720
they are very clever

97
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,360
they also transfer their

98
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,400
antibiotic resistant gene horizontally

99
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,720
across others other other microbes so

100
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,280
you have a serious problem of anti

101
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:01,040
antibiotic resistant genes emerging

102
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,760
across the world so i would say that

103
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,760
today organic holds water and is

104
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,599
relevant because

105
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,920
in organic you have to do polyculture

106
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,680
you can't do monoculture

107
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,360
there may be wrong kind of organic

108
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,799
agriculture in the poly houses and all

109
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,720
kinds of things not that you shouldn't

110
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:20,079
do it in the poly house but

111
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,079
organic is embedded in polyculture

112
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,240
organic mean that you will have to bring

113
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,759
back the number of

114
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:30,240
a sturdy and hardy variety of seeds and

115
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,560
breeds that have gone into the oblivion

116
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,400
bring them back into the system they

117
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,479
have the natural immunity

118
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,520
some of them can grow without seed take

119
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:42,080
for example a hybrid cow and a native

120
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,600
breeds of cow and what kind of input you

121
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,320
need for the hybrid varieties where

122
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,840
yield alone is the criteria look at the

123
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,080
natural you see typically they talk

124
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,720
about the natural farming in the chicken

125
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,520
farming in the rural countryside second

126
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,440
farming is you use a chicken

127
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,280
sorry the kitchen waste and feed the

128
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,360
chicken and get the chicken back into

129
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,520
the kitchen that's a natural farming

130
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,199
that's a sustainable system you don't

131
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,440
build a house

132
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,080
a concrete house for the chicken and

133
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,160
feed the corn and soya grown in the

134
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,759
amazon forest so how do you do what

135
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,759
you're conforming

136
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,080
you know this just defeats the common

137
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,000
sense that animal form if you take

138
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,960
animal farming was always a part and

139
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,039
parcel of the human farming they were

140
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,160
complementing each other you get the

141
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:30,080
grain grass goes to animals today you

142
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,720
grow the grain for animals and the

143
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,360
leftover oil comes to human beings

144
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,639
so today the byproducts of animal

145
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,720
feeding comes to human beings so this is

146
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,720
not you know sustainable this is not

147
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,960
very healthy today we talked about

148
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,360
global warming today we talk about

149
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:50,240
ecological damage we talk about sixth

150
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:53,360
mass extinction we talk about

151
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,840
islands of dead dead oceans in the in

152
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,080
this in the in the ocean dead oceans is

153
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,120
where nothing grows because too much of

154
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,520
nitrates from the aggregate fertilizers

155
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,600
leeching into the ocean and then

156
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,400
algal growth and then there is no oxygen

157
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,039
available

158
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,080
so the fishes die the marine life you

159
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,880
know is that

160
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,360
great it's a threat to marine life so

161
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,600
you have you know it's not farming is

162
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,520
not within the four walls it's done in

163
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,400
the open environment it is done in the

164
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,199
open ecology and what kind of impact it

165
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,199
has as as a sensible human beings we

166
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,440
know that we share this world with other

167
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,600
beings and the catalogued species on

168
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,440
this earth are just about 10 million but

169
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,479
they say uncatalogued could be 100

170
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,639
million

171
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,039
that is why it is said that we need to

172
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,800
preserve this world in whatever you do

173
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,720
particularly agriculture because it is

174
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,720
done in the open environment so that you

175
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,960
preserve the nature so one day you will

176
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,840
start appreciating how ignorant foods we

177
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,759
want

178
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,560
but ragu they say that organic food is

179
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,000
very expensive which middle class can't

180
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,319
afford like what do you have to say

181
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,240
about this but you see in my opinion

182
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,840
they always ask this question counter

183
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:04,479
question what is the real cost of cheap

184
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:06,800
food if you consume large quantities of

185
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,720
sugars and fat and the refined foods

186
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,880
that we all consume and we end up

187
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,479
spending our money for the diabetes and

188
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,919
sugar and and

189
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,400
heart health

190
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,720
today you know who says that once

191
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,880
diabetic strikes at the age of 40 it

192
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,639
costs you 10 lakh rupees

193
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:26,479
so are you so it's very good but you do

194
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,840
because it treats the economy and all

195
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,680
that pharmaceutical companies grow

196
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,080
hospitals grow and all that so what is

197
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,160
the cost of the real food if you had to

198
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,919
eat healthy food i know

199
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,919
unfortunately organic today is expensive

200
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,440
almost 30 percent more

201
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,639
but i would say

202
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,639
if you are cold saving water preserving

203
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,800
ecology

204
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,599
insect population or the microbial

205
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,319
population if your production system has

206
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:57,360
not eliminated and decimated those

207
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,680
systems until you produce a cheap food

208
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,840
then you ask further questions

209
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,319
they see the typically current practices

210
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,360
produce heap and sell cheap you know

211
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,199
that's the kind of agriculture

212
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,560
production system you have but what is

213
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,120
the real cost of your food if you

214
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,280
produce nutritious food if you prod or

215
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,680
diverse food if you have varieties of

216
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,479
food if it is production is slightly

217
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,400
less

218
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,240
then you if you pay more because you

219
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,680
have saved water because you see for

220
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,199
cleaning environment how much are we

221
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,960
spending today

222
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,599
see the government of india last year

223
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,840
sanctioned 3000 crore to clean pesticide

224
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,080
in river waters

225
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,440
is that the way can we clean up the air

226
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,680
water soil can you clean up all that

227
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,479
we cannot clean up

228
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,839
this is a very dynamic emerging

229
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,839
ecosystem

230
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,480
you cannot clean it up but you must

231
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:49,360
eliminate how can you prevent so in my

232
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,680
opinion see organic farming is a is a

233
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,240
thought intensive science

234
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,760
in chemical forming in my opinion you

235
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,080
have a narrow constructor called

236
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:01,040
causative you have a pest problem use a

237
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,120
pesticide you have a soil problem you

238
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,200
use a fertilizer you use a problem use

239
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,160
this you are not getting slave take a

240
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,720
sleeping tablet so this is a kind of a

241
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,440
problem and solution called you know

242
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,160
kind of a match but i find problem with

243
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,160
that match so i i would say that the

244
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,720
organic farming

245
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,839
can definitely feed the world if you

246
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,920
follow the nutrition per acre and you

247
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,720
know maintain the ecology environment

248
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:32,000
and all that all said and done today we

249
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,519
produce something like 2600 million tons

250
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,480
of food

251
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:39,120
which if you calculate is more than

252
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,200
enough to be feed seven billion people

253
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,959
why are hung one one billion people

254
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,480
hundred core people are hungry and

255
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,600
malnourished

256
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,040
why are 125 crore people are overfed and

257
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,800
obese

258
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,959
so it is not the production that the

259
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,920
product we have problem with but the

260
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,839
distribution but the diversity and all

261
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,600
that and all said and done today you

262
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,800
take for example

263
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,200
government

264
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,560
across the world they subsidize chemical

265
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,360
forming

266
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,279
if you put poison you are subsidized if

267
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,360
you don't put you save the nature and

268
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,200
give you a healthy food

269
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,360
there is no incentive

270
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,839
and people ask why is it more costly

271
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,760
people don't understand the hidden cost

272
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,600
of food production do you know there is

273
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,160
one connection many well-known people

274
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,839
are saying that when you subsidize wrong

275
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,920
food you end up being obese

276
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,920
you don't see the link apparently you

277
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,399
don't see the link but let's say i

278
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,959
subsidize urea and i subsidize one

279
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,600
single variety of rice i subsidize

280
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,760
processing i give you white rice and you

281
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,160
eat it and you become sick so i'm saying

282
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,880
and then i subsidize hospital care i

283
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:50,000
subsidize insurance look at the economy

284
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:52,399
we run our own diseases

285
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,360
should we not think of you know how to

286
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,800
how to be preventive in diseases how to

287
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,519
be proactive

288
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,760
so

289
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,680
there is enough food and food can be

290
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,440
take for example india which is 60 is

291
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,519
dry land you can't use fertilizers

292
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,399
pesticide in dry land but india has

293
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,720
forgotten dry land and we import 60 000

294
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,720
crore worth of oil from

295
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,399
south america and malaysia

296
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,240
is a massive quantity of oil we don't

297
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,120
grow oil seeds in this country and if we

298
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,360
can tackle the dry landforming which is

299
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,480
possible to do in organically

300
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,480
you know the echo divers you know

301
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,680
ecologically fragile regions

302
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,760
so i see if you see what we have done is

303
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,079
in the current economic system we

304
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,640
exclude ecology and social cost

305
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:37,200
they say what is the cost of pollination

306
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,959
by bees the fao says about

307
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,640
300 billion dollar

308
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,959
there's a cost of pollination but we

309
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,279
don't account for it that is why you

310
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:47,680
always miss the wood for trees people

311
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,519
ask that is why it is sad that you know

312
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,279
people we have great answers but

313
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,320
unfortunately for wrong questions in our

314
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,800
production

315
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,120
you know system today

316
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,760
so ragu now tell me how difficult is it

317
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,760
in india to do organic farming

318
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,320
is it easy or is very difficult right

319
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,399
now at this situation i would say there

320
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,160
are a lot of community knowledge

321
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,160
when it comes to human health when it

322
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,720
comes to agriculture when it comes to

323
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,560
animal husbandry how do todas you know

324
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,240
the tribes in nilgiris take care of

325
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,200
buffalos they know better than a doctor

326
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,200
there

327
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,079
do they not have do don't they know how

328
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,920
to take care of animal health they know

329
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,160
i have a book called wild health by

330
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,519
cindy she stole how do animals take care

331
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,440
of their health

332
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,720
no i'm not saying you know you don't

333
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,240
want science and

334
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,560
technology but you also see that

335
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,040
something is working already

336
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,040
something is already working

337
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,519
you see the natural forming and you know

338
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,360
without see if i can grow food in a

339
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,880
complementary way

340
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,040
typically it is like this why does a

341
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,880
pest emerge when there is monoculture

342
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,160
when there is water logging when i have

343
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,000
used when

344
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,440
soil fertility is connected to pest

345
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,320
emergence

346
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,639
suppose i have a beautiful manure of

347
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,880
microbe in the soil and the good humus

348
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,360
in the soil higher carbon content in the

349
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,639
soil then the best emergence is very

350
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,600
less

351
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,920
so the deeper connection in nature

352
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,839
see don't you have a narrow construct

353
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,560
deeper connection in nature then you say

354
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:16,800
the pest is not because the by pest

355
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,880
itself but because you provided a

356
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,360
conducive environment for the best to

357
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:24,079
emerge and first to become more potent

358
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,000
you use pesticides and more pesticides

359
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:28,480
and they become more potent then you had

360
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,800
to genetically modified food in order to

361
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,920
resist the uh pest

362
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,279
so it is

363
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,519
typically you know it is said that it's

364
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,519
a treadmill technology where you know

365
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,399
you you keep moving but you don't move

366
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,079
at all it's like a sea waves they move

367
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,920
but they don't move away

368
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,760
they're there but you always make to

369
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,320
made to feel that it is progress is

370
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,079
happening development is happening but

371
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,120
all said and done i don't want to eat

372
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:55,360
food written riddled with poisons and

373
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,040
you know pesticides and antibiotics i

374
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,720
want to eat a healthy food

375
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,839
i don't want to subject myself i'm not a

376
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,839
guinea pig

377
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,160
i want to be healthy i want to be happy

378
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,720
or eat natural food i want to tear

379
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,639
diverse variety of food so that is what

380
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,440
i think you whether you call it organic

381
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,040
biodynamic at all i think the science

382
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,240
ecology was never considered as a

383
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,360
science

384
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,199
unfortunately even evo wilson the man

385
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,600
who popularized you know the ecological

386
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,199
concept within the in the harvard his

387
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,399
department was shut down

388
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,839
where they simply did this is not

389
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,199
science

390
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,639
science is show me

391
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,639
you produce something

392
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,000
you give me a plus b is equal to c plus

393
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,760
d do you show me something but in

394
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,600
ecology you can't show like that there

395
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,120
are complex connections

396
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,920
so that is why in order to preserve

397
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,079
ecology and you know diversity health

398
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,600
and without all these toxic residues

399
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,000
that come to us

400
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,480
and that's a threat to other beings also

401
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,800
so that is where i feel when you give

402
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,519
any name to organic you give biodynamics

403
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:56,480
any name you call it but it is high time

404
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,160
we thought that can our food be safe

405
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,920
see they see the current world revolves

406
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,120
around three things

407
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:05,920
insecurity uncertainty and unsafety what

408
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,639
uh sigmund bowman will known sociologist

409
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:11,440
calls as the trinity of the modern world

410
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:14,240
treaty of honor is unsafety insecurity

411
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,240
and uncertainty that's the problem

412
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,800
and in the production system he also

413
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,040
says that we create waste and one of the

414
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:23,199
waste is human beings themselves there

415
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,360
are waste products out of the economic

416
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:28,480
system so i think we need to go back to

417
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:31,360
eco technology sustainable farming

418
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,680
less input take for example urea today

419
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,320
in the beginning we gave one kg of urea

420
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:39,199
for 25 kg of food grain today 1 kg of

421
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,680
area urea yields only 7 kg of grain

422
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:44,320
imagine 30 million tons of area urea for

423
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:47,040
250 million tons of food grain

424
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,519
and it is you see the ratio is declining

425
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:52,639
year over year i think you will land up

426
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:55,040
using uh one kg of fertilizer for half

427
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,839
kg of grain

428
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,440
is that sustainable serious question or

429
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,519
i must also tell you that the phosphorus

430
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,199
for example that we make dap and

431
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,920
phosphorous compounds to feed the

432
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:07,440
agriculture the phosphorus is mind

433
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,880
and the nature and many of the best

434
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,480
science journals peer review journals

435
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,560
say that at the current rate of

436
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,399
phosphorus mining it would last about

437
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,839
125 years

438
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,759
and you don't want the agriculture to

439
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,040
continue after that

440
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:22,399
what do you do

441
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:25,360
if you exhaust your minds

442
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:27,920
is there no other way we can grow food

443
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,040
so the input dependent intensive input

444
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,440
dependent

445
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,839
uh you know technological fixes do not

446
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,079
help us in the long run you need science

447
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,240
you need deeper science larger science

448
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:40,399
to understand all this understand the

449
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,240
human nutrition requirement biodiversity

450
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,079
requirement ecological requirement and

451
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,320
you all forming today for example wes

452
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,160
jackson a brilliant guy in the us the

453
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,120
land institute he talks about perennial

454
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,360
crops

455
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,360
you need not even plow every day every

456
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,279
year and plant and replant and

457
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,399
transplant and all that can you have

458
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,800
perennial

459
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,800
agriculture without the imports i mean

460
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,720
that's something seriously we should but

461
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,640
of course when you when you do something

462
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,039
when you do an agriculture without the

463
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,480
input it doesn't help the pharmaceutical

464
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,079
industry it doesn't help the chemical

465
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,679
industry it doesn't help the government

466
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,919
it doesn't help the subsidy it doesn't

467
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,559
help anybody so raghu one last question

468
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:19,199
how healthy healthy is organic food yeah

469
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:21,520
see if you ask how healthy i should ask

470
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:24,160
you is if you think that the little bit

471
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:26,000
of pesticide and antibiotics are okay

472
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,000
then it is not so healthy

473
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,360
uh if you think that um

474
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,480
you know more nutrients and

475
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,160
phytochemicals and antioxidants are not

476
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,919
all that important then it's no

477
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,840
different there is no difference so you

478
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:40,240
see where you should look at this see if

479
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:43,360
you look if you do the comparison

480
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:46,400
based on this narrow nutrition concept

481
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,320
of carbohydrate protein fat and all that

482
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,679
you will know you may not see much

483
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,919
difference but if you look at the amino

484
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,880
acids if you look at the phytonutrient

485
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,799
profile

486
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,640
if you look at the harm the pesticides

487
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,840
and antibiotic residues can do to your

488
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,960
human health you see a world of

489
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,039
difference but you see the problem you

490
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,799
see matt ridley who wrote this famous

491
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,640
book called rational optimus where he

492
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,400
says that in the

493
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,559
high yield era

494
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,880
we have produced large quantity of

495
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,559
starch which is sugary which he says

496
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,360
that there is more amylopectin and

497
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,880
lesser formylose which means that it

498
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,799
floods your blood

499
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,960
quickly what you eat floats your blood

500
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:25,679
quickly and you don't spend the energy

501
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,600
it lands up being stored as fat

502
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,960
so there is a serious problem you see

503
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:33,360
the very production system you have

504
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,520
agriculture scientists are disconnected

505
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,640
from nutritional aspect nutritional

506
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,679
scientists are disconnected from

507
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,080
something else that is always a

508
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,799
disconnected but if you see

509
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:45,520
the to to see the real value you should

510
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:48,080
be able to connect this way that

511
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,840
when i give see we all have to derive 60

512
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,640
of starch for our energy because the

513
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,880
blood and brain uses only starches

514
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,919
the energy source but what kind of

515
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:00,799
starch are you eating high in you know

516
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:04,160
this sugary starch or complex star

517
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:06,559
starch then you see the difference

518
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,600
a cow that walks a lot and eats

519
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:11,360
diversity of plant you will have better

520
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,440
nutrition in the milk you will have

521
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,919
higher omega-3 fatty acid

522
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,320
than a cow that is always tied to its

523
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,919
shed and you know just change from one

524
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,400
shed to another shed you will see a

525
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,559
difference in the milk milk quality so i

526
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,559
would say that the the difference that

527
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,080
you will have to see uh you know if you

528
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,679
really see they say that's why you know

529
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,760
oscar wilde's famous statement that we

530
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,080
today the modern a knows the price of

531
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,919
everything but the value of nothing

532
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,559
so you will have to discriminate this

533
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,880
way then you see the real change as i

534
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,880
said you know that there are all large

535
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,960
number of unknown compounds

536
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,520
unknown compound don't take the current

537
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,200
yardstick and judge and decide

538
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,200
you know that's why see we have one lakh

539
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,120
variety of rice but if you see the

540
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,200
nutrition value of indian foods or the

541
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:59,120
nutrition table of the us fda and many

542
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:01,919
of the fao tables you give you get one

543
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,360
table for rice

544
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,360
are they all same

545
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,120
no they are not same

546
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,960
you have different varieties of rice

547
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,000
different they they speak in different

548
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,160
colors

549
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,400
size shape

550
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,240
yield whole lot of difference you see

551
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,679
but nutritionally they are same how can

552
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,600
they be same

553
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,240
that's why you know rumi the great sufi

554
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,160
saint said if you call me a shia sunni

555
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,039
hindu muslim christian and putting me

556
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:29,919
put me into any box that will be your

557
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:32,320
coughing yeah so you must be able it's

558
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:34,240
not that you know you this it's not that

559
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:37,120
that the world changes but you need to

560
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,640
develop a new eye to see this

561
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,200
because our current

562
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,559
scientific eye with which we see

563
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,480
