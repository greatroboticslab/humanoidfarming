1
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:16,470
I want them to talk about how we can

2
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:19,500
prevent revolution by planting sweet

3
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:22,320
potato sweet potatoes as one of the

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,949
other cards that we teach justify mass

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:29,310
to planting their gardens now these are

6
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:33,420
the sweet potatoes with ran statute so

7
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:36,059
that when we plant the tubes we can have

8
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:39,719
these tubes having the sweet potatoes

9
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:43,950
that we hit during them grid fast even

10
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:48,719
at tea time at lunch and even at supper

11
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:50,760
the first thing that we do we just we

12
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,309
dig the terraces you can see these are

13
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:57,030
the trusses about that so are continuing

14
00:00:53,309 --> 00:01:01,800
these terraces then we plant these sweet

15
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:05,159
potatoes at there you can see the other

16
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:08,850
top so that when the sweet potatoes have

17
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:12,000
their sweets then just and inside and

18
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:14,310
when we plant the sweet potatoes we

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,150
plant right this way you can see how I

20
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:23,820
do plant them one on this end the other

21
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:26,850
one on the other side they will do the

22
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,400
conservation funny you can see how we

23
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:32,369
plant them when we plant the other signs

24
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,570
that are not designed still turns even

25
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:36,420
their trees

26
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:39,439
I have even they have a kind of cheese

27
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:42,299
in my garden this is how we plant them

28
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:48,000
you can see it haha one on the other

29
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:50,850
side so that the time of covering these

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,850
ones this wire on the side they cover

31
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:57,119
designed and those who that one on the

32
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:59,790
other side the kaabah down those trusses

33
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:03,689
so when the rain comes they are the stop

34
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:06,509
of the rains the rain to move the the

35
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:09,360
swamp so that the smoke and not Ruth its

36
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:12,590
fertility so they these terraces they

37
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,590
are the one that there are

38
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:38,070
still they're here you can see the

39
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:38,070
hubba-hubbas back that up to in nineteen

40
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:51,010
Cuarenta in my candle can see have front

41
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:54,340
and haha these ones today just trying to

42
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:57,370
make it today to the way that these they

43
00:02:54,340 --> 00:03:01,090
are so that I can feed my family through

44
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:03,640
this one still I can't have the bins to

45
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:05,830
fill the cut row and you know these fans

46
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:09,490
they have a lot of protein in the cut

47
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:12,130
row still I can tell they're sweet

48
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:16,060
potatoes that I would move from there

49
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:19,540
from this belt and my children can take

50
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:23,830
it as a food to attend certain to get

51
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:27,240
some him come and I think that is the

52
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:32,530
way we are mitigating to that it is

53
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:35,470
during now so this is my Cantor and I'm

54
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:38,380
still continuing to think how I can

55
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:41,050
change though we are too high can change

56
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:43,900
from the way we used to move out and

57
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:46,750
stay at home and keeping myself busy

58
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:50,260
doing something so that I won't get a

59
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:53,920
stretch so that our joy the place that

60
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:57,239
the ham and hand something from my stay

61
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,239
at home thank you
