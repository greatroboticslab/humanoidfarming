00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,240
a small community in the Pacific

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:06,799
Northwest a dynamic company is growing

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,400
this company has served the equipment

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:12,040
dealer market for 30 years they did it

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:15,880
by following their principles by being

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:17,520
the best and by being honest to their

7
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:21,910
customers

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:36,040

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,960
I think the unique thing about Johnson

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,160
Tractor and maybe it isn't unique to us

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,960
but our industry is an awful lot of hard

13
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,440
work in the spring and the fall I came

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,000
from the banking world and we worked

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,480
hard there but this is different the

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,600
pace in the spring and the fall is very

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,399
hectic we try to do what we can to keep

18
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,000
our customers going and eliminate any

19
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:05,400
downtime they might have and I see our

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:10,000
employees giving 110 120% during those

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:13,080
times and I think that is

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,040
unique they seem tired sometimes but

23
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,320
happy to do it uh it's a it's a

24
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,799
different pace and it isn't for

25
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,360
everybody but we have surrounded

26
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,240
ourselves with an awful lot of good

27
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,159
people who are very committed to their

28
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:29,960
jobs and I think that's good for us and

29
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:29,960
it's especially good for our customers

30
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,520
and I think employees have a way of of

31
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:38,680
working with each other and teaching

32
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,399
each other um they sort of start to

33
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,040
learn and I think we all have what's

34
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:45,159
acceptable in a workplace and what is

35
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:48,040
the norm um Leon Eric worked very hard

36
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:50,799
during the those busy months too and I

37
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:53,360
think that's an example um we try to be

38
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,920
flexible with our employees as far as we

39
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,079
don't want them to miss family events

40
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,880
and and trying to schedule their time

41
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:00,360
appropriately so I think they see that

42
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,039
and then are willing to make go the

43
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,799
extra mile when we need them as well um

44
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:06,600
so I I think they learn from each other

45
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,920
I think we all try to have a team

46
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,879
approach um it's fun to see them problem

47
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,400
solving with a technician and a parts

48
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:14,840
person and maybe Leo and Eric all

49
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,080
working on something together to get a

50
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:20,720
farmer going and that's what it's all

51
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,720
about and and I think they enjoy the

52
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:27,519
