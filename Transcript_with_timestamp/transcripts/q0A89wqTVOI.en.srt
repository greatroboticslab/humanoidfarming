[Music]

2
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:26,560
Morrison farming was formed in 2008 um

3
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,439
prior to that I was farming in

4
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,359
partnership with my brother Richard and

5
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,960
my Father John and and um and we were on

6
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:37,000
half of the original uh Family Farm

7
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,719
since um since 1864 and over the other

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,239
side of the road uh was a distant cousin

9
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:43,920
gram uh working away battling Away by

10
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,039
himself on the other half of the

11
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,800
original business so so we'd always sort

12
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:50,039
of thought well it would be nice to to

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,840
get the original land back together as

14
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:56,359
one piece conflict can be an interesting

15
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:58,879
part of um of Family Farms I guess um I

16
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:01,079
guess um we have our moments uh at

17
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,920
Morrison farming uh like like like a lot

18
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,280
of families so so but look one of the

19
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:08,439
great things that that alleviates a lot

20
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,680
of the tension or or some of the

21
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:13,040
conflict anyway is the fact that um is

22
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,040
that we now have a bigger area um from

23
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,439
450 acres we're now up to 35,000 Acres

24
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,119
so we're not living and working in each

25
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:22,439
other's Pockets we also have um have

26
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:24,560
have different skill sets and interests

27
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:27,000
within the farming business so so each

28
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,119
of the each of the directors uh has

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,520
looks after different portfolios and

30
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,960
oversees those Parts sure they have to

31
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,439
um turn up to the the Morrison farming

32
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,240
meetings and and and justify their

33
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:41,399
performance and that they've reached

34
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:45,880
their kpis um but we all have the um the

35
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:49,040
freedom to to to work uh with ourselves

36
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,600
or or or with others and um work on work

37
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,600
on the portfolios that we're in charge

38
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,600
of
