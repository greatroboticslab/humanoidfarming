  "text": "welcome to my view from the woods in today's video we're gonna transplant some tomato and pepper plants that I started in early February some of them are doing pretty good other ones are a little sickly and I want to give them a little boost this is how I'm gonna do it [Music] [Music] the first thing I do is make sure that I label them correctly so I just put the name these are gonna be Tiny Tim Tomatoes I started them on to eight and I'm transplanting today on three thirteen I put that on some tape so I can take it off on my salad cup and then I'll fill the cup with the on the side around the bottom where are they here we go so the ones that have the slots cut in the bottom maybe you can see them better this way let me start did or when the cup slide it on I'll put the soil on the cup slotted on the bottom I don't really label them because I generally keep them all together so just on the outside it's good so the first tomatoes I'm gonna do our Arctic rose tomatoes I did I planted these on February first I planted them I supposed to plant three seeds but you can see I kind of doubled two of them up so I have five plants in here so I've taken my cups with the slots in the bottom and fill them with potting soil her seed starting mix it's actually my that's announced a new mix it's not my seat started mixing sunny potting mix I'll talk more about that in another video I've just sort of sort of compacted the bottom half and then put a little divot into it what I'm gonna do is take this spoon that I found at the dollar store the other day it's nice and pointed I really like it it's gonna dig these out well I'm gonna dig these tomato plants out of this Cup lay them down on this cardboard that way I can just put the soil into my compost bin and put the plants right into the new cups so let's get started on that so I'm just gonna go around the edges where I can get the cup in or the spoon in dig it down under I don't know how big big the roots are and just sort of pry and then once they're loose sort of just dig around here where you can see it better and pull the plants out now I don't put this soil right back into here I'm gonna compost this in case there's any problems or any issues in it that way I'm not spreading any diseases order funguses or anything that may be in it I'll just restart it so here's my root ball my two plants you can see that well I'll put it in this hand and now I just need to separate these two again that ideal I might cut these it really depends on how the root systems break apart especially since especially if you're new to the channel I'm planning these in an indoor garden so I don't need 30 tomato plants I'm gonna give the other ones away but instead of hurting a plant I might just want to sacrifice one so this one's a little bit wheat compared to this one I'm probably gonna clip this one plant this clip this off in a few days and just let the one plant grow I think that's what I'll do that way I'm not gonna damage either of them I can just cut the plant and have it live so I'm just gonna take this a little root ball put it into my divot and my cup get it upright and then push some of the soil around it so it's upright compact a little bit and then add a little bit more new soil and spread that around the plant tomatoes you can plan a little bit deeper around the stem I try not to keep it as level as I can to where it was growing and you can see I'll probably take this plant here and cut this one that I'm bending down off he's left with this plant you see how it grows so let me repeat that through the other plants and see how it goes make sure I put it in the right cup Karthik rose and I put the date again and I put the date on it if you can see it too once the plant date in 313 s a transplant date again this is the salad cup later on I'll be mixing up some fertilizer mix and I'll water gently from the top and then put water in the bottom Cup stick this Cup in it and the water will be absorbed through the medium and in through those holes so let me go through these elements real quick [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] there we go it's a lot of those five plants I'm gonna get four and I'll probably pick the two best throw those up you get the other ones away [Music] other soil I just put my compost compost [Music] I'll throw into the rest of these and then I'll get right back with you when I get on all the transplant stuff so here's what I ended up with I ended up with four plants of the Arctic Rose tomatoes and five of the jalapenos and then I ended up with six seven of the tiny arms are they tiny temps yeah the Tiny Tim's I'm gonna put a link below that shows you where I purchased these seeds you want to take a look at these varieties I'm really excited about this Tiny Tim I think that's gonna be a great little indoor plant so I'm gonna put these on my plant rack and then I'll take you for a tour how I do that and what else I got growing I do have some more transplants to do but I'm not doing today I have to go to work and it's gonna be pretty miserable there's about six or eight inches of new snow out there today but such is life but I rather work outdoors and indoors so let's take you over to the plant stand okay we're back to the plant table plants shelf plant something I don't know what I want to call it the planting area I guess now that's planning area was the other room so I guess this is the growing area on the shelf so I got the plants all set i top watered the plants today I don't really have time to do a fertilization a little bit of a process I'm gonna put that into a separate video and the reasons why I'm going through the process and just doing a simple fertilizer I think they're good reasons but I'll share with those you later so let's take a look at the plants as I have them set up and I'm gonna talk about a couple of the problems that I think cause those transplants are cause those ceilings to be a little bit short and weak so here's the transplants I have them under just some regular LED lights I'm gonna lower the lights when I get down to filming here these lights are from Home Depot they're just three-foot LEDs they seem to be doing pretty good with the plants I had because I had again the colors because of the lights they're under now but I grew this lettuce salad mix under those lights and it grew well as well as you can see them in the back those green onions and a few little Swiss chard I still have some endive and some basil oh I'm gonna put into today's breakfast but reason they're purples because of the lights are called unit fun lights I thought they would be great the reviews were good but I think they stunted the tomatoes and the pepper plants that along with my seeding mix the first time was a little dense I a sense of added some perlite to it and what I planted in today is called royal gold basement mix it's a good planning mix it was recommended to me I'm probably gonna keep experimenting with planting mixes the reason I went with a mix instead of making my own is because I don't have the room to compost all the forest products that are in the potting soils I want to use there's some basil and that there is some cilantro that I only putting in the pots and then these are the ones I transplanted today only top watered them back to the planting mixes I don't have the room to compost all the forest materials that are in the soils so I had to go with again a soilless mix I went with a coconut coir base but I think it's worked pretty good and the proof is in the pudding because here are some plants and be focus these plants are only 15 or 16 days old and they were planted in that raw gold and I think the other thing is this Lighting's I'll step back these lights are the bulbs that just go into regular outlets they seem to work really well you can see they're doing a great job on the microgreens here's some I just planted two days ago here's a bunch of basil there's some cilantro let me turn the lights off see if that helps with the color they do have a little bit of color I guess it just gets too dark but I guess you can see the true color again I'll shut this head up it's gonna get dark but you can see the real they're nice and green micro greens especially and then it tomato plants and peppers and cilantro so I think it's a combination of light and the mix so hopefully I got that straightened around again here's the ones I did today I think they're gonna grow a lot better what are these lights than they are going to under these unify mites so I don't know if I should put these on eBay I don't know how I feel about that whether I should just like to cut my losses and have them as backups or try them on something else high that's what I'll do I don't want to give anyone self I'll like to someone that I don't think works well so that's my video today got some transplants the next time I go over my fertilizer routine and what I'm not gonna recommend that the fertilizer that I'm gonna do to anyone it's sort of complex so but there's reasons why and I'll explain them and I'll find a simpler method for everyone else so I'm gonna leave you on a note it's gonna take a while Cameron focus but you can just see what it's like [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay that's my view of the woods for today and hope to see you in the next video please like and comment I love comments leave me some comments what you think and if you what you what your experiences are I really like the comments and if you haven't
