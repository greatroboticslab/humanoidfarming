00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:12,160
Agri machines today we are going to

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,599
explore a modern farming model that is

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,920
becoming increasingly popular and highly

5
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:19,199
effective growing melons and grained H

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,720
houses not only does this model bring

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,480
High productivity but it also protects

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,720
crops from external environmental

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:30,640

12
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,719
growing melons in green houses has

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,640
several major advantages compared to

14
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,360
open field cultivation firstly green

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,520
houses protect plants from extreme

16
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,719
weather conditions like heavy rain

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,480
scorching heat or Frost ensuring

18
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,559
consistent quality and yield throughout

19
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,760
the year independent of weather

20
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,039
conditions furthermore the greenhouse

21
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:00,000
environment is closely controlled

22
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,199
temperature humidity and irrigation are

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,439
optimized for the plant's growth as a

24
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:06,680
result melons grown in green houses are

25
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:10,080
often of higher quality with evenly

26
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:12,280
ripened sweeter fruits this model also

27
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,799
minimizes the intrusion of pests in

28
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,119
diseases reducing the need for

29
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,840
pesticides green houses allow for

30
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,439
efficient water use with automatic drip

31
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,439
irrigation systems that conserve natural

[Music]

34
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,600
to get started we first need to

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,960
construct a greenhouse the design and

36
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,600
installation must ensure durability and

37
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,439
protection for the plants green houses

38
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,640
are typically built with sturdy steel

39
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,320
frames and covered with UV resistant

40
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,759
polyethylene film allowing the plants to

41
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,560
absorb sunlight without damage

42
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,479
ventilation and temperature control

43
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,920
systems are also installed to maintain

44
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,920
ideal growing conditions for the melons

46
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,879
once the greenhouse is ready the next

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,360
step is preparing the soil and planting

48
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,640
seeds the soil in the greenhouse must be

49
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,680
loosened and enriched with nutrients

50
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:21,920
Farmers plant the melon seeds in rows or

51
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:24,480
pots space 30 50 c apart giving each

52
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,640

53
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,560
through a drip system ensuring each

54
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,440
plant receives the right amount of water

55
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,599

56
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,319
LED Lighting systems can be installed to

57
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,310
supplement sunlight especially during

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,680
a crucial step in their growth process

62
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:53,200
ensuring fruit formation cucumber plants

63
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,159
have both male and female flowers and

64
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,879
for fruit to developed pollen from the

65
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:59,560
male flour must be transferred to the

66
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,000
female flour typically this process is

67
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,879
carried carried out by pollinating

68
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,280
insects such as bees as bees fly from

male flowers to female flowers in

Greenhouse farming Farmers often use

72
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,480
manual pollination methods using small

73
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,040
brushes to transfer the pollen or they

74
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:20,879
raise honeybees within the greenhouse to

75
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:23,519
ensure efficient pollination this helps

76
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,970
the cucumber plants produce even fruits

77
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:43,450
