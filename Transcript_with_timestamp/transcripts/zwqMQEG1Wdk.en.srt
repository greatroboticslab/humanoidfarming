Hi! I’m Lendert. I am a scientist and I work at Wageningen University in the Netherlands.

2
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,480
On the website www.best4soil.eu go to the page "Database".

3
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,060
Read the explanation on this page and then scroll down

4
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:31,500
to choose one of the two databases.

5
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,660
If the database is not in your language you change this

6
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:42,320
by choosing the language in the top left corner.

7
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,020
But for the moment we continue in English.

8
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,020
The demonstration of the database uses the example in

9
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,880
the Best4Soil factsheet on crop rotation.

10
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,240
First, you choose the country.

11
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,580
Then you choose the soil type.

12
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:19,160
Then you add the name of your request.

13
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:25,060
Now you select the crops.

14
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:29,720
You do this if possible already in the right order.

15
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,680
There are three groups of crops: Field crops including black fallow

16
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,400
Green manure and cover crops,

17
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:54,360
and vegetables (including strawberry).

18
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:03,200
In "Crop selection" you can change the order of the crop sequence.

19
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,980
Now you select the nematode species you would like to add to your request.

20
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,500
Then you click on the "Create scheme" button.

21
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,940
A pdf-file will now show up.

22
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,500
Depending on your device and your brower, this happens directly

23
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,620
or you have to check your downloaded files.

24
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,500
On the scheme you can see the crops in the selected order

25
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,820
The nematode species  are displayed in the header,

26
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,360
and just below you will see the soil types.

27
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,020
The colour of a cell describes the damage caused by

28
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,060
a nematode species to a host plant

29
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,520
The symbol in a cell describes the host status of a

30
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,120
plant for a nematode species

31
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,500
The letters of a column describe for which soil type

32
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,980
the information is valid

33
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:02,540
You can change the order of the crops by clicking on the arrows left of the crops.

34
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,220
You can remove a crop from your request.

35
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:17,220
You can also add a crop (or fallow) a second time to your request.

36
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,880
Background information is available by clicking on a cell.

37
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,900
For example onion & Dytylenchus dipsaci

38
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,420
or onion & Paratrichodorus teres

39
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,160
or potato & Globodera spp.

40
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,420
or potato & Paratrichodorus teres.
