00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:10,170
you know one of the secrets to having

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:13,380
strawberries and be able to harvest them

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:16,010
organically isn't that you have to use

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:19,170
pesticides but you have to keep up on

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:20,730
processing your crop as you can see here

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,070
this is my strawberry bed and there's

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,199
still a lot of strawberries in here I've

9
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,609
picked all these strawberries in the

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,670
last couple minutes and there's still a

11
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:31,289
lot to be had but what happens with a

12
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,880
strawberry bed is you get a lot of these

13
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,370
little sow bugs and a lot of other

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,010
little guys in there and you have to

15
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:40,610
pick them before the bugs get started on

16
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:46,320
them I pick them when they're just ripe

17
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:49,050
tomorrow all these will be - right so -

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,780
another day but if you let them sit for

19
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,340
just a little bit too long you'll start

20
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,640
getting a little bug bites all over them

21
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,590
from the the sow bugs also if you can

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,390
kind of pull them up as you're doing the

23
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,850
ones that are still white pull them up

24
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:13,140
so that they're not sitting right on the

25
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:14,630
ground that helps a lot and if they're

26
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,759
too ripe like this one right here

27
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:20,299
actually I just I just throw them back

28
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,500
on the ground let the sow bugs have them

29
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:24,090
I'd be nice to be able to just come in

30
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,520
here and poison them and put all kinds

31
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,470
of stuff in here but I like I'd like to

32
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:33,420
be able to just take a fresh strawberry

33
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:39,400
right from the patch I know there's no

34
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:43,659
poison in there when I start picking

35
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,659

36
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:50,820
so there's still good bachelor

37
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:55,740
strawberries in here I've been getting

38
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:58,830
from this bed that's four feet wide by

39
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:01,020
12 feet long I've been getting at least

40
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:05,430
one the two baskets of strawberries

41
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:08,789
every day and I usually eat them as I

42
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,090
pick them but strawberry pass has got to

43
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:13,189
get one

44
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,189
