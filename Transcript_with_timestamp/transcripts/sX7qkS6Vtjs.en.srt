one of the most important things we've

6
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,519
done to make our operation succeed is

7
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,520

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,279
the best education that I've received in

11
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,240

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,280
definitely be the rotational system it

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,360
