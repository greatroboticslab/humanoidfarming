  "text": "my name is mark morgan from clarksville johnson county we're here at peach picking paradise we grow peaches about 25 varieties spread out uh over about seven weeks or so of harvest and uh today we're going to be answering some questions about peach production in arkansas okay so the first question is uh you know there used to be a lot more peach orchards in arkansas uh maybe how come there there aren't as many uh around today you know there used to be a lot more peach orchards around i remember even just growing up there there was more orchards in the state i think it's a combination of things you know it's a very difficult crop to rely on cash flow there's good years and bad years and it's it's very difficult from a financial standpoint to keep that even the other thing is labor we still do so much with peaches as far as hand harvesting hand proving uh you know thinning it's a lot of shoulders and elbows as far as you know the mechanicalization as you know tractors things like that they have in the row crop side we haven't got as much of that in our industry and so it's uh you know finding labor at the right times is uh is definitely a challenge all right the next question uh how long uh will a peach tree bear fruit uh you know if you're going if you're planting in the ground that hadn't had peaches on it you know you really should be able to get 20 years maybe even or more out of that tree as far as us we've been in commercial production kind of on the same soils for a while we're we're really shooting more for that 15 uh just because uh it's had so many peaches on it in the past but uh you know really 20 years or longer you know if you take care of it it'll it takes about that third year uh to to really start producing them but uh but yeah 20 15 20 years in arkansas [Applause] all right our uh our next question was kind of uh you know as far as uh peach what the what the calendar looks like what we're doing uh certain times a year uh we usually start we're in bloom now obviously uh but we usually start uh in january doing pruning we prune january february hope to be done before bloom we've got a little bit left here but that's really whenever we're coming in and pruning if we're lucky enough to have a you know this is the time of year we start really looking for freezes we want to avoid those to have a crop you know april may june sometimes you can have two full of a crop where a peach will put on way too many peaches that it could stand so we have to come in and thin that then there'll be harvest season uh of course irrigation you know uh mowing around the trees keeping the weeds down stuff like that and then in the fall after we're done harvesting we come in uh do some uh do some work to to really get ready for the next year's crop as far as uh you know looking for peach tree borers spraying uh and and really uh helping that tree have the best setup it can be for the next year so when is the peak peach season in arkansas uh you know in arkansas we can grow peaches june july august uh really even september to october most uh mostly for us it's july you know we start uh mid-june and really go through august but uh july you know we try to be going by july 4th we've got the peach festival in johnson county the third week of july july is really whenever we get going here in clarksville all right the next question is uh what it uh why do peaches have fuzz or what is the uh the peach fuzz on the peach uh the the fuzz really is a a defense mechanism you know it keeps uh certain insects uh from either you know traveling over the fruit or laying eggs on it so it's really uh it's a helpful thing to in in defense of some insects we uh you know if you look at the some of the newer varieties the old-timers used to talk about all the fuzz you know being in the air and the packing shed and i think the newer varieties have a little bit less fuzz on them than they used to uh you know there's also the nectarine and nectarine uh is a peach you know pretty much it on the inside it is it just does not have fuzz on the outside it has a recessive gene that doesn't doesn't put on fuzz so [Applause] all right our next question uh the difference between uh freestone peaches and cling peaches uh so on a peach you know it's gonna have the stone or the seed in the middle you know a freestone would just break right off the off the seed the the first freestone really developed commercially with the alberta since then they've developed tons of free stones a lot of people prefer the freestones but we also you know the cling you can't just break it apart it's going to stick to the seed but a lot of the cling varieties we grow have a pretty big following and that people would come you know just specifically to get that cling uh you know if you're just cooking with it or whatever the free stone may be a little bit easier uh but if you know what you're doing with the cling and uh really uh are used to that you know more traditional taste it has a big following as well the next question is uh can i plant a peach pit and grow my own tree uh yeah you can't you can grow a tree from a pit the issue is is uh all of our uh peach trees are grafted so you know they have a root stock and then the variety grafted onto it so it's kind of a hybrid tree so the the seed you plant you're not going to get exactly you know what kind of peach it came from there's going to be a little bit of variance there but yeah it will grow a tree you can you can get a peach tree from a pit so do animals like deer and squirrel like to eat peaches yes yes and no we all you know we have to have a deer fence uh we've got so much deer pressure that uh the deer don't necessarily eat the peaches as much as where they really hurt us as they eat the leaves especially on younger trees they can come through and just you know eat all the leaves and then all of a sudden you don't have any leaves the tree's dead squirrels that they're gonna you know you'll see squirrels going out and taking ripe peaches out all the time uh you know our our theory on that you just got to grow more than they can carry out they're going to get their share got another question about like how do you keep insects off your peaches well it depends on the time of year you know this time of year we're in bloom we don't want any insecticides or anything we've got our bees working now later in the year whenever you start getting closer to harvest we have to keep a pretty routine spray schedule to keep keep insects off of the fruit you know your local county extension agent uh can provide all kinds of uh spray programs and things like that uh it's uh you know something that you kind of need to stay on top of but you also you need to do scouting to go out uh to see what your issues are because sometimes you may go out and you may not have any issues sometimes you may start uh you know seeing the development of something that could turn into a bigger issue so you know scouting and uh and contacting your county extension agent would be uh my recommendation all right and the final question uh why don't people say uh that they're feeling peachy when they're feeling happy uh you know i really don't know that's uh you've always heard that or peachy keen or all that stuff you know i just know that uh you know when it's harvest season and and we've got fresh fruit uh out here and it's you know it's from an arkansas peach orchard uh and they can taste it you know i think to me that's what feeling peachy is you know it's just that fresh uh you know hadn't been processed it's just right there and fresh and that's sure hard to beat and so uh we're looking forward to having a good uh good crop this year so far so good hopefully it'll stay with us and uh you know go uh go eat some local arkansas peaches this year at your local peach orchard uh [Music]",
