1
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,160
thank you br uh good afternoon everybody

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,360
uh my name is AEL

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,359
Garcia can you he me

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:20,760
there uh I am the irrigation specialist

5
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:23,359
uh as you can see here we have several

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,920
uh trials uh as regarded to

7
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:30,080
irrigation uh most of them are kind of

8
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:32,320
high-tech but uh we are looking at two

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,320
ways to provide information to our

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,800
producers uh one is the applied research

11
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,879
and the other one is a little bit more

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:43,239
basic uh the overall objective of these

13
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:45,559
projects are to study uh drought

14
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:48,920
tolerance in this case for

15
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:51,600
corn uh you might think that uh we know

16
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:54,079
everything about drug tolerant for corn

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,039
but basically what happens is that uh

18
00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:00,000
Wyoming has a really unique environment

19
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,480
and uh and it's even much more unique if

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,119
if we come to this part of the state so

21
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,960
it's very dry really really very dry we

22
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:11,479
haven't had rainall at all and uh we

23
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,600
wonder what we should do as producers If

24
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:16,080
eventually we don't have enough water at

25
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,960
certain point during the growing season

26
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,960
so we are going to try to respond to

27
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:23,759
those things uh the much more practical

28
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,400
issue is related to uh water balance we

29
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,799
want to know how much water the crop

30
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,280
uses for in this environment and also we

31
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,840
would like to know what what is the

32
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:36,479
water use efficiency of the Corn well

33
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:41,240
how we how do we do that we do following

34
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:42,640
different uh methodologies we use uh

35
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,960
some things that are called crop

36
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,159
simulation models to support our field

37
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,920
research we also use what you see there

38
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,640
are infrared thermometers what we do

39
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:56,240
with those equipments are to measure the

40
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,560
temperature of the canopy and actually

41
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:02,640
when the plant is transpiring uh the

42
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:06,159
plant Co off is cooler than the

43
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,920
temperature of the air so those infrared

44
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,440
thermometers are able to measure to

45
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:14,000
determine that temperature in the canopy

46
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,239
the information is sent every certain

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,879
period of time

48
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,480
to a station that you can see there in

49
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:24,000
the middle of the experiment and Via

50
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,720
radio the information is sent directly

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,480
to our

52
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:34,800
office uh this work is is uh part of the

53
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:38,560
research uh of Marcelo arita he is my

54
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,480
PhD student soell um so he's going to

55
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,640
develop this project during four years

56
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,200
he started just now this

57
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,680
season this system here is a Surface

58
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,560
treat irrigated it's a system that we

59
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,360
installed this year and the reason uh

60
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,200
why we are using treat irrigation for

61
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,080
corn here is mostly because we need to

62
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,599
know exactly the amount of water that we

63
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,000
are applying to the crop so so by having

64
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:06,440
this system we can do that very easy and

65
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,360
uh if you need to know a little bit more

66
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,959
about the specifics of that you should

67
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:13,159
ask Marcelo he's the one that is running

68
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,000
all the programs in his computer that

69
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:16,879
just comes from time to time to his

70
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,680
office and see whether or not everything

71
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:24,280
is okay sometimes actually he corrects

72
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:28,760
me and uh what else

73
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:32,120
uh as uh Dr has said we have several

74
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:34,159
experiments similar to this one and this

75
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,640
is on the surface trip we have another

76
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:39,080
one over there is the subsurface DP and

77
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,400
we have a third one far away there in in

78
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,799
the sprinkler

79
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,840
system one of the Practical results

80
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,920
we've gotten so far is that for example

81
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,959
we

82
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:53,120
compared uh yield of corn produced on

83
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:55,599
these systems with the flooded one uh in

84
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,200
terms of yield we got pretty much the

85
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:01,159
same but the water use efficiency of

86
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:04,640
this irrigation systems is really very

87
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:07,200
high for the crops is very high and uh

88
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,680
we were able to reduce the amount of

89
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,840
water that the crop needs in more than

90
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:16,320
four times I mean 25% of the water that

91
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:19,479
we are using uh 25% of the water we use

92
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,280
uh in a flooded irrigation is the one we

93
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:25,560
are using here at most so as you can see

94
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:27,600
the crop looks really very healthy and

95
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,520
we are expecting this year to have even

96
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,160
even a little bit more y than the other

97
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,960
uh irrigation

98
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,240
systems uh this is what I have for you

99
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:39,919
in this first stop uh if you have any

100
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,919
questions please uh feel

101
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,600
free yes sir

102
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,840
nit nitrogen rate I don't remember

103
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,639
Marcel I think we

104
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:54,919
app here was kind of

105
00:04:51,639 --> 00:05:00,880
150 almost pounds per

106
00:04:54,919 --> 00:05:02,960
acre 150 pounds per acre yeah

107
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,120
any other

108
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,199
question have you had any trouble with

109
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,560
these hoses clogging up with weeds well

110
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:12,720
it's uh first time and this is on

111
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,960
Surface uh I don't think we will have

112
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,840
problems right now uh it's first year I

113
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:21,280
mean from uh moss and such in the

114
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,600
irrigation water no we don't do know

115
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,319
it's from a well yeah it's from a well

116
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,880
yeah yeah good for you thank you so you

117
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:29,319
might just tell the other trailer what

118
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,639
the question was excuse me what was the

119
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:33,160
question

120
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,600
oh uh the question was whether or not we

121
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,479
have some problems with clogging

122
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,479
emitters here due to uh WS or something

123
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:44,120
like that but the water is a is a well

124
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:47,479
water so it's no problem so

125
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,479
far any other

126
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,360
question is there any plan certainly

127
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,199
water use efficiency is one of the

128
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,400
budgets budgets that you're looking at

129
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:59,000
what about the economics of of this

130
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,199
system compared to Conventional uh Mike

131
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,479
moris as asking about the economics of

132
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,840
this as compared to Conventional uh we

133
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:08,360
don't have yet of course it's first year

134
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,720
but we plan to we plan to to look at

135
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:14,360
that as

136
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:18,520
well thank you sure yes sir the I think

137
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:22,919
the well maybe it's uh cold than the

138
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:26,560
natural water uh is there difference the

139
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:31,120
well water and the natural water yes the

140
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:34,319
quality uh mainly to the to the uh Co

141
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,440
production yes well there is one thing

142
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,520
here we don't get rainfall at all

143
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:41,120
hopefully we don't we won't get today

144
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:44,199
but we don't get rainall at all the corn

145
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:47,880
approximately needs 400 MM the whole

146
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:49,720
season divide by 25 it gives you inches

147
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,800
uh here if you do not irrigate you don't

148
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:55,879
produce actually yeah but uh the

149
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,639
difference in water rainfall or well

150
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:00,360
water is mainly the quality yeah

151
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,000
rainfall is much better

152
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:06,879
than we were the difference I mean the

153
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
difference to the production oh

154
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:11,680
production

155
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,960
well no I don't know I don't know but

156
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,960
probably there is not a huge

157
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:22,240
difference yes Iration test yes but uh

158
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,879
we shouldn't have too much difference uh

159
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,000
the question here is whether or not

160
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:30,680
there are differences in yield with uh

161
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:34,479
rainfall water or well water no no R

162
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:38,400
that's uh the natural water natural

163
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:42,639
water yes CH water canal oh Canal water

164
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:46,440
okay differen is between uh ditch water

165
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:48,639
and uh yeah well water well the the main

166
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:51,560
the main difference is quality still Yes

167
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:55,919
quality and the the temperature of

168
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,919
course yes temperature as well
