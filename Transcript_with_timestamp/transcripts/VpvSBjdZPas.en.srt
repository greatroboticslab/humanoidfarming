00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,160
hello and welcome to an early morning

2
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,080
episode

3
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,519
in this one i finally get to prune my

4
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,679
apple trees

5
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,279
so right now we are in about a week and

6
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,120
a couple of days away from

7
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,360
spring which is a little late to be

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,640
honest ideally we'll do this in january

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,719
or february

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,160
but the buds haven't broken yet there's

11
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,200
no green showing

12
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,280
so it's not too late we're still good so

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,160
i'm gonna do it now

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,399
now these trees are one year old which

15
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,440
means i've had them for one year

16
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,440
um i think when i got them they were

17
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,800
probably about a year old

18
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,000
still for the nursery to grow them

19
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,280
because obviously they have to get them

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,199
up to size

21
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,280
so they're about two years old in total

22
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,680
now it is pretty normal for your tree to

23
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,080
be about one or two years old

24
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,000
now as far as pruning goes there's a

25
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,400
couple different choices

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
most commonly for apples and pears you

27
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,680
would prune them to what's called a

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,439
central leader

29
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,040
which is where you have a single trunk

30
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,600
coming up

31
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,680
and then anywhere from three to five

32
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,520
branches coming off horizontally

33
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,159
where all your fruit is going to be on

34
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,280
these branches are ideally spaced out

35
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,960
pretty evenly um it's let's say

36
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,560
two or three inches or about ten

37
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,040
centimeters apart

38
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,880
so they all get their own light and they

39
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,040
all face a different direction so like

40
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,640
north south south east west

41
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,880
you know they all get their own little

42
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,920
space all facing out a different

43
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,040
direction

44
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,799
all around the center of the tree from

45
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,960
the center of the tree

46
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,200
alternatively you could also prune them

47
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,920
and this is most common for stone fruits

48
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,399
in something that's called a vase shape

49
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,159
or

50
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:04,000
also called an open center this

51
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,759
what you do is you lop off the top of

52
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,680
the tree usually about

53
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,840
30 centimeters about a foot off the

54
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,480
ground so like say

55
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,879
right here maybe a branch left over they

56
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,680
will

57
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,120
all come off down here about three or

58
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,360
four branches

59
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,040
shooting up again spaced out evenly but

60
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,480
they're all coming from the same

61
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,680
the same point that causes problems when

62
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,080
you have

63
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,760
snow or anything like that weighing down

64
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,720
on those branches that's why it's not

65
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,080
ideal

66
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,879
these branches they might snipe off

67
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,560
so what i'm going to be doing is pruning

68
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,200
my apple trees into something that's

69
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,760
called

70
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,400
a modified central leader i got this

71
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,120
idea from steven at home from skill cult

72
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,800
so give credit where credit is due i was

73
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,640
always going to do a central leader

74
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,080
with a modified central leader sounds

75
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,840
even better this is where you're

76
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,560
combining the central leader

77
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,319
and the voice shape combined you have

78
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,040
your branches coming out

79
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,440
evenly along the trunk and they're all

80
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,680
go

81
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,640
growing up to kind of compete with that

82
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,400
central leader

83
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,239
so you don't get that too much of that

84
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,080
apical dominance it's just apples that

85
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,080
parents like to do

86
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,840
so you have about three or four branches

87
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,840
ideally coming out horizontally

88
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,720
growing up all competing then for that

89
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,040
for that main

90
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,239
apical dominance which it helps to keep

91
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,879
your tree small

92
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,159
and i'll explain and document and show

93
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,879
you how i'm going to do this

94
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,560
as we go along so with that said let's

95
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,879
get down to the first tree

96
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,319
which is my calypso so with the

97
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,760
one-year-old apple tree there's really

98
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,319
not a whole lot of pruning that you have

99
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,959
to do

100
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,400
it's more so just guiding it into the

101
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,840
form that you're trying to train your

102
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,000
fruit tree in

103
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,959
and as you do this every year you'll

104
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,840
find that there's just

105
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,840
it's just maintaining the the shape that

106
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,120
you have set up for your tree and it's

107
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,680
becomes very little work really so the

108
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,519
first one

109
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,040
branch it's pretty obvious you can see

110
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,280
it's swooping down

111
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,239
ideally this tree was swooping over a

112
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,480
little bit more

113
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,840
and i had it tied up at the top here to

114
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,239
kind of straighten it out

115
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,680
because it was very it was leaning over

116
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,439
a lot

117
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,519
and that caused this branch which was

118
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,560
horizontal to be very

119
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:17,680
swooping so i'm going to correct that

120
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,880
first off and how we're going to do that

121
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,040
is by pruning it down to a bud that it

122
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,120
comes out more horizontally

123
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,120
and ideally it's on the top here so

124
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,919
it'll also swoop up a little bit

125
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,280
so this bud right here fits that build

126
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,479
perfectly

127
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,639
so i'm just going to prune it down to

128
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,120
this bud which will take off

129
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,199
all that swooping motion that we've got

130
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,240
going on currently

131
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:45,280
so here we go we're gonna leave a little

132
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,280
bit of a stub right there

133
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,800
just like that takes off all that

134
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,960
swooping action

135
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,240
that we don't want

136
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,759
there's only one other branch that i

137
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,759
want to prune on this tree and that's at

138
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,400
the top so let me show you that now

139
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,600
so as you can see i still have it tied

140
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,039
up

141
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,960
although i could probably remove that

142
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,639
after this year

143
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,639
as you can also see i've got way more

144
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,080
than the three to five branches that i

145
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,360
was suggesting

146
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,000
i'm not really worried about it i'm

147
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,039
gonna do my own interpretation of it

148
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,039
i feel like as long as it has you know

149
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,280
light then it should be fine

150
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,240
then it will be fine i'm gonna i guess

151
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,720
it's gonna be a little bit of an

152
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,880
experiment but i know it'll be fine

153
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,240
a lot of this is also fruiting wood like

154
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,560
this

155
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,240
back here there's some fruiting wood

156
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,400
i've even got some up here

157
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,560
and down here and obviously don't remove

158
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,479
that down here

159
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,240
i obviously don't want to remove that so

160
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,600
12 branches i'll be leaving

161
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,360
but i'm going to be maintaining it over

162
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,680
the years and i'll be taking you guys

163
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,680
along

164
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,000
now the brands that i was talking about

165
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,759
is that

166
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,600
little fork that you have here and this

167
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,080
is kind of what i'm talking about

168
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,840
with guiding the tree you can see that

169
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,800
i've got two branches coming off of the

170
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,400
same area

171
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,319
which is not ideal it's going to swell

172
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,240
up so you're just going to want to

173
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,120
remove one of them

174
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,400
however if you look a little further you

175
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,000
can see that

176
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,400
this branch is already here

177
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,080
which currently is being shared right

178
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,000
above this one so that's not good these

179
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,440
two are going to compete

180
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,759
for light so ideally what i want to do

181
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,479
is remove this one and then just let

182
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,400
this one

183
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,600
take over because this has more of its

184
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,520
own area

185
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,800
you know this one is a little it's going

186
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,919
on a slightly different

187
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,759
angle than this one down below here

188
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,800
so that's the type of things i would

189
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,600
want you to think about when you're

190
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,319
making these pruning cuts

191
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,560
now i'm going to prune this which might

192
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,039
start sparking

193
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,080
little buds and growth happening at the

194
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,759
cut point here

195
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,520
which you're going to want to take out

196
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,039
when the time comes you could just rub

197
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,840
off the little

198
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:03,840
little buds there leave a little bit of

199
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:05,520
a stub

200
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,160
and there we go so there's a little bit

201
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,160
of a stub there

202
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,840
it's a little bit of a stub it's going

203
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,039
to have more branch spark out

204
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,680
and we're going to want to remove those

205
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,800
because we already have a main branch

206
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,280
in this one that's already going to be

207
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:25,199
the main scaffold so we don't need

208
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:26,880
that branch any branches beside it

209
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,160
so that's pretty much this tree done

210
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:32,960
it's it's very minor like i said it's

211
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,319
just small changes that you're making to

212
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,240
the tree

213
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,520
so let's go on to the next one now so

214
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,039
this is my odisso apple

215
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,960
and i'm really glad that i have multiple

216
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,479
trees to prune because it really allows

217
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,039
me to show you some of the different

218
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:49,759
scenarios that you're going to run into

219
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,520
when you're pruning your trees so with

220
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,199
this one there's really only one branch

221
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,960
that i want to remove

222
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:59,280
and that's the fact that they

223
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,800
have two central leaders you don't want

224
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,759
that you want just a single central

225
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,520
leader

226
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,960
so that you know you just have one

227
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,120
single trunk coming up where all the

228
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:10,560
energy can go into

229
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,919
having two is not good it's just gonna

230
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,919
compe they're just gonna compete

231
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:17,039
together and you just don't want that

232
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:20,080
ideally you just have one

233
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,199
where all the energy can go into i'm

234
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,840
gonna leave this

235
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:26,000
branch right here this could be a side

236
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,080
branch

237
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,160
or alternatively really what you could

238
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,840
do is if you didn't

239
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,000
so let's say i didn't want this branch

240
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,599
here what i could do

241
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,959
is prune it off right there

242
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:43,919
it would then have a new

243
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,720
leader here to take over rather than

244
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,880
this one

245
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,800
but i don't mind this branch being here

246
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,800
so i can just prune this lower one off

247
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:58,000
and that is what i'm gonna do

248
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,560
so same thing with the other one i'm

249
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,240
gonna leave a little bit of a stub here

250
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,000
and any branches that are gonna come off

251
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:09,839
of it i might remove

252
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,839
we'll just take it as it happens

253
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,120
it's a bit of a stub

254
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,519
it's kind of hard to do one-handed

255
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,800
but there it goes

256
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,959
and that's really all i want to do to

257
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,519
this tree

258
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,519
one single leader alternatively if i

259
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,160
didn't want it to be this high

260
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:37,839
i could take down this height down a

261
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,839
little bit this might be too high

262
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:44,640
ah i don't mind my tree being about

263
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,760
seven or eight foot high

264
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:50,000
so i'm going to leave it in this case

265
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,399
but you might decide that you want to

266
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,440
reduce the height on this a little bit

267
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:58,880
in which case she would just take it

268
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:01,279
down to one of these buds that grows a

269
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:05,279
favorable direction

270
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:07,350
so i can take over

271
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,720
you know what actually

272
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:10,560
[Music]

273
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,160
i might just take it off a little bit

274
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,240
because you're going to get

275
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,480
i'm going to prune this off and i'm

276
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,200
going to have essentially a second

277
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,440
row of scaffolds that are going to be

278
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,360
the canopy of the tree up here

279
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,959
that's part of the modified central

280
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,959
leader

281
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:31,680
technique there is to have

282
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:33,200
your scaffolds down low and have your

283
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,920
central leader all the way to tippy top

284
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,000
have a second

285
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,959
um second set of scaffolds that are

286
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,560
gonna keep it small

287
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,000
so i thought i could have to be a little

288
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,200
bit taller but

289
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,200
you're gonna have to take that second

290
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,640
scaffold in the top here you have to

291
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,320
keep that in mind

292
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,640
so i actually will have to prune this

293
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,360
off because if i have a scaffold up top

294
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,040
here

295
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,360
that's going to be way too tall even for

296
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,760
me so i'm going to prune it down a

297
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,600
little bit

298
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,839
and then see where i go so i'm gonna

299
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,839
take

300
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,279
i'm gonna take it down

301
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,480
this is probably about

302
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,600
two meters so about seven foot then you

303
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,440
have to add on another foot

304
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:20,800
for the second set of scaffolds so

305
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,560
i'm gonna take it down to here a fair

306
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,079
chunk

307
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,920
we'll start with that i could always

308
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,540
adjust later all right

309
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:31,040
so here we go boom

310
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:36,320
[Music]

311
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:38,800
and that's it so yeah so this is gonna

312
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,040
this is gonna subdivide all along here

313
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,399
over the course of uh the growing season

314
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,839
because you know what they do is they

315
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,160
send up a long

316
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,240
straight chute and then they subdivide

317
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,760
later on

318
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,320
so we'll see where the branches come out

319
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,920
and uh next year we'll take the next

320
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,959
step

321
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,720
on to the next tree so the last tree

322
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,399
here

323
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,920
i kind of messed it with this red maple

324
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:07,120
here but

325
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:07,120
it's the same thing you can see here

326
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:15,440
this this main scaffold is coming out

327
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,120
way too vertical okay you can see how

328
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,639
it's not coming out horizontal like at

329
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,079
all like maybe this branch down here is

330
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,560
actually a perfect example

331
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,600
it comes out nice and horizontal this

332
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,839
one

333
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,880
really wants to be the main leader i

334
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,040
don't want it to be the main leader

335
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:32,160
because i already have a main leader

336
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,760
so this one has to come out that's

337
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:39,760
what's going to be

338
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:44,959
the first operation here get in there

339
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:52,399
burn it off and you can just see

340
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:56,560
how tall it got

341
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:58,079
hello kitty yeah so it just got way too

342
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,279
tall

343
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,839
i'm going to be shooting for about seven

344
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,200
foot

345
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:07,040
as well and then uh extra scaffold

346
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,279
the last top scaffold will be another

347
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,279
foot

348
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,360
so that'll make it eight feet which you

349
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,560
know i'm relatively tall so that should

350
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,160
be comfortable for me

351
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,880
obviously you can adjust this to

352
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:22,639
whatever is comfortable for you

353
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:25,120
this is about seven foot a little bit of

354
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:28,639
a stub here

355
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:34,800
take all that top growth off

356
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:39,120
there we go boom

357
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,760
it's done so that's all the pruning i'll

358
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,079
be doing

359
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,560
on my apple trees this year it's not

360
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:47,040
very much like i said in the first year

361
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,000
i'm not you won't have to do a whole lot

362
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,120
and if you just do it every

363
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,519
year it'll all just become just

364
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,040
maintaining it's very easy

365
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,560
all right guys so that's all the pruning

366
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,680
i'm going to be doing this year

367
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,120
on these apple trees and i really feel

368
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,120
like this modified central leader is

369
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,519
going to be the best way to go about it

370
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,199
for

371
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,000
these apple trees i just think it's

372
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:11,120
going to be a much more natural looking

373
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,920
tree rather than you know they're pretty

374
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,440
tailored and catered to trees that you

375
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,399
see in a normal orchard i

376
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,399
feel like this is going to look more

377
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,079
natural and i also think it's going to

378
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,199
be more healthy in the long run because

379
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,600
it is

380
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,120
you know there's more more branching and

381
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,240
better branching and all that stuff

382
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,240
going on

383
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,079
and not like the floss shape i just i'm

384
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,600
not a big fan of it even when i do get

385
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,480
stoned for at some point i'll probably

386
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,920
be

387
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,440
pruning them in a similar fashion to be

388
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,560
honest and we'll just kind of see how

389
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,279
that goes

390
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,160
so i appreciate you coming along thank

391
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:45,600
you for watching

392
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:45,600
and we'll see you in the next one
