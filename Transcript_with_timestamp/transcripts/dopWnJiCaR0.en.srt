2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:16,710
my Jenny was a bit tough the economy was

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:19,529
very bad in snubbull no jobs companies

4
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:22,250
they were closing so I decided to come

5
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:29,740
into South Africa looking for work

6
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:32,530

7
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:34,610
my first chance was operating a forklift

8
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:38,150
because that was the only available

9
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:40,340
option I had previous experience from

10
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:43,340
warm then I had some experience

11
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:47,870
well the mechanical is just a little bit

12
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:49,670
I could do all sort of small jobs so

13
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:53,450
they realized as time went on that this

14
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:55,700
guy can easily adapt now I'm a Pecos

15
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:59,510
manager for the tomato pickers and the

16
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:02,420
banana pick house I would say maybe

17
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:04,610
Agriculture's one of the sector where

18
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,470
it's had people from neighboring

19
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:07,880
countries to come for employment with

20
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:10,550
other places to find a job is very

21
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,770
difficult so people will migrate with

22
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:14,630
this area because they want to get

23
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:18,140
better life for their families they want

24
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:21,920
at least to get employment Africa is the

25
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:24,050
youngest continent full of energy but at

26
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,600
the same time is a continent with an

27
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:29,090
enormous unemployment every year we

28
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:33,229
would need to be generating 12 to 13

29
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:35,330
million of job for the new entrants into

30
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:38,509
the market economy and Africa only

31
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:40,940
generates 3 million this is again why I

32
00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:44,119
believe sustainable agriculture and

33
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:47,929
limit smart agriculture and rural areas

34
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:50,569
play a crucial role agriculture is I

35
00:01:47,929 --> 00:01:53,539
think it gives more jobs than any other

36
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:57,009
jobs and people adapt easier to

37
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:59,600
agriculture you see they learn quickly

38
00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:01,490
because it's there even in the rules if

39
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,420
there are homes people still practice

40
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:07,459
agriculture it at small bases most of

41
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:09,740
the times they already know they work

42
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:12,430
but they need to adapt a little bit to

43
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:14,630
the circumstances of the hosting country

44
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:17,180
capacity-building rates immediate

45
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:19,130
benefits and a win-win situation both

46
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:21,680
for migrants and for the hosting

47
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:24,349
communities doesn't matter the girl

48
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,790
black or white or ever to studying the

49
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:27,260
farm because that's where there is an

50
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,760
economy if you found then you're

51
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:31,130
creating major opportunities for other

52
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,980
people as well and then there is a

53
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:36,230
program from the government that people

54
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:38,390
must that be must be sent to other

55
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:40,640
able to farm and all the days why we are

56
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:42,019
now even giving a University of Milan so

57
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,489
there is a need for us we keep on

58
00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:45,489
training people to be farmers

59
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:51,080
one of the strengths is to provide the

60
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:53,420
adequate skills to migrants or non

61
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:56,120
migrants to rural communities in order

62
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:58,430
to make agriculture modern they need to

63
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,680
to learn new agricultural techniques

64
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:02,720
they need to learn how to strain the

65
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06,530
value change of Agriculture that goes

66
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:10,120
from the harvesting and the consumer so

67
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:13,370
to reinforce agribusiness to reinforce

68
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:16,069
harvesting transportation market

69
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:18,170
opportunities we bring them to the land

70
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:22,299
we started working with them with some

71
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:22,299
time to refer to let them work May 4

72
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:32,120
2007 with method working by my hands

73
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,849
myself then I was then a foreman

74
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:37,819
supervisor managed and then now I'm

75
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:40,280
happy to be production manager if if

76
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:43,010
good potential they give you space they

77
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,560
try to teach you so after a long term

78
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:48,620
somebody decides to go back there with a

79
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,510
lot of work experience we do train them

80
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:52,220
to become farmers because we believe if

81
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:54,360
we empower them then you will be

82
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:59,940
empowering the nation

83
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:03,780
a big issue for us is that rural areas

84
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:05,820
have been neglected and that youth live

85
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,280
in rural areas a growing population in

86
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:10,620
Africa that is supposed to double by

87
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,680
2050 and that's why we're working

88
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,390
constantly to make agriculture

89
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,870
attractive to connect agriculture with

90
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:20,670
rural and urban linkages to make

91
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:23,550
agriculture part of the value chain to

92
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:26,010
make subsistence agriculture closer to

93
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:28,650
agribusiness to bring innovation to

94
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:30,960
bring ideas and successes stories so

95
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:33,870
other youth when watching the neighbor

96
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:39,060
succeeding can also replicate with a

97
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:42,419
good example when I came from to be

98
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:46,890
frank I was just an ordinary guy but for

99
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:50,880
now I have learned a lot I've got the 16

100
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:53,310
year old boy who is in Zimbabwe I send

101
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,450
money every time there I - after three

102
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:59,280
months for food for school fees

103
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:01,110
everything you'll be going to university

104
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,900
I'm not worried about paying for you

105
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:06,650
I'll be able to do so so it changes

106
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,650
somebody's lives

107
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:10,050
you
