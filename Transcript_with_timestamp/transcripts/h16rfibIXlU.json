  "text": "hey y'all it's betsy from happily ever after etc and i am back with another gardening video so today i have a few things to plant not a lot but i figured might as well pop out here and talk about it just a little bit so the first two things i have to plant are some more of these really pretty blue lobelias so they are smaller they only get six to 12 inches tall but they do get pretty wide and i picked up two more one here and one down there for the new garden bed when i first got these i think i got one two three four five of them um and i really liked them but i went back to get some more for this bed they were sold out so went back this week and they had some more i was very excited so i grabbed a one for all the way down at the end i needed just one more down there and two for this garden bed to just kind of tie it all together and give it that short little fun front layer that i needed in a few places so we're gonna pop those in and then i'm going to be planting some proven winners truffle of pink gomprina so i will put a picture up on the screen [Music] of what these look like i grew them last year right in here you can see i'll show you up close i have one coming back i planted four now these babies get like two to almost three feet tall and wide and they they take a little bit to start going like maybe mid-june mid-july they really start to put on growth and then they just explode so i like to interplant them um well i say i like like i've done it a million times last year i had the idea that i would interplant them with my fox glove because the fox glove only blooms in the spring you can see it is it is not done there are definitely still new sims new socks coming up but it is a spring flowering plant it is a biannual so it only comes up and blooms once every two year then you plant you plant new ones for next year and so i do have two of those growing in that will bloom for me next year and i'm going to be planning some more of the camelot mix next year which holds in its first year but regardless whichever type you have first year second year whatever year they only bloom in the spring and sometimes very early summer they do not bloom all summer long um and so i love this little spot with my sweet little bird bath and those long tall spikes behind my lower layers and so the gomphrena that doesn't start really putting on exploding growth until june or july is perfect i interpret it with the fox gloves and they are also a tall pink airy spike kind of flower and so as the fox gloves fade out the vampirina really starts to take over and i always have that beautiful tall pink element in that mid layer of my garden bed here on this here i'll have the glass behind it so that'll be even prettier but i'm very excited so my mom actually went and just picked those up i am at home because i have to go every 30 minutes and check on our new puppies cinnamon if you guys have been watching me i've had cinnamon with me glued to my hip for the last like two weeks she finally had her puppies so they are resting inside they're not old enough to come out here yet but i can't leave the house for a while because i have to be on puppy watch so mom went to get the grandparent and as soon as she gets here we will pop those in the ground and i will show them off to you but right now i'm gonna stop talking i'm gonna put these two lobelias in the ground and get them watered in [Music] coming together y'all [Music] [Music] all right y'all the truffula pink gumprina is here i'm so excited i absolutely loved these last year so they are like little pink cotton candy puff balls the pollinators love them that they wanted and they are just so pretty and they really like once they get going they fill in and they were a massive presence right here behind my little bird bath so um mom went and got these like i said she got 18 of them 10 for her i asked for eight so i will show you exactly how i'm going to put them in here over here right down there i have my one that came back from last year now these are annuals they are not perennials i'm not sure why that one came back the other three didn't i think it's because it's just closest to the porch and it was really protected and i am down here in alabama 8b almost florida so i do think that maybe if i cut these back to the ground next year and i really want to make a wreath out of these because i have seen so many people do dried gumprina wreaths and they're beautiful so i really want to harvest a bunch this year and make a big wreath so that will give me some motivation cut them back to the ground i'm going to mulch over them and we'll just see if they come back all of them next year so i'm gonna put four in right here so again they fill in amongst the fox glove and then i think i'm gonna put four more down on the other side i really liked these last year and i wanted them in more places in my garden so i'm going to put them down um in front of some of my iris that are also about to be out of bloom and hopefully these will do well on that side as well it'll also be a bit of an experiment because these are definitely full sun plants this spot gets a lot of sun it doesn't get quite as much down there um i have my peonies down there because they need less sun so i do think these will do okay down there i don't think they'll get as big so it's going to be a bit of an experiment to see how they do in other parts of my garden maybe next year i'll put them even more places i don't know but like you saw on the top they are um 22 to 28 tall spacing is a minimum of 12 to 18 inches they get well that's the width um they are annuals except for end zones 9a to 11b and hearty down to 30 degrees they do say you want to fertilize them for best results so i will start to fertilize them and full sun dead deadheading not necessary drought tolerant heat tolerant i mean these guys are workhorses so let's go ahead and place them and see what we think [Music] so i definitely want one right here kind of right behind the little girl and then i think i want one on either [Music] that's definitely 12 to 18 inches [Music] i think that's better that'll give me more about 18 inches trying not to fall over crush anything [Music] that was a bug it was my own hair [Music] okay so that's what i'm going to do so you can see the fox club are clint in a triangle and i've just flipped that over and made a reverse triangle with the gomphrena that way as the fox glove are going away the gomphrena are coming up i do need one more over there [Music] oh [Music] i have a fox glove right here and i have this hydrangea right here so it kind of makes it a little hard to put this exactly 12 to 18 inches i don't want it to crowd the hydrangea either but i think that's good i am going to go ahead pop down to the other side and see where i want to place these for because if there is a better spot for five over there then i might just stick with four on this side and do five over there so give me two seconds [Music] okay y'all so i'm definitely gonna move this one down there i have spots for five of them down kind of behind my panties i just planted two peony plants um and it is their first year they are not going to flower this year they're going to grow big and beautiful and hopefully next year we'll have blooms but they're pretty little this year and you need to leave quite a bit of air around candies check out my video that i did i'm still learning but i did a lot of research on how to grow candies in south because it is hard and i got a lot of good tips from other people so i want to share them with all of you but you need a lot of air there's so many maps eat a lot of air around your peonies when they're fully grown and so there is a lot of space around them right now that they do not need this year but they will need in um the new year the year after that in the next couple years as they grow so filling that space with annuals is not necessary but it is a good way to still have color in that space that will eventually be filled with beautiful peonies and this year can be filled with beautiful gum free so we'll stop talking about it we're going to put these babies in the ground got my gloves i've got my little shovel this area is pretty tilled up i um i planted here last year and i used my auger to really aerate the soil before i planted this here so i'm going to try to use my little spade so as not to disturb the roots of the things already growing i do not want to hurt the fox gloves or the hydrangea or anything else that i have in here especially my fox gloves that i have going for next year because then i've started at ground zero all over also i need new gloves i love these but i have literally literally more holes in them all right i'm gonna be careful cause i do have a couple seeds in here that still haven't germinated they might not they might be dead but i'm hoping they'll still come up they're also for fox club so eventually i want this whole area to be full of foxglove as well as over there just popping out of the back border with the gladiolus and the iris but oxford expensive i bought a bunch of seats to start for next year i'm going to start them inside like a real gardener [Music] and you're just buying things at the big box store or at your local nursery which is where i got these three i actually have not seen a single fox glove at a big box store this year i've been looking so i wanted to get some more inexpensive ones haven't seen any these i all bought from dolphin nurseries which is my favorite local nursery here in the area check them out um other two the white ones that are almost done i got from buzz and blossom's nursery which is actually i believe owned by the same family they're a little rebound so let's just tease them yes [Music] that was literally perfect i don't know if you were supposed to cut these back as you plant them like you are with some other things like um petunias or verbena i'm not going to because i still want to enjoy the fox gloves so i definitely don't want the comprehensive start growing like mad yet they shouldn't they need heat to really grow but you know if i should cut them back or not leave a comment down below [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] definitely saving these because i have eight of them mom has ten and they both came with trays and does that look this look like the perfect size pot to plant a fox glove seedling up into to grow before i transplant it to the garden right it does [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] see how these have the little pink balls and these have the pink spires they're very similar [Music] of course they're not bells there aren't multiple spires but you know they're pretty close [Music] gonna get these it is literally the end of the day shadiest part possible but still human and alafrica mammal and get these babies watered in go pop the other five in and i'm gonna call it a day i am hot [Music] [Music] all right y'all i have my three little truffle pinks here and another two here behind this peony and behind this peony i also moved the begonias up so all these begonias were here last year and for some reason they're coming back so i'm just gonna let them do their thing and we'll see how they do but you saw i had to pull out some old landscaping fabric i put it in last year when i did the border and it was to suppress all the grass but the grass is definitely dead under there and it was starting to inhibit the growth of some of these things you cut a hole for your plant but i would notice at least with the begonias they weren't growing through properly the bigger rooted things were fine so i've just been pulling it from around the begonias and hopefully they will fill in better this year but there's that truffula pink it should give us a nice mid layer there once all these iris are done and back there as well we'll see how they do over here since it's not as sunny but in the meantime let's pop over here real quick and i will show you up close the other ones and we will be done all right you can see that baby truffle of pink there and there and whoop one right there so this is the one right here in front of this box club it's coming back from last year they're not too different of a size so we will just see how this area fell down but i gotta go take care of cinnamon and those puppies so i'll see y'all later bye [Music] [Music] you",
