00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,279
Here is my Shirou plum tree. And after a

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,400
few years of patience, it's finally

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:10,639
bearing fruit for the first time. Shirou

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,360
plums are a Japanese variety known for

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,519
their sweet, juicy yellow flesh and mild

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,840
flavor. They're also one of the earliest

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,920
plums to ripen in the summer, usually

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,519
ready around July, depending on where

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:27,039
you live. These trees grow best in USDA

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:29,840
zones 5 through 9. Mine's here in zone

11
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,600
8b and it's been thriving with full sun,

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,680
good drainage, and regular

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:38,879
watering. Shirro plum trees can grow to

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,719
about 15 to 20 ft tall. However, with

15
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,280
pruning, you can easily keep them

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,719
smaller and more manageable. I'm keeping

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,559
mine between 6 and 8 ft tall. I do a bit

18
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,160
of light pruning in late winter to shape

19
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:55,360
it and let more light into the canopy. I

20
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,600
planted this tree about 3 years ago and

21
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,079
Chirro plums usually start producing

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,640
fruit in their third to fifth year after

23
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,720
planting. This one is just starting now

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,840
and it's a great reminder that sometimes

25
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,479
you just have to wait for the good

26
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,280
stuff. These are partially

27
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,400
self-pollinating, but they'll produce

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,000
much better with a compatible pollinator

29
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:18,320
nearby. Something like a Burbank or

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,759
Santa Rosa plum can really boost the

31
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,920
yield.

32
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,560
The fruit starts off green and gradually

33
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,560
turns a soft yellow as it ripens. You'll

34
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,040
know it's ready when the skin turns

35
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,759
golden and the fruit gives slightly to

36
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,640
the touch. They come off with a gentle

37
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,759
twist and are best picked just before

38
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,680
they're fully soft for the sweetest

39
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:42,000
flavor. Shirro plums are great for fresh

40
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,560
eating, but they also make amazing jams

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,360
and desserts. It's really been rewarding

42
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,600
to watch this tree grow and now finally

43
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,479
see the results. I can't wait to try

44
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,360
these plums and see what next year

45
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,360
brings.
