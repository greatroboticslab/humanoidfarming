  "text": "uh on behalf of uh hillary and adventure 37 i'd like to welcome everyone to uh the second part of our webinar webinar series this one on one health the critical crossroads of animal human and environmental environment health how do we really scale up one health my name's michael victor i'm the head of communications and knowledge management at uh at dillary uh and just wanted to mention that this is the second in the series the first one i was focused on uh uh was focused on leveraging livestock to combat malnutrition and i did put the link to the webinar in the chat so you can view it there so just as we get started it'd be great to if everyone could put their full name and organization uh on their name so you just go to your name click on more and you can then uh click on rename so you should be able to rename and put your full name and your organization helps everyone identify who is here you can also add your country if you want uh we will be enabling uh closed captioning which seems to help a little bit but there's always often mistakes so but it does sometimes help remember to keep your microphones off when not speaking i think most of the people we we have is a webinar so you won't have to worry about that uh if you can't see or hear uh please close and restart the zoom sometimes things get stuck again we we are going to be using the chat a lot so it'd be great if everybody could uh post questions or comments into the chat we'll have a moderator who will be able to feed questions uh to the panel when we have that and if you have questions to each of the speakers please put them into the chat and they can answer directly uh during the webinar uh and just remember that the session is recorded uh and any private chats are often also off often visible to us as well we will also be uh live tweeting uh so please uh you know please recognize that and we'll we'll be uh tweeting so you can also tweet i use the hashtag please why livestock matter which helps a lot maybe susan can put that into the chat okay great so with that i'd like to introduce mark mitchell to uh to kick us off and take us through the rest of the webinars thanks a lot and over to you mark all right thank you michael and i'm mark mitchell i'm the director of livestock and dairy activities with venture 37 and we're going to set the context for today's discussion with this short film it concerns land use policies um and how at times they can be unacquainted unintended consequences often at the expense of the ecosystems this video is on the privatization of land and around the uh mara serengeti in kenya in tanzania and demonstrates how diseases can spread when wildlife livestock and humans cross over into each other's spaces it's an integrated approach and we take it away please foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] in kenya is a classic example of what happens when landscape policies are developed without a one-held approach this is because one health supports integrated management of landscapes that enhance sustainable coexistence of agriculture and wildlife many experts such as ecologists vets public health professionals and others need to be involved in government and private sector decision making and planning processes this is um is [Music] [Music] nokia the choices we make about ecosystems have important consequences sometimes unintended ones on human and animal health a one health approach helps reduce further destruction and fragmentation of wild habitats incorporating biodiversity values while at the same time considering the health and nutrition needs of people [Music] okay thank you now i'd like to introduce uh christina rossell she's a scientist in the animal and human health program at illary christina holds a diploma of veterinary medicine and a phd in biomedical sciences she has led a number of projects on one health and now leads a new hillary-led bmz investment on improving animal and human health in uganda and helps conceptualize the bmz funded hillary one health center for africa which we'll hear about more in our panel discussion her particular interests include research on the epidemiology of diseases in the interface of livestock wildlife and human health parasitology working with students well in the north south and the south south technology and the knowledge transfer and we welcome you here today christina thank you thank you for the introduction and uh sorry to everyone who expected delia here today i am stepping in for her today and um yes i want to talk about the role of livestock research at the one health interface today uh just to set the scene for the following panelists and um coming from hillary of course our core business is livestock research and we are working based on a number of opportunities and challenges that have been identified over the years and one of the biggest challenges probably how to feed the global population in the future um because population growth is one of the biggest issues pressuring um our planet and we see that there's big disparity between current meat or animal source food consumption between high income and low and middle income countries and a majority of the population growth will happen in the global south in the future that's also where a lot of the potential is for growth of the sector for opportunities to reduce poverty um increase equity and livelihoods however all these things come with a lot of challenges and not only at a local level but also regional and global level that is of course the emergence of zoonotic diseases we know that more than two-thirds of the pathogens they originate in in animals and at some point in time um have a spillover event to humans also uh increased livestock production comes with an increase of ox antimicrobials or the livestock healthy which comes with a lot of pressure on the environment and microbes and increasing the risk for antimicrobial resistance more livestock also means more methane contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and of course global warming which needs to be limited and of course the more mammals for food or for eating that food to live on this planet the more we have environmental pollution land and water degradation which again increases um the risk for spillover so some of the key one health elements um that we focus on are to be prepared to detect and to respond and all of them just like in the one health venn diagram where all these three different circles uh overlap also these three components preparedness detection and response they also overlap and they cannot see independently and i'll give a few examples today and i think the following speakers they will then go more into the details and give more examples from their work so to be prepared we need to know where to put our money uh that's always a a big question by investors we want to solve all problems at the same time we don't know where to target investments often we come too late and try and solve problems when they're already there so data is one of the biggest issues we face in the global south we don't have data to prioritize we don't have data for surveillance and monitoring and therefore we also lack data to target our interventions and limited resources so that is one of the major contributions that um livestock research can make on top of that we have to utilize what we have and that is a lot of local capacity we don't have to take interventions that have worked in the north and implement them in the south and expect the same results we have to utilize local knowledge we have to localize you uh yeah local resources local capacity and try and build this capacity improve this capacity instead of trying to reinvent the wheel and i think bernard will talk more about this later and by being um prepared and investing early enough in data generation and building local capacity we can actually save a lot of money as these two examples show investment in yellow in the um [Music] in the right figure investment in keeping poultry uh vaccinating poultry uh against avian influenza can really reduce the economic burden on on affected countries the second component is detection and that's where biomedical sciences come in of course but also social sciences and of course we need to understand these different zoonotic pathogens we need to understand where they come from where they live how they survive in the environment is it mosquitoes is it waters is it wildlife reservoirs is it livestock reservoirs we need to understand the process from infection uh of humans uh and animals uh to the host immune response so we can also be able to develop diagnostic tools and vaccines and then we need to consolidate all this information that we have and develop strategies to target those and one example is shown here on the right that work is mostly generated by bernard and tim we look at data on rift valley fever we do entomological studies we know animal reservoirs for rift valley fever we know precipitation patterns we know uh altitudes we have all this data it's out there and we're trying to fill data gaps with our field surveys but then this data needs to be consolidated so that decision makers know okay we have a vaccine for livestock let's go to the high risk areas and these are the ones in red and we need this for many of the health subjects and this is a good transition to the response and the response is not just about having a vaccine ready it's also about getting to the vaccine to those people who need it and kovid is one of these examples in a in a global effort and miracle we have a vaccine already but in east africa and other parts of africa and southeast asia many people have not yet benefited from the vaccine it's very difficult to get it to people to have people accept the vaccine to have access to it governments are struggling with buying vaccines and therefore yeah the vaccine is not available and which leads again to a global problem of not having hurt immunity through vaccination kovit is just one example this happens with a number of the health interventions we are researching so these components acceptability accessibility affordability availability and incentives are quite crucial in getting interventions or research into use and that is also just as the way we're trying to generate data getting interventions out requires participation by uh the end users communities and i guess we'll hear a bit more about this about rangeland land management in a bit and finally i wanted to uh highlight again two of the recent publications that give very constructive advice to investors on where to invest what research gaps do we still have where are the data needs and how we can intervene in preventing not only the next pandemic but also preventing other uh health problems at the human animal environment interface these are also the neglected zoonotic diseases such as tapeworms brucellosis sleeping sickness diseases that usually affect low and middle income countries we also have a silent pandemic antimicrobial resistance so we're not just talking about the big scares um we give um yeah an investment advice for challenged these major anthropogenic drivers of synonyms so this is my little presentation to set the scene and now to i can take questions if that is in the agenda mark and otherwise i'll hand back to you all right thank you ma'am we're gonna switch quickly to um uh let's see bernard and i'm gonna skip through this quickly so that bernard gains a little time back and if you are ready to go bernard you can start talking to us about the policy process and the scaling out at your level thank you thanks mark my name is bernard beth i work with hillary as a senior scientist currently heading the one health center which christina [Music] mentioned so um i'm presenting this for focusing on how we are planning to scale up scale out one health practices and policies in sub-saharan africa and i'm working with a big team of people including leon christina ashley delia and hung this is a project which is funded currently by bmz so let's go to the next slide yes so this is first of all to to clarify or to set up the terminologies that we are using when we talk about scaling we really mean an ambitious process to expand the coverage of one health either through institute institutionalization that's making sure that policy makers right at the national subnational levels are able to apply one health principles but also there's a component on horizontal expansion this is involving many other players within the same levels of application but in the process of scaling up we are not just thinking of spreading out we only thinking of refining these institutions these practices realizing that you know we are not really here to start off from the beginning but many other players have originally set up platforms and and and processes much earlier so we're just helping to improve on the quality the main uh issue though is to really identify what's that scalable units because we know one health is quite proud we really need to identify what's the key component of one health that can be scaled so let's go to the next slide and i give examples of vertical scaling and this again that's what i meant institutionalization and currently we are looking at the platforms which were developed by countries regional economic blocks the tripartite and many other players in the region and trying to ask ourselves what are the competencies how are these platforms working so we are using an evaluation tool that's called network for evaluation of one health which is classical published and it's being used in many places to identify those gaps in planning thinking working sharing one health activities and the main aim here is to identify what which areas can we specifically implement interventions to make these platforms work much more effectively the second issue though would be research for development and this is where we're thinking of we want to demonstrate how new evidence can be used to inform decision making but also to inform networking partnerships so that it can really come out so clearly on which areas would those partnerships work better for disease control so on the next slide i give a small example on horizontal scaling what we do here is basically about building graduate fellowship programs so that we can get more leaders more students more technical expertise being used in the region and it involves training students within here at hillary but also helping local universities in developing new curricula uh on one health through our research partnerships also with governments ngos private sectors we hope that in the process of us implementing research with them those one health competencies come out strongly and they get recognized as ways of doing business but lastly also is we are really launching community outreach activities which aim to build um capacities at the local levels but also there's a frontline staff here including you know community based animal health workers or community health volunteers who work in the public public health sector so all those people are brought on board to work together in the local levels i think i have the second last slide which talks about the opportunities that we have to build all these um activities and one of them is um they say huge interests locally on building one health platforms and i think that interest would really help us to to move on from there there's also one health platforms which have been developed as i said earlier on and there's a huge um skilled manpower in mainstream government departments which can be brought on board in building all these initiatives but of course as you know there are many challenges and main the main one of course is being funding levels are low the other thing is conceptualization of one health you know one health is quite broad and many people may not really define what we mean by a scalable unit that needs to be determined for us to know where we begin from and where we reach in terms of taking it forward uh the the one thing that i also find it very useful is to identify reliable tools for assessment you know we keep doing there are many tools which are being used currently for assessing scaling in many interventions in veterinary even public health but those ones have not really been fine-tuned to capture one health and those are the limitations that we still face up to now lastly of course one health as we know it is very much on prevention of diseases of course it can be used for management of diseases but most of the time we want to use them for prevention but we know communities and many people in the on the ground are really very much tailored towards using curative services and not prevent preventive services and that's this this need for a mind mind changing mindset in terms of how those services are used so i think i have only the two slides one is on acknowledging partners and we have many partners in this region but the last one which i want to emphasize is we have had huge support from a cgir research program called fonh which was led by ifpri for the last 10 years they have been helping us to do one health and it's coming to an end in december this year so very much like to acknowledge the support that we have gotten from them so thanks mark that's the end of my presentation okay thank you bernard uh we're gonna quickly switch over to uh a usda-funded project and hear from uh lasha and the situation they're facing in georgia please lasha thank you mark greetings let me present safety and quality investment livestock or simply skill activities under the one health principles skillfully project is financed by the usda is and implemented by the orlando lakes venture 37 in georgia with our local partner georgian farmers association following farm to four principles project times to to food safety and quality improvement increase productivity and trade within the georgian dairy and beef market systems value chain next slide please as i mentioned scale major task is to support market systems development so i would like to focus on how the skill operates in the strengthening one health approach in a market systems development context system includes value interests starting from the input suppliers farmers processors distributors all the way to the finance consumers but also on top of it the market systems donated we say we have a role to develop supporting functions such as strengthening education centers sectoral trainers service providers etc and let me give example here recently skill trained call center operators of the ministry of environmental protection and agriculture of georgia in animal health and food safety matters and was first for them ever such technical training on the other hand we try to strengthen local rules and regulations through capacity building of the related state authorities developing market led safety quality systems and mediating public private partnership as an additional example we conducted the workshop regarding newly adopted regulation and animal byproducts their use and disposal next slide please so what are their tools in a toolbox as knowledge and awareness of the local sector actors was identified as one of the biggest challenges we uh conducted set of the trainings in different wild house related topics and let me give you some examples from this list food safety and hygiene principles that included hazop system for deity and preprocessors we also trained all state and private slaughterhouse veterinarians in meet inspection and as you see on the right in the pictures the environment of the trainings varies from the actual practice in the processing plant or more in kind of community based interactions next slide please also we tried to to cover gaps of developing education materials such as for our case manuals and booklets and guidebooks for that activity we had a small motivator like 120 nanometers small motivator it's basically all kind of people large gatherings is still restricted for more than a year now so we have to adapt materials will print in the distributed through our partners as well as electronic versions are uploaded in the local farmer's platform one our partners let's say was the national food agency and they disseminated these manuals to cattle farmers through their state animal vaccination campaigns and here on the right you can see example of one of our education materials regarding veterinary medicine products which explains the the health one health and general health principles as well as veterinary medicines residues flow from animals to humans to environment this manual also contains the information regarding antimicrobial resistance but one more like a simple farmer's understandable language next slide please and here i have a list of the other materials as you can see in the content of them and i would highlight practical manuals for the slaughterhouse veterinarians how to protect farm from the chronic disease as well as manual a vector board disease prevention is also ending next place slide please in order to promote those education materials skill developed animated videos that you can see this videos are simple way reflecting the key messages of the education materials these videos were designated through the social media and popular original televisions and i believe that strength of this concept was to provide the awareness regarding the main highlights of that very subject but also at the same time aware target groups regarding existence of these very materials to be either downloaded from the web platform or gained through their skill partners so with this approach we are able to educate target beneficiaries through the combined method of the videos plus manuals that do not actually require the gathering of other people and it's also a cost-effective as a challenge that we identified in a process access of the electronic platform by the farmers is quite limited but on the other hand on the opportunity side we think and we're planning to translate those education materials into english which are currently georgian to share amongst other venture 37 projects next slide please and basically that's the final slide so we try to adopt to the to the existing uh pandemic situation by uh providing and disseminating knowledge regarding one health principles and related actions in livestock sector market systems and that's the way it is thank you very much okay thank you elisha and the last of our speed talks here it will come from madessa and the hillary hill program if you could uh please start that discussion uh my name is badass i work for international lifestyle research institute i'm regular scientist the topic i'm going to talk on is linking green line management to one health in utopia rangeland is important for one health because this rangeland is a vast land area that cover the world service and also it is support millions of people's pastoralists who are depending on the rangeland rating of livestock production and also it is good for ecosystem service functioning when so that one health brings these three components by including rangeland health to improve the livelihood and ecosystem service for the company who are living there [Music] one of the project which is integrating the environmental aspect is heat this project is uh actually the constant rule led by vcfsu's along with ccm and italy as with the objective of to enhance the vulnerable community to have a sustainable well being that the project is conducted in three and three countries topia kenya somalia with an approach of bringing three these three components animal human environmentalists to have a good delivery service of one health service at the ground level for the pastoralist and this project also engaged different community levels including women men to have to accommodate their need that that to have a one health service delivery and also to have a cost effective approach for this this one service delivery and doesn't it at the end of the day this should be a model or a solution of still silver and silver service delivery that should be recognized by different tokens like a policy maker for the pastoralist as a whole most of the initiative of one health is lacking this environmental health so he'll make unique because of including this one health environmental health through an approach of past battery range land management this perspective land management have three stage and a different state of different steps so this actually a process that maintains the community management plan and improving uh the institution of this community rangeland management regulated management from this uh from rangeland there is a livestock disease distribution and also there are different regular conditions so the disease and the regular condition are highly integrated or correlated they are functioning together so this prm is bringing into the process of animal disease to be integrated well from for example if we take from our one side or download land which is found in moya red street how one health and the grazings are really linked together show us movement through concentration of livestock and high degradation of rangeland shows us our wine health and grazing are integrated from this institutional role to bring to bring together a different institution which are to act for one health center to learn from each other he developed msip for stakeholders to discuss learning because of environmental health is a broader so that to understand what rangeland health mean so msrb is a muslim style stakeholder innovation platform where many stakeholders are really from each other or to avoid the challenges of not understanding the whole environment from this rangeland heritage so the service delivery is to improve the rangeland which are highly degraded or to minimize to maintain the rangeland size as it is so to have an educated posture as a sum up randyland health is a key improving the whole system of the ecosystem and the productivity of the whole area that improve the livelihood and the community as well so that bringing of animal human rangeland health is a good to link to regular management to have a wider impact of the livelihood of communities so thank you if you have questions welcome thank you vadessa um we've now heard from three different programs and how they are scaling one health in policy uh training public and private sector activities and environmental pathways and we're going to change over to some questions now and i'd like to lead off by asking bernard how they've been able to reconcile the differing interests between their stakeholder holders we naturally find that there's a little bit of difference between what donors want what local governments want and what livestock owners want and i'd like to hear your views on this process thanks mark for that question so um yes you are right i mean most of the donors or most of the development agencies usually fund those challenges or those those issues which address epidemics pandemics with international concern usually they look at risks which transcend countries and and and regions but we we find that the stakeholders of the the people we deal with at the community level are very much interested in managing day-to-day challenges in terms of endemic diseases or things which we call production which may not really attract external interest so but i think there is a win-win um there's a room for win-win situation there because the support we get from external development partners which address pandemics and epidemics can still help in building universal surveillance systems or build capacity which might be used to manage multiple challenges at the same time so in that way i think you can still find a common ground where that external support can still be used to build capacity events to manage local problems thank you sir um last time i'm going to turn to you next to kind of follow the order of the speakers there and what curious how you're building capacity at the farm level to prevent the spread of zoodonic disease what what are producers the livestock owners knowledge and awareness of one health challenges how are they facing this well mark as i mentioned during my presentation uh one of the skill developed education material was manual for main chronic diseases of cattle and for georgia that would be resilience tuberculosis and glucoses so we developed a manual that contains the practical examples of the clinical science disease prevention also diagnostic practices manual also explains kind of existing regulations and also explains that this is very important the primary actions to be taken in case of the disease suspicious before even the veterinarian's engagement also we put like sticky posters of the disease clinical science and also k messages that uh are attached to the manual and these um owners of the farms that that have been delivered could stick them on the walls or the employees hang around so they will have always the major information in front of them the abortion and other clinical science and also highlight and also clinical science in humans as well so they would you know understand that they might be exposed so in my opinion that's the practical example how to aware kind of farmers on one health issues and try to get them on our las thank you and bethesda we're looking at the environmental part of our tripartite and and we diagram one health why is it is it challenging to incorporate one health into the environmental issues thank you mark uh yes it is uh if you see many of the finance initiatives the environmental health is lacking uh it is neglected many initiative this may may be because of this environmental research list funding to have to integrate this and also it is not taken as like seriously as uh other discipline like medical and also even through the issue and there also this environmental ha also have different theories uh which is not contextual to different uh areas like if you take a series of indigenous pastoralists which is sometimes they are conflict each other in some areas so that this is the main point why environment is not as others okay thank you for that interesting bit of information you know we we've labeled this as a hard talk session and so the hardest question i'm gonna pose back to uh christina where she she led us off today and as a thought leader in this field where does the focus on one health and livestock provide the greatest impact um well there's not a silver bullet answer to that because the context of any health problem is different in each country right so i i think uh the focus should be on um yeah the local context actually in which the the animal diseases um yeah navigate and the pathogens navigate and that the reason why i'm saying this in southeast asia for example where you have a much higher pig population you know pigs as a livestock species would be of much of more importance than um cattle and small ruminants in east africa for example and maybe i would like to pass this on to to my colleague bernard who is more of a a local leader in one health than i am thanks uh sure bernard if you would like to follow up please no i think christina managed to dwell by saying you know it change it it varies from one place to another maybe what one thing that jumped into mind because i can see in your question is uh there's a labeling of livestock and since we are thinking of one health you know livestock usually is considered to be and resourced in many places and so i guess bringing in one health in that perspective might actually help to enhance service delivery not just looking at disease per se but also managing multiple facets of livestock service delivery in this region for example you know many many remote locations there's a big challenge on that and so i see one health can really help us to reach into the those people who are considered to be left behind by previous interventions okay thank you we we have a couple of extra minutes is uh there are specific questions from the chat box that anyone would like to draw my attention to um otherwise i'm gonna jump to one of our other questions here what i'd like to ask is each of you just quickly to give me um a quick answer to say if which part of one health changes or the program implementation that you've dealt with has been the most difficult has it been with the local governments the private sector the veterinarians of the community animal health workers or the farmers themselves and bernard if i could start with you which which of those [Music] partners in all of this has been the the the slowest to make change that's a difficult question i would say government because um you know if you look at the other actors which you have in the list if an intervention is really beneficial to them they will adjust immediately you know private sector farmers but for government you know you really need to put in place policies rules before everybody else come to the same table so i think for me it will be government okay and lasha how would you uh talk about this that question that's tough mark but probably for us it's the engagement of the farmers um because to let them understand that something which is not always linked to their income and sometimes opposite that matters for instance an antimicrobial resistance or proper use of the veterinary medicine products proposed waste of uh by-products etc that could i mean this process is a slow process and it's more and more engagement for all the partners okay and the same question to you uh vadessa what uh part of the partnership has been difficult for you he's heard actually it is from uh perspective of like because i've seen this environmentalist because this an understanding of uh health aspect is somewhat is different from rangeland because it is a government and if you are like we see from a pastoralist point of view different organizations are there so and some of them also say government okay thank you and we have one question that's come in uh from abdel fatha and what are your thoughts on selecting for poultry or livestock that are genetically predisposed or resistant to any of the avian influenzas or other diseases and what's work is being done on the crossbreds uh for that process i'm not quite sure who who is best to answer that question if you'd like to speak up do we do we have someone who's been handling uh the selection of poultry and livestock for genetic and avian influenza um we already had a discussion on that in the chat this is christina and i mean uh i'm not speaking for hillary we are not uh working on on um selecting breeds uh resistant to avian influenza we do that kind of work um feeding and cross-breeding um disease resistant animals even genetic engineering um yeah to generate um disease resistant animals but yeah it can work in the lab you still need to get it to the community so one of the examples i i brought up was the gamma kettle from west africa which is very small but resistant to trypanosoma infections and the masai herders in east africa really didn't like it because it was too small not considered a real cow so even though that that cattle breed was resistance to disease they opted for the disease so uh and and we have other examples where we are trying to crossbreed um cheap that are resistant to uh worm infections uh and it's definitely a good bio a medical or genetical approach to disease control and but it's others working on avian influenza reading thanks i hope that helps a bit yeah thank you uh it looks like a good question has come up for um looks like bernard or vadessa and the question is zoonotic infections form the bulk of re-emerging or emerging disease burden that could benefit the attention of one health and management what is being done to actually manage the introductions from wildlife so i think uh that might be closer to uh bedessa yeah i'm in my perspective view because that's why we put a participatory rangeland management bring to this one health approach today this rain land management if we have an integrated integrator management plan these all things should be at minimized to absorb this as the issue of health else for management actually the wildfire so now we are like if we take the pastoral area there is a wildlife there is a climate climate change there is a land health uh so this is under the umbrella of environment so we are doing this project by compiling together having a strong integrated management plan to be integrated into one health um and i've noticed that last year would like to speak on that as well as we think through uh the question on this crossover from uh from wildlife elijah please thank you mark so actually one of the uh materials that we also developed is regarding how to build the cattle farm and that also includes how to select the place a lot of about biosecurity measures and all the threats that come to the farm from the wildlife from the imported animals and other sources but and that's i believe is part of the answer as well how to separate or how to protect the livestock and therefore humans later okay we're going to squeeze in one last question and um um anyone can pop in on this answer okay what is the one thing that we could do today that would improve or motivate buy-in from one health around the world is it you know the livestock the livestock owners the funding the people were involved or is it the markets that we need to put pressure on how how would you guys um discuss this topic who would like to go first how about um bernard you've been quick on the answers today oh well yeah that's that's really a big question so i would i would say i think if we get a stronger consumer demand on on on healthy and you know healthy landscapes and healthy food i think they can drive much more than just you know a supply side of things so i think the demand can really shape how more healthy value chains can be developed and i'm hoping that would really also force the private sector to come into in into into the picture much more okay well i should let's build on that private sector notion what how would you uh answer the question well actually mark now we're on the way of developing the market like the food safety and quality standard on the primary production level and i agree with bernard that yes indeed consumers awareness demand from the consumers needs to be there but also we should support the the production and primary production processing level to to meet up the standards the standards that sets the government but also especially the market-led standards that motivates the the processors to to move on thank you sir well we've heard from our panelists now and i want to give time for a wrap up here from uh christine yost she's the global health security initiative a senior livestock advisor with usaid's bureau of humanitarian assistance she provides technical support on saving lives and livelihoods of livestock keepers and fisher folk she lies with global humanitarian and resilience communities on issues regarding food security and food systems animal health emerging and transparent diseases she has over 30 years of the experience and working in over 40 countries and so we'd like to use her expertise to put a final note on today's webinar christine please thank you mark and thank you to all the speakers today i've really learned a lot i want to highlight a few things i liked how the speakers were kind of organized in research policy and then really looking at practice from christina we learned about the importance of preparing detecting and responding in one health approaches preparing in terms of particularly focusing on localization detection and both both the importance of the biomedical and the social sciences you know it's important to remember that disease isn't simply a biological problem it's a socio-economic problem requiring one health approaches and then responding in terms of coordination and targeting at all levels one of our main lessons from responding to the ebola outbreak in west africa that ended in 2016 was the need for improved coordination and it's a lesson we are learning again in the covid19 pandemic from bernard we were introduced to the one health regional center for africa with its focusing on policy and scaling and it was good to to hear bernard recognize the challenge of conceptualizing one health um and the need to integrate that into scaling approaches um both at uh the in in public efforts such as the national one health platforms as well as graduate programs and community outreach and then from lasha and badassa we we really had a nice look into examples of putting one health into practice both in market systems as well as in terms of linking rangeland health to one health what came out from the discussion and the contribution of the participants for me is that one health is not just an approach to research it's also an approach to practice policy capacity building that recognizes and supports the inextricable linkages between environmental animal and human health as livestock experts we need to continually challenge ourselves to think about and address what livestock research and development means for the health and well-being of people and the environments in which we live and how often we should be asking ourselves are we collaborating with the ecological and human health communities thanks mark thank you i'm gonna hand back over to michael now and he'll take walk us through our ending points thank you
