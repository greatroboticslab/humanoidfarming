  "text": "not so good afternoon today Victor will present as a Brownback seminar or we will change the name soon into Tupperware seminars or something like that so welcome and thanks for being here Victor has a Bachelor of law and master's degree in marketing and communications with postgraduate studies studies in local economic development I think it was part of how do we diversify certain profiles in intimate and in the program and in that sense you were looking for experience in public private partnerships agriculture marketing agribusiness and sustainable development say it has Victor sorry has lived in Asia Europe and America where he worked for the FAO dealing with farming market linkages as well as agricultural market services in Mexico Victor was with the internet inter-american Development Bank prior prior to joining similar here in CIMMYT he has worked on public-private partnerships within the SIP program he is component leader for masa grow product or and has been working in different projects in the let in the systemic densification strategy on farmer market linkages and will present first today farmer market linkages in the context of sustainable intensification systems and before we start thanks for Victor for doing the effort taking the time like everybody else who's presenting the Brownback's to put your work out there to be looked at mix I yes so thank you Ron for your presentation thanks everyone for taking the time to be here I wanted to give you a little bit of an overview of what we have been doing in terms of fundamental market linkages and how does this fit into existing efforts and program of sustainable intensification strategy so the presentation is going to start framing a little bit the scope of the activities we are doing and then we will see some mix pose in actual projects so we like to define ourselves as providing input in this in this sense by providing strategic interventions through the value networks of may suite and associated crops it's perhaps interesting to highlight here associated crops because it's part of CIMMYT mission to work with with crops different from maize and wheat but especially it's important in terms of of markets aiming at strengthening commercial relationships based on sustainability innovation and competitiveness so what we have been doing was revealing in which sense we could provide some added value to what already was going on on the market and how we could kind of round the activities that submit' was already doing and what we were already doing in projects dealing with sustainable intensification being masago the federal project one of the main efforts here you can see one of the infograph is one of the graphics that we are doing in which we kind of map the value chain it's interesting to mention also that we refer here value networks we want to refer that there are several readings on value chain and value networks what is the difference so we don't think they are those are incompatible terms we think those need to be combined so in for instance in the finance the use of value networks have been used have been used for years where they when they refer to the single actors in a given activity considering the different role they may have so kind of the same thing has been adopted by the university of chopping go we have been working with Roberto random of system by understanding how can we do this I see this as a reading as body chain could be kind of a 2d projection of what is going on and a value networks can be kind of a 3d projection or kind of isolating a specific player and understand which are the different this player plays being a client being a supplier being a complementary on being a competitor so we have been mapping the Mason with value chains with this perspective also this is an example of commercial network mapping exercises that we did with Roberta rendang in Oaxaca in Chiapas in four states in 2016 we plan to keep working on next year's in this effort what we do is to understand how the players relate to each other in a specific geographical context we kind of take a picture of what is going on from a commercial point of view we take the picture again after an intervention and understand whether new links have been produced so that there are there are some factors that we cannot understand by reading a simple value chain but by having this kind of associations and relationships mapped we get a better understanding and we actually want our collaborators providing support to farmers to also adopt this commercial networking mapping methodology so why did we start doing this kind of work it was mostly because of the demand of the farmers so misawa's you know started operating in 2011 soon after that kind of a couple of years afterwards we realized that we needed to develop or to put together a component that would help farmers to push correctly their product so we were kind of helping them to increase their productivity to increase their production but some of them were not linked to markets or were linked occasionally to markets or not understanding market dynamics appropriately and we understood that by by helping them to understand that we could help them a lot so we we systematize the lessons learned like globally there was some song work of scimitar already in different projects and regions in farmer market linkages or in agricultural marketing or value chain reading and we incorporated that into the operation of massage and of course we we went through extensive literature review to see what was what hat being developed how could we contribute to that this is an example of an in front of you found early product that we developed saying what what is the kind of route that a farmer should take by feeling that is not competing with his peer farmers or the P farmers they can organize themselves they can do joint efforts together these are some examples of materials that we have been reading so as bran was mentioning I was working at the marketing team at FAO and we recover part of that work and we Scheffer outside the David Camm who were kind of who have been writing of this topic for years these are some examples of projects or forming of the inter-american Development Bank and of course and of course this the socio economics program of CIMMYT has developed also some quite interesting documents that we have been utilizing these are some other examples this is one of the last actually one of the last products with Andre Duvall Jason Donovan working on an identification of experiences in the sea here but also outside of the CER and understanding how the so called VCD value chain for development could be better increase so starting from all this literature we we intend to bring it back to what is going on right so we developed several guidelines practical guidelines for farmers for operators to incorporate value chain development concepts in the in the project so for us to for us to start or to work on a specific region we need different elements to combine so in we need innovative farmers we need an enabling environment and we need willing buyers so the farmers and innovative when they adopt sustainable intensification sustainable agriculture when they kind of do this transition from traditional methods to innovation which is what we are helping them to do with projects such as massage then we provide capacity development in agricultural marketing strategies and we we understand that promoting farming organization is also key for this innovative farmers to succeed then we need an enabling environment so for that to happen we need a public pull up policies that support the whole process and we go with public policies policies at a multi level so not only at federal or national level but also at a regional level another important factor is kind of identifying and highlighting the existing synergies amongst the different projects that might be conquering and the same in the same region and that is something that has been challenging but we have been working through the different projects that are for instance taking place in Mexico and then the fact of institutional networks strengthening a linkages that means that we link with already in place he force in terms of trading marketing and farming organizations and we provide support to those existing structures then we need willing buyers so we stimulate new business models we will see what we understand for new business models in a minute and also we look for buyers that are interested in the tribal dimension of sustainability meaning environmentally social and economic sustainability of course so what do we understand by new business models are those who include the stimulation of new services or goods associated with sustainable intensification interventions for instance the development of appropriate mechanization services or the development of manufacturers of post-harvest tools as well as generating extra added value to existing processes and players this is a drawing that you have seen thousand times maybe so it is the model of the is the infrastructure of innovation hub so this is a model along with we have been working for for some years now so the the research platform is where is-where farm is where researchers do hypothesis and we bring the market related hypothesis also to this exercise so by using and validating varieties demanded by the industry into the research plots and also promoting market oriented crop rotation which also meets our combines or adds to agronomic crop rotation then we go to the modules or to farmers that adopt those technologies and we focus on income efficiency and contract farming as a couple of areas of work with these farmers those farmers kind of serve as a model for others to adopt the technologies and then we have the impact areas where we promote farmer organizations and a better value chain integration so both are the spected results in farmer market linkages interventions these are some of them may be strengthened overall competitiveness amazing with production systems from farm to the final product so understanding well seeing it can add a meaningful value to producers but also to other players in the value chain farmers abilities recognize developed and enhanced and also training is part of the core business of SEMA to say so we kind of tune up to two specific training on market business models based on the tripod dimension of sustainability promoted tools and methodologies to strengthen inclusive market approach developed and spread and develop foster among all value network actors it's important to mention that several players from the private sector but also from the public sector have seen value in symmetry in a neutral facilitator of processes and this is something that we have been doing with inter-institutional working groups and some other spaces for common discussion so when when we decided when we are invited to provide input to a specific project or a specific need we start with that with a diagnosis so we understand what's going on why we are required why what is the problem that we try to tackle right so we do of course literature review specific for that region to understand what what has been what have been experiences that we can learn from then we do a collection of primary information through sourcing methods such as value chain mapping and market research and do further understanding of market needs by understanding who would be the buyer or who would be the the pool force in that intervention that we want to promote then we design a customized intervention based on the existing model and what the project might require and we do start with the implementation of the project and a constant evaluation or feedback loop so this is an iterative process where we incorporate information on communication technologies or mill indicators monitoring evaluation accountability and learning indications and learning unsustainability indicators that will bring into the formula then we scale out and actually is not the idea they seem it does the whole process especially not the last step of scaling out the ideas that we prove methodology or that we prove an intervention to be worthy then the industry and the different players in the industry would have to play their role in validating that father and making them making it growth an important area as I was mentioning at the beginning is providing appropriate training so we developed several courses marked market related courses or training not about they have been implemented yet some of them are on the second year some others are still to be developed as you can see this right program so the ideas we'll be contract farming management of rural business farmer organizations and inclusive business models and we have several trainings with different as resisted each of them each of those that we are pushing in our agenda and that is also the importance to provide sufficient and useful materials for training offered the dissemination of information or debut that we have so one of the things that we think it's missing in a lot of cases in Mexico is is contrary culture and we had velop an explainer video explaining why it's a good idea maybe to organize and to and to understand what as the other benefits of contract agriculture being whoever it is who provides that contracting lastly for this session for this start of the presentation I wanted to explain that we are developing farmer market linkages specific indicators to strengthen the indicator matrix of the projects that we are working on so in the area of productivity we are studying as results indicators yield profit available grain to trade an adoption of contract farming as some significant indicators and we are discussing also with donors what our impact indicators that are useful for them such as ill evolution profit evolution or market effective participation index which is actually a recent indicator that we are developing these days so now how do we how do we go from all of these theory or from this ideas to practice or to implementation these are the ongoing projects in which there is a component of farmer market linkages all of them are in Mexico at the moment all of them are in Mexico of course part of our lab for proving practices was the massacre of the federal project then we got Massaro Vanuatu well we could do some more in-depth specific research for instance in the case of alternative crops for Vanuatu and then we got several projects with main industry players such as Kalos Nestle or guru per window which have started quite recently within the last 12 months and we have also a project in its second year now in the Finnish Rally Yucatan with funda theologian as al mundo Maya we will see a few examples of work going on on these projects so what kind of activities how do we phrase our interventions in those projects here there are some of them the idea is to provide value in in doing value mapping exercises that are relevant at the hub level at the regional level and we also feel that are in a good position to link the work that is very being carried out in terms of agronomy in terms of Technology Development and in terms of of markets so these are some of the areas I don't want to to read them in detail but you can see them here these are instead some typical type ologies where we have been working for the last couple of years so animal feed sector nixtamalization industry a growing industries or the retail LED interventions or niche markets in each of these areas there are different goals depending on who is the attractor or who is promoting the intervention and we are working with different products so for instance the animal feed sector white mace is not required but triticale or barley are incorporated as interesting associated crops in the next immunization industry of course is focused on white mace niche markets deals with landrace maize so we have a kind of a variety of of areas to intervene and as part of our exercise to review what was going on and on in terms of methodology we we start we identify that link methodology who was which was jointly developed by the sea at in Colombia and if pre was a methodology that could be useful for grains and that had not been used for the grains so we brought some people from from SIA to help us incorporate that and this methodology what does is kind of assessing inclusive and sustainable business models and in ethology that starts that has four main tools one is the value chain map which means ok I understand what where I am working who are the actors what roles are they playing then I design or I understand what is the business model with a business model campus to which is a classic pool in which we understand how different actors being there being the producer being the aggregator or being the end-user how do they see themselves what kind of business to the thing they have or they play in the chain then we do the new business model principle which is a tool to evaluate how inclusive trading relationship is and what can be modified in there and then we go to the fourth tool which is the prototype cycle or actually implementing those modifications into the business model of the of the organization that we think can help out and that is also guided by the same participants there is a feedback loop we keep working on this prototype or cycle until we understand that business relationship between two players is actually optimized what this interesting is to is to is to highlight that we have been quickly transitioning from the reading of the let's say theory materials to the implementation of those in field so in for in front of the certain projects that I mentioned before in 2007 we in 2016 and 2017 we have been training let's say project partners to implement link in their in the regions as we have some some examples here in Massaro we have got like six cases of partners that are being using League have been using linked masada wanna hot as well in the Kellogg's project as well and in the mill packet on project as well so as you can see some of this work is done with native language made some other is done with more typical or hybrid products certified products etc so we have different different scenarios and different market topologies that we have been mapping and this is the numbers one two three four refer to those numbers and the stage to which we have reached to date in those collaborations here we have some pictures from the field from our partners from these organizations in Mexico that are conducting this value chain mapping and following exercises this is exercise one value chain mapping this is exercise to well you do the model the business model canvas and it's interesting to see that they have been quite happy and finding useful this this methodology this is actually inputs that have been sent to us during the last month from from these associated organizations so here we can see the body chain map of the north of La Scala and we can see here kind of the hwacha rate data we can have with this exercises so this is these are specific commercial data gathering from the Fronteras caliber we have the different buyers that have been identified what is the buying price that they pay for the product what is the kind of payment method that they utilize what is the demand the estimated total demand that the buyer can have and some quality requirements so as you can understand this is very useful information for for for farmers to know and for farm advisors to contribute to in fact Atticus estate we did case of comparing ving and sunflower work we actually validated that by using some flower in the innovation plot and being in the control plot which is a typical product in in that region we could see that maybe the benefit cost ratio of using sunflower could be actually better so we were a company in some producers to move from being to some flower and to understand also what was the estimate demand for for sunflower as a sum as an example of of the desert some pictures of workshops that we conducted in in 2016 and we reached about two thousand six hundred forty producers and other players in this eruption were access to farmer market linkages component some other cases that I wanted to to share with you is the project in Yucatan is in this project we have a component to promote Landry's land resumes in niche markets so some of the activities that we have been doing leading to that objective is participatory workshop with farmers to review the projects commercialization strategy so as link suggests we don't arrive to a community and say this is what you need to do rather we go there we work with farmers we understand through participatory workshops what they want to do if they want to actually trade with their products if they feel comfortable comfortable with the way they are managing their selling and so on then we work on a catalog to promote landrace maize which has been kind of it's being a complex exercise because we need to carefully assess what is the available volume that can be traded especially in communities that have not been trading before so this is part of the of the exercises that we are doing we review and provide to the donor and to other interested parties key considerations in terms of pricing and logistics and the last activity that we are doing is actually a tasting workshop where metallic Palacios is helping to to plan which is scheduled for for next January where we will have chef and consumers characterizing organoleptic characteristics of this of three selected maize varieties that have maybe a volume higher than others in the in the peninsula Yucatan and that can be traded and appreciated by chefs and the consumers this this slide shows part of the variables that we have been reading in the field that we have been observing in the field and that we include into our recommendations to to the players so for instance in the case of Landry's maize producing in parallel Yucatan it it of course belongs to the milpa Sibley mill persistence or milpa system is highly conditioned by weather and by seasonal area of milk by itself then in terms of prices we have observed in local markets that price buys from 5 to 12 pesos a kilo there are also opportunities to add extra value to product for instance premium quality or certification to date there is no extra value to to to the to the product itself so we think there is an opportunity there to increase so how the price that the farmers would receive and also it's very important that we are always highlighting this part in order to avoid local market distortions we need further understanding or detail understanding of local market dynamics to establish maximum buying prices so high prices might differ existing equilibrium in terms of cell consumption or internal trade within the community those are the variables our under affection that we have been seeing how the price shapes in a specific local market so this take up this takes us to or to the whole other range of products or projects that we are developing so lately we have been writing and implementing projects on responsible sourcing as you can as you have seen this is kind of um kind of a purpose that can be applied to most of them kind of the the objective that we want to to pursue so to build and to con and to consolidate a commercial is sound responsible sourcing model aligned with the vision procedures and requirement of the other industry promoting the development of business relationships based on trust stability and reciprocal profit generation and allowing companies to meet the local mace and we demand as we have been seen and as we have been discussing for the last years if CIMMYT has now this this vision this wider vision on interventions in the value chain and we have seen that several companies have an interest in shifting from import to establishing long term relationships with local producers of of major wit so that's kind of the word that we are doing with as I was saying before callousness lay or bimbo so we kind of combine the pool and the push mechanism to create an enabling environment for responsible sourcing projects to thrive those are at the at the left we have some some activities that we that we do in terms of pool or push as you can see value chain mapping and analysis support to private sector in building a reliable local procurement capacity development the the support on sustainable intensification with technologies and agronomy that we do in every project market oriented production and of course another value that we are shaping is traceability and sustainability indicators all the way from farm - to the company so here we have some drawings on what kind of interventions do we do we do and how do we explain it so for instance this is the case of Nestle and as Nev wants to increase the radio of local procurement of maize in the state of Vanuatu which is which is actually quite low now and depends on a couple of intermediaries and this is kind of the way we saw it so we see okay there is this company that has a high volume demand there are farmers everywhere in the state most of them are disconnected some received technical assistance but it's just occasionally and there are not enough there is not maybe enough infrastructure in the region in terms of storage or logistics so there are some problems that we have identified so how can we solve these problems well in terms of reaching we can help identifying farmers and help them - or convince them to create organizations so this SP Aristotle provision rule also is family organizations getting together so technical assistance is provided by the project or by align projects in this case the government of Guanajuato is paying massive eluana hot is funding masala Vanuatu and that helps of course to other players that want to to buy maize in the rhythm major wheat actually in the case of Nestle is maize and wheat then we have a component component of work with the communities and that was for the specific request of the donor so we are promoting bio 45 major qpm in some self-consumption areas or smaller farmers in the state of Vanuatu we developed sustainability indicators together with the company and we we are making sure with our monitoring evaluation system that those indicators are being captured then we also work with a number of partners but also Financial Partners to make sure that there is the in that to make sure that the infrastructure needed for this project to to work is built is in place and well this is kind of the drawing of the intervention and we also understand that there are several kind of producers in this in this scenario and that in parallel we are going to work with these three kind of group of producers and we are actually helping them to transition from one category to other category so here for instance category C would be the producers who are not linked to markets and that are living like far from the I don't know from the company reach out so we work with them to make them visible the importance of working together of forming organizations increasing the quality the majority of their product so hopefully these producers would transition into two B which are farmers who are already organized but they are not added adding extra value they are selling their products to maybe a copy of others to those who are storage and then sell to the company so maybe if these organizations could do the the wrong storage could add some value or could help could get a better price for the service they provide and we have the aggregate Orozco Murphy analyst who are those who typically have been working with with the company so Nestle or other companies of course rely in big aggregators but the percentage of grain that they obtain from these aggregators is going to reduce as a percentage as other farmers become suppliers as well of the company this is an example of work instead with with Kellogg's what we have been identifying what was what were the main bottlenecks between the company are the main and the main aggregator that they deal with so whoever is familiar with link methodology and we will understand that this is one of the tools that we utilize which is a scorecard analysis well we see the perception of how good how healthy is the relationship and the mutual understanding between the company and the main aggregator and going we see that there is a difference in in reading or understanding of the position then we kind of try to solve this this difference then we do a value chain we have done a value chain risk matrix understanding what were the main factors that could offer that could affect the sustainability of the of the company business and we provided this kind of exercises which is not Chinese but almost but the company has the code I couldn't I didn't want to put here exactly go to where the recommendations because this is of course confidential information but we identified different kind of risks we identified possible mitigation strategies and suggested route of action this is also an example of a value chain map that we conducted for for for this last project and well this take this takes me to the last slide which is what is coming we have been quite I would say quite dynamic during the last few months in incorporating new topics we would like to see what is the what what are the opportunities to include public procurement responsible public procurement into the grain sector so there are some projects in Brazil and also in the European Union of governments buying grain for I don't know it can be for it for the jail for the pigeon system for the schools and so this public expenditure in food is been reoriented to more to incorporate some sustainable indicators or or awareness kind of awareness another area of work is using the information communication tools for for weather trust ability and transparency it is interesting to notice that IBM or Walmart have been doing have been working with blockchain technology to incorporate those elements of high-end technology into the food sector and we think that seemeth could also play a role there we are working on understanding what could we actually our fit the organization such as the sustainable agriculture initiative or ICL Alliance which actually support companies in developing sustainability standards and we are in contact with this with these organizations to understand what is coming next in terms of sustainability indicators so that we can be ready to provide that kind of information to the companies or to whoever we are working with in projects and another element that we would like to incorporate that within next year may be is participatory guarantee systems or participatory certification also known as participatory participatory certification as close to zero cost option for farmers to certify the product which we think is something that there are several cases of of success particularly in Asia now Mexico is kind of starting to explore this self certification scheme within something what we can contribute to and that was surrounded i hopes you [Applause] if you have questions now we have some minutes and I'm happy to respond Thank You Victor for the presentation I think you showed a lot of tools which is always nice I think showing really how to do it of course my question is about scaling because the word even popped up may when you can go to I think it's the fifth slide or so you had this flow chart and then at the end it was like and now we need to scale out yeah that one so my question is now you say we focus very much on the design its implementation and then the next step would be scale out right so I think I assume that in the first two blocks you reach maybe hundreds of thousands of beneficiary basically and the next you want to go to millions right so I think you would agree that this is maybe more complex then then what we're actually doing now so question is what how do you see the role in in supporting that scaling out process and and B we should take the leadership on that block then if we are not going to do it well I think it scaling out has to go through different steps or through different phases and to the last station we are probably not going to be the lead of that reaching millions but we can do some we can do some interventions in a way to make sure that a process is validated and it works out so for instance it wouldn't be enough if we assume it start implementing the link methodology and think look this is something which is working out but we don't help others to do that and we don't count on others opinion to do that so as a first step into this scaling out exercise is to work with different partners who are private small companies providing services to aggregate to farmers in Mexico that have been trained and are using themselves this methodology and seeing if there is any value in that so if they understand they understand that that's useful they will do their own business by by providing that service and that's a first step to scale out then the same thing similarly it works with the companies so the companies when they see that a pilot is working out successfully for them for instance in the case of bimbo it's very clear that what they want to do is a pilot because they want to focus on I don't know it's not even ten percent of their total procurement but the idea is to scale their is to scale it out to other regions to other countries to other crops or maybe in the case of mix of meme or not to other crops but maybe in the case of Kellogg's they have more different ingredients they would do that in other ingredients so we just kind of put the seed in there and see if we can support to the scale out process but it's a complex it's a complex topic of their I think they're working on that could you tell us more about the indicators of sustainable farming and whether those can all get into climate change amelioration or any of those aspects there are indicators in most of our projects we have indicators of knowledge of environmental environmental area enough production or productivity so in terms of farmer market linkages we are more focusing on those having to deal with productivity aside refer briefly there are several organizations working on sustainability indicators for the agricultural sector so we discuss with specific d'Honneur in each case what kind of indicators are you interested in some of them most of the indicators that the company are interested in belong to the matter mental part or to the income part so I want my farmers to be more successful in terms of return of investment or I want my farmers to have a better management of the water so some of them are managed by our colleagues of the ergonomics and some others are go cows walk out by by ourselves so these are the ones that we are kind of monitoring more closely controlling so we understand that is not only about producing more battery but about being more competitive in the way you produce and by indicating and by monitoring that over the years we understand that as a farmer has been successfully incorporating more more profit into the into its business there is this this last indicator I was referring before market effective participation index refers to to what extent a farm at is aware of the existence of different markets and how he or she plan strategically his production towards meeting market demands so that's an indicator that after a number of years we understand how that farmer has transition and that is valuable for us to understand whether it had make sense our intervention or not still is an area under the constant development and review but I hope this addresses a bit your question yes all right soon our job is international agricultural research so we should also be interested in ensuring comparability across countries regions and so on so these indicators you know it would help if we can ensure some kind of comparability with say what we're doing in South Asia so number one would be water use efficiency - nutrient use efficiency from a and three emissions and are they covered or not well what we're doing BOM do you want to yeah just an example there is the table of indicators which includes most ability greenhouse gases and it's a whole full table that has been developed it is an extract which is also fed into the discussions with monitoring and if meta monitoring and evaluation and learning unit that is also working across with the CGI art so what conclude it's not that this is just a selection so it may be a bit misleading by putting the exact I think this is an example of a specific specific project where it is important to highlight is indeed not all projects are measuring all the indicators maybe the next step of discussion is what are the minimal indicators that we agree across regions that you should measure being part of those discussions it becomes very interesting because usually we step out of the meeting saying every time should be the minimum indicators you should measure because depending the socio economics is that this is this etcetera on the other hand there is obviously also the dimension of the donors so I mean USAID is looking at indicators a lot of us looking at indicators who is doing everything from Mexico so I'm not sure I mean I don't have the answer where that ends up in the end but somewhere a lot of methodological challenges also to have indicators that are robust across geographies one aspects of indicators especially for that type of work are social indicators equity equity insistence with responsible sourcing for example it's a very interesting question so it's cement but not on instrument we are quite a few be interested in getting methods and metrics for those indicators and I think it's quite a bit more investment yeah I mean I totally agree I've been discussing with with brandies for for some time already and the idea is that we find you first what are valid methodologies and useful indicators for both the beneficiaries that we are working with and for what the industry may demand and then how do we streamline those indicators within the project portfolio of the program and beyond of all the different regions I think it's interesting to look I am drea who's who's on maternity leave has been working on that and may be interesting to ask her to give a presentation but also for me just to add it has been quite interesting that on methodology that cetera is completely different if you from from the business perspective because they want those data streams to go in business continuity which needs to be auditable by PwC's and those companies that they need to be trans able to translate that into financial indicators for them because then their insurance goes that I mean that's a whole even a whole different dimension where that we may not be thinking of but if we don't do that we cannot connect it and then the pool goes away of what is driving this because in the end the company is creating a pool for that so it's even more it's making it just a little bit more and another factor that is important is that time it is the time that it requires to capture the indicators analyze and kind of present them so the industry is pressing has to have quicker response ratio than we had previously with institutional donors which would be okay with us releasing data of 2 years old and saying ok this is the indicator of production of the state of Oaxaca 2014 that you are delivering that in 16 so now the companies are telling us okay I want some system where I can see if not in real time at least with a delay of maximum amonth who are our beneficiaries how are they performing in the field and so is something that we are actually trying to tackle with with with the BEM Bittaker electronic and some other tools that Andrea and others are working on and again I mean you mentioned the cost-benefit of indicators you know I mean you can have indicators that interest many people but they are very difficult and very costly to to update the upscaling of indicators as well you know can measure things at the field level for few farmers but are you scale that you know when you start working and and environment and I think all those issues of interest I think foresee bit because more and more also donors are asking for those indicators as a metric of success well greenhouse gas emissions is the typical case where I think we should kind of work closely with c-cups and others to understand what is going to be our methodology a question because I think that was an interesting comment how do we how do we avoid or at least the signals there that by the interventions instead that we are making sure that we enter at a level playing field because one of the element is you could say I take the farmers and I put them in contact with the company but that is not a level playing field because the companies for really much way more experienced with negotiating to farmers which for them are are our suppliers and that's what they do they negotiate their supply chain so can you comment some of the tools and elements that are being thought of to avoid falling in that trap and actually creating disparity rather than opportunities and a pool for so one thing that we need to clarify every time is that we are not traders so that we cannot make sure that by linking farmers to companies we our business is going to happen by itself so what we what we see is that we want to on one hand empower farmers to understand what is the value of the product they have what are the different markets they can go to and got are the benefits of working together or by developing a formal contract farming or by developing kind of loyalty to the to the potential companies that are interested in their products so that's that's a whole set of work and from the other side we work with the companies to kind of transmit they need to understand the characteristics of the farmers of the specific region where they want to source from they of course know the people but they don't they might not know how they would react to changes in the environment such as changing price scenario or changing weather scenario so this kind of of of awareness is important for the companies to have and also we have the companies to understand what are the benefits of promoting local procurement instead of imports in terms of marketing of image for for the companies and that they are seeing value in that so they are kind of open now to consider buying local Turing who sure that we know that Mexico is divided into mono cropping Jones no we have the areas about the area and so on so we want to as a part of sustainable intensification we want diversification as one of the component on the other side the contract farming is more towards specific quality trade commodity and mono cropping suits contract farming and vice versa how you see diversification and market linkage contract farming should we use only if useful so that means that not all the companies and not all farmer groups are seeing value in contract farming because contract farming is limited by stipulated programs so in that case Mexican xalapa has a circa and a circa has a service of contract agriculture which proved to be useful and unpopular in some regions and not in others so to start with this with this thing for us contract farming is not an obligation then in terms of what products we do we suggest in crop rotation we also we always start from understanding economics so whenever we see that there are several options in terms of agronomy appropriate rotation we see out of those who is the one what is the one that makes more sense from a market perspective but not the other way around we don't see we don't say ok in Bahia there is a new factory of oil of papas fritas and then we need to to get oil from this kind of legume enosis so we just understand in the system which is needed which is kind of helping to nurture soils and then out of that we we provide some recommendation I have a question especially you are talking a lot about market and specifically about big markets and slay people what about small-scale farmers if we see them yes of course also as producers and as consumers of their own cereals as maize and then if we try to connect them with you say chefs or these high like level restaurants how do we ensure that we that they can still have their own volume for self consumption and they if did we give them a nice price and all these contracts yeah of course it's gonna be a really nice incentive to sell everything on most of it and then what are they gonna eat if they prefer to eat their own mace perhaps we are going to make a different type of impact yeah well I think that was that was pointed out by I mean we do that by carefully assessing case by case first we cannot say that large farmers supply only large companies so that is the large companies also supply from small and medium farmers that get organized that's what we are doing in Bahia that's where we are doing in in some in Sinaloa not so much but in estado de mexico yes we're doing that for those niche market pool for that niche market pool that they want maybe some very specific products land resumes we have been doing this exercise community by community in Venezuela Yucatan to understand what is the percentage of product that they consume what is the percentage of product that they trade in their communities so we don't affect that we help them to increase their production and with that surplus of production we start talking about selling that so the volumes are incredibly low for the first year then we want to help them to make to see okay maybe they have three actors of land in average they are planting less than an actor because it's what they need but maybe next year they will think okay I'm gonna duplicate my production because I know I will have who someone who's going to buy from from me so volume setting and price setting is key and it's something that we work on in every specific community this is very time demanding so what we would want to do is that we have the private sector I mean small companies farm advisors dispatcher salary colas that provide a service to farmers okay thank you very much shake [Applause]",
