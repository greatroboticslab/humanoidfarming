  "text": "which this way so you need three pieces of wood in here yeah to make one box okay so you need three pieces can open you want me to talk or you going to add well this is a simple vegetable box built on the cheap so this is just made from uh 7 and 1/2 inch wide I think it is redwood fence boards this is just a Cedar uh fence Runner 2x4 just these fence boards come with a uh uh Dogg ear and cut the dog ear end off and you have roughly a 6ot length and I took another board same thing and cut it for my ends I just chose 30 in wide a typical vegetable Bend in commercial row crop is 40 in and they're starting to make better use of the ground now with the Advent of drip irrigation so this box is roughly 6 by3 and you can do it as simple as you want or as sophisticated as you want the key is when you're trying to start something from seed is you got to keep it wet once you get the seed wet it cannot dry dry out or you'll stop the germination process and how much you think that is with the wood uh this here these fence boards are you know you can get them between two and $4 Redwood this was about $4 a piece this cedar 2x4 is like $2 or less for the whole thing for an 8ft piece 6ft piece uh soaker hose you can use use drip drip actual drip irrigation costs more there's a lot of pieces it's not really necessary in a box like this unless you can get your hands on actual drip tape that they use in in commercial farming and they have whole spacing from everywhere from 3 in to 8 in so you can um get the water right to your plant but when you're trying to germinate new seedlings you overseed because there's a percentage of seeds that are not going to make it you know you look on the pack of seeds they'll say 85 85 is pretty common 85% germination rate that mean so you're going to put more seeds just in because none of them all instead of putting just one seed you would put more yeah there's a potential that 15% are not going to seed okay even if everything's perfect just because they are not perfect okay and then there's other factors outside here that are going to could cause some casualties as well well okay so I don't know if you can see in the camera we have some seedlings coming up in this first row so now what is that wir in there for first well that didn't come with the hose right no this is common soaker hose that is cut at the length to get one wrap or one line for each plant line and then I since I I cut it you know it was a 20 foot hose to begin with or something like that cut it just bought a uh garden hose repair fitting and a cap to cap this hose and originally I had it just laying on the directly on the soil and that's fine but I thought so that it wouldn't um interfere with any of the seedlings trying to come through the ground it is strung wire just off of where the the plant line is you can see here's the Sprouts coming through so it's just an inch off to the side hang the hose from there and just kind of suspends it and then it'll just drip let me turn the water on a little bit so where is he the Seas already where is the little sprouting well here's if you focus on my fingertip fingertip okay all along this line there you see little oh yeah light green starting to come through oh yeah nice yeah I think this was uh spinach in this first row and that's a pretty quick germinator we have uh carrots cilantro and I forget what the fourth one is in this box kale I think no kale no we were going to save kale for a bigger box but things most of these types of vegetables are between 7 days to 2 weeks and temperatures yeah is a factor there there's a about uh 8 cubic yards of soil in here and you could see it could hold some more but it's really not necessary to fill it to the brim this is plenty but a little higher doesn't hurt either the purpose of the box for one thing is the one of the main reasons is it will warm the soil quicker than it will warm the soil on the flat ground the sun can hit it from all sides it's isolated it's a smaller smaller unit so it'll warm up quicker that speeds up germination helps uh helps them get through the cold nights it's like a moisture yeah plus yeah so the wire you just added it there you attach it with a nail right yeah I just use some roofing nails on the ends because they have a wider head and that'll act act as the anchor it's nothing fancy I just cut some of the so I just Twisted the end around put some tension on it didn't have to be overtight and I just you can use anything you want if you have little uh ties like for closing bags in the grocery store those kind of twist ties that's fine I just cut some of the same wire to make my my hanger there so you had before you had it right on top of the soil now you lift it up so it could uh for what reason oh just to just in case the hose is laying on a Seedling it could you know it could break the head of the to protect it of the of The Little Seedling as it's trying to come through the ground but they're actually stronger than you think I mean they can push a dirt clot out out of their way sometimes when they're trying to get to the sun they can actually push a dirt clot out of their way of course there is a point where they will just so the reason they sprout is because they're looking for light right for the sun yes exactly very interesting yeah um what about how much with the whole bik with the so is what cost them if they wanted to do it to do one box like this is probably F the wood you got to buy a soaker hose uh spool of wire box of nails um you know 50 $60 that's not bad so and you the only only reason I chose Redwood is it's stands up to being wet better same with this cedar fence post they they can handle moisture I mean that's what they're made for is why they why they use it for fencing so they're more like water resistant I mean weather resistant right yeah they don't they are slow to rot from contact with water what about the soil now uh you can buy organic soil right this is the next bik you're going to do yeah there's these are 1.5 so 1 and A2 cubic feet bags of organic garden soil you don't have to use that but uh any good it needs to be a top soil not not a soil for uh house plants so it needs to have a little more uh this is it says flower and Herb so that's what you need right flower herbs right here so how many bags well the these are one and A2 cubic feet so we got one two three four five six six of them this is probably a little more than we need but we didn't get this first box very full either uh here's our three fence boards you can see the dog dog ear we'll just cut that off to get a nice Square in and that that was the length I used the begin and then you take one and cut it in half right for the yeah create create the end uh cut it in half cut it whatever you you decide how many rows you want to put in there and you need to look at what you're growing to determine how much width you need uh look on the packet of your seeds if you don't know and what the what the suggested row spacing is so you some things like to be crowded and other things they need some room to breathe so this right here this is I'm talking about organic or organic soil and the wood it would be about 60 if the one it started right yeah yeah the organic soil's a little bit more money and what on this next box what we plan to do is put uh food waste you know the husk of avocados banana peels just you know all that kind of food waste you have from preparing meals I'm going to actually put it in the bottom of the Box before we put the soil in okay and that as that decomposes you know that's going to release nitrogen and and other minerals into the soil so we're going to we're going to do it we're going to show them how to do the bags you're going to put it cut it put it together and then add the um leftover leftover right the from the juicing waste yeah from juicing all that pulp that's left we're going to food scraps and that's what is that called well it it's almost like composting campus okay like campus that's what you're going to do campus which is very good uh it's like a fertilizer it works as a fertilizer yeah when the food waste decomposes it's releasing nitrogen and other minerals to the soil so it's very very important you use that instead of fertilizers and so we'll come back I feel like that guy from California what's the name uh huser huser welcome back uh we show you how to put it together and I'll come back and show you how these seedlings are doing okay here's my dog Bing the neighbors Jen",
