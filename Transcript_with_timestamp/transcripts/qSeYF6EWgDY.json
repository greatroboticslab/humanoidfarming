  "text": "move around a little bit it's just my style my challenge today is to actually build on what was just said to say I don't actually think about the term Big Data anymore because to me big data is absolutely useless big data is only useful as you transform it into big decisions so the challenge for Australian livestock species is to do exactly as we said before is to merge what I consider Big Data into big decisions and actually equip the livestock Industries to enhance the productivity in the area that I work with there's some major changes are happening in the livestock area suffice to say that we've probably seen in the last 12 months changes that we wouldn't have expeced in the last 10 years my challenge is that producers are starting to operate more sophisticated brand uh chains they're starting to think about not only supplying on weight and fact demographics but also about how do they fit into the brand architecture how do they fit into the brand DNA how do they fit into the brand ecology now all of those three things are starting to really differentiate producers in how they interact with Supply chains production driven by branded products potenti block more in the brand so when you actually become closer to the brand one of the real challenges is you actually start to move away from that little bit of diversity that producers actually like they like the opportunity of diversity but with diversity comes cost of production and with that diversity also comes risk so being aligned to Brand aets ups and downs successful producers are really changing they're starting to manage more information they're starting equip himself to handle this information there's more and more sensors coming in I'll show you some examples of that there's this big challenge of managing more and more animals with less labor so corporate agriculture is moving into this area the cultural Chang that's happening in our uh particular space is that we are changing 3 or 400 years of agricultural production most farmers and most family Farmers that You' spoken about this morning have built themselves on dealing with complexity around visualization of that complexity they walk out into the padic they observe what their animals are doing they observe what their Fe doing they observe what's happening with the advance of all of these senses you're changing that Dynamic CU they no longer walk out into the P to observe things they're getting this tsunami of information presented to them so I'll show you that in a couple of these pictures that are coming up so we are about to see the cultural change of changing from visual agriculture to what I say is its best uh driven as information driven agriculture built around these value chains so transforming big data so big data requires analysis and interpretation into information and then interpretation insights into decisions now the size of those I tried to capture a little bit there's a heap of data there's a little bit of information and I had to put decisions into that Circle and B decisions in I really wanted to say the size of decisions to be a pinpoint on that particular side so we are investing PS of money into agricultural data we're not investing PS of money into agricultural decisions and in our area the biggest goal that we'll have particularly in southern livestock species is integration of what I call the uh livestock Enterprises with the cropping Enterprises with the pasture Enterprises with soil Enterprises all of those things which are the multiac areas of mix farming businesses and there is not one single entity that's actually taken that role and responsibility on MLA the company I work with they're very happy working about livestock decisions GDC happy working about cropping decisions the interface between our two areas will drive Southern Agriculture and yet we still haven't had those discussions so that is the role we need to do so Emer Technologies objective measurements changing the area and I know Tom and Troy will talk about that uh genetics and genomics a couple of years ago when we first started the the CRC we started characterizing animals and we thought if one or two genes could we could measured that would be fantastic then we got something that was measuring 100 jeans then we got something that measured 1,000 jeans then we got something that was measuring 50,000 je then we got something that's measured 700,000 je now we're doing full sequencing at 3.5 million gen and the interesting thing full sequencing costs now less than what it was to get one or two jeans 5 years ago so all of that information coming and then when you say to the average a sea stock producer I know there are several in the room not only are we going to give you this information around F we're going to throw you back full sequence information that full sequence information is basically one Gaby of information you've got 100 so we want to transfer down 100 GB of information down on the current download speeds have a little heart attack right so all of those things are emerging that area now with this information management how do you actually get all this information so you know we talk in talk in terms of of lead Yi we're talking single figures around percentages of L me yield what happens if I actually gave you percentages of L me yield in 39 muscles across the body I also gave you the meat color of all those muscles I gave you the pH of all those muscles I gave you the marbling store of all those muscles I gave you the consumer quality scores of all those muscles and then I said here's all this information there's at least 39 muscles I've given you 10 pieces of information go ahead and breed the perfect care producers can't even do one yet they bit like marinas they they get to one and they can't count past that so we're throwing all this information directly into their laps and we're asking him to make much more informed decisions and that he yet to really come I'm a bit worried about that particular area so we've got RI tags and they coming things the F PS for livestock I made a joke about 3 months ago on another Forum I said there'll be F PS for livestock and I noticed yesterday or two days ago there was a major article coming out but they've actually done exactly that they've now got 50 P of the livestock and they're actually thinking they're going to get improvements in breeding efficiency in Dairy C while about 10% through knowledge of that information so sometimes when you make a joke you got to be careful about the outcome GPS tracking we're doing all of these things so we now know virtual stocking rates we now are changing our feing lines for changing our pattern of resource utilization based on this information we got drones and sensors are going up in that area we got water and and fence sensors are happening all the time and the area that I'm most excited about is this biolog IC tattoos when you start to put in tattoos on individual animals with biologically active inks and they paress at different frequencies and that paress tells you about the well-being of animals now wouldn't that be exciting you can walk out in the padic and all the heers are bright green so you know that they're all happy now or more importantly wouldn't it be really good if you put the Drone up and they saw all these bright green heers and they actually reported back to you in your office when you're sitting inside the pool having the drink all your he is a Happ right now that's not too far off and again that's going to change the face of Agriculture and particularly the again it's going to take the visualization out it will change management skills and as Phil said earlier I'm starting to see that we're going to change a way from Farm managers to what I call a system as Engineers systems Engineers actually take all of this information and make effective decisions they're not managing anymore they're decision makers and again that's a change in we havec the areas again Chris people talk about it in her session I encourage you to go and listen to that later on is all these hyperspectral cameras and new deay Dex x-rays all this information that's going on it's just going to throw this Sami of of information back to livestock producers more importantly how do they make effective decisions about all this of this information how do they balance up the fact that we tell them that lean me yield and E quality have a big negative correlation if you want to fit it into value based marketing to adjust for that negative correlation the real value is actually optimizing on those two principles you throw a neural network at it he's the optimal profile for exactly the the numbers of animals that you need in each of these sequences and in Northern beep industry we're doing exactly that we're starting to say based on your genetic profile based on the r growth you've had up to 200 days you go on a boat and you go to a processing work that's the type of information that's going to come forward and again SPAC of technology that little thing that's a NYX color sensor that cost about $300 us it links to your iPhone it does a really good job of objective color in both beef and sheep we think that we're able to put all of these uh these little Nick sensors into a range of supermarkets basically get crowd sourcing information back as each of the consumers picks up a piece of meat tells whether they like the meat color or not they come back next time they use a little sense and they tell us whether they like the product or not so instead of having one or 2,000 pieces of information some we might have 100,000 pieces of information consumer capability of eating Quality Meat car on a daily basis won't that transform how agricultural production will go and won't that transform how companies integrate so it's becoming increasingly complex so biolog the biology of of Agriculture particularly Livestock systems I think producers and particularly livestock producers do a fantastic job of doing dealing with complexity in decision making what they don't do well is actually handle the complication of complexity and we are throwing more and more complication to that complexity we are making decisions metric five a minute and that is going to influence how we do those areas so it doesn't matter where you sit in the supply chain this increasingly complex system of moving from complex to complicated it's going to be a real Challenge and to show here's the red me language CH uh value chain this is all the information that we've got that's going across there does a whole hip of information all of these traits are coming in place the really interesting thing is there is not one common set of language or standards that goes across that whole agricultural profile there's Heats of information collected to that and not one part of each of those sectors talks to each other there's no stand in the meure right way across that Spectrum so goal of decision making understanding these whole areas so livestock Enterprises and my challenge for the the livestock producers in order to to Really grapple with big decisions and Big Data understand resilience and adaptability of your production system understand where the key points are going to be there's going to be huge opportunity not to live productivity I think people focus on productivity a lot in the supply chain at least in the meat supply chain I work in the cost of non-compliance to livestock production far out ways the cost of any improvements we can make in productivity so people producing things to a market Endo after 6 or 700 days and getting that wrong is far greater crost to the industry than liting productivity by 2 or 3% and as an example with the cost of non-compliance and a couple of Supply chains I've worked in it's about $52 an animal the dark cutting which is one industry issue it's $192 a kilo it's a $50 million issue that can be solved just with the data that we've got available today so there are big gains getting rid of non so less wastage of resources is probably the KE for agriculture more than anything else what are going to drive some of these things as I said before compliance to Market specification there's $30 to $85 ahead value based marketing well I've gone away from the term value based Marketing in my STP value based pricing when you actually have value based pricing then you allow the value change do the market producers shouldn't get involved in that area business efficiency and profitability they're all going to leverage this information and data to information to decisions identifying where those key areas is going to be quite important and from an RDC point of view when you actually use that type of area you will radically change investment portfolios in R&D if you know where the key points of transactional efficiency are you will change where you invest R&D dollars and at the moment we apply a shotgun approach to that type of area so lots of databases uh mid or MLA we're lucky to be the custodians of a range of different databases so we've got n meet stands Australia livestock data link the national livestock recording system where the custodians have breed plan where the custodian uh sorry with AB sheet genetics on Farm software Bree societies are all involved that animal health there's all of these databases that com in on board very few of them actually integrate to together to form big decision so in one area a little bit of on Farm software now is linking the national livestock recording service with the Bureau of me meteorology to sell a little bit of information about when we sell and what to Fe probably about 2% of livestock production is starting to actively make that prop then we get a little bit more complicated when we link those NIS with me standard Australia with Loft data link together with bre plan and Sheet genetics and the research databases to improve the information of eating qu and to show you how complex our challenges are in the area of meat standards Australia last year we graded 3.2 million animals each of those had measurements of intros measurements of color measurements of verification all those other challenges we have a national genetics databasing breed plan with the breed societies which is basically the world's best at the moment how many records out of that 3.2 million do you think went back into the genetics database to influence genetic decision making that's greater than zero not by much actually 611 so the other 2.9 million plus we lost in terms of that contribution to the genetics datab and and in our case MLA manages both of them and we can't even connect them yet so that's the challenge we have and here's an example of of where the real value actually lies Tom will probably use this later on in his talk value based marketing pilot if we actually understood the complexity of L that yield if we actually understood the complexity of uh heating quality if we can apply that the system provide that information back to producers over 105,000 animals is $18.8 million difference between paying on weight and fat versus paying on real value based course so there's about 20 to $130 per Animal by getting that decision right that's a huge opportunity for the Australian agriculture Industries to look at so we've got a whole heap of things there benchmarking and I won't go through those but benchmarking gracing systems host compliance the area that I want to see our our Industries get much more invoked in the BCA is about supporting investment strategies we saw this morning about investment in agriculture the problem about investment in agriculture is we are not using big decisions to make that investment decision for us so we can do a lot more of those areas Health and Welfare the uh spoke about brand DNA earlier on there's going to be this Quantum need for Australian agriculture to start to underpin brands with information that supports the brand Integrity in both domestically domestic and international communities and all that requires information coming from farm right up through the value CH so to deal with that complexity is going to be a challenge then you get measurement of R&D investment all those other things and the bottom line is total Farm productivity or or profitability it's the key area of big decisions now at the moment with big data we are making no in rides into that area with big decisions we can probably transform that with about a 5 or 10% Improvement that's the type of quantum we can see in agriculture and value chain efficiency is just a start to give you an idea what's already out there this is the Irish system so the Irish and you think the Irish are a little bit backwards and apologies for those people Irish in the room but they have a lovely piece of legislation that saids if you breed cattle in Ireland you have to be part of that system it's great wouldn't that be great piece of legislation to putr but it means every animal in irland is fully genotyped every animal all the transactions right the way through its lifetime are made when it goes to the avire every piece of information is actually captured it in the avire all of that information fed back into a National Database and that's all made will back up into decision making around genetics and completely integrated right the way through the system you have to be part of that now the really good thing is the Irish tapped into the European Agriculture Commission and they got something like $70 million to install and we don't have the luxury doing that type of area so that's our job New Zealand again system with New Zealand that's about $187 million today now we're talking about in nla about putting a system that's going to cost us $2 to $3 million we're not even in the right ballpark when it comes to these type of decision making so the lesson learned from others about talking thing and we've got a review out at the moment it's about getting everybody in the same room and think about where the wind situations actually are so looking for people to make decisions and outcomes and the real key about integration across the live stock chain is that you've got to create the win-win based on aggregation and aggregation to leads to decisions at the moment Mick might talk about later on about Open Access platforms around data well the real people are asking livestock is open access around the algorithms that involve the decision making because at the moment there is no confidence in a lot of those algorithms that involved the decision Mak so we've got to get to that M no one really knows what big data is everything everybody thinks is going to be important uh everybody's applying a consistent approach and principles to address that there's Democratic data is the delivery through public available apis and everything like that you talk to everybody everybody thinks yes I'm involved in Big Data you talk to everybody about how to using big data on collecting it collecting big data is not using big data everybody wants to be part of it and everybody thinks that because they've got data they've got value in big data and people have yet to work out the only value in data is when you aggregate that data to make a decision and we have got to face a real cultural change in in agriculture about moving away from IP protectionism to an open- Source platform that allows big decisions to be made across agriculture at the moment we're moving the other way down other way around information about genuine value creating genuine value in the supply chain or the value chain is a real critical thing you can make decisions you can give advice on those type of things but unless they lead to tangible value there be no impact on agriculture as I said before data by itself is not valuable and people are putting all of these restrictions around data because they think they own the data the real key is to only algorithms that aggregate the data that's where the real information is going to be collected and actually making the public Source most going and people think that providing data entitles them more value so I've listened and we worked with people recently that said I'm giving you this data and in in return for this data I expect this now in many cases you can't actually predict what you're going to give them so how can you actually give uh take their data without actually understanding what you're going to give them back and that's going to be the learning experience to work over in the next couple years and then industry own data I mean as an RDC about 3 months ago we blindly went into the belief that we should set up a single National Database set up all these algorithms do all these wonderful things control a lot right a lot of consultations power is firstly helping set the standards and secondly helping set the framework about how you create the algorithms to make decisions it's not our role to pull the data together our role is to coordinate and facilitate the opportunity to do that so my challenge for the industries are data is increasingly more complex it's complicated and volumetric and if you think farmers are struggling with day to-day decision making they are they're struggling with draft decisions they're struggling with all these things and suddenly we're going to put this huge pressure on them to cope with the information that's coming back to them and I have already started to see some of the producers struggling and particularly in the sea stock industry struggle with that transition from visual to information driven decisions and that is creating culture Big Data must generate capacity to drive big decisions so I hope everybody walks out the room we're thinking about big decisions rather than big data and the key barriers engaging everybody along the value chain and listening what Phil said earlier about changing the value chain that horizontal platform of information transfer is yet to be discussed because we haven't yet had the real conversation about agriculture about integrating livestock with pastures and cropping and soils everybody's wor walking in their own silos and that big decision about integration has yet to come thanks very much",
