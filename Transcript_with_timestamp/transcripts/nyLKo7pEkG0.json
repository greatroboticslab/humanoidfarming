  "text": "I would like to share one idea about managing water scarcity for food security focusing on sub-saharan Africa the world's population has been increasing continuously and this has been translated into more mouse for food and agriculture and food production needs a lot of water actually right now just for irrigation itself use about seventy percent of further withdrawn water resources and as a consequence many rivers and lakes are drying up so we are facing great challenge to produce more food with the limited water resources then the question is where we should focus on to produce more food with per drop of water food production is not just for local consumption it is also for international trade at the moment the international traded food accounts for about fifteen percent of the total production an international trade that carries virtual water which is the water used there for production during the production America North America and South America and Oceania are the major food exporters and also the virtual water exporters and Asia and Africa are the major importers of food also the importance of were taught in this map of water scarcity as you can see a tree though major water scarce regions are in the middle latitude of northern hemisphere and the in sub-sahara Africa there isn't physical water scarcity however in sub-saharan Africa yield crop yield is very low typically one-third of the global average and why it is that we did a lot of studies on the factors influencing the yield growth in sub-saharan Africa and craft models are widely used for this kind of an investigation and coupling it with GIS we can do large-scale assimilation and find out what factors are important for crop growth this slide actually shows one of our research result which is simulated a result of amazed yield in sub-saharan Africa the total height shows the range of the year the red line shows the average yield of maize at this moment for the whole continent and then the second bar actually shows if we increase the water supply to meet the demand for by the crops what will happen it shows actually it doesn't have much impact on you because you doesn't increase much the third part actually shows when we increase the fertilizer fertilizer supply to meet the demand of crops and then you can see the huge jumps by a big margin but the ranch is still very large because this means that the the ranch or the yield is unstable and the last one last bite ratio said that the yield is stable with water supply and sufficient fertilization and here we want to show the technology and and know-how actually there we know how to improve the yield for sub-saharan Africa if we can double the yield then the sub-saharan Africa would not need to import cereal anymore if we contribute then there will be surplus for export so with many regions in the world having water scarcity and the increasing production becomes a more costly and sub-saharan Africa is new sauce for the future food supply and virtual water supply to elevate water scarcity other regions so a Chinese entrepreneur once has said give me a Africa and I can feed the world he's wrong he cannot have Africa but he's right in a way that Africa does have two big potential to provide food to the world and the challenge is how to unleash this potential in our sustainable and equitable and economically way you",
