1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,679
hey welcome back everybody today we're

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,240
going to do some disking with our dirt

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:08,160
dog disc on the kubota m4 tractor now

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,559
dirt dog does offer discs to fit

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,160
tractors big and small so we have them

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,759
as small as four foot wide if you're

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,839
looking for something for a subcompact

8
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,840
tractor you know the five six seven foot

9
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,840
range everywhere in between two you're

10
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,359
going to see these are two rows on this

11
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,359
disc right here and they are going to be

12
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,279
able to be offset so you can have them

13
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,640
that are pretty much straight in line

14
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,720
just for the light tilling or you can

15
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,640
make them really aggressive on steep

16
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,960
angles to really get an aggressive turn

17
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,960
of your soil and everywhere in between

18
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,280
now disking is typically going to be a

19
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,760
kind of a final run or a final pass that

20
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,520
you can do prior to planting your seed

21
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,520
the very popular alternative would be

22
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,440
using a rototiller which i absolutely

23
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,280
love now this is the first run with a

24
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,680
dirt dog disc caro i've used these in

25
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,719
the past they do work well i don't think

26
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,120
they're going to give you the same

27
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,039
finished results as a rototiller wood

28
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,160
not the most consistent seed bed but

29
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,640
we're going to try it in a couple of

30
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,520
spots today a few weeks back we did a

31
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,080
long stretch with a big old sub soiler

32
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,000
and ripped down over 20 inches close to

33
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,080
two foot down we're going to be putting

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
in a screening cover right here to kind

35
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,680
of give us a little bit of distinction

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,439
as hunting season comes around in the

37
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,280
fall and so oftentimes you are going to

38
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,040
do some sort of a deep tillage

39
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,799
application it could be with a plow it

40
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,640
could be with a sub soiler and you would

41
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,560
come through afterwards with a disc or a

42
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,840
rototiller for your final preparation

43
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,439
i'm going to show you a couple different

44
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,000
areas today one of them will be where we

45
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,280
did previously do that deep tillage

46
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,720
another area is going to be where we

47
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,720
haven't done any kind of soil

48
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,640
disturbance at all so you'll see this

49
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,320
farm ground here has not been tilled it

50
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,840
has not been worked in well over a

51
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,360
decade so it's not great soil right it's

52
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,119
got a lot of clay in it a lot of sand a

53
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,439
lot of small stones

54
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,560
the top soil is just so so at best so

55
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,479
you're going to have a chance to see how

56
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,560
the disc caro does on something that's

57
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,320
been previously worked up as well as

58
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,240
we're going to call it virgin ground and

59
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,079
see if it gives you the desired results

60
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,920
now these discards will work with any

61
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,040
category one uh three-point hitch

62
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,799
they're also going to be quick hitch

63
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,719
compatible the bigger guys will work

64
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,479
with category two three points as well

65
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,880
dirt dog attachments are made down in

66
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,640
georgia so they're made in the usa

67
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,160
a few other points worth noting you are

68
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,800
going to have sealed ball bearings in

69
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,040
all of the axles a two inch square tube

70
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,040
frame all around your gangs are going to

71
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,959
be held on by a three by i think it's

72
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,560
one and a half inch square tube or

73
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,239
rectangular tube

74
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,760
in the black that you can see here and

75
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,000
you're gonna see we have an optional

76
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,319
scraper kit added on that's what these

77
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,400
little uh u brackets are that are

78
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,319
clamped down with these black rods that

79
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,080
are hanging along that's a scraper kit

80
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,599
so uh the mud and debris will kind of

81
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,959
clean off a little bit easier so we're

82
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,640
going to go ahead and adjust these to a

83
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,239
bit more of an aggressive angle then

84
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,239
we're going to get to work but don't

85
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,040

spacers they are made in america have a

120
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,160
lifetime warranty if your tractor feels

121
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,680
tippy side to side especially if you

122
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,360
have a cab on it then adding a set of

123
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,879
wheel spacers can make a big difference

[Music]

131
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,720
alrighty folks there you have it you

132
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,920
have a look right where we're standing

133
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,079
this is where we had done that deep

134
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,839
tillage and on the far side near the

135
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,480
road frontage is where we tilled that

136
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,240
virgin ground up so not really much of a

137
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,320
difference in results i don't think so i

138
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,399
think it'd be okay either way now that

139
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,640
is four passes we went down and back

140
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,560
twice on each one of these strips so

141
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,079
imagine the amount of time that it would

142
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,079
take you and it's really easy right

143
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,440
you're just dropping it down and going

144
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,200
but it's going to take you a while to do

145
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,399
but i do have a hydraulic top link on

146
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,800
here which is nice to make those

147
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,000
adjustments from the operator seat

148
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,560
you know it's a little bit of playing

149
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,959
around with the speed with the angle of

150
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,399
that top length to get the right

151
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,480
you know i mean the optimal i guess

152
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,839
conditions for the disc and i did adjust

153
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,240
this i went with the most aggressive

154
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,160
position the first down and back in both

155
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,760
areas and then i adjusted it made it a

156
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,200
little bit less aggressive there's four

157
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,440
different settings or four different

158
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,760
angles so i made it one less aggressive

159
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,800
setting on there and did another pass on

160
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,480
it

161
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,240
you know i don't think if i go any less

162
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,079
aggressive it's going to make it any

163
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,519
better you know i could go over it again

164
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,279
and again and i think it would improve

165
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,560
the results and if i had a larger field

166
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,240
you know like if i did this whole field

167
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,680
right now um i could come at it from

168
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,360
different angles kind of crisscross it

169
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,720
as well and that would certainly break

170
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,160
up these clumps and these clods a little

171
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,680
bit better and we're gonna get to doing

172
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,680
areas like that later this spring this

173
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,920
is just for a screening cover that we're

174
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,200
trying to get in right now

175
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,279
but what you see on here these are going

176
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,040
to be notched discs that are on here

177
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,399
they have smooth this as well the

178
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,720
notched ones are going to be better for

179
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,880
breaking up kind of the sod and the and

180
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,560
the heavy matter and debris that's in

181
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,160
here say you have a cornfield with some

182
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,760
corn stubble afterwards and you're

183
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,240
knocking that all down so really good

184
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,920
for that these scrapers came into play

185
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,680
really nicely

186
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,519
the last time i used a disc several

187
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,959
years ago it's been a while

188
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,480
there's just huge clumps of dirt and

189
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,160
everything that we're getting on there

190
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,639
so the same problem that has plagued me

191
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,800
on discs for smaller tractors like what

192
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,880
you see here is really kind of that

193
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,880
weight ratio you know you want a lot of

194
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,120
weight kind of pushing down into the

195
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,120
ground to help your your disc do its

196
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,880
thing and there were times if i was

197
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,279
going too fast that it felt like it

198
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,200
wanted to ride up on top of the ground

199
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,240
instead of down in it and going through

200
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,600
it

201
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,279
some of that was top link adjustments

202
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,399
that i was making some of that was speed

203
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,920
too but

204
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,279
the benefit of one of these discs is

205
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,800
that you can go through different

206
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,480
terrain you know you saw a lot of sticks

207
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,480
and roots and things like that that a

208
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,040
tiller may otherwise struggle with and a

209
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,040
tiller is going to be slower but

210
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,959
one pass is going to yield the results

211
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,040
that i think personally are better than

212
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,800
four passes with a disc and so the

213
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,399
kubota here has a little speedometer on

214
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,320
there tells you how fast you're going

215
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,160
and i was bouncing between

216
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,240
second and third gear and low range and

217
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:08,240
i was going from 2.1 to

218
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,680
2.56 miles per hour so going faster than

219
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,440
tiller of course

220
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,120
but you can see these finish results

221
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,880
which overall aren't terrible but

222
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,519
they're nowhere near what a tiller can

223
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,200
do and there's certain areas out here

224
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,639
that are well this is really good right

225
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,480
here actually but there's certain areas

226
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,920
up top and a couple of different spots

227
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,600
where it looks like there's just big old

228
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,760
chunks of sod still and of course that

229
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,000
crisscross hatch would fix that but just

230
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,680
an observation anyway we've got a lot of

231
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,760
tilling videos coming up whether it's

232
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,440
with a disc or a tiller or a plow

233
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,920
planting all sorts of stuff we're going

234
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,199
to put some pollinator

235
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,920
seed out here as well have some

236
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,360
wildflowers growing the field across or

237
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,720
behind this

238
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,399
fence row here we're going to turn into

239
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,880
a lot of different food plots where in

240
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,399
northwoods whitetails food plot seed

241
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,440
dealer as well so we're just getting set

242
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,279
up with them so look for more

243
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,720
information from them on our website and

244
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,160

00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,680
attachment something for the three-point

246
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,160
hitch for the front end loader we're

247

your own projects planned for the future

254
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,680

255
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,880
by watching us either way i want to

256

gonna do one final pass

261
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,800
make it a little bit less aggressive

262
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,560
even yet

263
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,630
