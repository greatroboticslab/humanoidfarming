1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,640
we started if you read the literature

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,160
everybody knew that no till had more

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,679
runoff than conventional tillage but no

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,440
till at that time was they take a

5
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:12,200
conventionally tilled field after

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,040
harvest they'd till some of it leave

7
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:17,199
some of it untilled and sprinkle it with

8
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:20,680
water and gee water went ran off more in

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:23,119
the noil see and so we actually included

10
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,920
a noil type treatment in some of what

11
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,720
we're doing it was kind of a high runoff

12
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,519
check but after 3 years it wasn't the

13
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,160
high runoff check anymore but then to

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,879
try to get people to move that way in in

15
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:39,280
the system took a while and then kind of

16
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:39,280
that started to change the mindset
