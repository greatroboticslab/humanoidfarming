1
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:12,799
I'm luk D and I work for re Creek

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,280
Partners which is Our Family Farm it's

3
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:19,520
comprised of my father and my uncle my

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:24,199
mother and myself and my wife um we run

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:26,400
a mixed Farm here grazing cropping and

6
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:30,759
livestock um my background I'm from

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,360
Precision farming and we're um yeah I'm

8
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:34,920
always trying to find the most

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:37,440
economical economical way to give the

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,440
greatest efficiency in what we do and

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,600
also be sustainable and look after our

12
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:46,320
land since the drought broke ended sort

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,960
of 2020 we um got a lot of rain and

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,840
we've had nearly four three to four

15
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,079
really really exceptional Seasons really

16
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,600
really wet that's bought some of its own

17
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,039
problems but every every time everything

18
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,280
brings problems but yeah we've had good

19
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:03,440
stock prices and yeah good yields good

20
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,439
livestock um and we' sort we yeah have

21
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,280
done reasonably well so we've decided

22
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:10,320
yeah to what we've made we're investing

23
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,799
back in to continue on to be able to

24
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,360
keep farming into the future and that's

25
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:16,680
through Water Works and fencing and

26
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,439
improving our pastures for the last

27
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:23,119
couple of decades I suppose we've moved

28
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:25,200
to minimum to no till mainly M till uh

29
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,720
improved pastures and Native pastures on

30
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,159
our grazing country and in the last

31
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,799
droughts or last couple droughts we

32
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,640
learned it was really important to

33
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,439
maintain ground cover and since then in

34
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,720
the last 3 to 4 years we've had high

35
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:41,119
rainfall and good pasture growth and um

36
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:44,479
very little water runoff in our

37
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:46,920
traditional dams and waterways and this

38
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,040
has decreased our ability to have

39
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,000
Livestock on country that does have

40
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,399
pasture but very very little water so

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,520
yeah we've decided

42
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,600
to put a couple of Bs together and put a

43
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,600
big header tank in and upgrade some

44
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,640
pipelines and add new pipelines and

45
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,119
Interlink all our farming country and

46
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,479
grazing country and start putting

47
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,360
troughs in it's a big task and yeah the

48
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,480
last couple years we've embarked on

49
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:16,840
doing that even through the dryer what

50
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:19,440
would have been Dyer pinches and spells

51
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,440
by having the rotational grazing being

52
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,480
able to

53
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,480
maintain the the feed body there and

54
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:28,400
have the water is definitely certainly

55
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,040
improving that we've noticed so we can

56
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,920
yeah continue our stocking rate through

57
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,720
the year instead of destocking and

58
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,800
restocking likewise so it's something we

59
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,640
want to keep doing more more work so we

60
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,720
can continue increasing our stocking

61
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,239
rate had some cropping country that

62
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,040
we're slowly breaking down into

63
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,000
rotational grazing country um and

64
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,480
they'll be they're basically 50 hectare

65
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,280
paddocks or more and we'll be splitting

66
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,879
them down into 20 hectare paddocks and

67
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,920
then whilst we're doing the fencing

68
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:55,840
we've been putting troughs in in the

69
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,280
fence line so they can be divided like

70
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,800
one one trough is being utilized between

71
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,040
two paddocks and that's sort of help

72
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,959
helping keep costs costs down a bit but

73
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,080
still providing the water there um

74
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,440
that's something we've done for a while

75
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,680
and yeah it's worked well so we'll

76
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,720
continue doing we live in our grazing

77
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,120
country lighter country and it's

78
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,360
traditionally that water runoff country

79
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:19,040
that's what you were talking about iron

80
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,480
bark country um Native grasses and we're

81
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,640
currently we're doing an Autumn our

82
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,840
terminal

83
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,400
use but join a terminal size uh are

84
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,360
laming down in that country at the

85
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:32,280
moment um and we wrote uh don't rotate

86
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:36,200
we sort of set stocked lamb but in small

87
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,560
mobs of 100 in Twins and singles so each

88
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,840
each Paddock on the Farm's getting

89
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,319
utilized and each padic needs to have

90
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,439
water but there's there's several

91
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:44,640
paddocks that we'll probably even go and

92
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:46,319
look at possibly that don't have any

93
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,040
water at the moment or just about to run

94
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,840
out of water with with uh Lambs at foot

95
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,959
on the U which is yeah it's not really a

96
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,959
good

97
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:57,400
situation I'd like to thank the local

98
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:59,840
Land Services for um providing

99
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:03,360
information and these updates

100
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,959
they're very helpful um they point out a

101
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,760
lot of things that are going on or what

102
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,239
other people are doing in the area that

103
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,599
we might not be doing or that what we

104
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:16,160
can learn on we try to attend most

105
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:18,799
programs that are run by the LLS AWI DPI

106
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,519
trying to always improve on what we're

107
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,280
doing because we can always do stuff

108
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,680
better trying to always improve our

109
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,479
1centers if you want to do something

110
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,240
there's plenty of contacts to talk to

111
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,840
and they've got good information and

112
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,600
there are resources that are there there

113
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,360
independent of of any major companies or

114
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,560
anything and they give out great advice

115
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,440
and it's something that we should we as

116
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,800
farmers and upcoming Farmers should

117
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,800
definitely support
