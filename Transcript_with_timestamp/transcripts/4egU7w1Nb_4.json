  "text": "hey folks is Josh Tony rich farmer welcome to the farm blog today it is what I like to call Golden Hour the Sun is setting the trees are beautiful everything looks wonderful we've got a few things we've got to tackle today we've got to go up and check on the goats I'm gonna show you some new gear that we got for the Gator we're gonna have a little bit of an unboxing I've got a big shipment in from Amazon today and about a bunch of goodies to put on the Gator to make things a little bit easier to haul around the farm and the last thing we're gonna do my lawn mower seems to constantly have a flat tire so today we're going to address that problem I've got some new inner tubes for the front wheels on my zero turn mower we'll take the tire off the rim slap those new tubes in there come on along I'll have a little bit of fun today first we're going to go check on the goats get a little bit of work done all right [Music] so first thing we're gonna do is head up to the goat pin where I'm gonna need this pitchfork I'll show you why I need the pitchfork I've got an issue and we're gonna solve this issue probably in one of the next few vlogs and I'll take you up there and I'll show you what the biggest issue is it's easier if I can show you let's go have some play that's one thing about golden our golden hour doesn't last very long and the grass is really coming in nice the Sun it's beautiful man look at that this is all the new ground the new grass that we sowed this year it's coming in nice and thick we saw this last September and this is some of the debris that's fallen from the windstorm so over the past two days here we've had bad bad winds the East Coast is experiencing what they call a nor Easter and that's pushing a lot of wind a lot of cold wind off the coast right to us and it's knocking trees down so we had a fire yesterday my neighbor called me up he said hey man you know your fields on fire I said what let's feed the goats so here's the goat feed and here's the goats I am getting ready to start relocating the goats in this area right here and basically we're going to move them from plot to plot to plot all throughout this field hay goatees so let's talk to you a little bit about the problem that I'm having up at the goat pen I put round bales in the goat pin for the goats to eat and this is what happens to them they get climbed all over and they eventually just get kind of spread out there all over the field the pasture here and they bind up the fence with it also so this is an electric poultry net and that's what keeps the goats in but it doesn't work if it looks like this let me show you the goats have spread out the hay all the way up against the fence right in here all the way down to here so we've got to get that off I've got to get that under control and we've got to find a better way to feed our goats hey they're just wasting hay they're just wasting it they're spreading it out on the ground which is good for the ground that's okay but they're wasting hay and I'm gonna take you over here and I'll show you what my idea is this is an old tobacco trailer used to haul tobacco I bought it from a guy a few years back and I built a mobile chicken coop a egg mobile out of this thing well I've built the egg mobile a little bit too top-heavy and it nearly turned me and the Gator over so we had to rethink what we were doing and we took off the chicken coop and reuse the materials when we built our chicken coop down by the garden so my thought is to convert this to the goat mobile the goat mobile will about the farm with the goats and the goats will go up inside of it I'll feed them inside of it so when I get ready to move them I can just close the door and move the goats and I also want to rig up an apparatus probably on the front here that keeps the hay bale up off the ground where the goats have to reach up and eat that's going to make for some fun times on the Stoney Ridge farmer channel building this thing we'll call it the goat mobile you know I went searching farm channels and looking for ways to feed goats that you know they didn't waste so much hay and there's just not a lot of information out there so I'm gonna put some info out there for you guys I hurt my finger the other day out this finger right here not my middle finger but my ring finger on my right hand I think I broke it on something the other day kind of got twisted and it's like you hear about the tiger that got a thorn in his paw you just can't function I just I'm having the hardest time because I just want to work I want to be able to throw stuff and pick stuff up and this hand is really hindering that it's a bummer as you can see it's a pain in the butt hopefully having the goat mobile and a place to keep the hay up off the ground will solve this problem I won't have to get in here and do this anymore all right we got our chores done with the goats we ride down here to the shop at this unboxing done and get the wheels off of this lawnmower at least the plan is today to get the front wheels off I think I'm gonna take the back tires off and take them to the tire shop a local tire shop here does a pretty good work in and they don't charge very much so we'll take the tires to the tire shop have them go through make sure they don't have any leaks and if they do we'll have them put patches in the inside of the tire and do it right that way I'm not filling up tires all summer long that's a pain in the butt I don't know if you guys have ever experienced that if you've ever experienced that post me a comment guys I asked you click that like button right now go down there click that like button tell me what you're thinking all right so we've been putting off this job pretty much all winter long I bought the inner-tubes last fall because I was just so sick of filling up the tires on the lawnmower and I'll show you over here they're probably already flat again I just filled them up yesterday yeah you can see that one there it's going flat and this one here is just it's just mush first thing we got to do is sweep up this area so we got a nice clean place to work nobody wants to work in a big pile of dirt shop owners best friend right there so much easier to sweep up your mess one of these little handheld jobs like that so one bad thing about a zero-turn the large zero turn like this this is a commercial john deere 777 you really can't move it unless you start it so I really hate to start an engine like this and let it run for fifteen seconds and back up it just seems to me it's doing more harm than good but we got to get it into the middle of the shop so we can work on it but the nice thing about having a zero return is you can whip it around in a little bitty tight spot let me show you what we've got to do the front tires on the zero turn come off a little bit different than you know then your normal tire let me show you so what I'll have to do is jack it up from this point right here and slip a jack stand in right here and we basically unbolt this bolt and the wheel should come right off and you can see that tyre is pretty much shot this one this one holds air pretty good you know the wheels are all kind of scrubby there so we may do a little wheel restoration we'll also just take this nut off and remove it and we'll put jack stands underneath here well fix these first and then we'll take off the rears so the rears have a pretty easy system you just unbolt those four bolts and off comes the wheel and I also write down 18 psi so this is my piece of equipment it's gonna be my piece of equipment until it falls down dying and screaming it's gonna go down in flames before I get rid of it on my wheels I wrote down what the PSI needs to be for the tires that way I'm running the same tire pressure on all four tires and I get a good even cut so if you're really OCD like me sometimes having a tire that's a different pressure on one side a lawnmower versus the other will cause your cut to be off you know it'll cause you to get an uneven cut on your lawn and make your lawn look like crap we want our lawn to look like gold so that's why I'm so obsessed with tire pressure and getting these tires right because I check the tire pressure before I mow every time I always check the oil and I always check the tire pressure that way I don't make a mess what good what all this work do if you went out and mowed your yard and it looked like crap when you got done so we're gonna use these little wimpy jack stands we'll take our jack get our mower up off the ground here slide in our jack stands we need to do a little manual manipulation here there we go pop that dude loose that suckers in there I'm gonna have to get him a rubber hammer and tap on it a little bit always be careful if you're hammering on some bolts or something like that that you don't damage the threads if you're gonna hammer on them so we're gonna get the rubber deadblow hammer to knock this thing out with deadblow every guy needs a dead blow hammer in his toolbox I'll post links to all the tools that I'm using down below in the video description if you see something in here that you're thinking about getting there'll be a link down below if you think you need it it's down there man pain in the butt put the wrench on it come on out of there buddy nothing's ever easy I will now deploy the beater screwdriver everybody needs a good beater screwdriver nothing ever goes like it should so this thing should have just slid right out it's rusty it's been outsides head grass on it grass is really acidic and grass is really really hard on metal so when I get done with my mower I normally try to blow it off the best I can I'll take the leaf blower and blow it off and then once every couple weeks I'll take the air hose and blow it off try to get all that old grass off there especially wet grass don't use a water hose just blow it off Buster out of here come on Buster come on out of there good lord you're making me look bad I'm gonna knock it back and forth a couple times see if that makes it slide out a little easier of course it doesn't good gracious I'm gonna have to use the feet there we go that's what daddy likes there we go see all that crusty rustiness we'll clean that up before we put it back on all right so here's our wheel entire assembly has two little grease caps on the ends right here that one and that one and those cover up the bearings we'll set those to the side and we'll look at our bearings our wheel bearings in here and make sure they're turning free you can tell here this one really isn't turning that free this one yeah they're both kind of gummed up my inclination is to clean them up really good take the air hose and clean them up really good maybe put a little bit of oil in there what I did not know is there is a metal shim down in there about that long like a tube down inside this wheel so I'm gonna slide the bolt back in here that's what it was all hanging up on there so that's kind of kind of work it back and forth here trying to work that rest off anytime you're doing a job like this you might as well try to do it right make sure everything's functioning properly when you put it back together I'm gonna rub and clean on these bearings a little bit and put some white lithium grease on it I think that's probably the right thing to do if you guys are wondering the free lawn mower that I got still on the back of the hundred dollar truck we'll get that off in the next day or so it's supposed to be a rainy day coming up I want to get it off there bring it in the shop here on a rainy day and take the engine off of it first we got to make sure it fires up so we'll throw a battery on it and see if it fires up there we go spinning pretty freely they're not brand new and we don't expect them to be brand new but they're not making any kind of grinding noises or anything so I'm okay with that let me start by saying I've never done this here's the inner tube the new tube and appears to tire this is a tubeless tire that's in it right now and I'm really wondering how the valve stem situation is gonna work out so we're gonna go on and open our tube hopefully this isn't beyond my scope of practice okay cool so it has a metal valve stem on the two and this is a Carlile lawn and garden trailer - but I think it's what it says yeah lawn and garden trailer tube cool and the tire is a 13 by 6.5 once again I'm not done this before I have a tire removal tool basically for a mountain bike and I'm gonna try to get in here and wedge the tool in and ring it around and pull that tool that tire back to the side and then I'll slide the tube in and put the valve stem through hopefully that'll be good I think the first step in this should be removing the valve stem good lord right now some of your Pro tire guys are laughing at me I probably need to cut this don't I yep so we'll give it a little bit of a slice here razor knife that suckers tough it's got metal in it so basically you have to I'll show you here you basically have to take your valve stem and it over like that and then cut right in there and that's what I'm gonna do right here and that'll get that valve stem to where I can remove it man having this messed up finger makes everything a pain in the butt every time I bump it on something it hurts cuz I'm a big wuss and that's how I roll good lord that's some good rubber on there yeah there it is that's what it looks like we'll get rid of that throw him in the trash can over here inside the tire is now the little valve stem okay so we know when we pop our tire off with our tire tool which hopefully works we know that we've got to get that valve stem a little rubber piece out of there or that's going to be a potential hazard we're going to take the tire off the rim on the valve stem side about me a tire changing tool to get it off ladies and gentlemen huh this is beyond what I can do in this shop I'm just going to pull off four wheels this is beyond what I can do I'm gonna pull all four wheels make sure all the bearings are okay all the bearings are good but uh this is beyond what I can do I'm gonna have to take it to the tire shop that that thing right there is really it has a huge lip on it and it's a really really stout tire you know this is a commercial mower so it may be best that I have them put air in the tire and fix up the rim I'd like to take the wheel all the way off scrape it clean with a wire brush or a wire wheel and make sure it seats really well the problem with this is that the wheel is rusting right in here and it's rusting along the edge where the tire touches it now once again my farm tractor tire store knows how to deal with this stuff and they'll hit it with a wire wheel and be done they'll probably hit it with a little bit of primer too it's a job for another day that's a bummer you know sometimes that works out that way well let's get over here and we'll set this tire and wheel down we'll go ahead and pop off all the wheels and tires and I'll get them all cleaned up and ready to take to the tire store make sure not only have any leaks and that they'll hold air okay let's get over here to the unboxing I want to show you all the cool stuff that I got basically I just bought a box of goodies that I need around the farm I bought my favorite kind of overalls I bought two different kinds of mounts to put on the Gator and we'll try both of those mounts they're like a hook type mount I'll show you in a second and and we'll tell you which one's the best so I think that's what it's all about is learning what's the best what works and what doesn't work so let's show you what we got my little friend came to help me you my friend shake my hand good girl good girl here's what we got this is a huge box from Amazon we bought double rhino clips for the Gator and we'll put those on either in the next vlog or in Monday or Tuesday blog we'll put these on it's a clip designed to hold two rifles or two shovels or two whatever I really want to start keeping a rifle like kind of a beater rifle 22 or something on the Gator so in case we run across a coyote we can take care of business and the next thing is these Copland mounts these are ratcheting Rhino grips and we'll install these we already have one of these on the Gator I have been through five of these they work really great until you bump into a tree and they don't hold up so good bumped into a tree heavy-duty magnets so I have a steel building if you guys have a steel building this that's what this is is a steel building a steel structure and in this box right here I bought two boxes of them there are 40 pound magnets I'll post links to all this stuff down below and especially once we start putting this stuff together I'll post links on that these are heavy-duty magnet hooks and they're really heavy-duty because it's hard for me to get them apart so basically they come gosh almighty things on there nothing's going right alright so this is the little magnet and it's a 40-pound magnet and it screws in to a little hook like that and I use these all over the place here in the shop so you can screw it in screws in nice and tight and you stick it on your metal building so let me show you so I've got several types of these this is a really really heavy duty one I've got some locks hanging in here this is one and I have a gate opener on it and basically they just stick on there like good gracious let's do a comparison so I bought this one on Amazon and I got this one at Walmart I can whack that I can white coat that one that one just falls off so this is extremely stout and if you wanted to you could probably put a longer bolt in there so if you've got a steel building like this these hooks are indispensable you need to hang stuff up hang your keys up or whatever these Walmart brand or whatever brand these are these little cheapies are not so good so tried-and-true it's almost this stout is that one right there so I'll post a link down below gosh that thing's on there they stick really really good they'll hang 40 pounds a little tiny magnet this thing's as big as a nickel and then a whole 40 pounds it's amazing so the last thing that we ordered the last few things that we ordered is what we're gonna be wearing throughout the summer while we work on the farm and that is overalls so these are the key brand overall and the style pocket that these have in them there's a snap pocket and another snap pocket and a place for your pin and then I have the Liberty brand I'll show you the difference in the Liberty brand pocket and the key brand guys if you've never worn a set of bibbed overalls you might think you look like an idiot you might feel like an idiot for the first day or the first 15 minutes that you wear them once you wear these things around your farm and around your house you'll realize how restrictive your belt is on your belly it basically constricts you in the midsection of your body and makes you have a gut they're really really lightweight so if we get tired of me in long pants we'll cut them off and make some really sexy shorts and this is the Liberty brand and the Liberty brand it has a different feel to it it's more of a I would say more of a country looking brand and it has a bigger front pocket a bigger front in it has a zipper pocket here which is very very convenient whoop you put your phone in there and your phone won't get all dirty and dusty which is very nice and you can feel it vibrate on your chest and it also has the snap pocket with one big pocket in there and it also has a spot for your pin it's kind of a toss-up between the Liberty and the key I'll tell you what I think at the end of the summer or sometime later on whether I like the key or the Liberty better or what I have on right here which is a Carhartt the only problem with the Carhartt that I have is this right here this is turning into a clothing commercial it's not what I wanted to do but what I want to tell you about things that are good and things that are bad and the problems that I run into so that maybe you can use those things and learn from me and not make those mistakes just like trying to take that tire off the issue I've had with a Carhartt brand is this little tab right here this little tab it likes to get hung up in the washing machine and you can see that's frayed to the very end the overalls are only as good as the clips will last this one got hung up too and it's all bent out of shape you can see it's bent right there take it for what you will I do like the Carhartt brand it's very robust it's very tough twits my winter time overall however these dude like to get hung up in the washing machine and get twisted so yeah take that for what it is well guys that's kind of it for the vlog today thanks a lot for watching please click that like button click that thumbs up don't forget there's going to be a lot of good stuff to come we're gonna build a goat mobile we've got to put all those little attachments there's a little grippy attachments on the Gator and I'll show you how they fit and how rifles and stuff fit in there and how shovels and stuff fit in there if it's something you might want for your UTV and we got to get these tires off get them to the tire store and take care of business so I don't want to fool with flat tires and put air and tires and carrying around a compressor and carrying around an air tank all summer long we're gonna solve this problem tomorrow's plan is me and mrs. Stoney Ridge are gonna move the goats or at least build the fence to move the goats to a new section of pasture and after we move them at some point once it dries out we're going to set that field on fire burn all that broom straw and let those nutrients soak into the soil which will make the grass pop it'll just make it green and beautiful thanks a lot guys click the like button we'll see you next time if you're not already subscribed subscribe to the channel click the little bell down there and I'll notify you when I post a new video all right talk to you soon [Music] Pierce we've had some ways opposed to me stone Tyrion [Music] look at in there",
