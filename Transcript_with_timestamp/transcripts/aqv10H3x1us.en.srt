ah

[Music]

3
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,210
it took hundreds of thousands of years

4
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:26,240
for the human population to reach 1

5
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:28,400
billion and in less than 200 years that

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,860
has increased to nearly 7.5 billion

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,629
people many scientists calculate the

8
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:34,520
sustainable population to be about 2

9
00:00:32,629 --> 00:00:36,290
billion people which means we need to

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,720
manage our resources and food production

11
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:40,610
very carefully to cater to the extra 5.5

12
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,500
billion people as populations have grown

13
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,629
farming practices have become more

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,610
intensified to maximize crop yield and

15
00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:49,100
ensure that we can feed our ever-growing

16
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:51,770
population fertilizers and pesticides

17
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,870
are used on crops and animals may be

18
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:55,640
kept inside in more densely packed sheds

19
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,260
to maximize milk yields or egg

20
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,570
production or speed up the time needed

21
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:01,940
for the animal to be ready to be sent to

22
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:03,920
the market for meat to learn more about

23
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:07,310
conventional farming watch our video on

24
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,690
modern agriculture in this video we are

25
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,430
going to look at an alternative to

26
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:12,590
conventional farming organic farm

27
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:14,660
they're going to see what it is in

28
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:16,369
theory and the pros and cons of this

29
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:19,160
method in relation to other modern

30
00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:20,990
agricultural methods organic farming

31
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:24,259
currently accounts for about 1% of

32
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:26,330
agricultural land worldwide it focuses

33
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:28,069
on sustainability and is thought to have

34
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:29,920
less detrimental effects on the

35
00:01:28,069 --> 00:01:32,420
environment than conventional farming

36
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,770
this is led to it being proposed as an

37
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,660
alternative to conventional agriculture

38
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:36,920
for helping to overcome the climate

39
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:39,679
change crisis we are currently

40
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:42,229
experiencing but the debate continues as

41
00:01:39,679 --> 00:01:44,240
it is not a perfect solution in Syria

42
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:47,030
organic farming should not use chemical

43
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,700
fertilizers herbicides and pesticides or

44
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:51,319
feed additives for livestock it requires

45
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:54,289
the former to use more natural

46
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:56,450
alternatives this results in low heels

47
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:58,280
of the Pharmakon sell their product at a

48
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,649
higher price because consumers believes

49
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,239
the product is of a higher quality

50
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:05,000
instead of fertilizers the newer is used

51
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:07,280
this recycles waste and improves the

52
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,720
sort of structure however it is smelly

53
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,030
and more difficult to apply than

54
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,890
chemical fertilizers and also means the

55
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,739
farmer has less control over the mineral

56
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:17,660
content they are putting into their soil

57
00:02:14,739 --> 00:02:19,430
crop rotation is used to reduce diseases

58
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,620
building up in the soils and to

59
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,510
strengthen the soil composition certain

60
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,700
crops and such as of the green family so

61
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,500
pins and beans fix nitrogen from the air

62
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,660
and increase

63
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,000
nitrate from the soil this makes this

64
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,800
were much more fertile and so farmers

65
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,560
rotate legumes with their other crops

66
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,630
growing multiple crops is however less

67
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,730
efficient and produces lower yields than

68
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:42,400
specializing in one or fewer crops

69
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:43,870
instead of using herbicides reading is

70
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,310
the preferred organic farming technique

71
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:47,200
this is of course much more

72
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:48,750
environmentally friendly because it is

73
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,100
chemical free but it is very

74
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,840
labor-intensive although this does mean

75
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,550
more jobs available which is a great

76
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,500
thing organic farming is thought to

77
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,940
maintain the biodiversity that is in

78
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,530
conventional farming because fewer

79
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:01,090
chemicals are used there are more

80
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:03,700
bumblebees and insects in the area

81
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:05,680
because pesticides haven't been used we

82
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:08,440
the non crop plants can grow as

83
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,090
certified values biodiversity benefits

84
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,550
the food chain across all levels from

85
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:14,680
the plants up to the Foxes these are the

86
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:17,739
theories of organic farming and is how

87
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,630
we farmed for 100,000 years before the

88
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:21,160
Industrial Revolution it is generally

89
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,560
thought that organic farming is much

90
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,600
better for biodiversity and also

91
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,300
produces a healthier product because

92
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,820
less chemicals are used on it in the

93
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,440
second video on organic farming we will

94
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:34,660
look at some of the problems of organic

95
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:37,890
farming and the reality of what it means

96
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,890
to be an organic farm
