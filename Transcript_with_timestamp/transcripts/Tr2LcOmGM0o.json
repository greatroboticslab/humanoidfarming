  "text": "good morning good afternoon or good evening depending on where you are and thank you for joining this virtual special event live and thank you to those of you who are watching this event recording my name is charles wenzel minister councillor for food agriculture and fisheries at the danish embassy in washington dc and i'll be hosting today's event together with my good colleague tom pesac from fao i would like to start by thanking all of today's speakers for taking the time to join us in this important conversation and also thanking all of you that have joined us and are listening in we would very much like to hear from you in the audience to participate in our q a session that will follow the panel discussion a little later please submit your questions in the chat box i would further like to thank our co-organizer fao north america thank you so much for once again making it possible for all of us to hone in on very important issues concerning agriculture we have a very busy schedule before us today but also in greater scheme of things so let's get started we are facing a growing global population and thereby an increasing demand for food both plant-based and animal protein at the same time our food systems are being undermined often at least in part because of impact of management practices and land use changes associated with food and agriculture we are witnessing imminence and in some cases irreversible biodiversity losses in countries around the world this alarming trend combined with advancing climate change as well as water scarcity and the loss and degradation of other vital natural resources underscores the urgent need to transition to a more sustainable agricultural practices and approaches there is a growing consensus that greening agriculture will require new science and new technologies as well as new and improved management policies and practices farmers has an enormous capacity to serve as agents of change in leading a shift towards a greener and more sustainable agriculture for the right policies and conditions farmers can play a lead role in transforming agricultural practices this policy seminar will focus on farmers as agents of change in the green transition furthermore today's event is part of a larger series of events happening this week around the globe from asia to europe to north america with a center in copenhagen denmark today and tomorrow the danish government is hosting the annual world food summit better food for more people this year virtually the sister the summit in copenhagen will provide important input to the un food system summit in september this year and key takeaways from our event will be integrated into that larger global agenda today's first speaker is blimnentoshan director of fao in north america he will set the stage for us and then we are honored by two excellent keynote speakers and leaders in this field from denmark mr cern synagogue farmer and chairman of the danish agriculture and food council and from california secretary karen ross of california department of food and agriculture then we will hear from three farmers and their story of transitioning into greener practices mr anas narco from denmark derek acevedo from california and doug keisling from kansas then there will be a panel conversation with say tony udada deputy director climate environment division at the fao thomas batchelor global vice president of bio agriculture with nova science north america and martin van nuycumbe global director for agriculture and food at the world bank the panel will be followed by a q a session and this event is rounded off by blind brenter sharan from fao but before handing the floor to the first keynote speaker mr cern synagogue i would like to welcome vimenta shan director of fao brementa the floor is yours thank you thank you trolls and uh let me on behalf of uh fao food and agriculture organization north america office welcome all of you to what i hope will be an extremely engaging and informative 90 minutes of discussion on opportunities and challenges in quote-unquote green transition to a more sustainable agriculture and food practice for me what makes the discussion more interesting today is that we get to hear not just from policy makers we get to hear not just from technical experts but most important of all we get to hear from the farmers farmers who are the real agents of change and farmers who really bear the brunt of climate change and its impact now since world war ii decades since world war ii world agriculture has become considerably more efficient we have seen production system and crop and livestock breeding programs are resulting in significant increase in food production however over the same period we have also seen that climate change as well as the need for feeding and ever increasing global population has exacerbated the existing challenges faced by agriculture now climate change is going to have a profound influence or rather has already started having a profound influence on agroecological conditions under which farmers and rural populations need to develop their livelihood strategies manage their resources and achieve food security and other elite food security and other ends but towards this and a green transition is a must easier said than done how arduous is that jerry how arduous is the transition what are the challenges what are the opportunities along the way how do the policy makers technical experts farmers how do they perceive it individually are their thought processes and thinking in sync now to hear and understand all this and more around this topic we have a fantastic collection of speakers from which you'll be hearing very soon but i'll be amazed if i'm not extremely grateful to soren van der gaad chairman of the danish agriculture and food council madame kevin ross secretary department of food and agriculture california all our esteemed panelists from ffa world bank nova zones and a farm of friends joining us from denmark california and kansas for taking time out of um very short extremely busy schedules to be with us especially those from california for whom it must be seven or seven thirty in the morning now most of all i'm also very very grateful to the danish embassy in washington and more specifically to trolls minister food and agriculture and fisheries embassy and his colleagues for their extraordinary effort that they have put in along with us and our team here at fao north america to get this event going and to bring this discussion to you i will not stand in the way of some very thoughtful and engrossing perspectives on the issue and let me with that hand over the proceedings back to trolls to take the even forward trolls thank you so much valenta also for the kind words but also for setting the stage so vividly for us and highlighting the importance of farmers in the broader context of a food system transformation and now to our first keynote speaker of the day mr sun synagogue farmer and chairman of the maine danish agriculture organization the danish agriculture and food council we are very pleased and honored that you have taken the time to address us here today mr syndical the floor is yours thank you very much trolls thank you for the word ladies and gentlemen good morning everyone or good afternoon like we say here in denmark right now depending on where you are in the world it's a great honor for me to be attending today's webinar focusing on this interesting topic farmers as agents of chains in a greening agriculture recently the danish minister for food and agriculture signed a memorandum of understanding with the department of food and agriculture in california focusing on further developing a climate smart dairy value chain so it's a special pleasure also for me having you secretary karen ross from california participating here today we are looking forward to support and deliver on this memorandum and make the cooperation a success this is exactly the kind of international cooperation we need for the future i honestly believe that farmers in reality holds the key to the future climate solutions and could be the ones leading the green transition towards a more sustainable production and in the next few minutes i will highlight why this is the case and i will give a danish perspective to this very important topic i am a farmer and i'm also chairman of the danish agriculture and food council personally i run a family farm with my wife and four kids my main production is within pig meat and arable crops my family have had the farm for generations i took over the farm from my father and he's still involved in the everyday operations the organization i represent danish agriculture and food council is a private organization covering the full value chain of agriculture and food production our members are the danish farmers including all sectors and size of production organic or conventional members also include the food industry cooperatives and limited companies and on top of that the agri-industrial sector and companies within ingredients and additives and enzymes and bioenergy are members as well and exactly this composition in our member base gives us a unique opportunity to unite the food cluster develop strong and sustainable solutions a complete value chain and to better handle challenges and opportunities integrated in our organization we have a strong innovation and knowledge center called circus this is where we get involved in research and develop projects either together with public research institutions or universities or by initiating the projects ourselves based on present or future demands or needs via segas we are able to stay updated develop more knowledge and quickly implement it into everyday farming or processing through our local advisory services in our organization danish agriculture and food council we have a vision of a climate neutral agriculture and food cluster by 2050. it's ambitious but we have a clear target and we are committed in getting there we have already come quite far in living up to the ambition we work determined in finding progressive solutions in the fields in the stables and the feeding within transportation and manufacturing and basically in every single link of the value chain and it's important to identify where you can make a change at the farm where can you improve where can we invest and we are determined to get better and strengthen our farmer management tools we have harvested the low hanging fruits and now it's getting more complicated we take responsibility and we can do a lot on our own but we also need cooperation we need partnerships and we need more r d in order to get there and i'm sure my fellow farmer from denmark mr anisnergo he will give you a more specific examples of what we're doing at farm level a little later in this webinar but there's one thing i need to underline we are dealing with biology and many people make the mistake to think we can change or stop emissions from day to day just like pushing a bottom naturally this is not the case everybody needs to understand that it takes time to change and manage a biological process i know the time is running and we all want to speed up however modern farming is getting more and more complex and challenging education and knowledge sharing is fundamental for farmers to be in a position to live up to the expectations from society in denmark we have for centuries had a strong tradition in having a specific system for education of young farmers all young farmers have three to four years of education before they become farmers themselves another proud tradition in denmark is our knowledge sharing we regard our neighbors as partners not competitors and that is why we have managed to build up strong farmer-owned cooperatives between being among the biggest companies in denmark now and they have world-class performance and on top of that as i mentioned earlier we have established a strong advisory service owned and controlled by farmers so we can optimize our production in a resource effective and sustainable way by sharing the latest knowledge for example from sigis and share it among all farmers we engage in international cooperation at all levels we believe that some of the findings some of the knowledge the products and the solutions we have come across in denmark they can also lead to a more sustainable production elsewhere in the world recently we have created a global climate task force among our members and now we are mapping all the many ideas and solutions that can lead the green transition internationally it's not just about producing sufficient food for a growing population anymore we must produce and manage our farms in an even more sustainable manner by using our experience educational skills knowledge advisory service tradition for cooperation and our strong value chain approach in a coordinated and intelligent way we can deliver we are and always want to be part of the solution in handling the future challenges so in conclusion what we need is first to be regarded as partners to be included and involved to get a stronger commitment secondly to get clear and consistent signals and directions from the politicians so we are able to plan our investments and our future development thirdly to have a more committed public and public private r d approach so we can develop the knowledge the technology and the solutions we need for the future a fourth element is to create more incentives for farmers to get engaged and spark the inspiration and motivation a fifth point is to have a strong focus on developing the agriculture and food sector not the opposite we have to respect the specific condition of a biological production and finally to increase international cooperation and partnerships and recognize the international impact of promoting new climate smart and sustainable solutions and projects so it is our ambition to create and develop an even more climate smart and sustainable agriculture and food production in the future we are on our way so under the right conditions farmers can show an even stronger leadership in the green transition thank you very much for your attention sorry so thank you very much mr sunigo i forgot to mute unmute thank you for your interesting remarks and highly relevant points um especially on ambition for the future education cooperation between farmers and other stakeholders and of course international cooperation and we know you have a very busy schedule today we're honored that you had time to to address us and i know you'll be listening in but thank you so much mr senegal and now to our second keynote speaker secretary ken ross of cdfa we're equally honored that you have taken the time to address us here today secretary ross the floor is yours charles thank you so much i appreciate this opportunity to be with you today um i really appreciated the comments from the fao director for north america so relevant and on point and to sauron um thank you he stole my speech i spent a lot of my time trying to tell lawmakers in california that the challenges in farming are that we have to recognize that they are managers of a biological system and if you change one thing it's all interconnected and so i really appreciate that now i know that my next climate smart ag trip is going to be to denmark because i want to meet you in person thank you my friend and former boss and now current secretary of the united states department of agriculture recently said i think agriculture is the first and best way to begin getting some early wins on climate i think he's absolutely right i've seen it i've seen it in california and i've seen it around the globe i'm really pleased that we're having farmers here today and so i am going to be very brief in my remarks but the very fact that the theme of this is a focus on farmers and ranchers as ages of change is exactly where we all need to focus and i think that a year after a pandemic when we all feel maybe a bit more directly connected to our dinner plate there is a renewed appreciation for the role of farmers and ranchers in our daily life and the opportunity to create new partnerships and new collaborations is the only way that we will be successful because we as government cannot do it alone academia can't do it alone farmers and ranchers can lead on change but they should not be expected to do it and bear that responsibility alone it requires all of us working together to be able to share what we know works to be able to learn from one another and to innovate in the ways that i believe the next chapter of agriculture in this globe will be an exciting one because of the innovation that is being unleashed on a daily basis through ag technology and other new systems approaches the whole commitment to building a resilient sustainable food system one that nourishes people and nourishes them better one that is equitable and makes sure that every human has the food they need to achieve their potential and be contributors to society a a resilient food system that is part of restoring our ecosystems and preserving species and biodiversity i've seen firsthand that that is possible and yes soren is right it is up to government to give the appropriate policy signals not to be overly prescriptive to be able to recognize that we all operate on the place where we are that it is our farmers and ranchers and their farm workers who have been on this land for generations and every day think about how to hand it on to the next generation and the one after that they are the ones that know that land and as stewards of our natural and working lands they can be the agents of change that we all know and want them to be so it is our role in government to first of all give the appropriate policy signals we've recognized that throughout governments by setting our own climate goals in california as a state our goal is to be carbon neutral by 2045 and we recognize with a natural working land strategy that is going to be the key for us to be successful that it is in agriculture and in forestry the opportunity to draw down carbon and store it in our soils and in doing so and focusing on our healthy soils we can be more productive we can be more drought tolerant with a water holding capacity we can improve the efficient use of fertilizer by improving the nutrient cycling and we will be resilient over time we have in just the last few years invested just in my department over 400 million dollars that have been made available to us as incentive programs because we use a cap and trade system and those auction proceeds are being reinvested into transitioning our economy to carbon neutral in total over the last 10 years almost 1 billion dollars has been invested in a variety of programs to benefit farmers and ranchers in making this transition at the department of food and agriculture one of our largest programs has been for the dairy sector to reduce methane emissions very important and in doing that the co benefit of that is improved water quality by by mitigating nitrates and also by producing renewable energy whether it's electricity low carbon fuels or renewable natural gas we've invested over 50 million dollars in the last three years in our healthy soils program and over a 10-year period we've invested over 80 million dollars for on-farm water use efficiency which also has the co-benefit of reducing energy use reducing greenhouse gases and improving the efficiency of our nitrogen applications governments working together governments coming together and sponsoring forums like this one and the world food summit and the un food system dialogues is an opportunity for us to share those best practices to learn which policies work and how they might be adapted for our own country and our own state i'm excited to hear from our farmers and ranchers today i am so appreciative and every day i say a prayer of gratitude for our farmers and ranchers for what they do for all the rest of us so that we can live the lives of our choices and not have to worry i hope about where our food comes from and we can feel good about what farmers and ranchers are doing because of the way in which they're producing it to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to store carbon in our soils to use water as efficiently as possible and to be as part of the solution in preserving biodiversity and restoring our ecosystems it is possible i have seen it i believe it and we're going to hear from farmers who will give us daily examples of how to do it thank you thank you thank you so much madam secretary for your always inspiring and insightful remarks and to your points on that agriculture is you know local in nature but it has global consequences and your calls for action and cooperation internationally i would say we are looking very much forward to hosting you in denmark sometime soon as i'm transitioning home i will be there and i greet you i know you have a busy day uh but we are very honored that you know took the time and got up early to address us here and i hope you will have have a chance to listen into some of the some of the next speakers so once again thank you so much for being with us and now we turn to the farmers the steward of the lands and of the animals first off is mr annas nargo a dairy farmer from denmark and he's also the vice president of holster borussoa agriculture council we are very interested in hearing your story how and when began the green transition on your farm and what has made it possible mr nargo the floor is yours thank you very much and thanks for inviting me for this uh webinar as we have a slogan in denmark danny's farmers talk about we don't we are part of the solution not the problem so i think it fit pretty well in here i have made a short presentation because my english is not perfect so if you can't understand what i'm saying then i hope the pictures will do the ch uh the the point for me but as said my name is anas i'm a dairy farmer from the western part of denmark we have about 850 cows and about 750 hives we are milking primarily all the cows in 12 laylee milking robots we have about 475 hectares of land only with grace and maize for the cows beside of that we have a biogas plant and as you said toads i'm a board member of the local farmers union and i'm a board member of landford cattle um i've been asked to tell a bit about what we are doing sustainable today at the farm and i just made four slides about the first things come to my head we do a lot of small things as farmers who are sustainable but this is a far four four things who's come first to my head in 2018 we were building a biogas plant at our own just in the end of the stable it is today that means that we don't have trucks or similar to transporting the manure we are just pumping it directly from the stables into the burgers plant the biogas plant is producing about five and a half million kilowatts electricity a year it's the same as six times the consumption of the farm electricity or in other terms about 1200 houses it runs primarily at manure and deep leader from the farm and the neighbor and at the moment we have some waste from the indrostial about for example we have bread as you see in the picture that's pretty funny every day we have a truckload and we also run some potatoes who can't be sold sold because of the covenant situation it makes also better utilization for the of the nitrogen especially for the deep leader but also the manure but at the dip later we've moved for about 45 to about 75 so that's uh pretty sustainable we think the next thing um as some talked about we have a lot we have a long history in denmark about working together in the whole food cluster and we are very proud to have today to have the digital feed chain where we can measure uh all the steps between the field and the mill tank and if we are following following the pictures then in the left corner we have the chopper at the field it's connecting to the cloud and the database so with gps and near sensors we can measure the production at the field all the time we are going into the silo and the database of course the third picture is from our wheel loader where we have a tablet solution connecting in real time to the database so it makes all the registration about the food and all this is ending up in a daily feeding region for the cows the good thing about that is the database because we have all these measurements uh the database is making uh automatically efficiency report every day that means for us as farmers that we can go closer to the limits so we have a better economy for first point they caught their feeding is the biggest cost at the farm but we also have better real resource utilization of the food and third we have better health so what can be measured can be changed the next thing is about the climate check we have from ala our dairy company climate calculation can be very advanced and we have a big need as farmers for similar calculations so we can move at this agenda that's why we in allah have a annual report and it makes that we can see the consequence of our actions it's a very strong benchmark database with about eight and a half thousand are owners in five countries i think so we have a lot of benchmark data to benchmark us against and we also once a year have a visit by an advisor where we are only discussing in this case the climate issues and where we could do better than today the next thing is about our hood we have a cross-breeded herd it's not so normal in denmark but we are cross-breeded our herd between holstein red and jersey and research shows that it makes a six percent lower feed intake of the cows that's pretty easy it's just to insulate with another with another genes and research also shows that we have better health and the cows lived longer so that's one of the things was coming to my mind at the next slide i was asked what is it that how do we get the farmers more sustainable and what are you thinking about and and we always been told that the gold is licensed to produce in my head it have to be higher than license to produce first of all we are a company we have to earn money if we don't earn money and we don't have a strong economy we can instil we can't invest in all the green technologies now and in the future so that's the main cause of course i'm also very important for me to secure the company for the future in a sustainable way happily most of the things we are doing improve both the economy and its sustainable solution so to get farming more sustainable in the future will require a better economy in farming and a more stable political environment thank you for listening you so much mr nago very interesting remarks and uh very nice to see some concrete examples of sustainable practices you know the climate check program and your points on on biogas but i think also the correlation between efficiency and making money you have a family farm that needs to run and secure for for you and your family in the future i think very interesting thank you so much and please stay on and listen into the to the next ones and now we turn to central valley california where we'll hear remarks from derek acevedo executive vice president of boltz farming company mr astava is part of a sixth generation farm where they produce cotton vegetables fruits and nuts among other things mr altaverdo how does bold farming overcome the challenges as modern farming are facing and how have you made the transition in central valley mr acevedo the floor is yours thank you yes and and uh bowles farming company is a 162 year old farming operation where the same family has stewarded that land the entire time and there's there's an incredible sustainability story that comes with that and during that transition uh the the organizations have the opportunity to reinvent itself multiple times and um you know one of the things that that you can fall into is a lot of us focus on providing nutrient-dense foods for our food shed and and and and the consumers that we touch and then and as it relates to the the green transition you know my my mark for that really begins when when our current ceo ken and michael really looked at um you know the the simple fact that our consumers are asking for more than they're asking more of their food than just to produce their nutritional needs and and asked us as the management team to look at the farm a little bit from a broader perspective you know you can fall into the rut of just growing stuff but if you look at the farm as an opportunity to be a carbon sink to draw down excess carbon from the atmosphere if you look at the farm as an opportunity to grow habitat and provide uh habitat for the the birds and terrestrial species we have on the farm you know that that caused us to start a california native seed company where we grow 52 different species of of california native plants that help provide habitat for the local ecosystem the farm is also a place to grow our people as simple as it may sound you know investing in scholarship opportunities for for our employees strengthens our community and helps provide resilience to our our community and the customers that we serve um perhaps most importantly you know our farm serves as you know a laboratory a place for research we we've aggressively pursued some of the uh climate smart initiatives that that that secretary ross has fought so hard for and and we invite multiple stakeholders multiple partnerships with ngos and biologists and all sorts of different individuals to come to the ranch and actually advance the technologies that we have we've been on a continuous transition all of agriculture has with producing more food with fewer inputs over time and so one of the most exciting parts of of this green transition is to witness some of that cross-pollination between the technology of agriculture applied to native plants and the native plants you know forcing their way onto some of our agricultural fields and and offer offering opportunities potentially for food as medicine and even participating in the in the textile industry and so you start to bring in some of our ngo friends you bring in some of the biologists the water you get a chance to to broaden your scope and and for all of those reasons and we can get into more of the the the opportunities and and challenges a little bit later in the discussion but but for all of those reasons you know it's been um you know it's been incredibly exciting to be a part of and and um you know agriculture is one of those that that uh when you when you take that that that more zoomed out approach to to looking at the farm is more than just the place to grow stuff you know the the opportunities are endless and it's probably the most exciting business to be a part of in the world today all right thank you so much but derek for that i think uh that was very interesting points uh you made there on the farms and the practices and great points about consumer expectation local ecosystem r d incorporation and a broaden scope for ag in the future thank you very much and now we will move uh from the west coast to the heartlands to kansas our next speaker is mr doug keisling mr kiesling is the fifth generation farmer who has been involved in almost all aspects of farming from crop production to supply chain services and policy mr kiesling what is your experience in growing greener and more sustainable and what are your recommendations to farmers and policy makers mr kiesling the floor is yours thank you so much and welcome to all of you i know that if you're a producer you had several options today to get on other zoom calls to learn about sustainability and how to grow carbon for profit and different other things so i'm glad that you're here on this one um if you're a policymaker and all you know this is an opportunity that i can reach out to you and talk to you about our farm and how this works in the bigger picture first of all let me start and back up he told a little bit about my farm our farm started in 1876 so i'm a fifth generation farmer central kansas central united states rainfall here is 20 to 24 inches of rain so a lot less than some areas our top soil and you think i might be crazy but we only have one inch of topsoil compared to an iowa or an illinois or even central valley california so we take our conservation very serious here because we can't afford to lose any so some of the practices that we do are focused on them um to wrap up our farm history we are right on the santa fe trail where i'm sitting right here is smack dab in the middle of the santa fe trail so there's a huge amount of history and this was homesteaded before uh for before my family by a doctor so on our farmstead are a lot of native plants not only to the midwest but from other areas for municipal purposes that the doctor used so because of that come with this rich history of what it takes to make the full circle of the biologicals now on our farm we've been doing no-till or sustainability for 30 years now keep that in mind because that's seven administrations that started in reagan and has come all the way through seven administrations so when we talk about this it's nothing new it's been going for quite a while but on our farm we do everything from conservation manure management with it which includes adding a lot of manure to our land instead of chemical fertilizers we do integral grazing to where we will graze different times in different fields so i don't really have pastures we use our cropland and rotate that around also but we do it with sources of using our crops which we have seven different crops plus our livestock about 200 head of cattle in in a full system of approach and with biologicals the cover crops some cover crops are used in portion of the grazing some of it is used just for organic building particularly if we took over a new piece of ground where we're helping we do custom work through our business and if we're helping someone build organic matter just to get started we start them and help them get started in a plan of building organic matter to capture that carbon to start with um i want to back up and talk about some terms we all think we know what it is but even in the ag industry we struggle sometimes with the terms so we talk about carbon sequestering what does that really mean does that mean for me and what i just said that i'm leaving residue on the field or i'm planning a cover crop that will just be mowed in or planted into probably because we want to capture that carbon for for later on and we want to build that organic matter and that one inch of topsoil i talked about sustainability man i think we all probably on this whole call we have 800 different opinions of sustainability so we need to that's one goal that agriculture really has is how can we define some of these and encircle them in so that when we're talking to you know the secretary of agriculture or our legislators how can we make a rifle point of this is the exact point that we want to talk about with sustainability um how do how do we do that um you know well we have to build habitat uh one of the other speakers talked about habitat and grasses i i hunt but i do it more my habitat is for water quality because i want to make sure that the water flowing off my farm is cleaner than when it started a lot of times it'll come in from someone else it com goes across me and when it leaves i want to make sure that that water is clean the other thing is we farm about 3 000 hectares which or or do custom work on which is about 7 500 acres and so with that we have gone to where when my grandfather two generations back he farmed a lot of 20 acre strips in order to do wind erosion or water erosion we now plant the whole quarter or half section so we might have 320 acre fields now whereas he had 20 or 40 acre fields in strips but by doing this new technology by doing research we found that we can do this and we can capture the water make the water cleaner and keep wind erosion down how do i want to talk about some of the partners that we haven't talked about as a farmer i view several partners key within this they might be ngos like i serve on the board of cultivating new frontiers in ag a large ngo in dc and we do stuff all around the world but part of that is then we do research somewhere else as i'm traveling uh to multiple international countries and then i bring it back to my farm and i improve my farm too and then i perfect it and then i take it back internationally to some other country to make that better as i'm doing consulting in another country so that's a partner to me um community commodity organizations are a huge partner because you know in in kansas wheat and sorghum and some other crops are the big crops and so wheat and sorghum have done a lot of research in order to how to figure out which is the best way to do conservation tillage how to transition over to no-till how to use these tools that we talked about and they've also done a lot in order to make sure that our environment's better to where we can take our crops to make ethanol so that's the renewable source how we can use carbon neutral crops in order to sell i even sell part of my wheat that goes to the east coast right by dc to make carbon neutral beer and so you know it's all part of the situation of what can we do to make it better um we need the more technology one of the things i struggle with is using less fertilizer a synthetic fertilizer for like nitrogen i use manure but that's one of the things that you know i still need help with on more research in order to to get over that hurdle so i can raise more crops with less fertilizer a lot of the things we do that also helps with water retention i've already kind of talked on that some of the concerns that agriculture in the midwest have is the cost versus the return ratio for me to implement some of these practices it might cost 40. an acre and currently my return may be half that and so as we uh talk about bills or legislation or just trend lines how can we incentivize farmers to do more they already want to do it and i'm already doing things that cost me money more than make me money but i'm doing it because it's the right reason i want to do it for my environment i drink the water here so i want to make sure that it's better than what it was when i started and then the other thing is is i travel so much um the one key thing that's hard that's a challenge that is weather you know here i'm getting 20 some inches in west texas it might be five inches so they have a hard time raising a cover crop and raising a crop also so things like crop insurance and all these things we think doesn't affect climate smart activities but they do uh because it affects the farmers bottom line and how do we move forward so all of these things and this is a lot to put in seven or eight minutes here but that's kind of what we do and i hope to have questions later thank you thank you very much mr keising for those interesting perspectives um and yeah please stay on i'm sure there will be some questions for you um some interesting perspectives on conservation and soil manure use crop rotation and how farms are integrated in the local biology and of course also on your points on knowledge sharing and partnerships so thank you so much and now um and before i hand over the floor to tom pasek who will be moderating the panel discussion and in the q s session i would like to remind the audience that we would very much like to hear from you i know there's a few questions in the chat box but please submit some more questions there and then uh tom will uh will take them up during the the q a session so tom over to you excellent thank you trills i think we've heard an excellent series of remarks uh very insightful remarks from chairman sundergard in denmark and secretary ross in california and of course from our farmers uh hailing from denmark and the united states in this portion of our event we will hear more of an international or a global perspective on some of the key challenges and opportunities associated with farmers serving as agents of change in greening agriculture and we have the very good fortune of being joined for this panel discussion by three prominent thought leaders in this space and i would like to turn first to my fao colleague cytonie old donna is deputy director of the climate environment division based typically at fao headquarters in rome i believe today he is joining us from the uk tony welcome thank you tell us that could you tell us a bit about how fao is supporting farmers as agents of change in greening agriculture and how farmers are being engaged in the global climate agenda to help achieve the goals of the paris climate agreement and the broader 2030 agenda well thank you and um greetings everyone from wherever you are this is really very interesting discussion and i haven't listened to to the colleagues who spoke already um it it's good to to see the perspective from from those parts of the world um so let me start by um answering your question by looking at the global agenda yeah in fao we're supporting farmers at two um fronts if you like the first one is on the global agenda exactly as you said because globally um there are various initiatives and policies being put in place that will affect farmers will affect the future of farming so it's important that farmers are part of that dialogue part of how the future of farming is being framed is being um influenced and and and challenged and particularly on the international climate change agenda on the u.n framework conventional climate change and the implementation of paris agreement uh with support farming communities actually to come to the negotiation to see what it's like to see what is being discussed and to give them the opportunity to have a voice actually to to say what are the challenges they're facing and what are the issues that they would like to see really been addressed to achieve this sustainability that we talk about to achieve the transition and the point i want to make here with this global action is that you know the discussion we've been hearing and and the views so far um i would like to add one dimension in particular which which we haven't covered and and that of the smallholder farmers you know we spoke a lot about farmers who have capacities and knowledge etc but 98 of the world's agricultural holdings are 10 hectares or less and most of these smallholder farmers are in developing countries and you support around two billion people so it's really critical that when we talk about the change that we when the sustainability we need to include smallholder farmers in sub-saharan africa and south asia in particular we have 80 about 80 percent of farmland is cultivated by smallholder farmers so this is really critical to include this this um community of farmers so the second point i want to make um is with regard to support in fact i talked about the global agenda and bringing farmers to where they need to voice their concerns and their priorities and their wishes but the second point is supporting actually farmers in their countries to adopt um climate smart practices but also as some of the colleagues said to have access to the knowledge to the information those farmers who actually would benefit from from access to technology from innovation and here again i want to highlight the point of when we talk about innovation and technology and supporting farmers we shouldn't forget about the local knowledge the traditional the indigenous knowledge and that's absolutely critical because um farmers do learn from each other and the knowledge just transfers from generation to generation from community to community so i hope this gives an overview of tom and give a chance to other colleagues to to come in and happy to come back and add more information thank you thanks i juni if if i could just like to ask a follow-up question i think in this session we've been hearing quite a lot about how uh if we're to address the the climate challenges we face we can't forget about agriculture and you've just reminded us that in considering and addressing agriculture we can't forget about smallholder farmers within that could you talk a bit about the role and the importance of of youth of young farmers and especially women yes absolutely well i think um you know we we think about the fact that if you want to achieve and i think this is the point to take away if you want to achieve this transformation in agriculture we cannot do it without involving farmers it's absolutely critical but looking into the future of farming and where actually um you know the the communities can be more active we can't exclude the youth particularly in some parts of the world where the population is is very young and take the example of africa for instance and i think we have to take that into account into looking into the future of agriculture and the role of youth is critical but the challenge the biggest challenge there is how would you make agriculture attractive to young people you know how would you bring uh young people into the in into this profession and as you know in many areas there is um there is a problem in rural areas where young people are fleeing the rural areas to go to to live in in in urban areas and that creates of course problems in in the rural areas and also creates the lack of capacity in in taking up um profession in agriculture so there needs to be incentives in in in terms of creating investment opportunities in helping young people to have access to finance there are so many entrepreneurs who have ideas they want to create things in in rural environments but they need that financial support and i'm talking particularly in developing countries and women in particular i think the biggest challenge either young or otherwise is the land tenure uh particularly in developing countries i think colleagues have been talking here about you know the establishment of farms that you have with the size etc and the capacity been in many developing countries unfortunately there are many small holders whole all the farmers in particular um to whom the land is is not their property and that's again a huge challenge in really contributing to food security and land protection without being the owner of of um of the land the last point i would make tom is is really with regard to inequality uh that's again with regard to to youth and and and women it's absolutely critical that the issue of inequality is addressing these settings so that the access to technology access to finance is is is really uh available to everyone and is is affordable by everyone and the point the reason i'm saying this is because if we really want to achieve global sustainability then we have to address equality of access to knowledge to to to technology to the resources that are needed thank you thanks so much and please don't go far from your your laptop i'm sure we'll be turning to you momentarily during the q and a i'd now like to introduce martian van nuke global director of agriculture and food at the world bank martin we've heard uh quite a bit about the importance of um farmers and their role in catalyzing a transition to greener and more sustainable agriculture and i think that that inherently assumes that they're sufficiently empowered or equipped to do so and zytonia just touched upon the question of finance and and given your role at the bank at the world bank i was wondering if you could uh talk to us about the bank's assessment of the relevance of current public support to agriculture and and in enabling farmers to serve as agents of change thanks very much thomas i'm very pleased to be here um and just for the sake of transparency you know originally i'm from the netherlands and i actually grew up on a family horticulture farm in the western part of the netherlands so i'm very pleased to be here with all the farmers still very strong roots there um i i think i i think i mean anders was talking about i mean we need stable policies i think syria was talking about we need clear signals from governments and derek was mentioning you know i mean the importance of incentives um so if you if you kind of look at that i mean um based on the data the best data that we have i mean governments across the world i mean provide about 700 billion dollars in public support i mean to agriculture i mean this is a big amount of resources so the question then is you know what is that doing for farmers um a couple of reflections there uh thomas one is that you know most of that support i mean does doesn't end up i mean with a small hold of farmers c2 usa actually most actually ends up with the larger farmers um a big chunk is about 300 billion is provided for market and price support and output support uh this generates a lot of allocative efficiencies actually providing incentives to farmers to grow crops that actually shouldn't grow and better they should grow something else i mean think about farmers growing rice in the punjab in india a lot of public support also going to input subsidies that also leads actually to overuse of fertilizers and that creates all kinds of environmental problems and of course doesn't actually help the farmers bottom line electricity subsidies for pumping irrigation water i mean depletes groundwater tables that actually forces farmers to invest in pumps i mean that pump of water deeper and deeper and actually thereby is undermining their resilience also one could argue that if you look at fertilizer subsidies to what extent are they actually relevant if you factor in the uh the risks the increasing risk of climate change i mean what's the value of a fertilizer subsidy the farmer doesn't have anything to sell because his crop is destroyed because of a drought i mean what's the value of a minimum price i mean for certain crop of the farmer it doesn't have any to sell because of a heat wave so so our assessment is i mean that this 700 billion dollars i mean can be used much better i mean actually to incentivize i mean farmers to invest in greener more sustainable technologies that also that actually reduce greenhouse gas emissions i mean can this 700 billion be repurposed and that's a very important point that we actually are bringing up globally thomas as part of the food system summit i mean that the un is working on the bank is very active in the finance level of that i mean to think of a kind of a new food finance architecture for the global food systems where farmers have clear incentives i mean to invest in green technologies and sustainable practices back to you thomas thanks martin you touched upon the question of incentives and you talked about some of the opportunities uh on the horizon uh to to support and further enable farmers i was wondering if you could elaborate a bit more as you look out across the international agricultural development landscape or or horizon if you will could you tell us what excites you in in terms of the opportunities before us to help empower and equip farmers to effectively serve as agents of change in in greening agriculture yeah a couple of reflections here thomas i mean one is the discussion about just about just rural transition um there was launch after the un climate action summit in 2019 i think that's very important you know because this this there's something strange going on here and i think it was also reflected when you listen to our farmer colleagues that farmers are kind of be singled out as being part of the problem and farmers want to be part of the solution you know if you talk about just a transition you know the way coal miners are being projected in the public opinion is not as being part of the problem they're being seen as victims and we need to help them while farmers actually um you know we need to you know human mankind i mean 7.5 billion people they're all affected by climate change but the 500 million farmers in this world are actually in the front line of climate change i mean so how can we actually help them and incentivize i mean to kind of make sure that they can actually help deal with the climate change because in the end i mean the 75 the 7.5 billion people depend on what farmers do when it comes to access to food etc so so given farmers voice i think that needs to be improved i think the just drool transition initiative i mean provides opportunities uh there i already mentioned the shift in incentives i mean particularly now with covet 19 i think governments are forced to take a very hard look at the public support programs everywhere in all sectors including in agriculture so i see a kind of opening up of ministers of finance including at the spring meetings that we had last week and seeing actually how they can use public support to agriculture and food more smartly um i mean why are we why are we subsidizing fertilizers i mean why are we not providing incentives to farmers i mean to invest in soil health i mean why is the price of carbon the market price of carbon uh ten dollars while the uh shadow price the opportunity cost of uh carbon is estimated by the imf at seventy dollars at all i mean imagine if that would be seventy dollars at all what kind of incentive that would be required and then finally uh what farmers need uh and i think the the the the secretary of agriculture of california mentioned it as well i mean they're managers of biological systems though so solutions do not call me silver bullets solutions do not come as blueprints i mean they come in packages and those packages need to be adjusted i mean to local conditions so investing in agriculture innovation more applied research and adapted research and better knowledge transfer systems are needed and idea and then i'm optimistic thomas i mean that the digital technologies and the digital revolution and digital and data driven agriculture provides new opportunities there to transform the food system back to you and thank you very much martin and you've made my job quite easy in providing the perfect segue to our last panel speaker but uh certainly certainly not the least and uh i'd like to now introduce thomas batchelor who's the vice president of agriculture marketing and strategy at novosimes and i'm hoping that thomas can take us on a tour or a visit to the laboratory as it were thomas martin just mentioned uh the importance of research i was hoping you could talk a bit about the role of research and science and innovation in helping to create the enabling conditions for farmers to effectively serve as agents of change in ushering in more sustainable agriculture and of course within that tell us of course the the role of novozymes in achieving this yeah i'll be happy to thank you and i think it is a perfect segue from all the other speakers here because over time we are a global market leader in developing biological solutions for the broader agriculture and food value chain and and our controlling shareholder is is a foundation of a foundation that also reinvests a lot of our proceeds back into fundamental research in in this area so it is it's very much our vision to be driving this innovation so what we are focused on is is really this biological system we all talked about unlocking the potential of that nature if we look at the comment from people who talk about applying manure back to the field understanding that microbiome so the natural microbes that are in the soil and in the manure you take a teaspoon of soil it comprises microbes that exceed the number of people on the planet it's a incredibly complex system and the potential of just unlocking what nature already has holds tons of potential so what we're looking at is developing those microbes and enzymes which are natural compounds as well and applying them for agriculture at an industrial scale so growers can apply them and they can be adopted as a natural part of agricultural practices also for livestock farming a similar the microbiome within a cattle and so forth is also one of the ways we can succeed for solutions the methane reduction that was maintained for for dairy and cattle a lot of potential for that and and that's exactly what novosymes is driving and investing very heavily and to succeed enabling a more sustainable agriculture of the future and if i can allow just kick-starting the reflection on some of the things i hear here because i think it was perfect comment on this incentives which i think just looking at the real value that's provided for not only our solutions but others making sure we create a real marketplace that that creates a profit for pharma applying the right practice is one thing but i think there's an even simpler starting point allowing a route to market for new innovation that is more expedited so we have safe and proven solutions that are spot on for some of the agendas we are talking about today but it still takes five to ten years to get them there because we're going into the pre-existing chemical regulatory frameworks often uh that we think we can find ways of enabling a faster way to market and to the growers hands just by having more of the fast track mindset using some of the cobit experience if we really want solutions to the market we can cut the time to get them there and i think that's part of the solution that i would argue should be seen as as a way forward excellent thank you thomas and if i may i'd like to ask a bit of a follow-up question number zymes of course is is widely recognized as a leader in providing and developing sustainable solutions for the agricultural biological industry particularly in developing solutions that contribute to solving the global challenges related to climate and water and production as well as consumption and so within that could you just elaborate a bit more i know you've uh touched upon some solutions but within all of this could you elaborate a bit on novozyme's perspective in terms of some of the biggest challenges and opportunities you see perhaps over the next 10 years yeah i think the greatest opportunity is is to make sure that that we get innovation in the hands of farmers and get it widely adopted and that's a mix of the incentives and the path to market and then realize making both growers but but also policy makers aware that technology actually already has solutions that can kick start some of the changes we have but as in many cases there's a huge benefit for accelerating that adoption in various ways and we're already partnering with there was a mention of sega's trying to have these partnerships where industry like ourselves partner with both growers and organizations to make sure it's not seen as a corporate push of profit but it's a solution that's adopted broadly from policy makers growers and industry as partners i think that that will unlock a lot of value and if we're a little bit creative about combining incentives helping growers decipher a very complex technology so getting some validity from an unbiased side i think that adoption can be accelerated hugely to the benefit of all the targets we're talking about excellent thank you thomas and to our audience thank you for your excellent engagement and and patience we're now turning to the question and answer portion of our event and i see we still have almost all of our speakers still with us i would now based upon what's been posted in the q a box by our audience by way of questions i would now like to turn quickly back to our three farmers and to ask them each uh very briefly to talk about what they see as the big opportunities uh in engaging young farmers uh in this transition and perhaps talking a bit more about incentives so perhaps if i could start with uh with derek thank you um you know as i mentioned agriculture is one of the most exciting fields on on the planet and a lot of the technology that's been introduced uh to agriculture over the last hundred years has provided opportunities for non-traditional roles on the modern farm we know we've had a a position on our on our management team the vice president of technology for the last five years we have a biologist we have you know we have um you know different food safety folks and we've pulled people from other industries into our farm to to broaden our perspective but at the same time provide opportunities for folks that you know they never saw their their role as as being working with a farm but the the data management that we go through the analysis that we go through i mean farming is a science-based profession you know the modern food supply is is grown by agronomists you know biologists chemists pest control advisors all these different science professions that provides a lot of opportunity for um for young people to to enter the role of farming and to speak briefly about about incentives you know i thought about you know how how do we simply define the you know the role of the policy makers and and the opportunity uh that we have by showcasing the voice of the farmer and what i came up with was you know the the implementation and the success of of meaningful policy will simply be judged based on the ability to provide rewards to the private land steward who protects the public good thank you derek i'd now like to turn to doug uh very briefly if you could uh respond to the same question sure i think there's a couple of different things some of the more logical ones is help through organizations like 4-h or ffa for future farmers i have two high school boys my two oldest kids are in high school and they both belong to those two organizations and i've learned quite a bit there one of the things i'd like to highlight is my 16 year old son was offered some land to farm and from an older farmer and he could not do it because the rules under our us f um through our government uh say that because he's under 18 he can't have it in his name so the farmer had to turn it over to me now granted he's going to be i'm going to make sure that he's actively involved in helping but sometimes we're our owners worst enemy is what i want to point out thank you very much doug and i don't believe um our unders are our danish farmer is uh is still with us um so i won't uh turn to him but if i could i would like if possible to pose a question from the audience to secretary ross um which comes from cecile makani and the question has to do with whether it's possible to have effective partnerships between farmers in developing countries and those in developed countries such as the united states i think it's possible there was a time in in us history where we funded organizations to do exactly that kind of farmer to farmer um transfer and i think doug mentioned he's had an opportunity through his organization to travel the world and take his research to other parts of the world i think it's absolutely vital to what we're doing i think it can happen farmer to farmer but i also think the investment that's made in the u.s we're very fortunate to have the cooperative extension system which is publicly funded that third-party objective source of doing trials and then sponsoring demonstration days for a group of farmers to learn from one another and i think that is an important place when i look at the world at the world bank i think that is an important incentive that is the research that is that transfer of knowledge and i know that our cooperative extension even though it's underfunded from what it once was is still the envy of the world because it's helping to do that transfer of knowledge and translating in a way that the end user from the smallest to the largest for animal and for crops and i think these are the types of things we need to think about globally and lobby our own governments to make those kinds of investments as well thank you very much secretary um i don't believe we still have chairman's undergrad with us so i won't pose the same question to him but i could i'd like to turn to our three panelists from the world bank fao and novo zimes uh perhaps in that order uh martin uh zytuni and then thomas the question we have here comes from ernie shea and ernie indicates that it's often hard to understand um how the voices of of farmers can be elevated in institutions like the world bank fao novozymes uh as well as how their voices can be uh accentuated in initiatives such as the un food system summit or in the broader climate agenda which was touched upon earlier so martian beginning with you briefly if you could share your thoughts on how the the voices of farmers can be further emphasized within institutions and and international processes i think thanks very much sir thomas um let me start at the global level um i you know i already mentioned that uh as part of the upcoming food systems summit i mean be very active as part of you know putting in place the food finance architecture there's a finance lever there [Music] we are actively reaching out and working very closely i mean with um federations of farmers organizations to make sure that their voice is being heard i mean the world farmers organization is for instance a example of it i think that's very important because there are many organizations who claim i mean to speak on behalf of the farmers um but if you then talk to the farmers i mean they tell me that's often that's not the case so having the authentic voice of the farmers by reaching out i mean to membership organizations is key at the country level when we do financing for the agriculture sector and a major kind of you know ag policy reform programs or working with governments in um redirecting public support along the lines i mentioned earlier um i always tell the ministers of agriculture you know if you cannot explain what we're trying to do in the projects that we finance to a farmer and how it actually benefits her wallet i mean then it's a losing proposition so actually you know having that perspective to kind of think through and calculate true i mean what those reforms mean for farmers bullets is key and then at the final level at the lowest level in the um at the project level i mean because most of the bank financing is channeled i mean it's all kind of projects i mean we take public consultation i mean very seriously as very part of you know of of our kind of project preparation procedures we work very closely with local farmers organizations also the funding actually is directed to those organizations um the kind of the the the the the where we do the economic cost benefit analysis of project i mean ultimately that's calculated based on the beneficiaries most of the time are farmers so both at the global country and local level i mean we are kind of you know reaching out at all those levels to make sure that farmers views actually are integrated and that's key i mean to success back to you thomas thanks very much martin so tony over to you the same question if you could discuss uh how the the voices and perspectives of farmers can be further elevated in institutions such as fao and in international processes thank you tom well first of all that question raises one one issue which is well who are the farmers we're talking about you know the farming community is not homogeneous so we need to to make sure that we're talking about heterogeneous uh community of different backgrounds different capacities different knowledge i think derek was saying that farming is the size based profession yes and no it depends to whom you know there are farmers who have the opportunity to be educated and to have access to knowledge to digital technology and there are smallholder farmers obviously who are an educated some some are uneducated they don't have the same level of capacity the same level of access to knowledge and and and learning so when we talk about you know the the access as you were saying we have to to just distinguish between the fact that we're talking about different kind of people in different kind of settings and i think that's absolutely critical so we don't give the impression that we're talking about farmers in general and everything we're saying all the solutions we're talking about they're going to apply to everyone they want um and the second point i want to make again with with your question is the fact that um there are possibly uh two avenues the first which is um again farmers who have access to be involved to be engaged and they can be invited to to the table you know either at fao or other processes no problem they can't travel they can have access they can read they can contribute fine um and and those who can't and this is the second category then you have to find out the means of doing that and the other means are to use the national representative the national policy makers the mps the ministers and others who can bring their voices to to these platforms and also the ngos ngos they play an important part really in connecting with the local realities with farmers and bringing those um needs those priorities that they have those asks to to the platform and that's absolutely critical and the last point i would make particularly in the current era where we're talking about technology and innovation then we need to reach out to farmers and listen to them it's very easy to film these days so you can go to any community ask the farmers the questions you know we're talking about change how can we make any change if we don't know what the farmers want how can they be involved can they in what circumstances and how and also just to distinguish about the changes we want to make some of the changes are big and challenging and demanding and some changes for some small communities just little changes will make a huge difference to the survivals to the livelihood to the income and that's absolutely critical so my my point is we need to be uh proactive as well to go and find farmers and and hear what they want to say in some context you know they don't have time to be involved in in global agenda they have other worries other priorities so we need to go and see well how can we help you they're never going to think whoa whoa there is a conference on climate change in glasgow we better go and and take part in that absolutely not so we are responsible in reaching out to those people when we talk about leaving no no one behind that's what it means go and find the people see what they want and take ownership and help them thank you thanks itony i think you raised some excellent questions and made some some very important points there as of course did martin um before turning to thomas i would just like to flag that just after promise i would like to turn to each of our speakers and ask them very briefly in about 30 seconds to 45 seconds to share with the audience what their key takeaway message would be if the audience is to remember one thing that each of you has said what would it be uh so please begin giving thought to that but before turning to each of you respectively i would like to ask thomas to respond to this question of how the voices and perspectives of farmers can be better amplified within institutions or organizations or companies um and also if i may very briefly thomas a secondary question for you which has come in from lauren hirsch um asking about what some of the key research gaps are still in need of investment over to you thomas and you can actually link a little bit because i think one of the things that we as kind of corporate innovation drivers lag sometimes is actually the engagement with with farmers early on to really make sure that we develop solutions that fit into the reality simple application realities economic windows of reality because you have great lab work but it never hits the market because it's misunderstood the application reality so that's a simple uh you should be easy but it really isn't but we have so many as we've exemplified today farmers that are progressive and actually eager to engage and that kind of engagement is is critical and then i would would tagline it over to the second part of the question of also creating these partnerships and alliances it can be with co-ops or individual farmers because sometimes it's also what is the willingness to pay if there's not a market for methane reduction or if there's not a credit given for carbon capture or soil health which is a longer-term gain than a yield one year well is it a is it a product concept or not and some farmers would love to pay for it but they can't afford it and then you need to link it back to policy making incentives and so forth and coming as a joint a representation of farmers and not as a corporate innovator that's being perceived to seek profit only creates a much better partnership for policy dialogue and so forth so i think that there's many of these which are these gaps that was asked to like soil health a methane reduction which are nebulous business cases because who will pay for them so that answers kind of that question there's a long list of business opportunities which should have capital value for a farmer but doesn't today and we can find a way to get that via incentives and get a fast way to market that would be great progress fantastic thank you very much thomas i hope i'm not being too ambitious here but with the time that remains i would really like to turn to each of our six speakers who are still with us to ask them in about 30 seconds to share their key takeaway message with our audience and if i could start with you secretary ross i was afraid i was going to be first and there was so much here two things i'm going to touch on one um i think thomas mentioned that we're trying to create some biological solutions and trying to fit them into a regulatory framework for chemistry and i think that really is something every country could take a look at and two thank you zatuni for your comments because i'm keenly aware california ag is very diverse we have the smallest organic urban farms all the way to the larger multi-generation but the small farmer and how do we engage on a global basis if we really want to make a difference that's where we're going to have to really work together and create partnerships thank you thanks so much secretary ross back to you thomas for your key takeaway sorry me yes yeah sorry um yes i would keep it back to the the central point about the potential and innovation is there it's a matter of unleashing it and getting it in the hands fast and an efficient way regulatory fast tracks ways to enable farmers to adopt fast would be my key takeaway excellent thanks for your brevity uh martian over to you thanks thanks tom um i i start um you know by referring to what derek said you know we need to reward private land stewards who protect i mean common public goods so my takeaway is that you know we need to kind of provide farmers the right incentives to do so and when it comes to uh making farmers better agents of change in greeting agriculture i think we need to provide them the right incentives so that we actually can move to a situation where we it's where it's recognizing where we redefine what it is to be a farmer in the 21st century i mean not just a producer of food but also a provider of ecosystem services and this would be revenue streams attached to that thank you martian um is itunes over to you in 30 seconds or less please thank you tom what three three points i would say the first one is definitely to include smallholder farmers and to listen to them the second point is to recognize the importance of indigenous and local knowledge and the third point i would make was within touch on its match actually is changing models but also changing our mindsets everyone thank you thanks itune i think it's only right and fitting that our farmer should have the the final word as it were so if i could turn to derrick and then doug each in about 30 seconds or less please uh derek over to you thank you i think the sentiment from farmers everywhere is they feel like the villain and and absent from a lot of these conversations that's simply unacceptable not only is the farmer play a critical role but we have a lot to be proud of in the food supply that we provide everybody and not only is the farmer the you know not the villain but but but critical to the solution and the answers lie on the farm and so um again i i appreciate the opportunity to share our thoughts and you could have had hundreds of thousands of farmers from around the world participate in this discussion and you have had equally diverse and interesting perspectives from each one of them thank you derek doug over to you yeah on a couple of these topics you know some of the organizations are doing this uh we built a 40 million dollar research facility to to study these type of things uh greenhouses the whole work sorghum is working on it they're even doing virtual reality work with international markets international grains program was developed in kansas and at kansas state university in connection with about seven or eight different commodities to address these issues so farmers are reaching out doing a lot of this i think a lot of these governmental entities and organizations are not reaching out to the farmers like myself and others because that work is being done and but my final takeaway is just include the farmers in these rules because we all got to do it and as much as possible the best way to do that is by making the carbon a free market system because of its free market system as eluded by some of the others the price of that carbon capture could go up and it will naturally happen thank you so much for today thank you very much doug i would now like to turn the floor back over to our moderator trolls thank you so much tom and thank you to the audience for all your excellent questions and uh to our panel and speakers for a very insight full conversation and thank you tom for moderating it and thank you for being the mastermind behind this event tom and fao did most of the heavy lifting behind this event so hats off to you guys and now i would like to hand out the floor to vimlendra from fao once again this time for some concluding remarks remember the floor is yours thank you trolls and you've been quite modest i think the embassy really took it upon themselves to make sure that we have the event as successful as we did have it today so it was a extremely engrossing discussion and i think even to expect to be able to do justice and summarize what we heard in five minutes i think it's beyond my capacity but i will try and uh bring out the main issues which i heard today both from policymakers the technical people looking at the global issues and definitely from the farming community represented by three farmers online today uh i learned a lot and i realized that more productive and resilient agriculture will require transformation and management of natural resources and higher efficiency of in use of these resources and inputs for production we heard uh to start with we heard from sauron sannega that farmers hold the key and this point got reiterated again and again uh including till the very last in in take away messages that they hold the key and they will be the one who will have to lead the front transition he also emphasized the need for a very effective partnership and strong r d along with strong incentives for farmers to bring about this transition uh secretary kevin rose thank you for reminding us that agriculture will perhaps be the first and best way to begin getting some wins in climate area and your emphasis on keeping sustainability and biodiversity from center in our policy prescriptions the greening of agriculture will also present an almost innovation challenge of producing more food and fiber without relying on most of the technological mainstays of productivity gains of the past so we need to innovate and we saw how andre nargo has led his organization sustainable practices through biogas plans digital feed chain climate check etc and andre we totally agree with you you're definitely not part of the problem you are the solution going forward a new demand is also being placed on agriculture and it has been asked to replace environmentally damaging products and protect biodiversity and mitigate climate change as well as address livelihoods and lifestyles and what better way to go ahead with this than to follow the initiatives are shown by bulls farming company and the kiesling farms which see farms not just as a place to grow but also to make farms work as a carbon sink as a habitat to promote biodiversity and also a place to grow human resources so the need to do all this and they've argued very strongly is to mention is to maintain the farming remains as remunerative activity we heard the community talk again and again about how farming is no more a very remunerative activity and how the youth is turning away from it so thank you so toony and martine for bringing a global perspective to it uh mr tooney he told us about fao's effort at integrating farmers voice the global agenda and also in handholding farming community at country level to make to take to climate smart agriculture and thank you for emphasizing once again the need to remember smallholder farmers because many times in our debate in north america we tend to focus on what farming is in and around this part of the world but to remember the 98 percent of the farming community is still farms and 10 hectares and less and your emphasis on being grounded in our traditional knowledge but looking forward to the future and having the capacity and the courage to embrace modern science and evidence martin thank you so much for explaining so well the need to better apply and target public resources going into agriculture worldwide uh can the 700 billion dollars be used much better can they be repurposed i think that's a extremely uh strong phrase how do we repurpose the 700 billion going in to ensure that they actually end up incentivizing farmers to invest in green technology and sustainable farming and that will require a lot of coordination with policymakers policy framers across the globe and especially in the global south thank you for spotlighting that farmers are in the front line of climate change and the need to understand that they are the victims and not the cause thomas you so rightly highlighted the importance of biological solutions for agriculture and food value chains and the fact that they exist and the need to change the regulatory framework to ensure that the land lab to land transfer happens extremely fast and the need for understanding the requirements the economic reality the implementational reality of bringing modern science to to the land so if we take all this together and summarize i think i'm being too ambitious to put it bring it in one sentence or two sentences but i would say that the potential of new science innovation knowledge technology and partnership to contribute to sustainable and green agriculture will depend on policy finding a way to manage these changes in a way that provides a balanced outcome for the society and the environment and ends up help incentivize the farmers to make the transition so it it the policy has to give the right signal and with that signal and partnership and knowledge and innovation and science and finance at an end we need to go forward always keeping the farmer as the focus point as the focal point and ensuring that he is front center of all our policy making so as we close this discussion today i think we need to take these lessons home and we need to help promote the urgent need to transition to green and sustainable agriculture i'm sure all of you would have taken your own lessons from the various points made by our speakers and i would end by thanking all of them to have taken time out of their business and attend this help us understand the issue with their ideas their thoughts and their perspectives thank you so much and back to you trolls thank you so much vimelendra as always on the point um and that concludes today's special event i think it has been a very interesting conversation and a much needed one we have less than 10 years to reach the sustainable development goals and some of the ambitious national goals for co2 reduction the clock is ticking and even as we are still in a dire situation with covet around the globe there is hope as we have heard today from farmers from government global organizations private sectors there is a great potential that can be unlocked and that farmers and other actors in the supply chain around them can adapt and engage with agility in a transformation for a more sustainable future so once again thank you so much all of the speakers for your great contributions and thank you to all the audience for for listening in we're sorry we couldn't take any more of your very good questions you have been a very active audience so thank you so much but i'm sure the conversation continues it needs to continue and so thank you so much all of you and have a nice rest of your day thank you you",
