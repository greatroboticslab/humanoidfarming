  "text": "uh we are uh back in the field again and I think it's uh3 days after sewing now although we had some rewing and replanting so it's not quite accurate because we have quite a few places which we planted later so and that creat a challenge now because we somehow need to figure out uh when to harvest this field and uh there are various ways to do this and we have an expert here with us today Martin gut who is our post har specialist and also leads the E program for so we'll ask him for help to help us determine where we are and what we do next okay so there as aim said there are different ways to determine whether the crop is ready for Harvest so uh the easiest is basically to look at the color of the grains so if you have 80% of the Grain in a panicle colored straw yellow then that's an indication that it should be should be right another way to to determine whether uh the crop is ready for harvesting is look at the at the hardness of the grains and the the grains in the bottom of the panicle should be in the hard do stage so when you when you basically open the Grain and you look at it it should still be a little bit soft but not too soft like like uh when you make a hot dough for for cooking so when you squeeze it you you your nail should probably cut the grain rather than than mash it up so to speak it should not be brittle yet so we start with a visual estimate of of how ready the crop is and we we we first look at the the proportion of yellow grains the proportion of straw yellow grains now Martin has suggested an ideal amount for Harvest would be 80% yellow now in front of me here we always have an issue as to whether it's representative or not it's probably 50 to 60% yellow something of that order it's not quite ready yet now a more objective and professional way to assess how uh how ready the crop is we'll be to measure its moisture content yep and this is one way to do that this is a moisture meter So-Cal moist meter it measures the resistance of the crop which is uh basically dependent on the moisture content and you have a small sample tray so you take a a sample from a panicle at least at 80% of the of the GR should be St yellow that basically says 80% of one panicker getting representative is always a challenge there's almost no is a challenge all so so uh you take a small sample like this fill it in there and then uh what you do with this instrument basically you crush it oops can I give you thisx it you you turn the knob and crush it turn it all the way to the end and then uh you measure the resistance and that gets translated in the reading of the moisture conted and this case it's 21.6% and what we're going to do is mix The Greener one I've I've I've harvested and because this is a way small sample it's not really representative neither for small plot nor for the field so what you have to do is you have to in one location you should do different at least three different measurements so now in this sample for example you have a lot more green grains than in the previous one so the reading should be a lot higher 27.9% and you would take at least three samples and then you have a button here where you can average the readings and then you get the average reading for that uh location and then what you have to do is basically also measure in a representative way in the field because the the crop doesn't mature evenly everywhere in the field we're facing the final tricky decision to irrigate or not to get irrigate that is the question so we're considering how moist the soil is now how moist is the soil now moist right we're considering what the weather's like what's the weather like hot dry and we're considering how long we'd expect until we Harvest and our consensus is about 10 days to 2 weeks something of that range it'll be close to to two weeks time before you're back to do the dude so we need this to last to to finish properly I think it needs the two weeks but it's moist it's heavy clay and we do want our combine to stay on the ground not to explore the underground I vote keep it dry yeah I would have if it was an experiment and I knew that we would be doing hand harvesting I would put on another irrigation just for safety but we need to figure out that we have to come in with a comine and so the carrying capacity of that soil will be the deciding factor and we can't delay Harvest because we see some lodging coming in so I'll go with the majority wot yeah I agree so no more irrigation let's see but I pray for a little bit of rain tonight maybe well on RAC and patterns I think you'll probably have that have that wish granted so there we have it we won't irrigate again and we'll it'll be in approximately 2 weeks we'll come back and harvest about May 2nd",
