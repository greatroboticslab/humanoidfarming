  "text": "okay so today i want to show the sleep production that means the shoot production from the sweet potato so there is a very nice and easy techniques that we very quickly we can produce the shoot from there so i have collected three types of sweet potato this is in malaysian variety so this is called yellow yellow sweet potato ubiquiladic kuni and this is called the purple sweet potato will be keledek and this is called a white sweet potato ubiquitous so these three types of potato i have collected from the shopping mall so today i want to show how to do or how we can set for the shoot production our main purpose is to produce produce the shoot from that types of root that means it is on type of root crops the sweet potato so this you can see the any i have used three types of different cup plastic cup with water just some the simple very simple the tap waters you can use so this is a water calf or any food or food cuff or even through the water office and it's a small one so i have tried to explain that you can use any type of waste plastic cup from your house i have used a transparent cup you can use the non-transparent also okay the transport is better you can show the you can see the routing as well from the shoot so firstly our job is to produce the shoot from there so after producing the shoot then we have to separate the shoot and we have to put inside the water again for the root production so from the root we can produce so many shoot at a time so firstly our job is to cut divide into two section so in uh in a sweet potato there are two of end this one is called the uh top end and the end and this is the another is what is called the uh another end so this end usually connected with the mother plant and this is the growing portion this will continue to grow so from both side we can produce the shoot but usually the end portion is usually called this is the top portion and this is the end portion the lower portion but both side we can use no problem but the top portion is usually they produce more shoot and you need just the knife and the toothpick normally you use the toothpick so just to hold inside this cuff so now i want to show you how to do that and how to cut and then how to set into that watercraft okay so now our first job is to cut the root under the tuberous root this is called the sweet potato from the middle so use a knife and just you can cut like that so very just make it half so like that okay so just to half so we can set letter so i want one by one i am cutting the portion so for this is called the wider inside the vessel is white color the flesh is white color this one is purple color this is one of the malaysian very popular sweet potato so they are flesh supposed to be purple so this is very nice this completely purple color so it's called purple variety and this one is the flesh supposed to be yellow color so cut carefully during cutting make it around there it's easier so this is yellow color or yellow flesh okay so now we have make it two section so now you have to use the toothpick this is the toothpick so usually is free toothpick for on so because we have to dive into the water so you can take or we can add the extra water no problem when it's out also push like that usually made three goes like that there's another one that's right okay so now leave here so when the is if water level is very low so you can add extra water just about one one centimeter is enough so dip into water so then you have to keep it about two weeks this is white varieties we have to keep it two weeks but every day you have to check the water level supposed to be one centimeter deep into the water if you see the water is already dried or what is called the vapor rice so you can add extra water so this is white variety so we can keep like that then this is a i mean the uh the top space is very more so maybe we can use four due to the balance to make it balance so we can use four toothpick here three is okay but to keep the purple balancer exact balancing because the space is bigger okay sorry you can use another one okay so like that as this is water is already low so later we have to add extra water and you have to ensure that the at least one centimeter deep into the water more you can do that because the suit will be produced from the top so this is purple then this is the yellow so as this is depending on the top especially so we can use the arduino program okay and another one is that free so now dip into water so this one is almost okay so now you have to check every day the water level and you have to wait within one week supposed to be they will start the shooting so after that within two weeks we can we can see the so more many many shoots already produced from the this route then later when the the shoot is about 10 centimeter five or this cut eight to ten centimeter or more can also okay then you have to sleeve that miscut from the root then the shoe you have to dip into the water again for rooting so that means it can confirm after transplanting that is that means there is no loss or there is no dead uh or the gap from the transplanting so whatever should you are transplanting so you can assure that more than 90 percent they will be survived so this is the way that how we can do for the shooting from the sweet potato this is the most easiest way and in any types of convenient uh one in your house you can do that no need any the what is called the cold room or whatever is nothing just we can dip into water then we have to wait about two weeks to produce the shoot from there after that we have to set for the routing so this is the silly production or shoot production from sweet potato okay so this is how it looks like after completion so all the three roots is inside the water cup with the water and dip into water is usually you can use more than one centimeter but minimum you have to maintain minimum on centimeter deep into the water so this is how it looks like then you have to leave it in any place at your house but please avoid the i mean the what kitchen place or some there is the temperature is very high in normal condition you can keep it and just you have to wait about two weeks then after that you can see the huge suit is already produced from the top portion of that sweet potato as very nice techniques and easy techniques that we can produce shoot from here okay that's all okay so this is exactly after two weeks so two weeks before i set for the shooting up this capsule production so today is already day 15 actually so that means two weeks later so is uh profuse you can see profuse number of shoot already produced from here and extra long enough so now what we can do now we have to sleep that means remove details the shoot from here and we have to defend water again for a reshooting from the individual shoot so very nicely there this one is a little bit solo but it's still very nice so this is the way so you can see how the roots has been grown up huge number of roots from the i mean cutted root of the sweet potatoes and this is all through the every single shoot and very nicely grown and this one is still growing little bit solo this one and this one is also okay this is different variety this one is a yellowish color basically the huge number of roots is already there this is supporting root just to help the for the shooting and this is uh the purple varieties these both are perfect varieties and there is one other another one was white so these are already fungal affected so i have removed that on from here so you can see the huge number of shoot that means sleep production from sweet potato just by two weeks then today what we have to do we have to sleep remove just by hand we can remove that truth and we have to agree in re have to uh set for the shooting routing from that shoot so then uh by one week so just for one week is enough so balls to one x then we can transplant in the main field so this is the called the should production from sweet potato quick shoot production actually very quick uh so just for tweaks and even by one week i have tried to see huge number of this another week just for the proper growth and development of the shoot and we have to do the another week for the shooting from the special or individual this should so that i can show you now how to remove the shoot from that route then we have to set for the routing from the that branches okay so now i want to show how to remove this produce shoot from the main route then we have to reset for the routing from that so just remove by hand is okay so just like that you can remove so this one then you have to soak into another new water again so they will produce new wood just by one week they will produce the roots like that just remove from the mother root then dip into the water those are sufficiently grown so all these sufficiently grown so like that we have to remove every individual shoot from here then we have to resolve for root production from that special or individual shoot like that so just remove all and this one you just keep to see another new shooting from there so this is also properly grown just remove you can see they have already started to produce ruda this small small rooting in its root initiation from here so very nicely it's very small small so they will produce the new root again so when you can see just by one week is enough so after one week you can see they have produced some of the new roots and the initiation of would already happen so now just you have to dip into water as this one is two different brightest better use two different uh pots or calf for the different variety if you have different varieties this all single body then you can keep all together in one cup for the root proper root growth from that uh new shoot okay there is the some dry leaves so just remove so this fresh one just dip into water okay this one is still growing so i am not removing that one so that's all so i am i want to show you the router very nice huge number of routes and the supporting route that is helping to produce huge number of foot from there so this is the overall way or methods of quick shoot production from sweet potatoes just by two weeks you can produce huge number of new shoot so they should have only given to water just wait for another one week so by one week they you can see they have produced new route from here then you can transplant into the main field or whatever you have a special body you have so just true and we have to wait for the root production from there the remove from there so that's all about the quick methods the shoot production is another term is called silly production from sweet potato okay so just one week before i set the newly produced shoot into another fresh cuff for the routing from there so you can see very nicely they have produced huge number of roots now this is completely ready to transfer into your main field but wherever places or whatever media you want to grow for the final grain so meaning is that one week before i detest that shoot newly grown shoot from the mother root and i replace into a fresh cup for the rooting from there so you can see you can see just by one week just by one week how nicely they have produced the huge number of roots so now you can transplant this newly grown shoe root with the shoot so you can see completely ready to transplant into your desired media or in the main field whatever you want to grow so they can see very nicely produce the root this is enough so now you can transplant so for this this is the easiest method and we can say this is very confirmed that while you're transplanting into your main field this already have huge number of roots so it will not die normally if there is any other environmental stresses there so this is the nice process very quick process the slip production or shoot production from the mother root of the sweet potato and just you can set the root you can decide for the full or the full size of the sweet potato into the water or you can make it to half and set for the root shooting and after two weeks you can remove the shoot from the mother dude and soak into water for rooting from that newly grown shoot so very nice very quick and confirmed that after transplanting it will continue to grow okay this is very nice and grow and you can try at your home and if you have the planning to grow sweet potato and in and very well grant that you are confirmed that your plant is will be survived nicely okay",
