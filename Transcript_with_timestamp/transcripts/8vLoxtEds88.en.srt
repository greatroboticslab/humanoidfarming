00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,480
the destructive biodiversity made of

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,040
parasites

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,880

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,840
all kinds of agricultural plagues and

11
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:52,719
competitors such as other plants

12
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,320
which decrease the yields of cultivated

13
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,120
crops

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,280
now the wide diversity of attackers

15
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,000
which are illustrated here

16
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,760
we have the uh fruit worm on maize

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,320
nematodes on bananas

18
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,880
diseases on sugarcane

19
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,200
drosophila being attacked by

20
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,680
ants on monk fruit

21
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,720
mango fruit and also white worms

22
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,360
attacking the roots of maize a disease

23
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,320
on cocoa

24
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,720
plants all these

25
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,119
aggressors attackers are a problem for

26
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,840
agriculture and farmers

27
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,360
and

28
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,400
they account for

29
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,520
a huge potential loss or even observed

30
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,079
loss

31
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,400
this table

32
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:43,920
shows you the various types of attackers

33
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:47,119
of fungi bacteria viruses

34
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,680
animals uh other plants and the losses

35
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:52,720
potential losses are huge the total

36
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,960
decrease of production due to these four

37
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,399
categories of attackers may reach 67

38
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,560
percent two-thirds of the crop may be

39
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,200
lost

40
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,600
versus the situation a similar situation

41
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,080
without the attackers now agriculture

42
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,319
for a long time has focused on how to

43
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,920
best control or even eliminate the

44
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,319
attackers

45
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,959
at the bottom on the bottom line we see

46
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:20,239
the efficacy of a possible fight against

47
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,879
attackers in percentage we never will be

48
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,440
able to eradicate the attackers limiting

49
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,400
the yield of crops but we

50
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,080
have

51
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,200
ways

52
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:34,720
to reduce the attack

53
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,720
in modern agriculture however

54
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,920
the best way consists in using or the

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,680
most efficient ways consisting using

56
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,400
biocides pesticides

57
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,879
targeting this or that attacker

58
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,040
industrial agriculture

59
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,959
and agriculture

60
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,239
in the green revolution countries

61
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,040
intensive

62
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:58,640
intensive single species with a

63
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,640
high use of fertilizers

64
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,200
invest a lot in pesticides

65
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,959
and use

66
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,480
huge quantities of

67
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,720
fungicides

68
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,800
pesticides

69
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,800
the chemical turnover represents 40

70
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,159
billion dollars in this field so it's a

71
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,480
huge cost

72
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,959
for agriculture to

73
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,120
try and eliminate or mitigate the action

74
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,120
of parasites

75
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,319
there is a paradigm on which uh

76
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,480
agricultural

77
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,640
production is based

78
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,400
it's all about eradication an attacker

79
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,640
is an emitting factor it decreases the

80
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,080
yield we use a buyer site to try and

81
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,080
eliminate the attackers

82
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,080
but by doing this we forget about the

83
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,000
wealth of ecosystemic services

84
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,560
present both in the cultivated plot and

85
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,920
all around the cultivated plot i think

86
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,760
it is high time we thought about other

87
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,760
ways to fight against parasites and

88
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,319
attackers because

89
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,799
abundant use of pesticides obviously has

90
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,400
a negative negative impact

91
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,239
on both the

92
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,120
producers and farmers health on the

93
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,120
consumer's health

94
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,560
we have reason to worry

95
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,000
about the use of pesticides by farmers

96
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,920
especially in

97
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,840
developing countries where safety rules

98
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:20,160
are not really complied with

99
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,160
we have a huge public health problem

100
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,600
and obviously pesticides leave residues

101
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,080
on the produce

102
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,320
whereby the consumers are also in danger

103
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,840
and the whole ecosystem is in danger

104
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:36,880
toxicology of the pesticides

105
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,400
in the environment is really a source of

106
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,880
worry

107
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,440
physiology

108
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,960
the man who invented ddt and got the

109
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,280
nobel prize about 18 years ago

110
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,440
and ever since we have come a long way

111
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:56,120
to understand that it's now absolutely

112
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,120
necessary to limit the use of pesticides

113
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,759
which aims at dividing by two the use of

114
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,840
pesticides within a few years time is

115
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,320
being implemented it's in progress

116
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,960
except it's very difficult to control

117
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:13,520
the pests and attackers differently

118
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,520
research produces all of the uh

119
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,479
agricultural industry of looking for new

120
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,479
ways to control pesticides and attackers

121
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,720
and diseases

122
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:25,199
there is a very good example

123
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,120
of a new way

124
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,240
to achieve this result the use of

125
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,160
vegetal biodiversity present on the

126
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,720
plant and around the plot on the

127
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,560
left-hand side you see agrochemistry

128
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,440
everything used by industrial

129
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,160
agriculture to get rid of

130
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,800
attackers mainly pesticides

131
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,600
the efficacy is specific it limits

132
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,360
the efficacy of bio attackers for one

133
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,440
campaign maybe two campaigns or three

134
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,840
until the bio attacker finds a way to

135
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,639
resist the pesticide and develops

136
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,680
resistance but it also has an impact on

137
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,120
production and yield

138
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,560
is high

139
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,000
except that an excessive use of

140
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,199
pesticides may lead to a very

141
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,199
unfavorable situation

142
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:19,120
in central america require 50 60 70.

143
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,160
treatments

144
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,160
a year almost once a week an airplane

145
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,280
has to spread pesticides on the

146
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,800
plantation

147
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,280
you can imagine the problem with this

148
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,840
entails on the right hand side we have

149
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,840
ways to fight

150
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,680
impact on human health and environmental

151
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,680
health

152
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,720
with different methods than spreading

153
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,319
poisons in the environment

154
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,039
this can be achieved

155
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,479
through beneficial organisms

156
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,479
which fight

157
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,759
the attackers or parasitoids or

158
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:10,560
parasites or pests which attack the

159
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,560
original pests

160
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,120
and this also will have a

161
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,599
beneficial effect on

162
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,599
soil fertility and biological activity

163
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:22,000
in the soil and finally there are some

164
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,880
spectacular effects on

165
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,960
economy and yield

166
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,120
with this new way to eliminate attackers

167
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,360
i'll give you one example

168
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,000
on how to use a vegetal diversity in

169
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:37,440
order to get rid of a

170
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,479
pest that attacks a maze in africa this

171
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:43,039
system was developed by icp in africa

172
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:45,759
it's called the push-pull system push as

173
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:49,120
in pushing pull as in pulling attracting

174
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:52,080
there is a type of muff and uh worm that

175
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,520
attacks maize and may reduce by 60

176
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,800
80

177
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,720
crop yield

178
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,039
now this muff

179
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,039
fruit

180
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,919
and destroys the maze the system is a

181
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,360
push-pull system whereby all around the

182
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,280
plot

183
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,919
a plant will be

184
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,960
planted simply to provide the service it

185
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,120
attracts

186
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,400
the female moss looking for a place to

187
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,120
lay their eggs

188
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:26,720
and this plant is toxic for the female

189
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,400
moth the moth deposits its uh eggs

190
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,080
on this

191
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,159
type of grass

192
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,159
and uh the eggs will not develop they'll

193
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,640
be intoxicated that this is the pool

194
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,800
system attracting the moss and in order

195
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,360
to reinforce the system between the

196
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,440
stocks of maize this medium is planted

197
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,519
and this medium is a plant that

198
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,720
pushes away the female moss and

199
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,399
therefore the moth population

200
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,959
looking for a place to lay their eggs

201
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,519
are pushed away by this plant they don't

202
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:58,080
like it this is a very simple

203
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,880
relatively um

204
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,760
cheap system to push away the

205
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,240
parasite out of the plot attracting it

206
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,320
outside of the plot to eliminate it with

207
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,320
a toxic

208
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,279
there are other advantages because the

209
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:17,920
dysmodium planted between the uh

210
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,080
stocks is a leguminous plant which is

211
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,240
going to provide nitrogen and fertilize

212
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,240
the soil

213
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:33,279
have an allelopathic effect on striga

214
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,880
seeds striker is a plant which is a

215
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,279
parasite for maize

216
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,920
and this medium will kill this trigger

217
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:42,160
see when they germinate

218
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,720
so it's a

219
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:48,320
way to engineer biodiversity in order to

220
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,240
control a parasite moth or fruit worm

221
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,120
and this system is now being used by

222
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,120
tens of

223
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,240
thousands of producers and farmers in

224
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,040
africa

225
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,080
this family of systems this push-pull

226
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,279
system

227
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:04,839
has been adapted

228
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,839
in other systems

229
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,120
a system that allows to push away the

230
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,640
parasites and attract them to a

231
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,279
different place between a trap where

232
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,680
they will be naturally eliminated was it

233
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:18,680
developed by sierra and for

234
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,680
adequate

235
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,519
companies or farms

236
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,760
and this way to fight parasites is

237
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,440
accessible for small producers

238
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,200
relatively cheap

239
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,800
and it doesn't have a negative impact on

240
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,519
the environment

241
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,360
we are finally realizing that

242
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,440
we don't need to think in terms of a

243
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,360
prescriptive way to eliminate parasites

244
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,920
with a pesticide same way that a

245
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:47,600
pharmacist or a doctor would

246
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,839
make a diagnosis and give you a uh

247
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,880
prescription to go and buy the drug now

248
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,959
we have to rethink the whole system

249
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,320
and there are other such like examples

250
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:59,279
the biological

251
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,360
fights against the pests extraction of

252
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,680
natural substances for some products in

253
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,880
order to spread them on the

254
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:09,360
cultivated plants and even uh

255
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,120
plants that sanitize the environment i

256
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,880
remember i told you about the banana

257
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,560
well in order to fight

258
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,839
against

259
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:20,480
nematode and weevil in the station there

260
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:23,040
is a plant that will limit nematodes and

261
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:26,880
limit the weevil populations and that

262
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,680
will go from 15 20 year treatments on

263
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,320
the

264
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,880
french west indies on banana plantations

265
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,480
and divide the number of uh treatments

266
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,000
by three

267
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,519
this is better for the consumers better

268
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,920
for the producers

269
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:45,079
and obviously it's also a better way and

270
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:45,079
a more economic way to fight attackers

271
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,279
you
