  "text": "summer Gardens farmers markets and roadside produce stands all make us feel closer to the food that we're eating knowing exactly where the beef in our burgers or the Cucumbers for last season's pickles came from adds a little magic to something we have a tendency to take for granted but is it possible for personal Gardens and local producers to feed us all [Music] hi I'm Melissa from Southland Organics where we provide natural solutions to Natural problems for lawn garden and Coop care learn more about these Solutions at southenorganics.com no matter how you get the food you eat one thing is for certain that process looks immensely different than anything we could have predicted 10 000 years ago or even a hundred years ago imagine with me living in a time where the only real access to food was whatever the family had growing in the yard could trade with close neighbors or relatives or had storage from previous seasons and what about a time where you had no home or no crop to harvest where everything you ate came from hunting and Gathering today an ever-changing web of food products ensures that there is a near constant supply of easily accessible food this was removed most of the regionality dependence on growing season and unpredictability that was for a very long time associated with food availability after Decades of infrastructure and development our food supply chain has morphed from local operations to a global Enterprise according to USDA reports the United States is the world's second largest agriculture Trader behind the European Union in 2022 agriculture products accounted for 196 billion dollars in exports more than triple the 62.8 billion from 1997. a large portion of exports are what the USDA considers high value products or hpvs these include dairy products Meats fruits and vegetables these massive increases in agriculture exports have been made possible by increasing demand and elimination of trade barriers trade barriers to Canada and Mexico were eliminated by the North American Free Trade Agreement or NAFTA which made it possible to quadruple exports to both of those countries even the products that stay in the U.S are destined for travel for example let's think about a fan favorite chicken whether it's nuggets wings or whole Birds if you're eating chicken grown in America there's a strong possibility that it was grown right here in Georgia where we produce the most meat chickens in any state in the country this enhanced international market for agriculture products has offered American farmers a new outlet to impact food supply globally as well as a stronger sense of security and their ability to sell their end products but it's not without its own problems from Transportation shortages to trade agreements producers are impacted by issues that arise at all levels of this intricate supply chain along with the normal risks associated with producing High volumes of crops or livestock like disease and natural disasters this doesn't begin to cover the social and cultural challenges producers are facing as consumer Intrigue and backlash grows recently the agriculture industry has been facing a new question from consumers how do we know that our food is safe and nutritious although This Global Food Market has opened new doors for producers consumers have begun to question whether or not they can trust the food that they're buying at the grocery store due to high volumes being produced the many stops it makes between the farm and the kitchen tables and the environmental impact from commercial production these concerns have paved the way for what some may consider a revolution of local eaters and homesteaders who believe that growing your own food or buying from a trusted local producer can provide an alternative this way you know not only where your food came from but also exactly who grew it and how as this demand for presumably higher quality food source has grown dedicated Facebook groups farmers markets on-farm stores and roadside stands have steadily increased in number now instead of going to the grocery store and buying a steak that came from somewhere in the U.S there's an option to buy beef from a producer 20 miles away and know exactly what the animal was fed it's breed and where it was raised and consumers are loving it in fact more than nine billion dollars in agriculture Revenue could be attributed to local cells a fresh and value-added products like butter and cheese in 2020. within this movement there are some with more drastic beliefs that locally grown food is the only option to ensure safety sustainability and nourishment but is that an option if we wanted to could we go back to a time where Global Enterprise didn't determine our food supply could we feed ourselves solely through local sales and trade let's take a closer look estimations can be made for the amount of land needed to provide food for a single person based on nutritional need conservative estimates say that one person can produce enough fruits and vegetables for a year on about 3.25 Acres now before we go any further let's remember that this number doesn't take into account any crop losses or inopportune weather conditions which is not uncommon when growing food in the United States alone the 2022 census reported 333 million 287 557 people but for Simplicity we'll use 333 million if each person needs 3.25 Acres that would mean a grand total of over a billion acres of land at first glance that seems like it wouldn't be a problem since the United States covers more than 2.3 billion Acres the complicated part of the equation is when you start to consider space already covered by cities bodies of water homes and land that's not suitable for growing food like mountains deserts and marshes taking all this into account you start to realize that the land mass we have available to us is simple simply not enough for us to grow substantial enough food supply for us all to feed ourselves without some form of commercial Agriculture and this is a theme that's echoed globally the truth is there's not a simple or a single answer for some growing their own food is a way of life a passion and a sustainable practice but for others this may not ever be an option because of time space and physical ability there are even folks like me that lie somewhere in between I grow a summer garden and love every bit of food it provides for me my family and my friends I never shy away from an opportunity to support a local producer but I also value the ability to walk into a grocery store and purchase the things I wouldn't otherwise be able to enjoy we live at a time where food has become incredibly more accessible than it was for Generations before us we're connected to Global Market simply through the food that we eat and we're lucky to have the opportunity to make a choice between growing our own foods and buying the food provided for us by hard-working Farmers across the globe homegrown local or commercial the choice for your family is in your hands if you have any questions feel free to email me at Alyssa southorganics.com call

making the right decisions for your family's food foreign [Music]",
