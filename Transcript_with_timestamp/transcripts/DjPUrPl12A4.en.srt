00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,680
Jesse Schmidt and I work for the UVM

6
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,760
extension new farmer project I'll be

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,279
moderating this session our presenter

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,880
today is Keith Morris since 2000 he has

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,080
worked professionally as a designer

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,160
Builder and grower of ecologically

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,320
regenerative socially just and

12
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,679
culturally appropriate whole systems in

13
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,360
cities and sides around the world he

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,280
teaches at the University of Vermont the

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,680

Burlington permaculture and has worked

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:45,520
for us Aid farmer to farmer in Nigeria

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,440
and Ghana welcome Keith ah thanks Jesse

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,399
it's a pleasure to be here um just uh as

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,719
far as sound goes is that sounding okay

22
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:56,920
to folks if you could maybe thumb up or

23
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,320
let me know that that sounds

24
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,199
good I think it sounds pretty good if

25
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,960
you might be able to pull your mic a

26
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:07,720
little bit away um it's just a little

27
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:11,479
muffled yeah okay I can pull it

28
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:13,880
away um great yeah it's a pleasure to be

29
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:16,240
here and I'm really excited to be a part

30
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:19,439
of the webinar series it's such a great

31
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,640
collection of resources already there in

32
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:27,040
terms of

33
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:30,280
webinars um yeah so um This was

34
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,680
um uh some stuff that we already did

35
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:35,520
here as far as the map so I think I'm

36
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:38,360
just going to skip through that and as

37
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,720
Jesse said um you know I work as a

38
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:45,079
designer um really my work as a designer

39
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:49,040
began um working for a variety of farms

40
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:51,840
um I started my own farm and I was 23 in

41
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:56,159
an interesting rent to own process it's

42
00:01:51,840 --> 00:02:00,079
whe Crossing Farm um in Johnson Vermont

43
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:03,759
where we grow um fruit trees nut trees

44
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:06,479
bushes Vines medicinal herbs and we're

45
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:11,840
increasingly doing added value in terms

46
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:14,519
of um Farm oh um I'm hearing that I'm

47
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,040
not I can turn my mic

48
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:19,239
up how's that Ida does that sound a

49
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,239
little

50
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,840
better

51
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:28,040
um just let me know if there sound

52
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,200
issues again so um increasingly we're

53
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:33,599
doing kind of added value production in

54
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:36,800
terms of farm dinners and educational

55
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,400
events um my other business is um

56
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,440
Prospect Rock permaculture which is

57
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,800
really more of a design and education

58
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,200
aspect where I work with farmers and

59
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,319
other institutions and Community groups

60
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,560
to um help figure out how to make

61
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:55,280
Landscapes more productive and connected

62
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,000
um just a brief little history with that

63
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,239
if anyone's familiar with these two

64
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,440
areas geographically

65
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:08,000
um we wheel Crossing is an area that is

66
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:10,280
overlooked by Prospect Rock and um long

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,480
before there was such great aerial

68
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,959
photography that we have today I would

69
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,959
go up to prospect Rock a bluff on the

70
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,720
Long Trail and going to look down over

71
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:25,480
my farm in order to help me uh figure

72
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:27,400
things out and do some design work so um

73
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,439
we're going to be talking about peric

74
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:33,840
culture design as applied to

75
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:37,439
Farms um but this isn't intended as a

76
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:40,239
basic introduction to permaculture so um

77
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:43,159
it's a very very big field there's a lot

78
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,840
of things to explore um but for those of

79
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:48,040
you that aren't familiar the the word

80
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,640
comes not only from permanent

81
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:54,680
agriculture but also permanent culture

82
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,319
and kind of looking at how ecology can

83
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:01,280
better

84
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:03,159
inform the ways that we meet needs so

85
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,280
everything from food really as a

86
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:06,879
centerpiece you know um agriculture has

87
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,760
always been a centerpiece of

88
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:13,040
permaculture but also shelter also

89
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:16,000
energy also Waste Management um how

90
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,280
these things can be better connected and

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,360
modeled after what we see working in

92
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:24,840
natural systems so I have two

93
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:28,199
definitions here of per culture there

94
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:31,639
are hundreds um but meeting human needs

95
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:34,600
while increasing e ological health and

96
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:36,039
um the postmodern synthesis of all wise

97
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,639
human behavior a big part of

98
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:41,720
permaculture of course is studying

99
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:44,479
traditional techniques and recombining

100
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,720
them in in novel ways in in response to

101
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,919
some of the things that we're facing in

102
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:53,560
the 20th century so

103
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:57,320
um most mostly um prob culture is a

104
00:04:53,560 --> 00:05:00,280
vision and a design system and it's a

105
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:02,639
network of people that's really where um

106
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:05,080
it's an exciting thing to be a part of

107
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,199
there's folks all over the world using

108
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,280
this design technique in order to

109
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:11,400
actualize this this vision of a

110
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:17,199
permanent

111
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:19,000
culture um it's basis is in ethics which

112
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:24,360
is something that's kind of unique in

113
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:28,400
Land Management Systems um and in slogan

114
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:30,199
form these are Earth care people care

115
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,919
and fair share

116
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:35,800
um which are kind of self-evident but

117
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:37,479
obviously we want to look take

118
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,160
responsibility for the resources that we

119
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:43,479
depend on natural systems that we depend

120
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:47,319
on but we're also caring for people um

121
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:50,800
and and it's really um about how as I've

122
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:52,360
said we're meeting human needs while

123
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,680
while improving ecological health and

124
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,479
recognizing that that isn't necessarily

125
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,440
a contradiction of terms although

126
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,039
there's certainly plenty of evidence to

127
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:05,440
to lead us to believe that that may be

128
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:08,160
the case um when we look at long-term

129
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,160
human needs obviously we need to have

130
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,720
good soil in which we grow our food we

131
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,400
need to have clean air we need to have

132
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:18,680
clean water um and then lastly and not

133
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:21,759
least importantly um be share meaning

134
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,759
limits to consumption limits to

135
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,560
population but most importantly

136
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,039
redistribution of our resources towards

137
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,199
better care of the earth and better care

138
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:33,360
of people um

139
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:36,199
so um that's the per culture ethics in a

140
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,840
nutshell if you aren't familiar with per

141
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:41,639
culture or even if you are um I just

142
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:44,639
point out here at the bottom the per

143
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:48,039
culture principles. comom website which

144
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:50,319
is really a great uh Resource as a as a

145
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:51,759
basic introduction to protoculture

146
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:56,360
ethics and

147
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:59,720
principles um the design principles are

148
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:02,440
varied and they're the things that we

149
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,400
learning from our study of traditional

150
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:07,919
culture and our study of

151
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:11,800
ecology and what's working in any

152
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:14,560
context and while we'll look at some

153
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:17,720
techniques that may be Place specific or

154
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,440
specific to a culture or E ecological

155
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,599
context really at its core these ethics

156
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:26,080
and principles will work wherever we

157
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:28,800
find ourselves in the world um so I

158
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,080
won't be getting too into depth with

159
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,599
these principles but we'll address them

160
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:39,039
a little bit um folks seeing my pointer

161
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:41,560
as I move it around the screen

162
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:46,800
um yeah so we'll be looking at how we

163
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:48,919
can integrate pieces of our systems to

164
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,800
be more mutually

165
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:54,800
beneficial um just to kind of give a

166
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,400
sense of the spectrum of protoculture

167
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,800
design I'll share with you the

168
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:02,680
protoculture flower and receive there's

169
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:05,960
these kind of seven points of action um

170
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:08,639
permaculture really encompasses how we

171
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:11,520
build the tools and Technologies we use

172
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:14,080
the education and our cultural aspects

173
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,280
um health and well-being finances and

174
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,479
economy land tenure and Community

175
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:21,639
governments and land in nature

176
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:24,960
stewardship so it's it's a very big uh

177
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:27,039
system and you know today we're really

178
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,960
going to be looking at just some of

179
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,200
these um maybe specifically

180
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,399
how we read

181
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:36,360
Landscapes and um you know how

182
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:39,440
agriculture fits in in terms of our land

183
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,279
and nature stewardship um but all of

184
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:46,000
these different pieces are kind of part

185
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:49,399
of our herbiculture toolkit um all right

186
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,760
so at any time if there's questions feel

187
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:54,800
free to type them into the box there um

188
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:58,240
I'm going to share a little bit more

189
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:00,160
about my own Farm just briefly we're

190
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,079
actually going to uh

191
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:06,360
do some time travel this is an aerial

192
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:09,160
photograph that was taken in 1942 of the

193
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,040
area where I farm and in 1942 they

194
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:14,880
started taking aerial

195
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:17,360
photographs um as a part of uh defense

196
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,560
strategies for World War II and they've

197
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,240
turned out to be some really great

198
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:25,120
resources for our understanding of Land

199
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,839
Management and um I'm not going to get

200
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,959
into too much detail but I just kind of

201
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:32,440
point out the curve of the river here as

202
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:34,839
it was in 1942 and also introduced these

203
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:38,079
photographs not only to share my own

204
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:41,399
Farm but to let you know that if you're

205
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:43,880
farming um You probably it's probably

206
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:47,240
going to be well worth your while to dig

207
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:50,920
into the archives of the map rooms of

208
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:53,720
the USDA or your local uh state land

209
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:57,320
grate University or wherever these files

210
00:09:53,720 --> 00:10:00,360
may be archived because they will share

211
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:04,760
incredible insight to the Past of our

212
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:07,920
Landscapes so um as we travel through

213
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:12,320
time here we're going to see a couple of

214
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:15,279
things um one is that even in just a few

215
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,959
decades um we see tremendous changes

216
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,760
happening in our Landscapes and I'm sure

217
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,600
we're all well aware of that but to

218
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,680
really be able to quantify that in a

219
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,800
place specific way can be an incredibly

220
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:28,240
helpful tool in helping contextualize

221
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:31,079
our own decision making process and our

222
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,440
designs so in terms of this particular

223
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:36,560
site we see that obviously there's some

224
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:40,720
pretty severe erosion happening along my

225
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:44,880
Riverbank um also here as we move um

226
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:47,959
into 1995 we see the original farm and

227
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:50,519
Homestead and barn raised and put into

228
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:54,560
the ground where there's the beginnings

229
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:57,560
of a of a of a church um

230
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:01,200
constructed and we can see as I've

231
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:04,000
started to set up my farm some of the

232
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,519
changes happening in terms of ecological

233
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,839
secession both allowing some areas of

234
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:11,000
old pasture to to start to regrow and

235
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,959
you know here we are with one of the

236
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
more recent photograph Series where you

237
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:18,720
can kind of get a sense of um what's

238
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,480
happening on my farm which I'll talk a

239
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,680
little bit more

240
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,880
about

241
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:28,440
um I share that because it's really

242
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:31,160
critical that we make an effort to to

243
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:35,320
comprehend our place in our Landscapes

244
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:37,639
with long-term perspective and and do

245
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:40,240
that in order to have long-term

246
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:42,120
cooperation with the ecosystems that

247
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,079
we're coopera that we're you know

248
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:47,600
depending on and interacting with and

249
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:49,560
most importantly use that long-term

250
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,320
understanding as a as a point of

251
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:54,480
foresight so we can do some long-term

252
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:58,399
planning because that's um that's where

253
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:01,079
we're going to be heading here now is um

254
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:06,279
getting into some details of of how

255
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:09,480
we'll do um the actual work of design um

256
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:13,199
so the per culture design process it can

257
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:16,399
be done in a endless variety of ways but

258
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:18,120
in its simplest you know we want to be

259
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,040
very clear about what it is that we're

260
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:24,639
trying to achieve in terms of goals

261
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,639
articulation um let's

262
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:33,360
see okay and um we'll be working on maps

263
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,720
in terms of having an actual physical

264
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,720
record that we can refer to as we make

265
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,399
observations about our Landscapes um the

266
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,160
focus of today's talk is really going to

267
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,639
be How We Do site analysis and from that

268
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,240
analysis we're going to come up with

269
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:51,639
Design Concepts which are really very

270
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,600
kind of loose ideas and I know it's hard

271
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:55,600
for many of us especially if we're

272
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,760
Market Growers and I I actually I'll

273
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:01,000
I'll take a minute just to ask um who is

274
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:04,720
Farm and if folks wouldn't mind just

275
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,360
typing into the chat box there um if

276
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,199
you're farming if you're coming here

277
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,920
with a specific uh site in mind in terms

278
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:15,600
of where you want to apply this design

279
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:20,440
process um I'd be curious to see that um

280
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:23,720
okay great yeah um so we as Growers are

281
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:28,440
often really good at thinking about

282
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:31,000
specific props or varieties and we may

283
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:35,199
have some great skills in terms of

284
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,399
rotations and soil prep um and these are

285
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:40,600
all critical you know

286
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:43,320
foundational but um per culture is kind

287
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,240
of going to flip this around a little

288
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,440
bit and that we're not going to be

289
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,920
starting necessarily from an individual

290
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,320
crop or technique but really

291
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:54,040
contextualizing that in the whole of our

292
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:57,880
farm and this is why having a design

293
00:13:54,040 --> 00:14:00,920
concept comes before detailed design in

294
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:04,040
our uh

295
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:06,680
in our design process here in that it's

296
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,440
really easy to determine exactly what

297
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,160
variety you want to grow and how far

298
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:14,759
apart it should be planted but what

299
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:17,360
we're trying to focus on is having more

300
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:20,560
importantly that these pieces are taking

301
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:23,839
place within the whole

302
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:26,600
um uh and and in better relationship to

303
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:29,360
all the other pieces of our farm so for

304
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:32,480
instance if we realize that we need uh

305
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,959
hedro or Windbreak on a farm maybe

306
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,720
before we even get into what species we

307
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:40,240
might be using in a hedro or Windbreak

308
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,480
is exactly how it's placed and how it

309
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,519
relates to some of our vegetable

310
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,600
production or grazing paddocks or

311
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:49,560
Vineyards or whatever other aspects we

312
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:55,320
may have so um this is great thanks

313
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:57,480
everyone for for chiming in with your um

314
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:00,199
this is great

315
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:02,880
so hi Kevin

316
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:05,839
okay so and then last of all of course

317
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:08,160
you know it's not just um you know the

318
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,000
designing but uh one of the most

319
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,279
important pieces is is actually doing

320
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,399
this right putting it in the ground and

321
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:16,480
then of course continuing to accept

322
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,920
feedback and recognizing that that these

323
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,720
systems are much more akin to sailing

324
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,800
ships and that we're constantly

325
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,920
adjusting the sales and our rigging

326
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,279
we're always accepting feedback and

327
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:29,959
responding to change we're responding to

328
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,759
Market we're responding to what's

329
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:34,759
working we're responding to what we're

330
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:37,240
enjoying um and it's it's a very Dynamic

331
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:38,199
process and unfortunately we're we're

332
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:44,680
never

333
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:46,759
done um okay so um goals articulation in

334
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:51,120
and of itself is something that honestly

335
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:53,519
we could do a full hour's webinar on

336
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,519
because it is so critical and and I

337
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,560
won't um spend a whole hour talking

338
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,519
about goals articulation but um I will

339
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,959
encourage enage any of you who are

340
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:07,079
planning to bring a design process to

341
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:07,959
your farm to do some very very thorough

342
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:09,800
goals

343
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:11,440
articulating um which is a little bit

344
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,440
different than goal setting right it's

345
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:17,120
it's about figuring out really what it

346
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:19,240
is that you're um that's really res

347
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,279
making your heart resonate right it's

348
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:26,399
not about kind of setting external

349
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:30,079
objectives and um on my website prospect

350
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:32,440
rock.org there is some educational

351
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:36,319
resources and in there is a document

352
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:40,920
that gives you some detailed exercises

353
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:44,240
to help you um articulate goals and

354
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:46,639
honestly even if you aren't yet farming

355
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,800
or even don't have a piece of land where

356
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:51,759
you're farming you may be even in the

357
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,800
best position to do some goals

358
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,639
articulation and as I work with clients

359
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:59,399
you know honestly a lot of times the

360
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:02,680
place I prefer to work with place at

361
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:05,839
least I have the highest Leverage is is

362
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:09,480
if folks have um some ideas but they

363
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:12,760
don't necessarily have a space yet um

364
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,640
meaning to say you know that you can do

365
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,360
a lot with any given piece of land but

366
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,000
if you know that you want to do

367
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:20,079
vegetable production or if you know you

368
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,199
want to do an apple orchard if you know

369
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:24,520
you want to be grazing animals having

370
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:27,199
those goals really clearly articulated

371
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:30,000
beforehand is really going to determine

372
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:34,080
the criteria that you use to choose

373
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,640
where you farm and um I can't I can't

374
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:40,400
understate that it's it's so important

375
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:44,440
that um that we you know

376
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:46,760
actually build these practices um if

377
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:49,559
possible you know I I recommend folks

378
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:51,799
start Market farming before they buy

379
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:54,480
land before they you know bite off a big

380
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:56,600
chunk of debt um really one of the

381
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,520
biggest pieces of course for Market

382
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,799
growing is is being strategic about

383
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:02,640
where you are relative to markets and

384
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,840
thinking about what you want to grow and

385
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,880
who's going to buy it and are you in a

386
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:09,159
position where Farm Stand makes a lot of

387
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,200
sense or whether there's a tourism

388
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:13,039
industry and there's a lot of

389
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:15,080
restaurants serving really good food so

390
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:17,159
um doing that goals articulation as soon

391
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:22,280
in the process as possible and

392
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:25,840
continuing to do it um is critical um

393
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:28,840
holistic management also offers a really

394
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:32,320
great toolkit for us in in doing some

395
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:33,919
goals articulation and um after the

396
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,159
session you may want to check in with

397
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:39,440
Jesse I'm not sure if they're still

398
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:41,480
doing a whole Farm planning course but

399
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,240
um for those of you who are in Vermont

400
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,880
there has been and I believe will be

401
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:48,320
again a uh a whole Farm planning course

402
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:50,400
which really helps Farmers through um

403
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,520
some of the business planning processes

404
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,440
and you know making sure that those

405
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:58,159
business plans really resonate with our

406
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:01,799
ourselves and our lives um here we go

407
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:04,080
thanks Jesse for the link um one one

408
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:05,520
piece of the goals articulation process

409
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:10,960
in holistic management that I want to

410
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:14,360
share here is just this idea of uh a

411
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:18,120
house and thinking of our goals really

412
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:19,960
as as a house the foundation being our

413
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:23,080
core values and our ethics those things

414
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:26,039
that we refuse to compromise on and

415
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:29,880
really being doing a lot of

416
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:32,640
introspection and thinking about

417
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:35,200
um you know why it is that you want to

418
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:38,039
farm and making sure that your daily

419
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:41,720
activities and all the work that you do

420
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:44,159
in terms of chores and and and your work

421
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:47,039
is kind of based on those ethics and

422
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:48,520
values rather than compromising them and

423
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:51,440
then one of the pieces that I think is

424
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:55,039
is really unique um is of course the

425
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:57,080
Legacy and thinking about in a

426
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,760
permaculture perspective

427
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,559
intergenerational

428
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:03,400
decision- making like

429
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:05,600
how we are leaving our farms and

430
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,200
landscapes for future generations of

431
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,159
people whether they're our own ancestors

432
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,600
or not um in the in the holistic

433
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:15,080
management

434
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:19,159
process one way of doing this is

435
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:22,360
actually writing your obituary which may

436
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:25,760
seem morbid to folks but um it's

437
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:28,720
actually can be very fun and to do this

438
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:31,880
I find just really offers such an

439
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:35,320
incredible Insight on um you know

440
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:38,600
writing down what we want to have said

441
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:40,760
after about us after we're gone and and

442
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,919
then having that as a as a written

443
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:46,520
document to refer to in our

444
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:49,919
decision-making process and

445
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:52,640
um be able to make decisions based on

446
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:55,440
that idea of Legacy like is is are this

447
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:59,240
decisions going to support that um that

448
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:04,440
Legacy that we're trying to create so

449
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:06,600
um excuse me in that vein of long-term

450
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,880
planning or or intergenerational

451
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:11,480
thinking um there's a couple other

452
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,919
things that I think you know are a part

453
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:16,320
of where permaculture design came about

454
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:19,840
in response to that are really critical

455
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:23,720
for us as our Growers and Farmers to be

456
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:26,320
considering in our farming plans um most

457
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:29,880
of you have probably heard about peak

458
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:32,640
oil and are somewhat familiar with it

459
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:35,760
I'm not going to go too in depth with it

460
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,799
but of course the reality at present is

461
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:42,159
that we're at a point in history where

462
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:45,559
we probably have the most resources

463
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:49,440
available to human beings at any time

464
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:51,120
before or after and for the whole Arc of

465
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,240
history of course you know we've we've

466
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,760
had more resources available than

467
00:21:53,240 --> 00:22:00,279
previous generations have but we're

468
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:02,080
extremely novel in the new situation of

469
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:05,080
recognizing that we have more resources

470
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:07,360
available to us than previous

471
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:11,240
generations had excuse me then future

472
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:13,360
Generations will so um that's definitely

473
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,960
something to take into consideration

474
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,360
when we're thinking about our farm plans

475
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:20,720
um not only on the annual basis but on

476
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:22,159
the five or 10e basis and really

477
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,240
recognizing that this provides an

478
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:27,520
opportunity at present for us to in

479
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,360
invest energetic resources to invest

480
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,919
fossil fuels to build some of the

481
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,360
infrastructure that we may need that may

482
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:37,600
be more difficult to build in the future

483
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:40,159
so um and this is really kind of where

484
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:43,559
my business is positioned to a degree in

485
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:45,559
that we work with folks to establish

486
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:47,760
green houses and food processing

487
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:51,200
facilities and root sellers which quite

488
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:54,440
frankly are energetically intensive and

489
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:57,200
um can be expensive but when we look at

490
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:59,760
the return on those Investments over

491
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,720
years um they're not going to get any

492
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:05,559
cheaper to build and they'll start

493
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,880
paying back the minute you build them so

494
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:10,799
um we'll look at some other examples of

495
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,559
how we might invest fossil fuels into

496
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:15,400
our

497
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:17,640
systems but um here's just uh another

498
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,880
graph of the same kind of information

499
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:22,120
that also includes Consumer Debt load

500
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:25,240
which I think is really important piece

501
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:27,520
because um when we're thinking long term

502
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:29,640
we also want to recognize that a lot of

503
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,600
our Farms are present are very dependent

504
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:35,840
on global economic systems that are

505
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:39,240
frankly outside of our control

506
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:42,320
and the the challenge that we face as we

507
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:46,320
move into the 21st century is how we

508
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:50,480
make our farms and our communities um

509
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:53,159
locally viable and really food food

510
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:57,400
producers and land managers are at the

511
00:23:53,159 --> 00:24:00,480
centerpiece of this potential for um for

512
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:02,240
resilient EOS economies for economies

513
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:07,360
that are not dependent on the whims of

514
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:09,360
the stock market or foreign exchange um

515
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,919
currency rates

516
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:15,960
so um that just sets some context as

517
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:19,240
well and then of course dealing with the

518
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:23,720
reality of climate change here we have a

519
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:26,120
graph of our 1990 USDA hardness map and

520
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,240
you know again anybody who's who wants

521
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,840
to just play with some of the

522
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:32,399
interactive technology feel free to just

523
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:36,520
you know throw your little dot on the

524
00:24:32,399 --> 00:24:41,279
map and we'll look at how this changes

525
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:45,520
from 1990 to 2006 um sorry I just wiped

526
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:49,960
away everyone's dots but um I'll go back

527
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:54,480
and do it again we're seeing a pretty

528
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:56,799
clear trend of moving hardiness zones

529
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,760
and in some areas of the country that

530
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:01,960
can mean actually cool cooler um here in

531
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:06,080
Vermont there's very very clear evidence

532
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:09,360
that we're seeing um warmer weather and

533
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:12,960
especially warmer Winters um as far as

534
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,720
the act the objective records go um that

535
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,000
has major implications for our food

536
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:20,480
systems you know when we look to the

537
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,399
forecasts of climate we see you know

538
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:27,480
this is New Hampshire but um with

539
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:29,240
aggressive reduced emissions scenarios

540
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:32,399
where you know we Implement carbon

541
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,799
sequestration and and reduce emissions

542
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:36,159
we're still looking at New Hampshire

543
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:38,600
behaving as the virginas by the end of

544
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:41,520
the century although more likely we're

545
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:44,640
looking at New Hampshire behaving as the

546
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:47,600
Carolinas um so these are all factors

547
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,720
that that we want to take into play as

548
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,600
we think about what techniques we use

549
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:55,760
what crops we use what strategies we

550
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:59,799
employ and you know I'm not trying to be

551
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:01,640
the uh the harbinger of do here but the

552
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:03,679
more closely we pay attention to climate

553
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,640
scientists really the scarier this stuff

554
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:09,799
gets right um we're seeing here this

555
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:13,600
kind of Arc of temperature and

556
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:16,039
um just notice how close we are to

557
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,559
temperatures that human beings have not

558
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:21,320
lived on the planet in and then of

559
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:25,200
course the forecast for our present

560
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:27,600
emissions um clim climactic response to

561
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,440
our present emissions so I'm not trying

562
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:33,480
to scare any one here um but I am trying

563
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:37,240
to maybe do some goals articulation for

564
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:39,480
all of us collectively in terms of the

565
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:41,799
importance of making our Farms carbon

566
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:43,440
negative of making our Farms climate

567
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:45,039
resilient

568
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,679
because

569
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:52,600
unfortunately with all of the forecasts

570
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:53,880
and models out there honestly um no

571
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:57,240
predictions are going to be that

572
00:26:53,880 --> 00:27:00,240
accurate everything's unfolding more

573
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:02,799
rapidly than was imagined and the only

574
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,919
things that we can really be certain of

575
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:07,240
are increased incidents of severe

576
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:08,559
weather we're going to see late Frost

577
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,640
we're going to see early Frost we're

578
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:12,799
going to see drought we're going to see

579
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:16,039
you know torrential downpour here in

580
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:19,440
Vermont most of you arew that we've seen

581
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:22,000
um secessions of record-breaking floods

582
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:25,080
just in the past few years and that's of

583
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,520
course a major factor for me for those

584
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:29,279
of you who are just looking at the um

585
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,159
aerial photograph farm you may have

586
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:34,600
noticed that we're right in the river

587
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:37,279
valley um also now is that chance to

588
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:39,480
invest fossil fuels to set up systems

589
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:43,080
that don't need them as constant daily

590
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:45,120
inputs in the future and um whether

591
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:49,600
that's investing in Alternative Energy

592
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:53,120
Systems or um irrigation systems that um

593
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:57,240
and and and fertility cycling systems so

594
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:59,919
that we we are not stuck with um our

595
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,640
systems being completely dependent on

596
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,679
things that are outside of our control

597
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:08,159
if if your agricultural model involves

598
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:11,960
for instance buying in a lot of grain um

599
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:14,240
you know that's fine to to to make sure

600
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:16,720
that you're you're meeting your your

601
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:19,120
bills but you may want to be making a

602
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:21,519
five or 10 year plan to start producing

603
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,320
more of your own feed or build

604
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:26,640
relationships with other local producers

605
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:29,360
that may help you in that because um

606
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,279
obviously not only the trucking but um

607
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:34,600
having brain come from very far away

608
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:39,120
just puts it in an increasingly fragile

609
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:42,240
situation um okay and and then you know

610
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:46,640
not least important is really thinking

611
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:49,000
about how our economies are vibrant in

612
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,760
local systems and really starting to

613
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,039
weave these connections among local

614
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:58,799
producers um

615
00:28:54,039 --> 00:29:01,960
because honestly Global e global economy

616
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:05,360
um are outside of our control the

617
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:07,080
forecasts don't look good but that said

618
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,399
I'm I'm not trying to look into a

619
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:12,840
crystal ball here um but what I am

620
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:15,120
saying is that we see healthy economies

621
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:17,399
happening all over and we can make an

622
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,799
intention to be a part of them more

623
00:29:17,399 --> 00:29:21,120
directly and to create these

624
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:23,880
relationships among local producers and

625
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:26,000
our local communities that really bring

626
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:28,559
real economic health economic health

627
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,440
that's based on appropriate student ship

628
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:34,279
of of of resources and regeneration of

629
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:38,840
resources as as good Farms are capable

630
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:42,000
of doing um okay and as you know we're

631
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:46,240
seeing things like the food safety

632
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:50,200
modernization act and all these other um

633
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:52,760
you know uh Staples Commodities debt

634
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:56,600
speculation all these things that are

635
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:59,880
somewhat outside of our control are um

636
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:02,559
we're we able to insulate ourselves to

637
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:06,240
them as we build real relationships with

638
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:09,080
real people on a face-to-face basis um

639
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,919
you know it's very concerning I'm sure

640
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:12,519
many of you who are Growers are paying a

641
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:14,240
lot of close attent especially smaller

642
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:18,480
Growers are paying a lot of attention to

643
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:20,960
the food safety modernization act and

644
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:24,720
all of these certification processes

645
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:26,760
even organic become less relevant when

646
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:31,880
we know our customers our customers know

647
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:34,640
who we are um and we're directly engaged

648
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:36,080
um so when when when people know who

649
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,360
they can trust they they all become

650
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,600
necessary of course and that's the

651
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:42,279
reason we're seeing the demand for these

652
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:44,880
types of laws is because when food

653
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:47,240
production is totally out of sight with

654
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:50,720
zero relationship um there's a lot of

655
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:52,720
risk um in terms of health so let's take

656
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,919
an opportunity now to build these

657
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:59,080
relationships preemptively so that we're

658
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:01,120
well positioned despite the

659
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:03,279
frankly potentially you know corporate

660
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:08,679
controlled regulation that that's

661
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:10,679
unveiled um okay so getting back to our

662
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:12,480
kind of landscape design

663
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:16,600
process

664
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:19,639
um we'll I'll just go back to our um

665
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:22,360
design process as a whole for a brief

666
00:31:19,639 --> 00:31:26,639
second if I can find the right slide

667
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:31,240
yeah sorry I I drew all over it but um

668
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:32,799
so we're doing some articulation um and

669
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:35,679
let's presume we've done some base

670
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:38,600
mapping for for most of you you know

671
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:41,120
unfurling a big piece of paper and

672
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:44,360
drawing a map of your farm by hand is

673
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:47,559
going to suffice honestly to do this at

674
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:50,799
detail with scale for the Big Ideas is

675
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:53,320
less important certainly as you get into

676
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:56,200
some of the more detailed aspects like

677
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,880
how many of a certain plant or how wide

678
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,279
certain rows are you're going to need to

679
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:03,799
work at scale but for the big picture

680
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:07,440
ideas rough and out of scale is is

681
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:08,880
better than doing it too scaled because

682
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,760
I find you know if we try to make these

683
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,760
Maps too carefully we don't have as much

684
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:15,159
fun just kind of throwing our ideas out

685
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:18,240
on paper but really the center piece of

686
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:20,480
the process is um better understanding

687
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,440
our Landscapes and that site analysis

688
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,760
and

689
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,760
assessment and

690
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,399
um we can do that through What's called

691
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,799
the scale of permanence

692
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:33,039
and the scale permanence is something

693
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:36,159
that actually is predates

694
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:39,320
permaculture but um it's a really great

695
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:42,720
tool that we have to understand our

696
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:44,799
leverage essentially so starting from

697
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:48,679
climate which

698
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:50,480
is sure globally and Society wide we're

699
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:53,240
impacting climate but on our own

700
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:56,919
individual Farms there's not much that

701
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:59,159
our decisions affect how much rain we

702
00:32:56,919 --> 00:33:01,519
get in a year how cold it gets during

703
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:03,639
the winter um you know where we are

704
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,679
relative to the equator or poles and

705
00:33:03,639 --> 00:33:07,720
we're primarily responding to that

706
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:09,519
that's not something we're designing for

707
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:12,360
whereas as we get down to the other end

708
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:14,600
of the spectrum things like how our farm

709
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:17,760
feels to people when they walk on or

710
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:21,200
what it looks like is entirely under our

711
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:23,120
control and so this spectrum is

712
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:26,880
basically from the most permanent

713
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:29,200
aspects of our landscape um down to the

714
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,559
least permanent or I should say the ones

715
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,440
that are most easily influenced by

716
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:37,320
Design so that doesn't mean so we're

717
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:39,320
designing in response to these aspects

718
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:44,039
and then increasingly we're able to

719
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:45,240
design these um along our own goals so

720
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:47,279
starting with

721
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:50,960
climate

722
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:55,000
um obviously things like average

723
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:59,120
precipitation um and rainfall are great

724
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:02,080
but we want to look not just to averages

725
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:04,840
but also to extremes and especially

726
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:07,760
recently you know averages

727
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:11,240
are great Baseline information to pay

728
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:12,800
attention to but we also want to know

729
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:14,440
what is the most rain that we've ever

730
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,240
had what is the longest drought that

731
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:18,520
we've ever had um what is the hottest

732
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:20,399
that it's ever gotten what is the

733
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:22,560
coldest that it's ever gotten and make

734
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:26,800
our Farms as resilient as possible not

735
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:28,520
just to averages but also to extremes um

736
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:32,839
and then of course as as I think I've

737
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:35,280
already um made clear we really need to

738
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:37,839
pay attention to how climate's changing

739
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:40,679
and anticipate that and as a part of our

740
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:43,919
climate analysis so here we see a more

741
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:46,639
detailed um hardiness zone map is an

742
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:49,760
updated one for Vermont and we also see

743
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:53,599
the Vermont State climate Trends um

744
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:57,880
looking over the past 50 years um which

745
00:34:53,599 --> 00:35:02,880
is showing um pretty clear warming trend

746
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:05,320
based on the numbers as well as um much

747
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:08,160
more extreme warming during winter

748
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:10,960
months um which might have some

749
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,440
advantages for us as Growers frankly but

750
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,079
also has some

751
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:17,760
disadvantages and as I mentioned earlier

752
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:21,920
the reality of these forecasts is that

753
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:25,720
the the the climate change is kind of a

754
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:28,640
um it's it's almost a misleading phrase

755
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:32,599
because it it seems to indicate gradual

756
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:34,240
unify uniform benign predictable whereas

757
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:37,800
I think this phenomenon is better

758
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:40,280
understood as as climate chaos or

759
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,720
climate collapse and I I don't mean to

760
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:44,320
say that things are hopeless but I mean

761
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:47,000
to say we really want to buffer

762
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:49,440
ourselves from floods we want to buffer

763
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,040
ourselves from winds we want to have as

764
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:54,640
much diversity as possible in our crops

765
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:56,680
and and techniques so that something's

766
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:00,160
always winning um regardless of what's

767
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:02,079
Happening you know I'm here um in

768
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:05,760
Northern Vermont in what's classically

769
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:10,160
considered a Zone 3 and we had bumper

770
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:11,920
crops crops of peaches um and as far as

771
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:15,720
I know they were the first peaches ever

772
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:18,200
grown in theor valley of Vermont and we

773
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:21,680
just happen to have the right conditions

774
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:24,599
during pollination that um we had great

775
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:27,240
fruit set and I'm not banking on having

776
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:28,280
a peach CR every year but it's pretty

777
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:31,520
exciting

778
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:33,240
and um I think you know we all have a

779
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:38,520
little room to do some

780
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:42,079
experimentation in regards to um

781
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:46,680
variables okay

782
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:49,520
um all right so landform then is kind of

783
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:54,160
our next most permanent after climate

784
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:58,079
and let's see if I can get my little

785
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:59,680
drawing thing here yes perfect so

786
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:03,480
great

787
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:05,760
um so obviously you know things like a

788
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:09,200
basic sorry

789
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,920
folks things like a basic toppo map of

790
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:14,839
course can be really really helpful

791
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:17,280
information here but really um it might

792
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:20,119
be that you just sit down and kind of

793
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,400
draw everything that has anything to do

794
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:25,839
with the land form of your farm steep

795
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:29,079
Ledges where you see Boulders or Bedrock

796
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:32,040
expressed um what's flat what's Steep

797
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:34,839
and kind of we're making these maps on I

798
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:39,680
make them on tracing paper so that I can

799
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:42,680
um I can overlay them one after another

800
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,920
um this particular topo map is from

801
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,640
Libra

802
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:51,240
maps.org

803
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:53,560
um it's the USGS topography but it's um

804
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:55,880
huge Contour intervals and honestly

805
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:59,760
doesn't tell us very much about our

806
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:03,319
Farms if you've ever had a survey done

807
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:06,000
or if there's any surveys on record with

808
00:38:03,319 --> 00:38:07,599
um uh having done a septic system or

809
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,319
anything like that these are going to be

810
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:13,119
way more detailed and in some cases it's

811
00:38:10,319 --> 00:38:15,960
totally worth paying a surveyor or

812
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:17,760
working with your you know your USDA and

813
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,119
or CS you might be able to support these

814
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,319
things depending on what practices

815
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:22,599
you're trying to do so we recently

816
00:38:21,319 --> 00:38:24,720
actually I'm sorry I wasn't able to

817
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:27,599
upload it into the slideshow but we

818
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:31,319
recently had an actual you know micro

819
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:33,200
topography made of our farm um and just

820
00:38:31,319 --> 00:38:36,760
kind of looking at these patterns of

821
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:39,839
erosion and deposition and how that

822
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:44,119
influences the big big overlays of the

823
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:48,319
way our Farms work um water of course is

824
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:50,119
an is another one um and in the case of

825
00:38:48,319 --> 00:38:52,480
my particular Farm what we're looking at

826
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:54,839
overlaid here is essentially the flood

827
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:58,920
plane and you can kind of see in the

828
00:38:54,839 --> 00:39:00,800
layout of crops um as as if you can see

829
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:04,680
in the land of crops we're kind of on

830
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:07,480
these islands in the flood plane which

831
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:09,359
is which is fortunately positioned that

832
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:12,079
way because we've had opportunity to

833
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:14,440
observe multiple hundred-year floods and

834
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:19,520
in the past few years we've seen two or

835
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:22,560
three 500e floods um

836
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:25,960
and one of the

837
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:29,800
main efforts of our farm is to be

838
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:31,440
reforesting um buffers so that our more

839
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:36,480
sensitive production some of the more

840
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:39,640
valuable crops are um protected so when

841
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:42,079
we put water and land form together we

842
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:44,079
end up with a wide variety of techniques

843
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:46,640
but um what we're looking at here is an

844
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,960
image of what's called keyline design

845
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:52,079
specifically we're looking at Mark

846
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:54,880
Shepard's Farm in Wisconsin um who's

847
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:58,040
this was farm this was a cornfield this

848
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:02,240
was Bare black dirt when he started

849
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:05,359
and um the entire layout is arranged

850
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:08,720
over very nuanced expressions of

851
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:10,880
topography and keyline design is is

852
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:15,160
again another topic that's kind of a a

853
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:17,040
whole webinar in and of itself um but

854
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:19,680
long story short what we're looking at

855
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:21,440
is managing water as it moves off our

856
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:24,079
landscape so instead of our kind of

857
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,960
conventional management which is

858
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:28,200
shunting shunting water to a drainage

859
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:30,839
ditch where it close off the farm as

860
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:33,920
quickly as possible we're spreading it

861
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:36,200
out along so basically you know the flow

862
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:39,520
of the hills in this direction and as

863
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:41,640
rainwater rolls over the farm instead of

864
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:45,160
gaining speed and momentum and carrying

865
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:47,599
soil off it is spread across the farm

866
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:49,319
and these ditches are actually not

867
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:52,520
they're not really ditches but they're

868
00:40:49,319 --> 00:40:55,880
um these um they are like kind of plow

869
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:59,720
lines that are not actually on Contour

870
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:01,760
they are slight off Contour so that

871
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:05,359
water is being better distributed

872
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:08,440
towards the dry ridges and and and

873
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:11,480
making it more even um also of course

874
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:13,880
tremendously preventing erosion also of

875
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:17,400
course instead of having all that water

876
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:19,720
fly off of our Farms when we get tons of

877
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,920
rain and then it's dry it's storing that

878
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:24,680
water in our systems and basically

879
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:27,760
working like a battery so that we're

880
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:30,560
between heavy rain and periods of dry

881
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:35,040
were way balanced in the middle so

882
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:39,680
here's here's Mark Shepard here um and

883
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:41,280
in these rows of trees he's growing Oaks

884
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,440
uh sweet Acorn Oaks he's growing

885
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:46,560
chestnuts he's growing hazelnuts he's

886
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:49,680
grazing animals he's um on rotation

887
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:52,920
doing annual vegetables um it's it's a

888
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:55,319
really great example of kind of farm

889
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:58,040
scale permaculture design so here's just

890
00:41:55,319 --> 00:42:02,079
a little bit more of what key line can

891
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:05,160
look like this is in Australia where um

892
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:07,800
you know water scarcity is a major issue

893
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:12,319
especially on pasture land and this is

894
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:14,480
key line where the key line management

895
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:18,119
is specifically diverting water into

896
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:21,160
these ponds which are then able to be

897
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:23,880
released as passive irrigation so no

898
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:26,000
pumps just entirely Gravity by holding

899
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:30,720
water as high as it's possible in the

900
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:33,720
landscape um um for for many of us um

901
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:35,280
this may not necessarily mean ponds but

902
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:38,160
it could mean something like a water

903
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:41,400
tank um in fact we just recently were

904
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:44,880
citing a livestock shelter at a farm for

905
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:47,200
some friends and decided to put the

906
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,480
livestock shelter on the highest

907
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:51,760
possible part of the landscape we put it

908
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:54,200
basically on the top of the hill and we

909
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:57,240
did that because we put a huge roof on

910
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:59,280
the livestock shelter which a made for

911
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:01,280
nice Shady space for the animals in the

912
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:03,520
summer it's open walled with the open

913
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,440
walls facing south so that it creates

914
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:08,680
this warm microclimate for the animals

915
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:13,160
during the winter months and that whole

916
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:17,119
roof area is used to fill a giant it's a

917
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:19,440
2,000-gallon water tank um which fills

918
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:22,240
almost instantly I think most of us

919
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:25,720
aren't aware of how a drain really comes

920
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:28,200
in an event you're you're going to get

921
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:30,200
um6 gallon

922
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:36,680
approximately 6

923
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:40,319
gallons per inch of rain per square foot

924
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:42,680
of roof area so you do the math on that

925
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:44,839
100 square feet which is an incredibly

926
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:48,359
small building you're going to get about

927
00:43:44,839 --> 00:43:51,200
60 gallons of water just of 100 square

928
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:53,839
feet so you put a thousand or a few

929
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:56,200
th000 gallon water tank there and in the

930
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:58,640
case of this instance we had all the

931
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:00,319
water needs for the livestock there from

932
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:03,040
the rainwater catchment without having

933
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:04,760
to run plumbing up there and then we had

934
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:07,000
because it was at the top of the hill

935
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:09,520
the ability to run a hose out of it to

936
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,359
any other parts of the Garden or pasture

937
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:15,440
completely passively without any pumps

938
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:18,119
so um there's another example of key

939
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:21,160
Line Design and then another aspect of

940
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:23,480
key line is the key line plow and this

941
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:25,960
is how these ditches can be made to

942
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:29,440
manage the water as I said and they're

943
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:31,800
also used of course to deepen top soil

944
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:34,680
and bring the organic and biologic

945
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:36,640
components of soil a little bit deeper

946
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:39,079
which is being used which with

947
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:41,520
Incredible success by a organization

948
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:44,640
known as carbon farmers and carbon

949
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:46,640
farmers are essentially quantifying to

950
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:49,800
what degree they're sequestering

951
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:52,079
atmospheric carbon in their soil simply

952
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:54,599
by deepening their top soil and of

953
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:59,640
course it makes plants more productive

954
00:44:54,599 --> 00:45:02,599
um it makes pastures healthier um and is

955
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:05,599
is it holds incredible promise for um

956
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:10,559
for sequestration of atmospheric

957
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:12,400
carbon okay so vegetation in Wildlife is

958
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:13,800
another we're we're not necessarily

959
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:17,760
going through every layer of the scale

960
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:20,240
of permanence but um I encourage you to

961
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:24,280
um you know if you come back and view

962
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:26,640
this slideshow you know you can you can

963
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:28,400
go to slides like this and also I'll

964
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:31,319
Direct toward some resources where these

965
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:33,760
things can be found online but

966
00:45:31,319 --> 00:45:35,359
essentially every single one of these

967
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,640
needs to be thought about very very

968
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:42,680
carefully and then put together and it's

969
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:45,839
a lot of fun to do um it it does take

970
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:48,599
time but it's time that's infinitely

971
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:51,240
worthwhile and as we overlay these

972
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:53,240
different things as different Maps we

973
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:55,359
find that no matter how intimately

974
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:57,400
familiar we are with our farms and

975
00:45:55,359 --> 00:46:00,480
Landscapes you'll come to new

976
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:02,079
discoveries you're going to learn um and

977
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,800
one of the reasons I like to do it with

978
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:06,520
tracing paper is of course as I overlay

979
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:10,240
different layers on top of each other

980
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:13,680
for instance microclimate on top of

981
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:15,440
vegetation and Wildlife I may find why

982
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:17,920
there's different ecological communities

983
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:20,440
on different parts of the farm um more

984
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:22,119
obviously I me come to understand why

985
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:25,559
we're seeing some of these

986
00:46:22,119 --> 00:46:28,800
differences um especially water and

987
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:30,960
access you know as we overlay those we

988
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:33,200
may learn the catchment area that's

989
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,040
really coming through a CT or something

990
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:38,720
like that and better understand why

991
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:41,640
we're seeing roads blow out um and uh

992
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:45,559
have some different opportunities for

993
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:47,559
management okay so vegetational Wildlife

994
00:46:45,559 --> 00:46:49,839
is is one of the bigger ones and one of

995
00:46:47,559 --> 00:46:52,000
the more complex ones it's one you know

996
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:54,640
you can spend a lot of time just you

997
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:59,240
know identifying the vegetation on your

998
00:46:54,640 --> 00:47:02,359
farm um you you can um look things up in

999
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:05,200
field guides which is really great one

1000
00:47:02,359 --> 00:47:07,520
um process that I really like is using

1001
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,480
field Guides of natural communities

1002
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:11,880
which are a little bit different than

1003
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:14,480
the field guides that you might use for

1004
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:17,520
say identifying an individual tree or

1005
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:20,440
shrub or wildf flower um field guides to

1006
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:23,960
Natural communities are field guides to

1007
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:27,040
the groups of plants and animals and how

1008
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:29,040
they interact which is very very help

1009
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:31,240
ful for us when we're doing um

1010
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:34,359
broadscale Farm design to understand

1011
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:38,440
exactly what ecological community that a

1012
00:47:34,359 --> 00:47:41,480
farm once was or could be in the case of

1013
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:43,760
my farm here um as we look at Islands

1014
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:46,000
like this and we look at the the the

1015
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:50,520
semblance of vegetation that was left on

1016
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:53,240
this hay field um this uh would key out

1017
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:58,119
as What's called the sugar maple ostrich

1018
00:47:53,240 --> 00:48:02,240
Fern flood plane Forest um so

1019
00:47:58,119 --> 00:48:04,920
that's um an incredibly valuable tool

1020
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:07,079
for us to use as a point of inspiration

1021
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:09,319
um on the one hand it shows me okay that

1022
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:11,200
you know we already have very valuable

1023
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:13,559
vegetation in the over story and the

1024
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:17,400
under story both sugar Maples and

1025
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:19,920
fiddleheads or ostrich F but um more

1026
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:22,720
importantly it allows me to do what we

1027
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:26,520
call ecological analoges so as we

1028
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:27,359
determine which plants we are looking in

1029
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:32,200
as

1030
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:35,160
crops um we can look for instance to the

1031
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:38,640
butternut which is juggling CA one of

1032
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:41,359
the Native nut trees to this community

1033
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:44,839
however the butternut is subject to a

1034
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:46,839
blight and they're diseased so we're

1035
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:49,960
working at hybridizing the butternut

1036
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:51,559
with the Japanese Walnut the heartnut to

1037
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:53,640
create something that's a little bit

1038
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:55,559
more valuable to us a little bit more

1039
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:57,280
resilient that said we're still planting

1040
00:48:55,559 --> 00:49:01,359
butternuts we have a lot of hope for

1041
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:03,480
them and as we go on with this

1042
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:06,559
hybridization we're finding some of the

1043
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:09,640
ones most suitable to our specific place

1044
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:12,079
um another kind of halfstep analog of

1045
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:13,640
course is the black walnut and as we're

1046
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:16,359
looking at climate

1047
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:19,280
change um we're also of course

1048
00:49:16,359 --> 00:49:21,400
anticipating uh warmer weather and

1049
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:24,960
experimenting even with the Carpathian

1050
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:27,000
Walnut which um I wouldn't necessarily

1051
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,720
recommend spending a lot of money

1052
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,520
investing in if you're if you're in

1053
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:33,400
Northern Vermont but by all means

1054
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:36,359
potentially experimenting with it's a

1055
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:39,839
it's a the carping Walnut being uh

1056
00:49:36,359 --> 00:49:41,440
typically not Hardy but the one of the

1057
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,920
more valuable in terms of Walnut

1058
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,319
production it's you know the walnuts

1059
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:46,599
that you buy in the supermarket are

1060
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:47,839
almost entirely jugin regia the

1061
00:49:46,599 --> 00:49:52,119
Carpathian

1062
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:56,960
Walnut um and the shag bark Hickory Kio

1063
00:49:52,119 --> 00:50:01,599
ovada and even karia ilanis which is our

1064
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:06,240
peacon and quote unquote you can't grow

1065
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:08,920
peons in Vermont but um my peon trees

1066
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:11,000
haven't read the books so they are doing

1067
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:14,119
fine and we'll see you know whether

1068
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:16,200
we're going to be getting uh nuts

1069
00:50:14,119 --> 00:50:17,640
ripening in our short season um we're

1070
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:20,400
not banking on them we're not planting

1071
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:22,160
them entirely but um I think I really

1072
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,319
just want to drive around in a nut

1073
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:27,280
Shaker which is one of the reasons why

1074
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:30,680
uh I'm planting so many nut trees but

1075
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:35,599
also of course because of where my farm

1076
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:37,640
is um in terms of floods so let's let's

1077
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:41,520
actually go to the kind of overall

1078
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:42,480
concept of the farm a little bit um

1079
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:45,440
which

1080
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:47,599
is you know we're you we're still doing

1081
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:50,160
some annual production we're still doing

1082
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:53,559
some tillage but all of that tillage is

1083
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:55,760
contextualized in the establishment of

1084
00:50:53,559 --> 00:50:58,200
what we're calling productive buffers

1085
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:01,839
now any buffers is good and there's some

1086
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:04,640
great um programs out there to subsidize

1087
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:07,920
and support folks reforesting along the

1088
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:10,640
River's Edge but they're pretty strictly

1089
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:13,920
um purely native plants that are not

1090
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:17,480
productive and um that's good but when

1091
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:19,079
you look at the the the the finances a

1092
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:21,720
lot of farmers of course are somewhat

1093
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:23,920
reluctant to enter these relationships

1094
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:26,000
because their crops may be much more

1095
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:28,960
valuable than their buffers but when

1096
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,559
we're looking at high value Lumber when

1097
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:35,520
we're looking at nuts fruits medicinal

1098
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:37,160
herbs Vines berries um it it may take a

1099
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:39,920
few more years but we're looking at

1100
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:43,000
things that are actually yielding more

1101
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:45,680
value in the long run than any crop

1102
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:49,720
they'd be growing in The River's Edge

1103
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:51,520
but which with with permanent Roots so

1104
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:53,520
um I'm very excited about the potential

1105
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:55,680
for reforesting agriculture but by no

1106
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:58,960
means do I mean to say that you know all

1107
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:01,200
of our Farms totally be reforested um

1108
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,920
it's always going to take shape

1109
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:04,160
completely differently based on every

1110
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:08,000
different farm and every different

1111
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:12,359
farmer goals um for our farm it is high

1112
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:14,920
value fruits nuts medicins and um and

1113
00:52:12,359 --> 00:52:16,920
Vines and berries especially

1114
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:20,000
concentrated in the areas that are prone

1115
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:23,680
to erosion um we're working with the

1116
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:26,760
Anglers Association who recognize the um

1117
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:29,000
the ability to shade the stream and

1118
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:31,880
prevent nutrients from washing into the

1119
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:35,160
river and most importantly for us as

1120
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:37,160
floods come through our farm having

1121
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:41,000
these buffers established prevents

1122
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:44,839
immediate physical damage from flopam or

1123
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:48,400
Woody debris or icebergs um which we see

1124
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:50,920
pretty regularly and also makes for

1125
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:55,000
incredible habitat so this was an

1126
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:58,240
earlier draft of our design and um we

1127
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:00,839
see here kind of a more recent one and

1128
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:04,599
this one was a map done specifically for

1129
00:53:00,839 --> 00:53:08,559
our irrigation plan but um if you look

1130
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:12,680
in the upper portion um I'm not sure if

1131
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:16,359
that's too small to be read but um you

1132
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:18,000
can see kind of our layout and how what

1133
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:21,160
I'm getting at when I'm stressing this

1134
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:23,200
idea of a design concept which is to say

1135
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:25,799
that of course it's important to plan

1136
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:27,680
your rotations and have things spaced at

1137
00:53:25,799 --> 00:53:30,760
the right distance

1138
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:34,079
but more importantly is thinking about

1139
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:36,480
the big picture of the parts of our farm

1140
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:41,640
and how they fit together as an organism

1141
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:43,799
as a whole um so and how are animals

1142
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:46,240
able to integrate with some of our other

1143
00:53:43,799 --> 00:53:48,000
production systems for instance here we

1144
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:50,480
see one of our production rows of

1145
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,599
hazelnuts um in the fall as the

1146
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:55,000
hazelnuts are ripening we fence our

1147
00:53:52,599 --> 00:53:57,760
chickens in which completely weed the

1148
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:01,200
plants fertilize the plants and prevent

1149
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:04,400
squirrel pation as well as um being kind

1150
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:07,799
of isolated in the areas of high

1151
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:10,119
activity um which really limits how much

1152
00:54:07,799 --> 00:54:15,240
squirrels are willing to risk getting

1153
00:54:10,119 --> 00:54:19,520
across the farm um which kind of leads

1154
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:23,319
me to introduce another one of our um

1155
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:25,839
design principles which is zones of use

1156
00:54:23,319 --> 00:54:27,839
um which is essentially a tool looking

1157
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:31,240
at like our daily patterns of activity

1158
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:33,400
on a farm um starting out you know in

1159
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:36,480
your bedroom when you wake up and

1160
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:39,520
thinking about how our chores unfold

1161
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:42,000
based on our normal daily activity and

1162
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:43,839
if you find yourself you know needing to

1163
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,799
cross the entire Farm to get to the

1164
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:49,920
dairy barn or the greenhouse or some of

1165
00:54:45,799 --> 00:54:53,640
these High um maintenance tasks you're

1166
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:55,720
spending a lot of time and energy that's

1167
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:58,839
not that productive and maybe you're not

1168
00:54:55,720 --> 00:55:01,440
able to move your barn or Greenhouse but

1169
00:54:58,839 --> 00:55:04,720
you can make the path from your door to

1170
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:06,559
there um where your main garden rows are

1171
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:08,359
so that as you're walking through them

1172
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:11,079
you're able to at least keep an eye on

1173
00:55:08,359 --> 00:55:13,839
things if not even pull some weed or do

1174
00:55:11,079 --> 00:55:19,359
some harvesting and really as much as

1175
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:21,880
possible lay our Farms out along the um

1176
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:23,039
the putting things which need the most

1177
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:25,839
attention in the places where they're

1178
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:28,280
going to get it um one of the reasons

1179
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:30,760
undoubted that we had such success with

1180
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:33,520
our peaches is I put my peach in a place

1181
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:35,599
where I walk by it every single day and

1182
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:39,319
I have a few trees

1183
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:41,960
and the ones that I don't see they don't

1184
00:55:39,319 --> 00:55:43,960
get watered when it's dry they don't get

1185
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:46,319
thinned whereas the one that I was

1186
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:48,319
walking by day in and day out if a bug

1187
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:51,480
was biting a peach I noticed it I picked

1188
00:55:48,319 --> 00:55:54,319
that one off um if there was a bow

1189
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:55,960
starting to eat the bark um which did

1190
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:56,920
happen to one of the ones kind of out of

1191
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,319
the way

1192
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:00,880
um I was able to respond to that

1193
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:02,119
immediately so put things that need care

1194
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,599
and attention in the places where

1195
00:56:02,119 --> 00:56:08,640
they're naturally going to get it as

1196
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:10,359
much as possible um I I I think um we

1197
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:14,319
can kind of start to summarize and I

1198
00:56:10,359 --> 00:56:15,920
might like to um uh provide an

1199
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:17,720
opportunity for any other comments or

1200
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:19,400
questions before we end but most

1201
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:22,599
importantly I just want to encourage you

1202
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:25,000
to make maps have a lot of fun kind of

1203
00:56:22,599 --> 00:56:26,799
draw out your dreams and really think

1204
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:29,280
things through you know does design can

1205
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:33,839
be intimidating but it's also an

1206
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:36,559
incredible amount of fun and you know

1207
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:38,359
it's it's iterative we're always

1208
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:40,359
learning and we're always making

1209
00:56:38,359 --> 00:56:44,119
mistakes but when we can make those

1210
00:56:40,359 --> 00:56:47,480
mistakes on paper um it saves us a lot

1211
00:56:44,119 --> 00:56:49,960
of time energy and resources um and get

1212
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:52,160
out in the landscape and you know use

1213
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:53,799
some stakes and flagging and if you're

1214
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:56,559
thinking about you know where you might

1215
00:56:53,799 --> 00:56:59,319
site your barn or Greenhouse or or one

1216
00:56:56,559 --> 00:57:02,599
of your next rows maybe flag it or stake

1217
00:56:59,319 --> 00:57:05,039
it first and walk by it for a few weeks

1218
00:57:02,599 --> 00:57:06,680
and really feel it out I'm planning on

1219
00:57:05,039 --> 00:57:09,599
building a barn at my farm right now and

1220
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:12,280
I staked the four corners and had it

1221
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:13,680
there to the point that I saw the barn

1222
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:15,720
and people would be you know walking

1223
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:19,640
across this open area of grass and I was

1224
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:21,640
like oh you're standing in my barn and

1225
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:24,760
what happened one day I pulled in with a

1226
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:26,200
trailer behind my truck and I couldn't

1227
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:28,480
make the turn without clipping the

1228
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:29,960
corner of the barn however fortunately

1229
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:31,640
the corner of the barn was simply a

1230
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:33,839
wooden stake that hadn't been

1231
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:35,960
constructed yet and I was able to kind

1232
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:37,640
of accept that feedback and learn that

1233
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:39,599
the this position of the bar needed to

1234
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:43,160
move if I wanted to continue to access

1235
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:45,920
that one route with truck and trailer um

1236
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:48,000
so as we we close on these images here I

1237
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:51,359
just want to share the aogi farm which

1238
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:54,760
is in Putney Vermont um really

1239
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:56,680
absolutely inspiring Pioneers in growing

1240
00:57:54,760 --> 00:58:01,520
rice um

1241
00:57:56,680 --> 00:58:04,319
in Vermont and the uh Mr rogi's you know

1242
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:06,520
a Japanese born American who reads

1243
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:08,599
Japanese and has been reading all the

1244
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:09,799
research that has happened in the past

1245
00:58:08,599 --> 00:58:13,119
few years to

1246
00:58:09,799 --> 00:58:15,720
bring uh rice to the northern islands of

1247
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:17,640
Japan and these are areas of their farm

1248
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:20,559
that would have otherwise been

1249
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:22,880
considered unproductive kind of spongy

1250
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:25,079
Fields this is you know what they look

1251
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:26,599
like in the early season turned into

1252
00:58:25,079 --> 00:58:28,839
some of the most beautiful productive

1253
00:58:26,599 --> 00:58:30,880
and profitable areas of their farm so

1254
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:32,359
the more we can kind of think through

1255
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:35,960
how problems might be made into

1256
00:58:32,359 --> 00:58:39,359
Solutions and how all these pieces

1257
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:41,920
integrate and reciprocate to to feed off

1258
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:43,359
of each other um the the more resilient

1259
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:48,440
our Farms

1260
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:50,520
become so anyway um we're nearly closing

1261
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:53,960
if there are any last comments or

1262
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:56,400
questions feel free to um throw them in

1263
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:58,319
the box there I'm sorry we only had an

1264
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,799
hour obviously it's kind of a teaser

1265
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:03,079
there's a lot of

1266
00:58:59,799 --> 00:59:05,799
information um to try to fit but I hope

1267
00:59:03,079 --> 00:59:09,079
you found it worthwhile and um stay

1268
00:59:05,799 --> 00:59:13,160
tuned to the UVM extension webinars next

1269
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:16,359
week is going to be uh uh one on Shake

1270
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:18,520
mushrooms which I'm excited about and um

1271
00:59:16,359 --> 00:59:20,440
here Jesse shares our our link for

1272
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:23,160
feedback

1273
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:26,359

01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:12,720
with us um and and uh we really

1279
01:00:11,319 --> 01:00:15,880
appreciate all the information you

1280
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:17,880
shared um Tina Barney had a question hi

1281
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:20,119
Tina uh she said do current use

1282
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:23,200
reviewers recognize permaculture

1283
01:00:20,119 --> 01:00:24,640
principles as valid and supported and

1284
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:26,680
for those of you outside of Vermont

1285
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:29,760
current use is a

1286
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:32,880
regulation that uh values property at an

1287
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:34,559
agriculture um for agriculture use and

1288
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:37,079
has tax implications keth do you have

1289
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:41,000
any experience with that um yeah thanks

1290
01:00:37,079 --> 01:00:44,920
so current use definitely values having

1291
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:48,240
uh design on paper um um so they you

1292
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:50,160
know they've definitely it it depends

1293
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:54,480
which is really kind of the answer to

1294
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:56,720
all regulatory questions right but um if

1295
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:58,319
you have a working plan

1296
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:00,160
um you definitely need to be producing

1297
01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:04,760
something whether it's you know whether

1298
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:09,280
it's pasture hay apples berries um even

1299
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:11,400
Timber but um the better recorded you

1300
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:13,680
have that and and the better documented

1301
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:16,079
you have any planning or planting or

1302
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:19,520
implementation um the easier it's going

1303
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:19,520
to be to to get current

1304
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:28,880
use great um and uh Mike Gibson asks um

1305
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:31,400
about young nut trees and looking for a

1306
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:33,880
good place to purchase them um and also

1307
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:36,119
do you grow yours from cuting or do you

1308
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:38,000
purchase your trees yeah great so we

1309
01:01:36,119 --> 01:01:40,480
have a nursery mic that's become one of

1310
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:43,920
the biggest growing parts of our farm is

1311
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:47,359
selling young trees um particularly the

1312
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:49,559
Hazels where um we are now at the point

1313
01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:51,160

1314
01:01:49,559 --> 01:01:53,559
that we're you know we're planting our

1315
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:56,599
seed out um from our own trees that

1316
01:01:53,559 --> 01:01:59,640

1317
01:01:56,599 --> 01:02:01,680

it's um it's a really exciting crop for

1330
01:02:30,279 --> 01:02:35,480
for for me and for us um it does take a

1331
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:37,200
little bit time to get established but

1332
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:39,400
but we've started you know really

1333
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:41,119
carefully running the numbers and the

1334
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:46,440
return on investment after a few years

1335
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:46,440
is is um is better than than most

1336
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:52,079
things great Keith thanks and I know

1337
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:55,200
that some work has been done on uh

1338
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:57,520
permaculture and looking doing Financial

1339
01:02:55,200 --> 01:03:00,359
um projection for permaculture based

1340
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:04,079
Farms um can you let people know about

1341
01:03:00,359 --> 01:03:05,839
that that resource um uh because I I

1342
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:08,559
know that for Farmers a lot of them want

1343
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:10,119
to be able to uh look at Financial

1344
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:11,359
projections and better understand how

1345
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:14,520
these things are going to contribute to

1346
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:18,400
their bottom line yeah it's pretty nent

1347
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:20,520
but um there is you know some growing
