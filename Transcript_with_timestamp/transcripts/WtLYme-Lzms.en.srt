1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
all right thank you

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,279
um for the opportunity to speak to you

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,540
today so I'm going to talk for a few

4
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,720
minutes about

5
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,219
weed management and strawberries

6
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:14,280
and

7
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:16,400
just to put a few kind of qualifiers on

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,619
here I'm going to summarize what we do

9
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,000
in Florida first for weed management so

10
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:24,180
that means everything that I'm talking

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,980
about is in regards to plastic culture

12
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,099
production although a lot of the

13
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,000
techniques do go beyond that

14
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:31,740
um

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,660
I'm going to kind of frame this around

16
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,280
an integratedly matched program because

17
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,020
one thing we have found is that no

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,579
single tool will solve the problem but

19
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,780
you've got to integrate a bunch of them

20
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:42,600
so I'm going to spend a little bit more

21
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,680
time on some components of this than

22
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,860
others

23
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,480
but uh we're going to highlight some of

24
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,340
the things we found the last few years

25
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,079
but also highlight kind of the standard

26
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,480
practices here in Florida

27
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,579
so to start with we're going to start

28
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,160
with fumigation the vast majority of

29
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:01,860
strawberries in Florida are fumigated we

30
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,300
do have around anywhere from six to

31
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,040
eight hundred acres of organic

32
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,540
strawberries

33
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,920
um in the county where I'm at which is

34
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,080
Hillsborough County

35
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,060
and that kind of varies depend from year

36
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,520
to year depending on the market

37
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,799
but as far as fumigation goes we just

38
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,080
completed a management survey a short

39
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,540
while ago

40
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,479
and the most common fumigant in Florida

41
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:27,240
when strawberries is pickle or 60.

42
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,159
and as commonly thought of for control

43
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,020
of pathogens and nematodes it does

44
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,340
provide some weed control as well which

45
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,939
I'll talk about a little bit in a minute

46
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:38,100
telephone c35 used to be the most common

47
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:39,659
fumigant but it's no longer as common as

48
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,220
5460

49
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,920
and then there are a few Growers that

50
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:46,619
use k-pam or vapeam as well which its

51
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,540
strong point is weed control

52
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:50,759
the

53
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,220
one of the reasons that we use these

54
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,740
combinations of tone and chloropicarine

55
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,119
is because of the fact in terms of weed

56
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,619
control they're much more effective when

57
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,720
combined now these pictures I'm going to

58
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,520
show you the next couple pictures are in

59
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,100
tomatoes but you see the same Trend in

60
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,439
strawberries so the pitcher on the left

61
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,360
is your non-treated

62
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,360
and you can see nut sedge coming through

63
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,220
the plastic here if you add 50 pounds of

64
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,739
chloropicrin it depends a pick you

65
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,480
actually make the problem worse and

66
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:21,060
that's because low levels of pick will

67
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,980
stimulate not such sprouting if you get

68
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,900
up around 200 pounds of pick well then

69
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,700
you've certainly reduced the population

70
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,680
compared to a non-treated but you don't

71
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,560
get great control

72
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,599
if you look at same picture on the left

73
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,920
as untreated the middle that's still 50

74
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,720
pounds a pick but the picture on the

75
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,120
right now this is 15 gallons per acre

76
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,340
one 3D it essentially doesn't have any

77
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,920
effect on that side's control

78
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,660
on its own but this is where you really

79
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,940
see the difference once you combine the

80
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:50,099
pick in the one 3D you see a really

81
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:52,980
clean bed and it's that combination of

82
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:54,599
products that gives optimizes weed

83
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,660
control and we see that consistently

84
00:02:54,599 --> 00:03:00,120
across all crops and

85
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,260
um the that combination improves control

86
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,260
now

87
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,940
here is a key point though is this

88
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,319
really weather dependent so those

89
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,360
pictures that I'm showing you where we

90
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:12,060
get really good control of nutsedge

91
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,739
those are fumigated in January in

92
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,800
Florida so that's when the soil is a bit

93
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:19,860
cooler if you look at this picture on

94
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,200
the left is Pickler 60 on the right is

95
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,780
non-fumigated almost no difference those

96
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:27,420
are fumigated in it's a lie when it's

97
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,459
really hot so we for weed control when

98
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,400
it comes to fumigation

99
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:34,560
you have to take into account whether

100
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,000
cooler slightly cooler soils are going

101
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,560
to give you better weed control just

102
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,360
because the fuming it moves through the

103
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,459
soil more slowly

104
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,560
we've done a lot of long-term fumigation

105
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:44,640
trials the last few years and I'm not

106
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,500
going to spend a lot of time on this

107
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,900
because communication is not kind of

108
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,700
where I want to spend all the time but I

109
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,900
do want to point out this picture to

110
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,640
give an example on the left is

111
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,680
non-fumigated on the right is Pickler

112
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,799
60.

113
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,239
and again on the left is not fumigated

114
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,120
on the right it's the Florida three-way

115
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,920
what we call the Florida three-way is a

116
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,819
combination so indicate in this case

117
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:10,560
Pickler 60 plus k-pam on the top and

118
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:13,140
early in the season you don't see a lot

119
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,819
of a lot of difference but when you move

120
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,380
through

121
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:18,000
um late in the season you see where we

122
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:20,519
didn't fumigate we just got hammered

123
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,840
with disease Pickler 60 did fairly well

124
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,040
but there's a lot of variability in

125
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,600
those plants

126
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,720
if you look at this three-way a picture

127
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,979
on the right you see consistency just to

128
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,960
show you another picture of how extreme

129
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:33,360
this can be we don't use Paladin anymore

130
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,880
but this still shows the difference of

131
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,320
the Florida three-way versus not the

132
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,759
bottom left-hand pitcher that's power

133
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,440
and pick 21 you can see all those

134
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:41,520
grasses and broadleaf weeds growing in

135
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,040
there

136
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,259
this is the same field here we have

137
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,780
Paladin plus k-pam and you can see how

138
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:50,639
much cleaner it is so consistently if we

139
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:53,220
have a problem field that's going to be

140
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,139
fumigated that has a lot of weeds the

141
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,360
Florida three-way or what Georgia they

142
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:59,520
call it the Georgia three-way that

143
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,139
combination gives you the best control

144
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,419
and in our studies it actually gives you

145
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:05,580
the best economic return as well

146
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:08,100
so real quick

147
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,540
use combinations if you fumigate

148
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,100
cooler temperatures are going to give

149
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,960
you better weed control

150
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,280
with four or three ways the best in

151
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,740
terms of weed control as well as

152
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,960
economic return and it's the best in

153
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,940
terms of broadleaf and Brass control as

154
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,479
well

155
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:26,240
when it comes to herbicides so

156
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,259
I'm going to talk about some

157
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,880
pre-herbicized pre-emergent server size

158
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:32,759
the ones that you apply before the weeds

159
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,259
are up so in our in Florida we're going

160
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:37,040
to talk about herbicides that go

161
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:38,220
underneath the plastic mulch so

162
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,780
[Music]

163
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,340
you can have this equipment you can see

164
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,139
here which is a bed press which has

165
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,699
nozzles on the back which can spray the

166
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:46,500
herbicide directly on the bed

167
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:49,320
immediately before we lay the plastic

168
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,880
this is not a real common practice in

169
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,740
Florida not a lot of people are using

170
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,360
herbicides under the plastic

171
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,940
it does occur

172
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:01,020
especially in fields where there are

173
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:03,680
problems with broadleaf grass weeds

174
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:06,600
here is a summary of the most common

175
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,460
herbicides used in Florida historically

176
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,280
the recommendation was a combination of

177
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:12,479
gold and Evernote uh we've moved away

178
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,280
from that

179
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,680
Chateau is now the most common

180
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,419
recommendation and there's a few reasons

181
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,860
for that if you look down this is just a

182
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:21,660
few wheat species that we have in

183
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:24,000
Florida strawberries

184
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,680
and black medic and Carolina geranium

185
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,360
are two common ones you see Chateau

186
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,880
provides some suppression of those two

187
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,560
species where's the other two products

188
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,780
do not

189
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:37,020
um generally speaking Chateau persists a

190
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:38,940
little longer and provides really good

191
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,259
excellent weed control of most species a

192
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,539
little bit better than gold although

193
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:44,580
gold was also a very good product

194
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:46,259
you might be wondering why historically

195
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,360
would they have mixed gold and ever and

196
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:50,520
all well that's simple this next chart

197
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:54,240
shows it devinol is much better on

198
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:56,160
grasses than Chateau orgoal so that Gold

199
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,360
Plus Denver and all mix gave you a

200
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,840
better

201
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,220
um overall we control however Chateau is

202
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,919
pretty decent better than gold on

203
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:06,660
grasses and the last pricing I did which

204
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:09,720
was admittedly a little over a year ago

205
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:13,139
but it was so prices changed a lot but

206
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:15,479
at the time Chateau was at around twenty

207
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:18,000
dollars per acre a gold devron all mix

208
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:20,160
costs around 120 dollars per acre so a

209
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,620
big difference in cost which is why

210
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,599
we've kind of moved away from that mix

211
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,000
and settled on Chateau is the best

212
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:28,800
option

213
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,599
unfortunately neither one of the none of

214
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,539
these products work on nutsedge there

215
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:37,500
are no effective herbicides registered

216
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:40,380
for nutsedge control and strawberry

217
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,759
just a real quick blurb on flumioxism

218
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:44,039
which is the active ingredient in

219
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,680
chateau

220
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:50,400
um this chart right here we did this

221
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:52,740
trial a short time ago looking at the

222
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,539
red labeled rates which is 1x all the

223
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,340
way up to ridiculously high rates

224
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:58,080
something that you would never use we

225
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:00,360
were just trying to highlight

226
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,819
um what rate would you have to use to

227
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,099
see damage and we did this across a lot

228
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:07,020
of different sites and you can see I'm

229
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:09,780
pointing at these dots where the One X

230
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:12,000
rate which is three ounces per acre two

231
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:14,460
x-rayed or the 4X rate this is

232
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,139
essentially no damage you have to go all

233
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,819
the way up to eight times the label rate

234
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:20,819
to cause damage and Chateau so it's

235
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:23,460
extremely safe if you do get damaged

236
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:25,860
this is what it looks like Chateau if

237
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:27,479
you get it on the bed and it comes up

238
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,460
through the roots you can see the

239
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:31,319
Browning on the veins that's what

240
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:33,240
Chateau will do it'll burn the veins up

241
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:36,539
and of course that leaf will die

242
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:40,020
if you have real high rates on the plant

243
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:42,839
is not likely going to recover

244
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:45,480
this graph is Chateau persistence over

245
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:46,560
the season and I know it goes up a

246
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,839
little bit here but it's just kind of a

247
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,880
little bit of accumulation effect but

248
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:52,560
basically the reason we like Chateau is

249
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,440
because the fact it persists throughout

250
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:58,140
our season so it's a really good product

251
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,000
just a couple of things

252
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:02,519
um strawberries are extremely tolerant

253
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,560
of Chateau you can apply it don't of

254
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:07,080
course but you we went up to four times

255
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,240
the label right without any damage it

256
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,620
persists for the whole season that's a

257
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,300
good thing unless you're going to use

258
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:15,180
that plastic for a second crop then

259
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,800
that's could be a problem for you

260
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,420
um I have gone to a few Fields over the

261
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,060
last few years where we

262
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:23,220
um saw some Chateau damage and the three

263
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:25,200
bullet points in the bottom here these

264
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,839
are the three reasons we've seen damage

265
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,640
number one inadequate agitation in the

266
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,339
tank so Chateau right now is a granular

267
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,540
although that formulation is changing

268
00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:35,459
and there's been cases where people

269
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:37,200
didn't agitate it the elves and you

270
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:39,660
release a clump of herbicide in the

271
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,300
middle of the field and you get a you

272
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:44,160
know a spot where you get some damage

273
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,080
you have an inexperienced driver who

274
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,820
slows down near the end of the roads and

275
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,120
you get really high rates near the end

276
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,860
of the row that can happen or Chateau is

277
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,380
supposed to be put on the top of the bed

278
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,820
right before you lay the plastic there's

279
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,500
been a few people sprayed on the flat

280
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,620
and pull that bed up and you end up with

281
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:03,959
a concentrated lines of herbicide right

282
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:06,620
where the plants are and that also can

283
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:09,480
cause damage

284
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:11,760
now most of the herbicides that are used

285
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,959
in strawberries are used in the Raw

286
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,519
Metals

287
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,740
um and that's

288
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:18,540
pretty well every single grower does

289
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,339
apply herbicides in their own Metals in

290
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:22,920
Florida except for the organic Growers

291
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:24,800
which tend to rely on cultivation

292
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:27,300
we've done a lot of trials in different

293
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,860
crops looking at which herbicides are

294
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,200
the most effective

295
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:33,440
and this is just a table showing two

296
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,580
different seasons and this was weed

297
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,339
density in the row middle and you can

298
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:41,640
see Chateau consistently dropped weed

299
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:44,700
death density significantly dual Chateau

300
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:46,680
and dual and gold did fairly well but

301
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,640
not really any any better than Chateau

302
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,560
alone

303
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,120
I mentioned dual because it's recently

304
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,399
been registered in strawberries in

305
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,660
Florida I don't believe it's registered

306
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:57,240
in Alabama

307
00:10:54,660 --> 00:11:01,440
but I'll just we can use it in their own

308
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,279
middle I'm not 100 sure of it in Alabama

309
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,140
um

310
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:05,700
this is an example of a role model this

311
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,980
is again this particular one was in

312
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:11,519
tomatoes but you can see non-treated

313
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:13,440
versus Chateau application we had your

314
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,940
maximum exterior to burn down what was

315
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,860
green and a big difference so really

316
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:19,800
really good

317
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:21,959
um control this

318
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,420
um this is just a summary of the most

319
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:28,320
effective options and the most common

320
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:30,300
used ones in Florida so a lot of Growers

321
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,880
will before transplant will use a

322
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,899
combination of aim and Chateau to burn

323
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,120
down what's there and to give them

324
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:37,440
residual control or from Oxon and

325
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,260
chateau

326
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,360
fuel use gold and gramoxone and there

327
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:44,040
are a few that use glyphosate after

328
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:47,519
transplant there are a lot of Growers

329
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:50,640
that use glyphosate or gramoxone placato

330
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,800
mix that can be sprayed up to fruit set

331
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:55,980
but not after just a couple of things

332
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,260
warning with Chateau if you spray it in

333
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,540
Raw Metals it does persist a long time

334
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:03,000
that's its strength

335
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:04,740
um but you can there's a risk of if you

336
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,540
have a sandy soil like we do in Florida

337
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,220
and you get a lot of wind or you can

338
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,779
actually have particles of sand blow up

339
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,160
from the fruit if you wait too long to

340
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:13,440
apply that application you get little

341
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,760
burn marks so something you don't want

342
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,680
to go too close to when you think you're

343
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:21,480
going to be picking

344
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:23,040
with glyphosate really common problem is

345
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,600
um this yellowing this is a little bit

346
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,940
of drift when they were spraying it this

347
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:29,100
is very typical of glyphosate Roundup

348
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,320
damage and strawberries where you see

349
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,240
the growing points and even the buds

350
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,399
down here all kind of Turn of a yellie

351
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,079
twin yellowy twins so you need to be

352
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:40,079
careful if you're using glyphosate after

353
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:43,880
transplant careful to do everything you

354
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,880
can to minimize drift

355
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,079
um I'm going to mention this particular

356
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:51,959
species because we historically did not

357
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:54,120
have ragweek parthenium in our

358
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:56,700
strawberries it started down south of

359
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,500
Florida it has since moved rapidly

360
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:01,200
northward

361
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:03,360
um now I pretty much see it in all of

362
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,060
our Strawberry Fields a lot of people

363
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,579
mix it up with common ragweed

364
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:10,800
and really easy to tell them apart if

365
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:12,779
you look at this picture ragged

366
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,399
parthenium has white veins which common

367
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:16,740
Ragweed does not

368
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,540
and common Ragweed if you look at the

369
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:21,120
top that's common or agree a little bit

370
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:23,339
more finely divided leaf of course the

371
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,459
dead giveaway is these small white

372
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:28,620
flowers look like little puff clouds

373
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:31,139
um and then you have

374
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:34,500
um also the vein as he's really uh sorry

375
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:37,139
the stem is these really prominent veins

376
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,700
so why why we're concerned about Ragweed

377
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:41,639
parthenium and why I'm mentioning it

378
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:44,399
today is we've seen consistently it's

379
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:46,260
moving rapidly northward and this is

380
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,060
what it looks like just a couple of days

381
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:50,399
ago in some Fields what they had

382
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:52,139
terminated with herbicides and you can

383
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,000
see the ragley parthenium is happily

384
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:56,160
still growing it's very tolerant of

385
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,980
glyphosate and very tolerant of

386
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,600
gramoxone so it will happily grow and if

387
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,440
you don't control those few that are

388
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,440
left

389
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,560
this is a pepper fuel just south of me

390
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:10,260
and you can see these white lines that

391
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:12,540
is it filling the row middles between

392
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:14,459
these rows of peppers and it's very

393
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:17,399
difficult to manage

394
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:19,079
and strawberries you only have two

395
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:22,560
options at the moment

396
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:24,120
one is Chateau again this is the number

397
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,440
of weeds per pot so we're looking at the

398
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,720
effects of these herbicides on

399
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,579
controlling pre-emerge so putting it

400
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,060
down before the weed comes up

401
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:34,740
and this NTC is a non-treated control

402
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:36,600
and then you see three and six ounces of

403
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,920
Chateau give really good control they

404
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,560
won't control the hundred percent but

405
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:43,260
they do certainly reduce the density

406
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,480
after that the only options is hand

407
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:48,779
pulling hauling or cultivation there are

408
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:51,060
no herbicides that can be used within a

409
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:52,620
strawberry crop to control the species

410
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,579
we do have some products that are

411
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:56,519
working

412
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:58,620
and we have spent some time

413
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:00,839
um working on getting a label for those

414
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:02,060
strawberries and that will be a national

415
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:04,380
label

416
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:06,000
once we make a little bit more progress

417
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:08,279
so something to consider with this

418
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,040
species if you do see it in Strawberry

419
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:13,079
Fields it tends to start on the edges on

420
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,740
the field edges

421
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:18,779
um you need to make sure you remove it

422
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:20,940
now in Florida we usually terminate all

423
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:23,220
strawberries at some point either with a

424
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:25,920
herbicide or with a fumigant herbicide

425
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:29,519
of course being the most common

426
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:32,339
um approach and Cape ham or vapeam being

427
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,079
the ones that are used the most often so

428
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:36,839
this is just a series of pictures where

429
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:39,300
we looked at different rates of in this

430
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:40,560
case it's k-pam vapeam basically you get

431
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:43,380
the same data

432
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,060
and looking at how much it takes to kill

433
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:48,060
strawberries this is at the end of the

434
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:49,980
season you want to inject k-pam and the

435
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,480
advantage of doing this is that you not

436
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:54,480
only terminate strawberries but you kill

437
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:57,899
the weeds and you also kill seeds in the

438
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:02,220
soil and pathogens and nematodes

439
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:05,040
so at 10 gallons per acre you can see

440
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:06,779
well this red box that

441
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,240
perfectly good

442
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:11,100
um strawberry control at a very low rate

443
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,620
of 10 gallons per acre so if you have a

444
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,180
nice clean field and not really any pest

445
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,560
pressure and you just want to terminate

446
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,940
your crop this could be an option

447
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,620
although it's going to be more expensive

448
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,959
than herbicides

449
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,339
however if you go to a part of your

450
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:25,740
field where you have a lot of nutsed

451
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:27,480
which is the case in this picture and

452
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:29,820
I'm just using that stage because you

453
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,880
can visually see the difference

454
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:34,320
at 10 gallons per acre you still have a

455
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,060
lot of green weeds growing because you

456
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,860
don't there's not as much spread and

457
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:39,660
there just isn't as you get control in

458
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,860
the center this is with one drip tape

459
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:43,800
but you're not getting control in the

460
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:44,820
bed edges if you up it to 40 gallons per

461
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,500
acre

462
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:50,519
they're still a little bit of green but

463
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:53,040
you get much much better control and

464
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:54,959
um overall we control which means it's

465
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,759
gonna if it will kill nutsedge on the

466
00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:00,620
edges as killing other pests that also

467
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:00,620
occur on the bed edges

468
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:05,220
um we use this type of technique if we

469
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,839
have issues with these diseases like

470
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:09,059
charcoal rotten strawberry this can be

471
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:11,059
an effective way to minimize

472
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:11,059
um

473
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:16,679
chance of infection the following year

474
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:18,959
we've done a lot of studies looking at

475
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:21,419
rates

476
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,819
so you can see this is a non-treated and

477
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:26,280
Petri dishes these black dots this is

478
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:27,240
actually macro firmina growing and petri

479
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,340
dish

480
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,960
at 10 gallons per acre you drop it in

481
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:34,140
the center but the sides still pretty

482
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,840
bad 20 gallons per acre similar story 30

483
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:38,880
gallons per acre this yellow is not

484
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:41,400
um macro firmina this is a different

485
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,780
organism that's not of concern but

486
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,900
you're still not reaching the side at 40

487
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:48,780
gallons per acre you start to get much

488
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:51,179
better control so crop termination with

489
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:53,280
vapam helps with diseases but it also

490
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:55,080
helps with weeds so for example the most

491
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,760
commonly we have in strawberries in

492
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,580
Florida is goose grass

493
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:03,120
and if you look at this chart here this

494
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:05,760
is the dose of metam potassium or kpam

495
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,740
this is percent control and you can see

496
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,660
and this is control not of the plants

497
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:11,580
this is control of the seeds and this is

498
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:14,280
what's really important is you can get

499
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:15,539
significant kill of a seed bank with a

500
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:19,260
good application

501
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:21,240
of something like K Camp and this rate

502
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:23,580
right about here would be equivalent to

503
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,200
40 gallons per acre which means that

504
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:28,260
around 40 gallons per acre you're going

505
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,940
to get decent control of seeds uh common

506
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,440
personal in another weed that we have a

507
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,960
lot of this would be a very similar

508
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,940
Trend you can see decent control of the

509
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,740
application of kpam

510
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:39,539
so

511
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,039
summary 10 gallons per acre will

512
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:42,840
adequately terminate a strawberry crop

513
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,940
but you need much higher rates right

514
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:47,039
around 40 gallons per acre acre if you

515
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:49,440
want to optimize weed control and

516
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:51,860
control of a lot of pathogens like macro

517
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,860
firmina

518
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,360
I do want to mention a follow program so

519
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:58,740
our season of course is a little

520
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,500
different than yours but generally

521
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:05,880
speaking we are fumigating and putting

522
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:09,000
beds in in August we plant in September

523
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:11,100
and we're harvesting through till March

524
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,280
or April depending on markets and things

525
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:16,740
like that that means we have a file a

526
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:18,900
program in from April all the way

527
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,740
through to the following June

528
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,900
um

529
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:25,080
all right April May and June sometimes

530
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:26,880
in July and then perhaps part of August

531
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,140
so several months there where we have

532
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,780
bare ground

533
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:32,460
a little over 80 percent somewhere

534
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:35,580
around 85 percent of the strawberry

535
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:37,440
acreage is cover crop every year

536
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:39,059
um there's a lot of important reasons

537
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,799
for us to do that that's our wettest

538
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:43,200
time of the year so cover crops help

539
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:45,600
with things like erosion

540
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,280
um and helping improve a water uptake

541
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:51,539
for our aquifers

542
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,740
but cover crops also do inhibit weeds

543
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:56,460
you can see this picture on the right

544
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:59,280
hand side taken underneath the canopy

545
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:01,200
um see hardly almost no weed seeds

546
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,059
germinating there so a good cover crop

547
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,039
inhibits wheat growth and suppresses

548
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:07,679
weed seed production

549
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,059
and can emphasize the importance of you

550
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,880
know there's all kinds of reasons to

551
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:14,900
cover crop for soil structure for soil

552
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:17,820
Health but just in terms of weed control

553
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:19,500
you can really reduce

554
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,820
um weed growth and prevent seed

555
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:24,120
production

556
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:25,860
with a properly managed cover crop now

557
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,720
that's true for broadleaf weeds and it's

558
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:29,580
true for grass seeds and actually in

559
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,260
some of our long-term trials the

560
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:33,000
presence or absence of a good follow-up

561
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:35,940
program whether that's cover crops or

562
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,100
herbicides was more important than

563
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,360
deciding which fumigate to use that just

564
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,940
kind of gives you an idea of how

565
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,799
important a good fellow program is that

566
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:46,440
decision of what to grow when you didn't

567
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:48,179
have strawberries there had a much

568
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:51,299
greater effect on what the number of

569
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:53,580
weeks than even what fumigating selected

570
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:56,400
when it comes to nutsedge management

571
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:58,020
cover crops are not a good option and

572
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,760
the reason for that is not such will

573
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:01,620
happily grow underneath the canopy of

574
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,780
even the most dense cover crops this is

575
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:05,820
a picture of sun hemp even under Sun

576
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:09,120
hemp which can form an incredibly thick

577
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:10,799
canopy uh cover um and that said you'll

578
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,840
continue to happily grow

579
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,580
now it won't produce as many tubers so

580
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,799
you do prevent your populations from

581
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:19,200
getting bigger which is good

582
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,640
but you don't reduce the population so

583
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,720
if you have a field with a nut such

584
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,900
problem

585
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:27,299
you're much better off to use something

586
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,799
like cultivation and glyphosate

587
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:30,720
combinations

588
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,880
so basically what you want to do is you

589
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,860
want to allow the nuts Edge to grow you

590
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,919
want to spray

591
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:40,620
um glyphosate when you have not said

592
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:43,140
about I don't know seven inches tall if

593
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:46,200
certainly before it flowers then you

594
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:48,000
want to cultivate to stimulate more

595
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,880
um sprouting and then spray again doing

596
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,600
that a couple times will optimize your

597
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,600
not such control

598
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,260
so that kind of gives you a summary of

599
00:21:55,860 --> 00:22:00,659
the overall

600
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:03,419
um approach to lead control there's one

601
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:06,059
other thing I want to cover here shortly

602
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:09,299
but again I want to emphasize the one

603
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:11,760
thing that we have know for certain is

604
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:13,980
that effective we control over long term

605
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:17,159
is you've got to integrate more than one

606
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:19,559
tool at a time and

607
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:21,299
one of the reasons that we don't have as

608
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:24,240
many issues with herbicide resistance

609
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:25,860
for example in many specialty crops like

610
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,500
strawberries is because we have

611
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:30,059
historically used very integrated weed

612
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,860
Management Programs so you want to

613
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:33,600
continue to make sure

614
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:36,419
that you do that

615
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,919
we've um last few years we've been doing

616
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:40,980
something kind of fun I'm just going to

617
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:43,620
mention this quickly uh here in Florida

618
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:46,559
we do this practice of relay cropping

619
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:48,960
where we plant a second crop into our

620
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,580
strawberries so

621
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,840
um in this case you can see eggplants

622
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,700
growing in strawberries what would

623
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,080
happen is somewhere around January which

624
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,780
is when we're

625
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:59,580
full out harvesting strawberries

626
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:03,840
they will come through and they'll plant

627
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:05,400
eggplants cantaloupes or peppers in down

628
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,860
the center of the bed so we grow two

629
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,480
rows of strawberries in one bed with one

630
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:13,140
drip tape down the center so they'll

631
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:15,840
plant a second crop right down the

632
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:18,720
center along the side of that drip tape

633
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,220
and then when it comes near the end of

634
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,840
the strawberry season the standard

635
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:24,419
practice right now would be to remove

636
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,159
those strawberries by hand and allow

637
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:28,740
that second crop to grow

638
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,780
so the advantage and the reason they do

639
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,280
relay cropping versus terminating the

640
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:34,740
strawberries and then planting a second

641
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,600
crop it's all about timing it allows

642
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:38,520
them to get another crop to Market

643
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,440
sooner

644
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:42,780
um without the gap between when one crop

645
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:45,299
ends and another one starts

646
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:48,120
and um there's that there's that

647
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:50,640
advantage of timing the strawberries do

648
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:52,440
provide some protection so it allows you

649
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,059
to get basically it allows you to get

650
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,440
two crops in a time period when you

651
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:56,700
normally couldn't get them because the

652
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,480
part of that time they're growing

653
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,880
together

654
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,260
the downside of this approach is it as

655
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,360
you can imagine hand removal of

656
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:05,340
strawberries is labor intensive

657
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,799
so we started

658
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:09,480
um developing this Shield which is

659
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:11,880
really very simple this is just a

660
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,919
prototype it's basically a triangular

661
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,940
Shield that you can adjust the width at

662
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,159
the bottom

663
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,539
and then on the outside on each side we

664
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:20,460
have nozzles

665
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:21,299
I'll just show you the back of it as

666
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,280
well

667
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:26,640
and we have at the front is kind of

668
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:28,260
flanged out slightly so what it does is

669
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,640
as you pull through the field in this

670
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:32,159
case I'm showing you with eggplants

671
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:34,380
again it pulls the leaves of the

672
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:36,240
eggplant up and into this triangular

673
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:38,220
shield and then you're spraying the

674
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,600
herbicide on the outside to kill the

675
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:42,480
strawberries

676
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,640
so when you pass an open area you can

677
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,020
see this dry line down the center of the

678
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,120
bed that's where the herbicide didn't

679
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:50,039
touch which is and your plant is covered

680
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,900
and then this wet area on the outside

681
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:53,640
both sides that's where the herbicide

682
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:57,240
would have been sprayed

683
00:24:53,640 --> 00:25:00,960
so what this looks like is right here

684
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:02,880
the strawberries eventually die and you

685
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,700
are continue to grow in this case we're

686
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:08,340
testing hand removal versus herbicide

687
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:10,140
removal in eggplants we've done in

688
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,820
cantaloupes and we've also done it in

689
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:15,539
peppers

690
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:17,220
not a great idea for cantaloupes but for

691
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:19,140
Peppers anything growing upright like

692
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:20,539
peppers and eggplants is a great idea it

693
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:22,200
works really well

694
00:25:20,539 --> 00:25:25,320
and

695
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:28,140
um no no effects on yield as a matter of

696
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:29,940
fact if you plant the second crop at the

697
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:31,919
right time you actually get a bit of a

698
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:33,659
yield boost

699
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,360
um just because as I started to mention

700
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:38,100
earlier the strawberries provide some

701
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:41,039
level of protection

702
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:43,140
against cold periods or colder weather

703
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,360
or wind

704
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:46,679
so with that I want to I know I've gone

705
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,880
kind of long already and I want to make

706
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:50,460
sure if there's any questions there's a

707
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,779
chance to ask those but um I want to

708
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,220
acknowledge I've got a great team down

709
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:55,200
here there's a lot of there's a lot of

710
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,760
this work for me and we're funded by the

711
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,740
sort of strawberry Growers the social

712
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:01,940
Association as well as the Florida
