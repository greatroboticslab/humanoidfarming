  "text": "all right well we took a break after the bridge now we're going to go do uh fence we're going to repair fence so I like to get the fences done every now and then so the animals don't uh scratch their eyes so gatlin's getting his driver's license right now hey hello so same Principle as a big vehicle but slightly different uh you got to hold in the brake when you turn the key all right all right there you go you can let off now so it's got a clutch that's on a belt so it doesn't roll like a car wheel but you notice it's in gear right now so uh just drive out underneath this tree there's no seat belts okay there no seat belts for said there's a clutch or no clutch no nothing you just as you press the gas the uh belt will will compress the clutch is automatic and it'll Lurch forward but then dry you got it yep keep going you'll want to go right in between the tree and the trailer and what you'll do is uh as soon as you get the driveway you'll turn and go up that way right yeah and we'll go we start following the fence we're going to pull down all that electric old electric wire we're going to get rid of those yellow insulators and then anything that's broken we go ahead and take care of as well there things like that you can just drive right through it it won't matter this as fast as it goes no it it'll do 70 but I put a regulator on it so to keep it under 20 but once you get out there you could go you know once you get straight and through the gate just floor it and you'll see [Music] W yeah it's got a little pick them up juice then we'll just go down to the gate and we'll start there what you're looking for is the broken wires so when you see a broken wire you can just take your foot off the gas it's got a brake clutch all right uh but if you need a hard stop you can use the brake but usually it'll Coast Coast to a stop and then any of those yellow things we're going to pull those off the p uh off the pipes too right those used to be an old insulator all this old scraps of wire that I've been pulling out of the ground we're going to throw in the bed at back of this thing and just clean it up so the animals don't get hurt and fix the brakes there's yeah there's a brake all right perfect turn the key you can turn it off and those yellow things are super hard to get off the uh pipes I mean I just all I do is just torque at them and see I like that one I I don't know if I left it or not but I'm trying to clean up you know what I mean like I don't want to leave a bunch of you know that I hit play yeah I did um record just walk down and Gatlin and just you know anywhere we see these but I'll teach you to do this right now there's a lot of ways of doing wire this is the way I don't like to do it whoever fixed it last time but it's the way most ranchers tell you is right but I don't like to do that so see what happened is the Bulls came through here fighting yeah and they broke it and so a lot of people will crimp a crimp repair in here I don't think that lasts so um I'll get my gloves and show you how I do it all right so what I do you know obviously the crimp I'll cut that off so what I do is I unravel the um The Wire yeah back about 6 in 8 in in and then I braid in the uh the solution that way I'm not buying anything I'm just using what wire is there so you know I just unravel it and then if I can grab the other side I'll just wave it in but sometimes I can right so see how this is all broken so I'll have to pull this staple out first time well I have a better video on this uh this without me blocking it right here I'm just teaching Gatlin how to do this so uh you know his presentation's for him but basically I spay those two pieces of wire apart then I braid one strand over it and the other strand over that in opposite directions one clockwise one counterclockwise I do that on both ends then I don't need any extra grommets I don't need ferals I don't need special expensive CRI crimping devices and I find if I pull this tight uh it spreads the load out over a longer surface area so you can pull them a little bit tight now I'm careful not to tighten these too much these old strands cuz you break them but that's what I'm doing I'm just weaving two kinds of Bob wire together it's already got you whoopsie did not see that I was too focused on here bar wire it really does have a mind of its own [Music] all right you want to grab it like right there and just put a little tension look down the line make sure I you know that it's not real floppy I'll do the same over here a help here he's pulling the tension in the line so that it's a a little tighter now I could have a fence stretcher do this with a fence stretcher I've got one but I find setting it up and getting it to hold on with these old strands and not going too tight breaking them uh just a human touch seems to make do and later on I'll show you how I tighten them anyway but uh so he's he's holding on to it with the pliers and giving me a little tension there so the line doesn't just flop down but I just twist these by hand all together I leave the little end up like a barb wire that's all I do on it so nothing fancy uh but I am teaching Gatlin here he's picking up pretty fast he's a a quick learner he's a young man he's not a late teen he's an early teen kid just heading into getting his driver's permit so uh there'll be opportunity I'm going to let them drive a little bit more the more you let kids drive the safer the world is for them and the happier we all are so I'm happy to have him here he's he's driving around today I'm not driving nothing but there's that strand all mended up you hardly even notice all right now this is uh this is how I pull it tight if I need to so once you you find the post is where you do it well after you do the post if you give them a little crimp like that Ben they'll do that so uh let me get the hammer and a staple would you grab the and uh the split in there and just pull it uh tight for me SPL yeah just grab it here and just lean against it all right and let's do it the opposite direction we grab it this way and pull the fence that way okay oh over here on this side got one and then when I want to make them tight what I do uh from this point on is uh I told all the slack into this spot I physically just kind of you know drive a nail into it against the post right so um in fact you could do that that one that's good I dropped the staple somewhere in here hope I lost it huh well Gone Forever it's really hard to drive those Staples so it's good practice for you uh go uh running and it ran into a piece of the barb wire dangling like this and the barb wire went right through its eye into its brain killed it instantly Oh e yeah it was terrible you see that once it sticks with you how dangerous bad fence is you know yeah and uh for me it was in Michigan middle of winter so I couldn't even bury the thing I had this Dead Goat that I had figure out what to do well I've got a playful nature so I gave uh Gatlin here the hardest of uh of jobs to do keep tension on a wire driving a staple listen I don't even know if he's ever picked up a hammer before he showed up out to the farm I did not ask him for his extensive resume this is a boy's first job and when you hire a young man your job is to help him and they're not ready for a eight hour day they're not ready to be yelled at they're not ready to do a lot of things and we forget as we get older what it was like for us when we had our first job and hopefully we had a good good boss a good teacher I had good ranchers they're all kindly a little ory and so I'm a little ory to this young man I tease him a smidgen and all in good fun letting them know but this is the hard job and if you'll notice there I'm using a hatchet Hammer uh so you got that sharp edge to intimidate you uh on top of it but driving these staples in if you've never driven a staple into a fence you have no idea how how hard this is so I let this run with uh with Gatlin uh regular speed so you can appreciate his struggle now I'm watching them out of the corner of the eye while I'm uh fixing fence down down the way I'm I'm wiring all the fence there is dozens and dozens and dozens of the wire straps out so I'm I'm fixing all them as I'm going L do this every spring not hes in the fence I told you it's hard isn't it it's hard to get the right the right angle it's really hard he's still he's still working on that staple I'm trying to get it in there without one hurting myself to No it's it's hard get in there it's surprisingly hard well can you uh hold this area over here like pull on it a little bit so I can get more room to come on right there I need more you want me to do this one yeah my friend I can't I can't get the right angle no I I set you up on that one it really is hard to do you're going to do it in half the time no I will well I'll do it but I won't do it in half the time yeah there you go anyway that's how I pull them tight all right after the fact as I physically do that I'll get it next time yeah what next time yeah yeah I set you woo but uh and then as far as uh see where it's kind of floppy yeah so what I do is I go down see how and I give them all a little crmp and you don't even notice it but's see how it draws that right up so that's all you do is just give them a little crimp as you walk down oh hey this one's just straight on grab a stretch staple to do this one all right and that one won't be as hard for you all right so what happens the fences that messes it up well the Bulls come through on each side and when they're after each they just walk right through like a spaghetti and then it breaks the fence and then you have to put it back together so that's what we're working on right now plus you know the post can let go of you know a little wear and tear as normal but this is all bold damage that's bull crap man while he learns to do this and just know uh I know that he is struggling and uh but I let him struggle and that's all part two of of the training listen I didn't hire a 30-year-old man here to help me run the fence this boy this young man called me and asked me for a job and when a when a young man asks you for a job and you need you got help you hire him and you take the time to teach him and that's your job as an older fella uh to do that and uh it wasn't mama who asked or his grandom or anything else it was this young man trying to trying to make his way in the world with the first job and this is a heck of a first job let me tell you I got so many things to do uh the first video I Shot with him he was uh doing the uh uh mud the concrete found some sandburs I bet you yep all right almost looks good [Music] all right that was um actually about 50t a really bad fence trans missing retaining wires gone Staples out there's the staple out let's go down in the middle and I'll walk down and drive that missing staple you grab all them yellow reflectors while I do that every one of the little Gatlin found weird bugs I've never seen them before I don't know what they are I think they're beet sort a beetle of some kind well we are removing there you're being evicted y'all getting evicted get out from behind oh here's another torn piece of f yeah so what I'll do is cut that off and wrap it around and nail it good catch but you see why uh they're bad for the animals imagine you're grazing a catle cow in the middle of the night you get that in your eyeball take a minute and remember the man that hired you the first time and how were you and if you're in farm country you might have started working I don't know like me I was bailing hay probably around 12 years old but I had jobs before that mowing the lawn things like that and I think I made a a dime of baale throwing them up on the uh the truck and I was a little dude they they were 80 lbs just like Gatlin here with the the mud yesterday and doing all this work for me today but you can see his value he's still cutting my time in half uh with all of the uh we ran down got all them reflectors all the running he has value right now gatlin's looking for the next broken strand so many of these were missing their ties that I decided to walk down let's see already you found a broken strand one right there on the bottom oh I see it yeah left over here on top on top these bottom ones I'm just going to wrap around try to make tight and wrap around all right this one's actually broken twice what happens to these besides being close to the ground is they get caught by the mower decks you know and then they get snapped off yep good eye once I can I'll try to fix ones like this that are just all rusted away I don't see any point in it well not only were you responsible for hiring them at first but they are and uh what their experiences are but uh let them use you as a reference so that they getting not only P so I'm not paying them as little as I can I'm paying them a man's wage uh but also I I want him to use me as a job reference when you're a job reference for somebody your job when somebody calls you isn't to play The Devil's Advocate and to say good and bad about uh the young man you've helped your job is to uh prop him up and uh you know anything that a young man needs to learn he can learn on the job but you're going to talk like here where uh Gatlin is totally focused on helping me he's there ahead of me quite frequently that's the skill set that you're after uh he's working hard he's focused we're two hours into into building here fenon fenon is the boringest cutest hardest little job in the entire world and it's Texas hot and the gatlin's right there that's the kind of things you say when somebody uses you for a job reference for a young person uh you focus on the strengths that breaks to young people let them wander around a little bit let them uh uh you know give them a bit of time but also when you're a job reference make sure it's a solid reference or don't even offer so I mentioned earlier that Gatlin called me asked me for that job well you know I don't want a babysit somebody I don't want their mama calling well let's take a look now at Gatlin I'll run him full speed at at the end of the day here he is on a a post without my help without my intervention and he is doggedly determined on each one of these posts sure he doesn't have a 240b man swing like I do uh but I got you know 40 years of experience Beyond him him don't expect people to be at your experience level give them that Grace where they can figure things out and give them the time don't sit there over their shoulder and helicopter them and micromanage every post that Gatlin runs into he just gets better at doing what he needs to do for that particular job and uh you know this is an hour and a half into him uh driving uh post and I I enjoy hearing him make man noises when he gets up off the ground like uh ooh he it cracks me up so then I don't feel so so old having a young person around is just as good for me as it is for him to be around now I've got a couple other fellas that come out that are in their 30s and then frons is as Elder he's retired so them old Cowboys come out and help me too uh but uh I so I say I'm a solo Builder but the fact of the matter is I could use a full-time young man like Gatlin uh but uh I got to go pick him up he doesn't have his driver's license yet so why am I letting him drive my stuff around uh one he can't hurt anybody and uh two I got a uh regulator on that uh UTV he could not go 70 miles an hour will he make mistakes on it well I hope not uh but that is the nature of being a kid you remember when you were a kid and you treat kids better than somebody misuse you you make sure you don't misuse some other kid your job is to help young men get off off the ground and and be excited about work and be excited about earning money don't cheat them don't uh underpay them just because you're training them too right uh let them get excited it doesn't cost you nothing out of your own pocket uh anymore and looky here this young man first day on a job um I'm telling you he cut my workload in half in concrete when he did that job yesterday he was a full-sized man um and by the end of the day he's a cowboy here uh each one of these posts takes him 20 minutes but tippity tap tippity tap he just stays at it till he gets the job done and I you saw me in the background I wired up three four five other posts uh but uh I didn't have to drive a single nail so he's taking care of all that himself and I'm really enjoying that we're getting towards the end of this run and this one run was a uh uh on both sides it's 3/10 of a mile so the full run is a little over a half a mile of fencing and uh I'll tell you what that'll wear you out he stayed positive he stayed focused uh you put your knee in sandburs and he stepped in fire ants Texas is mean y'all and to have a young man out there helping me uh really made me happy uh the whole day went a lot faster for me listen I get tired uh running fences too and uh they are a heck of a job so uh to have somebody out there that I could talk with this bottom line that he's fiddling with pulling them out of the dirt I'm not sure about five strand barb wire with one just a couple inches off the ground but I appreciate Gatlin glad to help glad to have him working this big boy right there that's a fence wrecker everybody I have seen him come through this fence after another bowl and then when he knocked that bowl down he sat on it to kill it and uh d did out of all of its energy he did as soon as he put his 2,000 plus pounds on anyway that guy when he wants to walk through a fence a fence doesn't mean anything to him he just goes right through it so he'll come through my lane and then fight the bowl on that side so the bowl on that side's a young one now but it used to be an older one who ran the show Romo was his name and he had horns and I thought for sure this guy wouldn't win he came through and whipped old ROM Mo I saw two out and I so I only brought two Staples turned out that it was six out so here I am had to walk back and get Staples said I don't need no more practice walking I know how to do that real well that's what I did gave myself practice walking that's it young one we did it next time you come out we'll do another little bit that way we won't be doing it all the you know they get tired of that you sure you don't need a cowboy hat I want a cowboy up you don't want a cowboy up huh huh you don't want a cowboy up huh all right well you got hair an old guy like me and Sun just melts my bald little head all right we're done right I mean y'all come if I walk down this and pull each strand I'd find wires missing I'll do that after I fix everything out but look how good much better that looks I mean we had wires crisscrossed over the top crap on the rails man that looks so much better all right let me get his thoughts let's go we got to be able to see our own face yeah all right Gatlin what do you think about fencing it's uh pretty easy what it just takes a while it does take a while it takes a while but it's not difficult cool anyone can do it really you know that old song desperado you've been out riding fences for way too long I just all right well that generational Gap there but listen out riding fences is a big deal imagine you were Cowboy at King Ranch which is the size of Rhode Island good Lord oh my God you every day would be fence day yeah every day all right well I'm going to wrap this thing up we did uh let's see a little over um I'm going to guess that's 3/10 so we did a little over a half mile fence repair I've got 1.2 miles around the outside then I'm going to guess another couple of miles going up and down so there's plenty of fence to do between now and Judgment Day all right like subscribe follow us along I hope you learned a little bit about fencing today bye so I told Gatlin to go do a three-point turn and he's never uh he's never driven youv so he doesn't even know what that is uh go down that guy's driveway pull in and back out",
