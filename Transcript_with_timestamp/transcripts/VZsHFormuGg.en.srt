00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:00,280
yeah yes so um how did all of this start

95
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:05,440
how did you start all of this well this

96
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:08,800
place started um well far back 2020 2020

97
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:12,479
the co year year so that every all of us

98
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:16,080
were locked inside the house yeah so we

99
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:19,479
are deeply into construction industry so

100
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,639
at that time government and

101
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:24,880
other uh

102
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:27,000
other uh business agencies shut down

103
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,800
their shops that's true because of the

104
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,720
because of the co so with found

105
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:36,080
ourselves in the house and lock

106
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,319
ourselves up but before then don't

107
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:43,199
forget we have

108
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:46,400
workers employees under us so every

109
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:49,240
month employees will put a phone across

110
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:54,400
and say a what about our salary we have

111
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:56,199
not SE so as a man don't work as a man

112
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,759
we must pay because if you don't pay

113
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:01,759
they will come and look for you at home

114
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:04,600
and um based that we have worked we have

115
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,599
a Cod relationship at work we cannot

116
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,360
deny

117
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:11,680
them so I have to think Which Way

118
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:14,400
Forward we think outside the box and say

119
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,479
there's need for us to start something

120
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,160
so that we not notice that what we do is

121
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:22,479
what we should tell oursel the bitter

122
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:26,080
truth that we don't have any permanent

123
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:28,000
work we only had a temporary work

124
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,680
because a contract work is a temporary

125
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,120
work so we start

126
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,520
yeah

127
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:37,840
2020 start building during the coid we

128
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,759
will come here we put blocks we started

129
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,400
from the other side we put

130
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,360
blocks just one block two blocks three

131
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,319
blocks at the end of the day we have

132
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,319
about over 10

133
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:59,560
p p f p f what do you have in p f here

134
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,960
we have Growers growers okay when you

135
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,240
say grows what do you mean by Growers

136
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,360
Growers are those that have matured from

137
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:11,639
piglet sh

138
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:16,039

139
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:19,960
attend a a mature State stage so that in

140
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:24,800
this area this place you now see the PE

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:38,280
independent from their mother they tend

146
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:40,280

00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,760
thing that this machine does but there

187
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,839
is the mixer where all the

188
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:51,160
additives I put them together and I mix

189
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:54,320
them with B them

190
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:57,440
okay so if we start to customer custom

191
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:00,200
okay you sell this to to customer how

192
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:04,360
much does the bag of this cost

193
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:08,200
H I may not give per head because we'll

194
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:12,200
buy in tons in tons okay are the major

195
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:16,839
challenges you faced in Pure Gas like I

196
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:21,279
said the challenges we face is

197
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:24,240
economy our economy is harsh in

198
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:26,800
Nigeria as a

199
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:30,040
whole you buy something today tomorrow

200
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,160
you will not get it and the people your

201
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:35,440
customers would not tell you how much

202
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,600
you buy raw materials all they are

203
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,920
concentrated is this is the price you

204
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,480
have placed this if you are saying you

205
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:47,839
are selling a kg of

206
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:51,440
pork 1,5 it should be 1,5 irrespective

207
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:53,680
of other adops in raw materials for

208
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,920
example we have raw material we use like

209
00:10:53,680 --> 00:11:01,240
Maze and other grains a bag of maze is

210
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:03,880
goes for 60,000 per bag back of 100 kg

211
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:06,800
so by the time you compound and other

212
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:09,240
element other raw materials that those

213
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,399
the one we imported by the time you

214
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:15,000
compound them together and see how much

215
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:18,720
a kg of feet goes you will not able to

216
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:22,639
sell a pork the cost price that is I'm

217
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:26,639
talking of the the the the production

218
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:29,480
cost will not be less than 2,000 naira

219
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:31,440
per kg and if you sell it you will not

220
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:36,519
see people that will patronize

221
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:39,360
you so we are struggling to to come out

222
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:44,000
considering our production cost we are

223
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:46,519
struggling to pay our overheads our

224
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,880
bills because the cost of production is

225
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:52,279
high so it's a huge challenge if our

226
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:55,120
economy will be fair will be better that

227
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:58,279
things are easily accessible easily

228
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,560
bought then other people can even come

229
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:02,560
on board

230
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:05,519
so that is the major challenge we face

231
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:08,399
like I told you recently that we are

232
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:11,800
blessed with customers from across the

233
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:17,279
neighboring states like kaduna

234
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:21,680
Abuja uh nasarawa Benway anambra and

235
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:24,880
other states is because we we don't look

236
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:27,079
at that cost I was telling you we are

237
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,920
looking at how can we bring more people

238
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:31,880
on board because I believe

239
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,600
the greater we are into this business

240
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:37,000
the better for us we subsidize our rates

241
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,240
we bring it

242
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,839
down and allow other people so long you

243
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:46,079
have that passion to be in business we

244
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:48,920
don't look at the monetary aspect of

245
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:51,959
it we look at how we can help you to

246
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:55,000
start up your business so because if we

247
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:59,600
want to look at how much we spend to

248
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:02,320
raise a pig a piglet we may not sell so

249
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:06,360
we look at what is possible how if we

250
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:10,240
have brick even on the cost of breeding

251
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:12,199
a big to certain level we're good to go

252
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,800
so like piglet we have the one we can

253
00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:18,480
sell as low at

254
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:21,800
25,000 30,000 depending on the breed we

255
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,480
have also a breed of 60,000 we have

256
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:28,199
breed

257
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:30,560
of 40,000 what's the highest amount of P

258
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:33,959
I'm the one I'm telling you

259
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:36,920
140,000 piglets for

260
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:41,279
piglets okay so it depends on the uh on

261
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:44,440
the brid yes okay so what of bigger pigs

262
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,720
how how do you sell them okay I'm

263
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:51,120
talking of

264
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:53,240
Life yes we sell 1,000 we sell 800

265
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:57,880
depending what you are buying now we

266
00:13:53,240 --> 00:14:00,279
sell one two depending the the the the

267
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:04,839
quantity you are buying if you buying in

268
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:07,720
L scale large scale we s we reduce money

269
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:11,399
uh if you are just buying few uh it

270
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:14,839
depends but ranging from 800 to

271
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:17,480
1,200 what's your advice to um someone

272
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:21,160
wanting to venture into pig farm or any

273
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:23,759
business at all in Nigeria uh I say that

274
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,920
young particularly the younger ones we

275
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:28,839
shouldn't because our government have

276
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:31,320
disappointed us we shouldn't be

277
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:33,480
lamenting in our government as a result

278
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:37,519
of bad

279
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:40,120
leadership you understand we should we

280
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:42,680
