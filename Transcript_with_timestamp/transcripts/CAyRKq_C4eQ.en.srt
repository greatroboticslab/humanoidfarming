fueling and daily maintenance on

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:13,080
tractors and other farm equipment has

3
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:15,040
the potential for serious accidents

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,920
operators should start by checking

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,439
operator manuals for specific safety

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,920
practices become familiar with symbols

7
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:25,840
and colors on equipment intended to warn

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,760
operators of danger points and

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,960
activities red color is associated with

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,800
danger it indicates Ates a hazardous

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,239
situation which if not heated can result

00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:40,160
in death orange color is associated with

13
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:43,920
hazardous situations which if not heated

14
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:46,000
can result in serious injury or death

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,440
yellow color indicates a hazardous

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,719
situation which if not avoided can

17
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:53,600
result in minor or moderate

18
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,719
injury read all safety decals on the

19
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,680
machine and follow the instructions

20
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:01,840
before starting operating refueling or

21
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:04,400
performing any mainten on the machine

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,439
remember to keep a first aid kit in each

23
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,799
tractor or self-propelled machine the

24
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,880
operator's manual explains which fluids

25
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:14,759
need to be checked daily and how to do

26
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,080
the checks operator's manuals also

27
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:19,040
include safety tips and describe the

28
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,880
location and purpose of all of the

29
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,159
gauges and controls as well as other

30
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,439
indicators knowing where the controls

31
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,920
are by memory can allow operators to

32
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:31,600
react more quickly in emergency

33
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,360
situations the operator's manual will

34
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,759
also explain the correct safety

35
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,439
procedures for refueling tractors and

36
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,720
self-propelled farm equipment only

37
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:43,719
refuel tractors and farm machinery when

38
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,640
the engine is cool and shut

39
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:48,960
off never smoke while refueling

40
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,360
equipment if you have to climb a ladder

41
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,799
to reach the fuel tank be particularly

42
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,399
careful if the steps are wet or icy all

43
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,200
fuels are flammable so be careful to

44
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:02,000
minimize activities that could ignite

45
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,880
the fuel during the refueling avoid

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,159
overfilling fuel tanks any fuel spills

47
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,319
should be immediately cleaned up

48
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:12,160
tractors and equipment with Selective

49
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:14,599
catalytic reduction or scr emission

50
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,879
reduction technology require filling a

51
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:19,120
second fuel tank with diesel exhaust

52
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,120
fluid check the fluid levels in the

53
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,680
engine crank case radiator and

54
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,800
transmission daily be particularly

55
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,920
careful when checking radiator levels

56
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,000
because the radiator is pressurized when

57
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,080
the engine is hot proper tire pressure

58
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
is important when operating tractors on

59
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,560
roads and in working

60
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,440
operations inflate each tire according

61
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,879
to the tire manufacturer's

62
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,920
recommendations inflation requirements

63
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:46,560
may be located on the outside of the

64
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,120
tire around the rim and in the tractor's

65
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:54,040
operator manual power hop also called

66
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:55,879
wheel hop Tire hop or tractor hop is a

67
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,280
condition of tractors and self-propelled

68
00:02:55,879 --> 00:03:01,319
farm equipment bouncing while operated

69
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:04,400
on highways power hop is caused by

70
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:07,680
overinflated tires remember to check for

71
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,680
cuts cracks and bruises in all Equipment

72
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,959
Tires check to make sure all headlights

73
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,640
flashers and brake lights are working

74
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,239
correctly clean and visible to other

75
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,640
drivers farm tractors are required to

76
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,480
have two forward-facing headlights and a

77
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,920
red tail light that burn continuously

78
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,319
the tail light must be visible from 500

79
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,920
ft under normal conditions and mounted

80
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,000
on the left rear side of the the tractor

81
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,519
farm tractors and Equipment require

82
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,640
Hazard warning lights or flashers when

83
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,920
operating on public roads white or Amber

84
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,959
flashers are mounted on the front and

85
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,280
red or Amber on the rear these lights

86
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:49,400
must be activated when the vehicle is in

87
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,599
operation clean clear windows and clean

88
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,159
mirrors are essential for good Vision

89
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:57,000
while operating tractors take the time

90
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,959
to properly adjust the mirrors check

91
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,519
Shields around the engine to make sure

92
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:04,239
they are securely fastened and in good

93
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,439
condition following safety precautions

94
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:11,959
does take a little more

95
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:11,959
time but being safe is your number one

96
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,720
