00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:26,100
as the webinar goes on so a brief recap

74
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:30,420
of part 1 of the webinar series a couple

75
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:32,220
weeks ago Katherine I went over basic

76
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:34,650
land access concepts and we went through

77
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,630
a wide variety of options that farmers

78
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:39,600
can pursue to acquire land and gain

79
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:42,600
access to it and one main take-home

80
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,130
message from that part 1 of the webinar

81
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,860
series was that you don't have to own

82
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:49,140
land to acquire it and various lease

83
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,360
arrangements and other scenarios can

84
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:55,040
enable you to get onto the land with

85
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,330
without necessarily purchasing it and

86
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,160
last webinar we also went through the

87
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,919
types of leases and what what is

88
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,290
incorporated in a typical lease and we

89
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:07,980
also touched on a little bit about where

90
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:10,710
to search for fun land but tonight's

91
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:12,900
webinar will center around readiness

92
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:17,940
concepts and planning and preparing for

93
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:22,410
farm tenure and we'll also go through

94
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:26,010
assessing particular parcels the tools

95
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:29,040
and resources you can use to learn much

96
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:32,000
more about a particular site that you

97
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,000
are interested in

98
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:48,220
so to get ready does everyone recognized

99
00:05:40,690 --> 00:06:00,190
the group on the right here this is this

100
00:05:48,220 --> 00:06:01,840

00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:04,660
to come out and sing their song get

102
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,460
ready but as Cathy do you want to go

103
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:14,200

104
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:15,370
going here and get ready no and I guess

105
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,320

106
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:24,790

some of these icons if you like the

115
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:58,930
little song there so getting ready for

116
00:06:54,940 --> 00:07:00,100
farm land tenure involves various things

117
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:03,550
that we're going to be discussing in the

118
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:05,470
next half hour or 45 minutes before we

119
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:08,080
get into the principles involved in

120
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:11,700
assessing particular properties so so

121
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,990
briefly we're going to be talking about

122
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:16,270
determining whether or not land is your

123
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:18,550
limiting factor we talked about

124
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:20,830
evaluating your needs versus you wants

125
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:23,380
integrating family values considering

126
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:29,290
ownership costs this this is a big one

127
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:31,510
right here it's a lot of times beginning

128
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:33,040
farmers underestimate how much it's

129
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:35,800
going to cost them actually to own land

130
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:38,890
or what are the costs involved in

131
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:41,220
actually leasing land they needless to

132
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:44,740
say I have enormous implications for

133
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:46,120
moving your farm business forward we're

134
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:48,490
going to go through a farm land purchase

135
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:50,080
and leasing considerations that can be

136
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:53,230
integrated into a business plan and

137
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:56,620
we'll also look at if you're looking to

138
00:07:53,230 --> 00:08:00,430
acquire a farm through purchase we'll

139
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:02,710
look at how to prepare for approaching a

140
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:04,920
loan officer or obtaining a loan to do

141
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,920
so

142
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:20,950
so as land acquisition right for you um

143
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:23,140
you know what what really is your your

144
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:25,660
limiting factor in in in moving your

145
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:29,380
farm business forward or your your your

146
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:31,120
family life forward a lot of times there

147
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:35,920
are other things that might be holding a

148
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:39,310
new farmer back and and land might not

149
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:41,440
be on the top of that list so there are

150
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:44,230
other typical challenges that are

151
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,480
associated with that are that are the

152
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:48,910
typical barriers to starting up a farm

153
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,400
it could be lack of production knowledge

154
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:53,860
and skills it could be you don't have

155
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:56,310
markets that are developed yet you know

156
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:59,380
the huge one is there's not enough time

157
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:00,760
it's that's not talked about a lot but

158
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,410
the truth is for a lot of beginning

159
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:06,220
farmers there's just no time to work on

160
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:11,800
the farm because they have to oftentimes

161
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:14,440
work off the farm so it is is addressing

162
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,910
the land axis very going to be the first

163
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,260
thing that's most important to moving

164
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:27,580
your business forward and that's that's

165
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:29,380
the main question you know what so if if

166
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:31,090
it's if lack of production knowledge and

167
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:34,000
skills is the main barrier then maybe

168
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:36,520
before looking into acquiring land it's

169
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,800
best to look into the various

170
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:41,410
apprenticeship programs or even get a

171
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,500
job on a farm so you really hit the

172
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:46,180
ground running once you do acquire land

173
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,890
capital there's there's not there's not

174
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:50,650
as much as a fine line between lack of

175
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:54,900
capital lack of land that kind of go

176
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:57,610
hand in hand but oftentimes you can get

177
00:09:54,900 --> 00:10:02,710
financing or capital to start a business

178
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:05,500
that's that's not centered on the land

179
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:07,900
piece you don't need 40 or 100 or 200

180
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:10,690
acres of land necessarily to start a

181
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:14,250
business with making productive use of

182
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:14,250
your assets and capital

183
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:24,500
and it's needless to say it's really

184
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:27,200
important to filter out your needs from

185
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:30,320
your wants now this is assuming that

186
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,730
that you're that you have already

187
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,930
identified that you're limiting factor

188
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:37,700
is indeed land access or at least it's a

189
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:43,310
major limiting limiting factor for you

190
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:45,800
now what what type of land or what what

191
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:48,770
type of tenure situation or scenario is

192
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:53,120
going to fulfill your needs in terms of

193
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:55,400
let of what what is most limiting to you

194
00:10:53,120 --> 00:11:00,800
what type of land you need in other

195
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:02,990
words so this is otherwise known as the

196
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,090
minimalist strategy if you're really

197
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:08,090
focusing on what it is you need out of a

198
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:11,870
property and it's kind of

199
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:14,270
counterintuitive but if you can sort of

200
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:15,980
filter down what you actually need out

201
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:18,460
of a property or out of a farm tender

202
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:20,870
situation it actually opens up more

203
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:23,590
10-year opportunities that's really a

204
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:26,720
counterintuitive but the fact is that

205
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:30,170
the real viable opportunities are going

206
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,880
to open up to you when they're more

207
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:33,020
based on what you need and when and

208
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:37,100
they're more based on the scale of

209
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:39,050
business that you're at so north other

210
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:41,030
other words there be more realistic

211
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:42,560
opportunities available for you if you

212
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:44,960
can really focus on what you need out of

213
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:48,770
a property versus what you want everyone

214
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:52,580
wants the the farm property that's on

215
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:54,290
the cover of all the magazines but could

216
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,670
you are you going to be able to manage

217
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:58,820
that type of property when you get onto

218
00:11:55,670 --> 00:12:00,890
it even in the long term is it something

219
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:02,960
that you could grow into those are

220
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:08,180
questions that are worth asking from the

221
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:10,370
get-go in terms of garner garnering

222
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:12,230
support for your farm operation you

223
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:14,180
might be reaching out to community

224
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:15,830
members for financing you might be

225
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:17,570
approaching loan offers once you do get

226
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:20,150
access to land you might be reaching out

227
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:25,150
to two loan officers to extend you a

228
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:27,320
loan and my experience has been that

229
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:28,850
people are much more willing to support

230
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,150
an operation that they know is making

231
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:33,350
more

232
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:36,380
less than you know they have too much to

233
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:38,120
handle so that's something to keep in

234
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,920
mind and then of course in terms of

235
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:45,620
protecting yourself from unexpected

236
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:49,550
costs they're huge costs associated with

237
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:52,070
owning and in leasing more more land

238
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:55,280
that you need more land that you can use

239
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:59,060
productively so in order to protect

240
00:12:55,280 --> 00:13:06,920
yourself from that risk it's good to

241
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:10,370
really focus on what what you need this

242
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:15,320
is a checklist that's available in

243
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:20,690
holding ground which kathy had a huge

244
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:22,040
part in in writing this is a guide to

245
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:24,050
northeast prime land tenure and

246
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:26,480
stewardship it's currently available for

247
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:32,590
sale at the New England small farms

248
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:36,890
Institute bookstore and this page is

249
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:38,660
page 31 out of that text i highly

250
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:41,210
recommend everyone getting ahold of this

251
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:42,970
if they are serious about acquiring land

252
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:46,370
either through lease or purchase or

253
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:48,650
alternative other alternative means it

254
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:52,190
goes through all sorts of scenarios all

255
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:56,570
different options in in acquiring land

256
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:57,530
and this is a great checklist that can

257
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:59,830
guide you through some of the

258
00:13:57,530 --> 00:14:02,360
considerations that you can make and I

259
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:06,020
apologize to everyone because the the

260
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:07,700
text might not be readable here but the

261
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:09,440
way Kathy's laid it out here is that

262
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:11,000
you're really you're looking at each of

263
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,160
these factors whether it be location

264
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,100
land-based climate infrastructure

265
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:17,690
housing or the history of the land and

266
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,820
you're you're assessing for your

267
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:22,100
particular situation whether or not each

268
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:24,380
of these factors is necessary to your to

269
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:26,930
your farm operation or your family

270
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:31,670
ambitions whether or not they're these

271
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:33,050
factors are desirable or optional so you

272
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:36,530
know it's really it's sometimes it's

273
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:39,080
tough to go to keep in your head all of

274
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:42,819
the considerations that that can be made

275
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:46,239
when looking into respect

276
00:14:42,819 --> 00:14:48,519
really at your potential for running off

277
00:14:46,239 --> 00:14:50,350
of viable farm operation once you do

278
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:56,079
acquire land so this kind of lays

279
00:14:50,350 --> 00:15:05,649
everything out on one page for you to

280
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:06,939
use Family Values is not often

281
00:15:05,649 --> 00:15:10,029
considered people are very excited

282
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:13,509
usually to start farming to get onto the

283
00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:15,759
land but you really in some cases

284
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:21,239
committing to a long-term endeavor and

285
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:21,239
it can be important you know this is

286
00:15:21,389 --> 00:15:28,239
this is a great picture of a happy

287
00:15:24,729 --> 00:15:31,989
family um you know I not sure who the

288
00:15:28,239 --> 00:15:34,749
farmer would be in this picture but I'm

289
00:15:31,989 --> 00:15:37,839
sure the rest of the people would

290
00:15:34,749 --> 00:15:39,220
appreciate being close to the farmer you

291
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,989
know maybe helping out throughout

292
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:44,289
retirement no that's that's the case I

293
00:15:40,989 --> 00:15:47,439
uh I don't know if Jesse mentioned in a

294
00:15:44,289 --> 00:15:50,519
small bio when we started out but I'm

295
00:15:47,439 --> 00:15:53,679
trying to establish a small fruits farm

296
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:55,689
and my father has expressed the desire

297
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:57,009
to work on it throughout his retirement

298
00:15:55,689 --> 00:16:00,279
so I'm gonna be putting my dad to work

299
00:15:57,009 --> 00:16:03,339
hopefully um but it's hard to do that

300
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:06,759
when you're far away needless to say

301
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:08,619
there are complicated issues involved in

302
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:12,729
in figuring out what's best for the

303
00:16:08,619 --> 00:16:14,409
entire family you know not often times

304
00:16:12,729 --> 00:16:16,959
it's not a line necessarily with what's

305
00:16:14,409 --> 00:16:19,959
best for the farm business but it's

306
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:21,369
definitely good to keep in mind that the

307
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:24,069
things might be in balance I've heard a

308
00:16:21,369 --> 00:16:26,379
lot from farmers who are established and

309
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:29,319
say I wish I had settled down closer to

310
00:16:26,379 --> 00:16:31,089
family or in some cases I you know I

311
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:35,589
wish I hadn't settled this close to my

312
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:37,569
family yeah I wish I at least they there

313
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:39,189
at least a half hour away instead of 15

314
00:16:37,569 --> 00:16:41,589
minutes and banging down my door every

315
00:16:39,189 --> 00:16:43,979
day but so I think you guys get the

316
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:43,979
point there

317
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:53,640
as I mentioned before considering

318
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:57,110
ownership costs oftentimes farmers don't

319
00:16:53,640 --> 00:17:01,320
consider every cost that goes into

320
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:04,350
owning land so this would be specific to

321
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:07,050
those out in our audience here that are

322
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:08,339
looking to purchase land and we'll

323
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:10,020
talking a little bit about how this

324
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:14,120
applies to if you're leasing land but

325
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:16,470
for the most part there are several

326
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:23,130
ownership costs two types of ownership

327
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:24,959
costs depreciation is when you are when

328
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:26,309
something is degrading and value over

329
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,280
time and this this applies to

330
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:32,210
infrastructure on the form this does not

331
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:35,220
apply to land land as an asset that is

332
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:38,429
well known to not depreciate you can't

333
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:41,280
you can't declare in your taxes that

334
00:17:38,429 --> 00:17:44,490
your land is depreciating land generally

335
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:48,320
stays at its as its present value or

336
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:50,610
appreciates in value whereas barnes

337
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,350
fencing equipment and other

338
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:53,610
infrastructure tend to depreciate in

339
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,870
value just over time they're going to

340
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:57,480
rust and they're going to wear down and

341
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:59,160
that's considered a cost to whoever is

342
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,540
owning that piece of equipment was ever

343
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,940
zoning that that that piece of

344
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:05,280
infrastructure it's not necessarily a

345
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:08,809
tangible cost you're not going to be

346
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:11,429
paying someone else for for the

347
00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:13,050
depreciation costs but when it comes

348
00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:15,120
time to selling an asset that you own

349
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:17,330
you're going to be getting a lot less

350
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:23,790
for it over time as it depreciate

351
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:26,550
interest commonly amongst agriculture

352
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:29,250
economists interest is an opportunity

353
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:32,700
cost so this is this is not really

354
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:35,490
referring to the cost associated with

355
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:39,179
paying down a mortgage interest in this

356
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:41,660
case is referring to the opportunity

357
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:46,140
cost for owning land in other words if

358
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:47,400
if one of you or a farm owner purchases

359
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:51,270
a property for a hundred thousand

360
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:53,970
dollars you could have used that hundred

361
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:55,050
thousand dollars at the Wall Street of

362
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:56,790
the stock market or you could have

363
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:58,620
invested that hundred thousand dollars

364
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:59,700
in the CD and you would have been been

365
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,710
getting three percent

366
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,210
interest on that so that's considered an

367
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:05,700
opportunity cost that you're missing out

368
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:06,929
when you lock up your capital or your

369
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:13,470
hundred thousand dollars in a piece of

370
00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:15,269
land repairs and maintenance I've been

371
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:20,279
living by this statement here everything

372
00:19:15,269 --> 00:19:23,639
works great until it breaks I there

373
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:24,870
there is definitely truth to it and and

374
00:19:23,639 --> 00:19:26,190
there's there's a definite cost

375
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,809
associated with repairing and

376
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,220
maintaining any equipment or

377
00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:32,159
infrastructure that you have on the farm

378
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:35,820
and we'll go in a little bit more detail

379
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:40,169
about that in the following slides taxes

380
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:42,330
on property now this is one of the most

381
00:19:40,169 --> 00:19:46,490
underestimated ownership costs for

382
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:49,169
people that are new to acquiring land

383
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:51,929
they can be taxes on your property can

384
00:19:49,169 --> 00:19:54,120
be significant it's it's a lot easier

385
00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:55,860
these days or in some cases assume you

386
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,450
have good credit or you might have some

387
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:01,970
collateral ah'd easier to get financing

388
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:04,139
for the loan to purchase property but

389
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:06,330
the question is whether or not you can

390
00:20:04,139 --> 00:20:09,539
pay taxes on that property over the long

391
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:12,179
term and there are ways to assess your

392
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:13,769
tax hit or your potential tax hit that

393
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:15,299
is going to be associated with a

394
00:20:13,769 --> 00:20:18,659
particular property and we'll talk about

395
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:23,039
that in a little bit and lastly

396
00:20:18,659 --> 00:20:24,240
insurance again if you if you're going

397
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,460
to be owning a farm you're going to need

398
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,440
insurance on your property whether that

399
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,789
be casualty insurance or liability

400
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,340
insurance in some cases if you're

401
00:20:29,789 --> 00:20:36,500
inviting the public onto your forum and

402
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:36,500
those can be considered ownership costs

403
00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:47,000
is everyone still with me is it please

404
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:47,000
use the smiley face

405
00:20:51,290 --> 00:21:06,020
feel free to use the chat box and enter

406
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:07,880
your questions as they come up so a

407
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:10,520
little bit more detail about ownership

408
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:12,460
costs when you're talking about

409
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:15,830
infrastructure equipment and buildings

410
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:17,420
you can use this this equation it's

411
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:20,090
known as or this formulas known as the

412
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:22,910
dirty five and that's again going back

413
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:28,130
to the previous slide you can see the

414
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:30,850
DDI the are the t in the eye it's this

415
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:33,800
slide just gives formulas to how to

416
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:36,230
assess those exact costs so if you're

417
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:38,840
looking at depreciation you're looking

418
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:42,140
at if you're looking at the depreciation

419
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:44,860
on the tractor the original cost might

420
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:47,210
be $20,000 the salvage value might be

421
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:48,890
one thousand dollars when it's all said

422
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:52,160
and done when you're when you're ready

423
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:54,770
to sell it so you divide that over its

424
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:56,950
useful life so you're basically taking

425
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:59,480
the the the original cost of the item

426
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:00,920
and determining how many years it's

427
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:05,540
going to take for it to lose all its

428
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:10,300
value and you're breaking down the costs

429
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:13,540
over that many years and for interest

430
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:16,460
you're looking at the original cost

431
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:17,900
minus salvage value divided by two

432
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:20,420
you're basically looking at the the

433
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:22,310
average value of your investment

434
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:23,780
whatever whatever money you're going to

435
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:27,260
have the owner is going to have locked

436
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:29,150
away in the asset you're looking at the

437
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:32,000
average value of that asset over time

438
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:34,460
and then you're multiplying that by the

439
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,000
interest rate that's you know that the

440
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:41,240
going interest rate which which does

441
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,540
fluctuate but again this is an

442
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:46,730
opportunity cost so you know it would

443
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:48,260
depend on the period that you're looking

444
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:54,770
at and I'm assuming you could take an

445
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:57,710
average interest rate to determine an

446
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:59,960
actual opportunity interest cost for

447
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:02,660
repairs generally speaking of the this

448
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:04,760
the repairs can be one to two percent of

449
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:07,780
the replacement costs for buildings

450
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:09,620
now this is based on formulas that

451
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:12,410
agricultural economists have done all

452
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:14,180
over the nation they've done surveys of

453
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:16,850
farmers about how much are you spending

454
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:19,550
per year on on repairing and maintaining

455
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:21,830
buildings beyond the average has been

456
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:24,080
one to two percent how much have has

457
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:25,880
farmers have been spending per year on

458
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,590
repairing and maintaining machinery

459
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:31,070
average has been about three to five

460
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:32,890
percent of costs now obviously your

461
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:34,880
particular situation might differ and

462
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:36,170
you know depending on the particular

463
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,630
tractor you're looking at there a

464
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:40,280
particular building repairs and

465
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:44,810
maintenance might not be these actual

466
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:48,380
numbers but these are the averages taxes

467
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:49,760
for buildings you're looking at the

468
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:53,150
property tax rate which is going to be

469
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:55,580
determined at the town level and you're

470
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:57,590
looking at the assessed value which

471
00:23:55,580 --> 00:24:00,500
again is determined that the town level

472
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:02,800
but it's yeah I'm not sure how it is in

473
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:05,600
other states but towns here in Vermont

474
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:07,610
they have each town has their own

475
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,750
appraisers and Lister's that will come

476
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:12,020
out to your property and assess the

477
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:14,180
value you know they'll list it in the

478
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:18,610
grand list of the town and then they'll

479
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:21,890
tax you based on the the going rate and

480
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:23,360
insurance again a general formula you're

481
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:26,180
looking at the replacement cost for

482
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,950
buildings on the one percent of that

483
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:29,120
replacement cost is generally what

484
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:32,150
you're going to be paying in insurance

485
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,440
and for equipment again to ensure that

486
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:40,100
equipment you're looking at the average

487
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:42,980
value times about one percent so I know

488
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:44,960
that's a little bit complicated and

489
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:46,610
might not be applicable to your

490
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:50,540
situation right now but it's a good

491
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:52,670
thing to keep in mind if you do if it

492
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:55,880
ever does come down to figuring the

493
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:58,070
actual ownership costs and as will

494
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:00,080
mention a few minutes landowners if you

495
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:02,450
look into leased land land owners will

496
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,880
going to want to be assessing their

497
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:07,520
actual costs for only land so they can

498
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:10,310
try to determine a cash rental rate to

499
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,900
charge a tenant farmer so they'll be

500
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:14,870
looking at this formula in detail and

501
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:17,150
it's good to know what a landlord is

502
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:18,470
going to be looking at to try to find

503
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:19,730
some middle ground

504
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:21,980
doing the number that they determine

505
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:23,240
from this formula and the number that

506
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:25,700
you'll be able to handle through your

507
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:27,799
business or the going market rental rate

508
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:29,630
and we'll talk about that in a minute or

509
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:45,530
two getting a little ahead of ourselves

510
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:48,530
here sorry about oh sorry everyone I

511
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:50,030
think I hit the wrong key here and went

512
00:25:48,530 --> 00:26:03,530
to the end of the slideshow just bear

513
00:25:50,030 --> 00:26:05,630
with me here so again the dirty five

514
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:07,490
formula is one way that landlords can

515
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:10,400
estimate now this is this is relevant to

516
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:11,240
if you're leasing it's a situation if

517
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,330
you're looking to lease a property

518
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:18,830
you're trying to determine a price to

519
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:21,860
pay per year per acre for cash rental on

520
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:24,350
the land owners are might be using this

521
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:27,200
dirty five formula to estimate how much

522
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:32,900
they could charge you as a farmer tenant

523
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:35,770
and in most cases all of those ownership

524
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:38,510
costs put together the depreciation

525
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:41,000
interest repairs taxes and insurance

526
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:43,429
oftentimes all those costs put together

527
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,070
are going to be way more than a farmer

528
00:26:43,429 --> 00:26:51,140
can actually pay based on their

529
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:52,669
enterprise plan so if one hundred

530
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:54,890
percent of these costs cannot be covered

531
00:26:52,669 --> 00:26:57,289
by the farmer what percentage of the

532
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:59,120
cost can be and that's for you guys to

533
00:26:57,289 --> 00:27:02,299
determine if you are farmer looking to

534
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:04,850
lease land it is suggested that you

535
00:27:02,299 --> 00:27:08,809
determine what you are actually able to

536
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:11,900
pay for cash rent so this involves the

537
00:27:08,809 --> 00:27:13,730
careful estimation of what you are going

538
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:18,039
to be returning from your farm business

539
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:21,020
per acre and it also involves a careful

540
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:22,669
estimation of what you need to live what

541
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:25,130
your what are your family needs and how

542
00:27:22,669 --> 00:27:29,360
much is your family or your or you

543
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:32,580
yourself spending per month on all of

544
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,990
your living expenses and then you can

545
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:36,570
determine what you're able to pay for

546
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:41,220
cash rent aside we've outlined a basic

547
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:43,049
formula here your neck now this is not

548
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:45,269
for a cur but you use just generally

549
00:27:43,049 --> 00:27:47,460
speaking for the whole deal your net

550
00:27:45,269 --> 00:27:49,950
returns before your lease payment this

551
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:52,890
is from your farm business and net

552
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:54,480
returns being your income after all of

553
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:59,929
your expense all of your other expenses

554
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:03,899
are paid such as fertilizer in such as

555
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:07,080
seed and and whatnot it's going to be

556
00:28:03,899 --> 00:28:08,850
that net return minus the percent that

557
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,980
you need to reinvest into your farm

558
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:14,940
operation that you plan to reinvest into

559
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:16,440
your farm operation over time minus your

560
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:19,110
family needs equals how much is left

561
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:21,750
over that you could afford to pay in

562
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:23,460
your total cash lease payment so these

563
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:26,880
are some some basic business planning

564
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:29,309
principles that can go into figuring out

565
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:34,409
how much you can handle for for cash

566
00:28:29,309 --> 00:28:36,360
rent and it it enables you to develop a

567
00:28:34,409 --> 00:28:40,200
middle ground between what you can

568
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:42,269
handle or my or i should say between

569
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:45,600
what you might want to pay for for lease

570
00:28:42,269 --> 00:28:48,419
land and between that and what a

571
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:50,190
landowner might want to charge you and

572
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:51,659
then number three there is is careful

573
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:54,409
examination of cash flow so you need to

574
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:57,389
know when you'll be able to pay a

575
00:28:54,409 --> 00:28:59,100
landlord the lease payment you need to

576
00:28:57,389 --> 00:29:01,649
know when cash is going to be available

577
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,850
in your particular business cycle if

578
00:29:01,649 --> 00:29:04,799
it's you know if you're going to have a

579
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:06,510
horde of cash in October after you've

580
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:10,590
you've sold all your produce in

581
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:11,940
September then you know maybe that's the

582
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:13,769
time to schedule your lease payment

583
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:17,570
instead of in in February when there's

584
00:29:13,769 --> 00:29:17,570
when cash flow is next to nothing

585
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:33,550
again they can't really overemphasize as

586
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:37,960
a farmer you need to know what you're

587
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:41,470
able to handle financially and in terms

588
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:43,720
of purchase it goes the same way are you

589
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:46,360
able to handle the purchase based on

590
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:48,100
your off farm income based on the income

591
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:51,040
that you'll gain from the farm

592
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:52,870
Enterprise once you do purchase land and

593
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,850
are you able to handle so between that

594
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:57,000
you're off farm income you're on farm

595
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:59,800
income and your savings are you able to

596
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,330
handle the down payment on the purchase

597
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:05,050
of land are you able to handle the

598
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:06,550
closing costs you are if you have a real

599
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:10,480
estate agent involved you can be paying

600
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:12,340
them three percent plus or minus if you

601
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,960
have an attorney involved you might be

602
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:16,540
paying anywhere from four hundred to a

603
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:18,429
thousand dollars in closing costs you

604
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:21,809
know and you have and there's other

605
00:30:18,429 --> 00:30:24,340
costs associated with getting financing

606
00:30:21,809 --> 00:30:27,150
depending on the terms of the loan that

607
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:28,960
you might be getting to purchase land

608
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:32,050
need to make sure that you can handle

609
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,820
all of these costs and then and then of

610
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:36,910
course your monthly mortgage payment

611
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:40,230
based on your income and can you handle

612
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:42,309
these ownership costs a lot of times

613
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:43,960
number two they're the monthly mortgage

614
00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:45,640
payment the banks will make sure that

615
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:48,130
based on your income you can handle that

616
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:49,900
that payment based on your cash flow

617
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:51,370
from off farm income or based on the

618
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,540
farm business they're going to they're

619
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:54,070
going to be reluctant to extend you

620
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:56,710
alone unless they know that you can

621
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:58,000
handle that payment but rarely do banks

622
00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:00,790
make sure that you're going to be able

623
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,790
to handle ownership costs there you know

624
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:06,070
they a good loan officer will ask you if

625
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:07,450
you can handle taxes and insurance and

626
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:09,250
repairs and all the equipment and

627
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:11,350
maintenance that you have for the farm

628
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:13,059
so number three is really something up

629
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:15,040
for you guys to keep an eye on closely

630
00:31:13,059 --> 00:31:18,640
you should be keeping an eye on all

631
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:21,550
these but number three won't be handed

632
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:23,020
to you on a silver platter you can

633
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:25,290
really be need to do some research on

634
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:25,290
your own

635
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:32,200
some general business planning

636
00:31:29,049 --> 00:31:35,410
considerations for leasing you can get a

637
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:38,820
tax deduction based on you on the money

638
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:41,140
you're paying in cash rental per year

639
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:44,200
that's why it often makes sense to lease

640
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:48,450
land you're actually you're paying less

641
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:53,470
taxes by deducting your your expense of

642
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:55,059
making your lease payment and again you

643
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:57,730
have to time your cash flow for your

644
00:31:55,059 --> 00:31:59,650
lease payment schedule that's important

645
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:01,840
you need to have cash on hand for other

646
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:03,160
factors that are going to be involved in

647
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,900
your leasing land you're going to be

648
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:08,290
paying liability insurance in most cases

649
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:09,760
if you're leasing you're gonna have to

650
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:14,710
cover minor repairs and regular

651
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:16,330
maintenance so it's great to know or to

652
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:19,870
plan beforehand to know that you have

653
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:23,260
that cash cash on hand and again for

654
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:28,240
capital improvements this is something

655
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:32,860
that you would it could be assessed at

656
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:34,630
the point of considering which

657
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:39,090
particular improvements that you might

658
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:42,070
be undertaking at a particular property

659
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:43,390
you need to know if you're going to be

660
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:44,620
making that investment that's generally

661
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:46,390
start-up costs if you're if you're

662
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:47,980
making a capital improvement you know

663
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:49,210
it's not considered as a business

664
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:53,350
expense but if you're going to be making

665
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:54,340
a significant investment in in a capital

666
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:55,780
B let's say you're building a greenhouse

667
00:32:54,340 --> 00:33:02,500
in a particular property that you're

668
00:32:55,780 --> 00:33:05,410
leasing or you're adding on to a barn it

669
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:07,390
pays to know where that money is coming

670
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:09,010
from and what the strategies that is

671
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:11,020
going to be for retaining equity and

672
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:12,910
that infrastructure improvement once it

673
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:15,940
is made in other words if you're paying

674
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:19,660
for a twenty-thousand-dollar barn

675
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:21,460
improvement and if you're leasing that

676
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:23,830
land what's going to happen when you

677
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:25,750
when the lease term expires how are you

678
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:27,640
going to be recouped for your investment

679
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:30,370
that you've made as the farmer tenant

680
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:33,760
and lease terms as kathy went over in

681
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:38,200
the last webinar the terms of your lease

682
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:40,090
can specify what what is the formula for

683
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,740
determining how

684
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:45,750
tenant farmer can get repaid for their

685
00:33:41,740 --> 00:34:00,070
investment and what are the terms that

686
00:33:45,750 --> 00:34:02,500
that go along with that so these are

687
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:05,350
just the 5 CS of credit if you if you do

688
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:07,990
decide to approach the loan office of

689
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:11,290
Finance here for credit in order to

690
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:13,899
purchase a property a conventional loan

691
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:16,030
officer is going to be evaluating your

692
00:34:13,899 --> 00:34:17,349
case based on these five criteria it

693
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:23,320
easier to remember the 5 CS of credit

694
00:34:17,349 --> 00:34:26,080
and again this is for most conventional

695
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:29,619
lenders whether it be the Farm Service

696
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:32,950
Agency state agricultural credit

697
00:34:29,619 --> 00:34:34,540
corporations or commercial banks they're

698
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:37,050
going to be looking at your character

699
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:42,760
capital conditions collateral capacity

700
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:45,820
now character lenders will be judging

701
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:47,619
you based on what you know how

702
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:50,139
professional you are presenting yourself

703
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:52,179
they're going to be for the most part

704
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:54,339
trying to get a sense of how well you

705
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:56,139
know your business if you're looking to

706
00:34:54,339 --> 00:34:58,180
acquire a farm in order to run a

707
00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:59,349
business you need to really know your

708
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:01,510
business well and so they're going to be

709
00:34:59,349 --> 00:35:03,640
asking you questions about how you

710
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:06,010
pertaining to how we try to get a gauge

711
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:07,560
and how well you know your business for

712
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:13,109
the boat for the most part though

713
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:16,450
lenders use the objective credit score

714
00:35:13,109 --> 00:35:19,330
to do to as a major measure of your

715
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:22,150
character lenders don't like to make

716
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:25,630
character judgments because they you

717
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:27,550
know they can get a really bad rep for

718
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:32,020
not extending a loan based on someone's

719
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:34,359
race or ethnicity or sex or and so on so

720
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:36,970
lenders do like to use the objective

721
00:35:34,359 --> 00:35:39,070
measure of your credit score when it

722
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:40,990
comes to judging your character in the

723
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:45,160
context of whether or not you can handle

724
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:48,369
alone so I guess the bottom line there

725
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:51,010
is that if your credit is poor and you

726
00:35:48,369 --> 00:35:53,050
hope to get a loan it's worthwhile to

727
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:58,030
try to build your credit

728
00:35:53,050 --> 00:36:01,780
and I'm definitely not an expert in

729
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:05,170
where to go to to to get help with that

730
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:08,350
I don't know if Cathy have you run into

731
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:10,270
that at all just general resources where

732
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:14,590
for that farmers can tap into to help

733
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:16,420
build their credit back to help build

734
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:20,350
their credit back if they have bad

735
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:26,800
credit not not really not any more so

736
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:30,550
than anybody else here in Vermont we

737
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:35,650
have a central vermont Community Action

738
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:38,880
Council various community based economic

739
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:43,060
development organizations that work with

740
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:45,120
with people on their taxes they work

741
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:47,170
with people counseling family budgeting

742
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,940
there are various community based

743
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:51,820
organizations that that offer free

744
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:54,370
financial counseling that you could go

745
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:56,080
to to help build your credit back up I'm

746
00:36:54,370 --> 00:37:03,160
here in Vermont I'm not sure about the

747
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:06,190
rest of the region here so moving on to

748
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:07,540
capital lenders are going to need to

749
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:09,970
know that what's on your balance sheet

750
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:13,630
they're going to need to know that do

751
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:17,380
you have assets that exceed the amount

752
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:20,440
that you're that you are taking out a

753
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:21,880
loan for are you primary they're going

754
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:25,870
to be looking at what kind of debt you

755
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:30,250
have already do you have do you have too

756
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:33,040
much debt to be taking on more and that

757
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:34,660
go that ties into capacity are you going

758
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:37,660
to have the capacity to actually repay a

759
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:40,080
loan and this is based on your income

760
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:43,810
streams based on your off-farm income

761
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:46,740
based on your info on farm income and

762
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:52,390
whether or not you could afford monthly

763
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:53,920
loan repayments and sometimes a lot of

764
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:57,580
the agricultural land lenders will

765
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:59,500
extend an interest-only loan for the

766
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:02,290
first couple years if they know that

767
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:04,720
your business model is not is not such

768
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:07,450
that it can cover principal and interest

769
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:10,180
just to start out I know farm

770
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:12,580
does that across the region and I

771
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:14,710
recently met with an FSA loan officer

772
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:16,180
and they do that as well that's

773
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:17,830
something to inquire into if you don't

774
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:19,300
have a capacity to repay principal and

775
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:22,150
interest you can get an interest only

776
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:25,320
loan that will convert into a regular

777
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:28,320
term loan or sometimes a balloon payment

778
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:32,170
based on your capacity to repay the loan

779
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:34,270
conditions is just referring to what

780
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:36,130
what are the basic market conditions

781
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:39,070
that surround the type of business that

782
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:40,740
you're that you're trying to start you

783
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:44,500
know does it make sense to grow bananas

784
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:46,720
in the Northeast if you go to a loan

785
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:49,260
officer and you want to have a banana

786
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:51,430
papaya operation are they going to

787
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:55,150
extend you a loan for that are the

788
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:57,400
conditions right for that maybe not or

789
00:38:55,150 --> 00:39:00,760
maybe you have a secret that you that no

790
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:02,530
one knows about yet I think there's a

791
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,420
lot of potential for example to grow

792
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:07,240
fish in greenhouses here in the

793
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:08,770
Northeast I'm not sure how crazy I'd

794
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:12,100
sound if I took that idea to a loan

795
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:13,390
officer but but I guess if you could

796
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:15,460
prove that conditions are such that

797
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:16,540
allow for fish culture and greenhouses

798
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:19,600
and that you've really done your

799
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:21,850
research again kind of time back to the

800
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:23,590
character issue then then you'll get

801
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:27,700
good marks for the for the conditions

802
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:31,750
aspect and collateral you you're going

803
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:33,120
to need to you know most loans for from

804
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:35,530
conventional lenders are securitized

805
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:38,440
meaning that you you must put up

806
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:41,290
collateral to guarantee the loan if you

807
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:45,280
have to default on a loan the bank has

808
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:47,800
right to just to liquefy your assets and

809
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:49,900
use that to repay the loan so they can

810
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:52,000
be looking at again what what kind of

811
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:54,040
capital do you have do you already have

812
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,070
own real estate you already own assets

813
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:58,840
do you already own livestock and what is

814
00:39:57,070 --> 00:40:01,900
saleable what what is the the what are

815
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:03,430
the the liquidity or replacement cost

816
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:07,060
for each of the assets that you own or

817
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:08,530
what are what are the values rather for

818
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:13,090
each of the assets that you own and and

819
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:14,440
could they be repossessed and sold in

820
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:18,730
order for the bank or the lender to

821
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:22,890
recoup the investment that they've made

822
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:22,890
a new in the form of a loan

823
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:32,760
so on to the second part of this webinar

824
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:42,220
take a 30 second break to stretch

825
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:44,740
anyone's like to grab a fresh of fresh

826
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:56,190
air or stretch a little bit now's the

827
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:56,190
time then there was a question earlier

828
00:40:57,210 --> 00:41:05,890
I'm just going to get back to that just

829
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:09,070
about when you were talking about the

830
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:12,610
percent reinvested into the farm being

831
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:16,540
part of the calculation for what you can

832
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:19,750
afford wondering if that should just be

833
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:21,460
part of the general farm budget so that

834
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:24,550
your net returns would have already

835
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:27,760
accounted for that that was always back

836
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:30,130
I don't know if you can address that or

837
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:33,910
would that you know investment actually

838
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:37,870
be um something that the landowner would

839
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:40,120
be you know deducting fearless because

840
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:44,440
you're you know investing in improving

841
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:46,800
their land or their infrastructure for

842
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,800
that matter

843
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:55,480
I'm sorry Jessie could you rephrase that

844
00:41:51,339 --> 00:41:57,940
question sure cuff is a little lengthy

845
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:00,550
but um if you scroll back in the chat

846
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:03,400
box there was a question from Susan

847
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:05,890
Peters about the percent reinvested into

848
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:11,349
the farm operations you were saying that

849
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:12,550
that should be subtracted when people

850
00:42:11,349 --> 00:42:16,569
are trying to figure out how much they

851
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:17,950
can afford to pay in the lease and it

852
00:42:16,569 --> 00:42:20,230
looks like Susan was just wondering

853
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:22,030
shouldn't that you know reinvestment

854
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:24,819
into the farm already to be part of your

855
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:27,400
farm budget and already included so that

856
00:42:24,819 --> 00:42:30,190
your net returns would reflect that I

857
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:32,940
think she was looking questioning why

858
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:34,780
that wasn't already you know

859
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:41,380
incorporated when you're figuring out

860
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:44,819
your net returns from the farm yeah it's

861
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:49,540
it's the same general concept they your

862
00:42:44,819 --> 00:42:52,390
your net your net income from your farm

863
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:56,859
operation is going to be revenues minus

864
00:42:52,390 --> 00:43:00,280
expenses so that's the only reason why I

865
00:42:56,859 --> 00:43:01,450
separated those to the the amount the

866
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:04,119
the money that you're going to take

867
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:05,770
after all expenses are paid and reinvest

868
00:43:04,119 --> 00:43:07,240
into your farm operation is not usually

869
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:12,190
considered an expense that's the only

870
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:14,740
reason I I I separated it out it's it's

871
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:17,530
good it's great for farmers to think

872
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:19,930
about income reinvested into their farm

873
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:22,809
operation as an actual expense and have

874
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:25,869
a regular habit of reinvesting in come

875
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:27,880
into their farm business but it's you

876
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:29,349
know it's generally perceived as

877
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:32,079
something that happens after you've

878
00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:33,819
figured for your fixed and operating

879
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:36,339
expenses of the farm business so it's

880
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:39,160
right so this is beyond just you know

881
00:43:36,339 --> 00:43:43,329
maintenance and doing what you need to

882
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:46,150
do to get your your crop to market this

883
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:48,760
is reinvestment that that's going to

884
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:52,329
improve improve the land or

885
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:54,430
infrastructure so and I guess the

886
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:58,450
question is when the landowners somehow

887
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:59,920
be responsible for that or accounting

888
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:02,700
for that if you're actually improving

889
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,700
their property

890
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:13,900
sure if if you are actually improving

891
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:19,570
their property than you then it's

892
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:21,369
definitely not a cost so it would be

893
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:25,359
factored into into that kind of equation

894
00:44:21,369 --> 00:44:26,530
a little bit differently if you can

895
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:31,060
somehow value of the improvement that

896
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:36,670
you're making you can definitely deduct

897
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:38,260
that from a cash rental payment that

898
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:40,420
you're negotiating Cassie can I just

899
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:42,400
comment on that I think it depends on

900
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:44,680
the nature of the agreement between the

901
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:47,619
landlord and the tenant if you're making

902
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:51,690
an improvement that the landlord is not

903
00:44:47,619 --> 00:44:54,310
willing to accept a shared cost or the

904
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:59,530
residual value of it then it would be

905
00:44:54,310 --> 00:45:01,119
your expense and appreciated or whatever

906
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:03,640
and I'm not a business person but in

907
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:05,920
terms of the nature of the relationship

908
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:07,690
between the landlord and the tenant that

909
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:11,770
would be true on the other hand as

910
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:16,540
landlord might be willing to either

911
00:45:11,770 --> 00:45:20,830
share in the cost of it for a sign that

912
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:24,040
your cost as Ben was saying it take that

913
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:26,050
into consideration when the lease fee is

914
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:27,940
being calculated so it wouldn't be

915
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:34,170
automatically one way or the other I

916
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:34,170
don't think okay I'm signing off

917
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:44,549
yeah and thanks Cathy and these these

918
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:47,249
formulas that we're using in these

919
00:45:44,549 --> 00:45:49,229
methods that can be used to determine a

920
00:45:47,249 --> 00:45:53,359
cash rental rate or not are not only set

921
00:45:49,229 --> 00:45:56,279
in stone they're really just references

922
00:45:53,359 --> 00:46:00,479
for for both landowners and farmers to

923
00:45:56,279 --> 00:46:02,309
use two reference points to use in the

924
00:46:00,479 --> 00:46:07,019
negotiation process of determining a

925
00:46:02,309 --> 00:46:09,029
fair rental rate it really depends on

926
00:46:07,019 --> 00:46:10,319
the priorities of both the landowner and

927
00:46:09,029 --> 00:46:13,019
the farmer and the needs of both the

928
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:19,799
farmer in the landowner to determine an

929
00:46:13,019 --> 00:46:22,799
actual working cash rental rate and we

930
00:46:19,799 --> 00:46:24,569
we went over this in the last webinar

931
00:46:22,799 --> 00:46:27,479
I'm not sure if we want to take time to

932
00:46:24,569 --> 00:46:29,249
go through that again the various ways

933
00:46:27,479 --> 00:46:37,019
to determine a cash rental rate I know

934
00:46:29,249 --> 00:46:38,999
it's a popular question so if we if

935
00:46:37,019 --> 00:46:45,479
anyone wants to speak up if they'd like

936
00:46:38,999 --> 00:46:48,390
to go over that again please let me know

937
00:46:45,479 --> 00:46:50,660
or else we'll just go through the next

938
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:50,660
set of slides

939
00:46:55,290 --> 00:47:05,950
and I'm just scrolling through the chat

940
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:11,920
box here until I haven't just catch up

941
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:15,640
here for another minute dance break good

942
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:17,080
I'm glad someone was dancing and we

943
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:20,080
definitely can get copies of the slides

944
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:24,730
is that right Jessie you want to address

945
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:27,190
that question will you be sending out a

946
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:28,839
follow-up email to everyone here for a

947
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:33,220
link to the recording of this

948
00:47:28,839 --> 00:47:35,190
presentation or I'm not sure if you send

949
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:46,690
out the actual PowerPoint slides to

950
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:47,980
participants okay so proper so when

951
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:49,119
you're assessing a particular let's say

952
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:51,670
you have gone through all the

953
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:53,950
preparedness concepts and you're you're

954
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:56,770
ready to really home in and look at

955
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:58,720
particular parcels of land whether

956
00:47:56,770 --> 00:48:01,240
you're leasing whether you plan to

957
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:03,460
purchase or whether you plan to get onto

958
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:06,480
the land in any of the other ways that

959
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:10,000
Kathy mentioned in the last webinar so

960
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:11,349
there are basic things to look at you

961
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,720
want to be looking at natural features

962
00:48:11,349 --> 00:48:16,660
of the land and you can really get into

963
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:20,109
depth into and some science into looking

964
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:23,530
at the natural features that exist it's

965
00:48:20,109 --> 00:48:24,790
really a fascinating discipline you want

966
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:28,119
to take a close look at whatever

967
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:30,099
infrastructure exists you want to take a

968
00:48:28,119 --> 00:48:31,810
close look at whatever Barnes exists or

969
00:48:30,099 --> 00:48:34,830
whatever fencing exists or whatever

970
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:38,320
equipment that might be available to you

971
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:39,849
to assess what needs to go into that

972
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:41,290
what what kind of repairs and

973
00:48:39,849 --> 00:48:43,420
maintenance what kind of major overhauls

974
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:45,070
need to go into that on what are the

975
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:47,020
costs you know we talked about this

976
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:50,410
already what are the costs they're going

977
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:51,339
to be associated with owning or or using

978
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:55,000
that piece of equipment or

979
00:48:51,339 --> 00:48:56,530
infrastructure the financial

980
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,900
considerations we'll talk a little bit

981
00:48:56,530 --> 00:49:00,400
more about taxes and how to assess taxes

982
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:02,020
on a particular property where to go to

983
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,550
do that and some of the other

984
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:05,910
considerations involved in that and

985
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:08,609
we'll also talk about community and

986
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:13,440
surroundings

987
00:49:08,609 --> 00:49:18,310
so as you probably all know there are

988
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:25,060
lots of natural variations in in farm in

989
00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:27,850
farmland and land in general it these

990
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:29,920
are just some of them on the list soil

991
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:33,190
is is a huge one and we'll talk about

992
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:36,790
that how you can assess soils will go on

993
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:41,700
a little web torus is that if that works

994
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:45,070
for you guys in a minute here topography

995
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:47,520
microclimates is often underestimated

996
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:50,550
what's what are what are the different

997
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:53,230
hardiness zones this ties into climate

998
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:56,950
you need to know what what hardiness

999
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:58,660
zone you're looking in what what if you

1000
00:49:56,950 --> 00:50:01,450
if you plan on doing vegetables or fruit

1001
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:03,940
trees or other crops what what hardiness

1002
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:05,560
zones can they be grown in but within

1003
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:07,450
each RT is known there's going to be

1004
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:09,430
micro climates are you on a south-facing

1005
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:12,310
slope that's going to that's going to

1006
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:13,660
warm up first in the spring if you're

1007
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:17,410
going fruit trees that might have

1008
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:19,000
implications for frost for having your

1009
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:21,400
flowers and fruit cheese be susceptible

1010
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,530
to frost bite because everything thaws

1011
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:25,750
out on the south-facing hillside first

1012
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:27,400
but then you get one or two freak

1013
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:30,220
freezes and then all your flowers are

1014
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:31,690
gone you know you really want to look at

1015
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:35,020
the topography and how they tie into

1016
00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:37,690
micro climates water is huge what how

1017
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:41,230
you know if water if water does not

1018
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:42,609
exist it maybe not might not be a parcel

1019
00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:45,070
that's worth looking at or at least if

1020
00:50:42,609 --> 00:50:47,590
it does not exist what are the costs

1021
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:50,680
that that you might have to take on in

1022
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:52,619
drilling a well or in gaining asset

1023
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:54,850
access to water from other sources

1024
00:50:52,619 --> 00:50:56,680
there's a lot that can be done with

1025
00:50:54,850 --> 00:51:00,280
spring development and I've gotten this

1026
00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:02,230
question a lot lately a a piece of

1027
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:04,060
online can have a sheep on the hillside

1028
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:06,460
and that can be your water source but

1029
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:08,220
you do need to assess what what needs to

1030
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:10,570
be done to that is it feasible to

1031
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:13,750
develop a spring out of that water

1032
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:16,119
source can you dig a trench on the on

1033
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:18,820
the hillside there and funnel more water

1034
00:51:16,119 --> 00:51:20,290
into a reservoir Natural Resource

1035
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:21,470
Conservation Service is an excellent

1036
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:26,030
resource

1037
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:27,740
they have plans and schematics for how

1038
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:29,000
you can go about doing that and you

1039
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:33,230
might be able to get you might be able

1040
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:35,390
to consult with an NRCS specialists in

1041
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:36,859
your state or your County who might be

1042
00:51:35,390 --> 00:51:40,760
able to come out to the to the farm that

1043
00:51:36,859 --> 00:51:43,490
you're looking at and assess how water

1044
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:45,770
resources can be conserved how flow of

1045
00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:48,500
spring can be Springs there can be

1046
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:53,210
increased how you might be able to tap

1047
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:56,720
into river resources and you know enable

1048
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:59,810
yourself to be independent from town or

1049
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:07,730
village water and and utilize the water

1050
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:12,290
that exists on site vegetation a big

1051
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:16,340
question or a common question is is it

1052
00:52:12,290 --> 00:52:18,290
is it feasible to clear forests you know

1053
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:21,680
we have we have really cheap forest land

1054
00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:23,510
that that's evelio we this this land is

1055
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,830
being sold for next to nothing and if we

1056
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:29,540
buy that land we can just clear the

1057
00:52:24,830 --> 00:52:34,010
forest and that I am NOT a forester I'm

1058
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:35,300
not a logger so the the actual costs

1059
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:38,510
associated with clearing forests the

1060
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:40,970
actual impacts of clearing forests would

1061
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:43,180
depend on what's there to begin with but

1062
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:46,010
generally speaking I tell people that

1063
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:48,589
it's often not cost-effective to clear

1064
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:50,180
forests that exists it's the the money

1065
00:52:48,589 --> 00:52:52,190
that you're going to save in the

1066
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:57,200
purchase price of land is not going to

1067
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:58,760
surpass what you're going to spend in

1068
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:01,130
clearing for us in the environmental

1069
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:03,170
degradation that's going to ensue from

1070
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:06,380
you clearing a particular piece of

1071
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:07,520
property and then again it depends on

1072
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:08,270
your timeline if your look if you're

1073
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,339
doing if you're talking about a

1074
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:12,589
short-term lease it's often yeah I

1075
00:53:10,339 --> 00:53:14,330
haven't haven't come across any cases

1076
00:53:12,589 --> 00:53:17,510
where it's really worth it to clear for

1077
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:18,950
us to enable cropping but if you do have

1078
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:22,810
a longer term horizon it might be

1079
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:22,810
feasible to do that little by little

1080
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,770
more about soils

1081
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:35,490
can you guys see my arrow here and maybe

1082
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:39,390
I can use this thing here you can see my

1083
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:41,850
little wand here you are looking at soil

1084
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:44,160
profiles we're looking what exists

1085
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:45,330
underneath the surface of the soil

1086
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:47,400
you're going to be if you're going out

1087
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:52,860
to assess particular property you me

1088
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:56,940
walk in the land and oh no slide or one

1089
00:53:52,860 --> 00:54:02,540
visible hmm is anyone that that can see

1090
00:53:56,940 --> 00:54:07,050
my wand here can anyone else see my wand

1091
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:12,860
hey Ben to use that you actually need to

1092
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:15,060
click it'll put a there you go a dot and

1093
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:19,560
that's going to move over time you click

1094
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:24,380
to a new spot okay well that's the

1095
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:28,380
surface of the soil we're looking at and

1096
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:29,940
this is the the the depth of the soil

1097
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:31,590
this is about we're looking at about two

1098
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:34,080
feet underneath the surface right here

1099
00:54:31,590 --> 00:54:38,760
at that dot maybe about three feet right

1100
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:41,490
underneath there and obviously if you're

1101
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:44,220
standing right here you might not be

1102
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:49,380
able to to understand what exists right

1103
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:51,510
here I do suggest that if you're if

1104
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:53,000
you're seriously considering owning or

1105
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:56,460
leasing a piece of property that you

1106
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:58,200
obtain permission from the owner before

1107
00:54:56,460 --> 00:55:00,990
you before you start probing into soil

1108
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:02,580
but you do take the time and energy to

1109
00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:04,910
probe down into the soil whether that be

1110
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:07,110
digging a small ditch with this shovel

1111
00:55:04,910 --> 00:55:10,860
whether that be using some of the tools

1112
00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:12,990
they're shown here this is a small two

1113
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:14,880
foot soil probe that can be used for

1114
00:55:12,990 --> 00:55:17,970
taking tiny little corium about the size

1115
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:19,680
of your your thumb you can get small

1116
00:55:17,970 --> 00:55:23,160
soil cores if you if you probe down

1117
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:25,370
about a foot or two this is a bucket

1118
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:25,370
auger

1119
00:55:29,109 --> 00:55:35,869
and this can be used for probing down

1120
00:55:33,349 --> 00:55:39,559
about 5 or 6 feet depending on the the

1121
00:55:35,869 --> 00:55:41,569
length of the handle here are and a lot

1122
00:55:39,559 --> 00:55:45,319
of times University land-grant

1123
00:55:41,569 --> 00:55:46,790
universities have these NRCS soil

1124
00:55:45,319 --> 00:55:48,440
scientists have these they might be able

1125
00:55:46,790 --> 00:55:50,329
to come out to your site it costs about

1126
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:53,329
one hundred fifty dollars two to three

1127
00:55:50,329 --> 00:55:55,220
hundred dollars this this bucket augers

1128
00:55:53,329 --> 00:55:57,049
is a lot more expensive than this this

1129
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:59,960
piece of equipment here is about thirty

1130
00:55:57,049 --> 00:56:02,480
dollars that can be used and of course a

1131
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:04,010
garden shovel works but you want to

1132
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,450
obtain permission to be able to look at

1133
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:10,599
the soils that you might be dealing with

1134
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:10,599
this soil here is going to have

1135
00:56:10,930 --> 00:56:14,599
tremendously different implications

1136
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:17,299
using the soil than this would this this

1137
00:56:14,599 --> 00:56:20,000
year is is known as into Saul it's a

1138
00:56:17,299 --> 00:56:22,640
very young soil it's extremely nutrient

1139
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:25,040
deficient it's extremely sandy it might

1140
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:28,280
be great for some uses if you can amend

1141
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:30,799
enough nutrients but because it is well

1142
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:33,890
drained this soil on the other hand is

1143
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:35,809
is a I think it's a picture from the

1144
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:39,380
Midwest the breadbasket region where

1145
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:40,490
it's a tremendously vertel soil this is

1146
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:42,520
probably what you're going to be seeing

1147
00:56:40,490 --> 00:56:45,980
more in the northeast of New England

1148
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:50,030
areas it's a little bit younger of a

1149
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:51,920
soil it's going to be a probably a lot

1150
00:56:50,030 --> 00:56:55,160
more sandy than you then you'd find out

1151
00:56:51,920 --> 00:57:00,440
in the Midwest but oftentimes you do

1152
00:56:55,160 --> 00:57:02,390
find this soil on the right side is is a

1153
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:03,799
visit you can see the cracks down the

1154
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:07,910
middle here is due to the high clay

1155
00:57:03,799 --> 00:57:09,440
content and you know this is gonna be a

1156
00:57:07,910 --> 00:57:13,910
tremendous the Clay's of tremendously

1157
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:16,670
heavy soil that's going to be very hard

1158
00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:19,299
to work especially in the spring so it

1159
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:21,680
really pays to dig down from the surface

1160
00:57:19,299 --> 00:57:23,270
get to feel the soils that you'd be

1161
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:25,339
working with get to know them a little

1162
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:32,299
better and don't let your soils be a

1163
00:57:25,339 --> 00:57:35,000
secret um so let's talk a little bit

1164
00:57:32,299 --> 00:57:38,720
more about assessing soils you can use

1165
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:40,849
the online web soil survey as a tool for

1166
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:46,220
assessing site soils

1167
00:57:40,849 --> 00:57:56,269
and we'll try to launch a little web

1168
00:57:46,220 --> 00:58:33,289
tour here and see if this works bear

1169
00:57:56,269 --> 00:58:35,720
with me for a second here okay so please

1170
00:58:33,289 --> 00:58:43,069
indicate with the smiley faces as you

1171
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:45,829
can see this page the usda nrcs you see

1172
00:58:43,069 --> 00:58:48,979
it Jessica so so great you guys can see

1173
00:58:45,829 --> 00:58:51,859
this this is a tremendously useful tool

1174
00:58:48,979 --> 00:58:52,880
that's offered by united states

1175
00:58:51,859 --> 00:58:56,119
department of agriculture and natural

1176
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:58,069
resource conservation service and what

1177
00:58:56,119 --> 00:59:00,559
the Natural Resource Conservation

1178
00:58:58,069 --> 00:59:07,910
Service has done all over the nation is

1179
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:11,529
that they've surveyed soils I'm sorry

1180
00:59:07,910 --> 00:59:11,529
that's some of you can't see this

1181
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:16,579
hopefully we can get that resolved sweet

1182
00:59:14,119 --> 00:59:19,759
so they've surveyed soils all over the

1183
00:59:16,579 --> 00:59:21,650
nation they did this back in the 60s

1184
00:59:19,759 --> 00:59:24,140
when there's a big effort isn't as a

1185
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:26,150
civilian conservation corps or some big

1186
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:27,769
federal program that enabled soil

1187
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:31,880
scientists to go out all over the nation

1188
00:59:27,769 --> 00:59:34,239
and catalog soils and since then the the

1189
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:37,460
surveys have gotten a more detailed and

1190
00:59:34,239 --> 00:59:41,119
and they become digitized which is a

1191
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:44,119
great advantage for us online users you

1192
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:52,059
can go into into the web soil survey the

1193
00:59:44,119 --> 00:59:52,059
click on this screen button here um

1194
00:59:53,930 --> 01:00:05,490
and try this so I I've tried this before

1195
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:07,680
of a webinar it's tough to to go through

1196
01:00:05,490 --> 01:00:10,130
this but you can click on the state

1197
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:13,020
where your way you're in you can use the

1198
01:00:10,130 --> 01:00:15,300
navigation tools over on the left to

1199
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:17,160
enter your address and what you do first

1200
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:18,510
is you enter your address your area of

1201
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:20,790
interest which means you're basically

1202
01:00:18,510 --> 01:00:24,180
I'm sorry I can't display this over the

1203
01:00:20,790 --> 01:00:25,740
webinar but you're basically the once

1204
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:27,690
you type in an address or location will

1205
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:31,820
give you an aerial map and you can draw

1206
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:34,410
a rectangle using this first screen here

1207
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:36,359
you can draw a rectangle or a shape over

1208
01:00:34,410 --> 01:00:38,700
the area where you're looking to assess

1209
01:00:36,359 --> 01:00:41,430
as the property you're interested in and

1210
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:44,220
then within that rectangle it will

1211
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:48,390
divide up the different soil types and

1212
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:50,640
you can then investigate the soil types

1213
01:00:48,390 --> 01:00:54,000
that exist there you can click on the

1214
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:57,480
tabs here you can click on the soil map

1215
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,920
and again i'm sorry i can't do that but

1216
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:01,109
you can you can click on the soil data

1217
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:02,670
explorer to learn a lot more about the

1218
01:01:01,109 --> 01:01:06,869
potential for the particular soils that

1219
01:01:02,670 --> 01:01:14,339
are on site there if you know the series

1220
01:01:06,869 --> 01:01:17,089
name let me try to launch another web

1221
01:01:14,339 --> 01:01:17,089
tour here

1222
01:01:25,059 --> 01:01:31,450
for the sake of time I'm not going to

1223
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:34,099
get into the nitty-gritty of soil series

1224
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:37,099
but basically if you could every soil

1225
01:01:34,099 --> 01:01:39,289
series has an every soil type down to

1226
01:01:37,099 --> 01:01:42,829
the most detailed classification has a

1227
01:01:39,289 --> 01:01:44,270
series name associated with it you know

1228
01:01:42,829 --> 01:01:46,940
and their conventional names based on

1229
01:01:44,270 --> 01:01:48,470
geography it might be the state bird or

1230
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:51,380
something like that is the name of the

1231
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:53,420
soil it might be the town name where the

1232
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:56,569
soils predominantly exist but once you

1233
01:01:53,420 --> 01:02:00,859
have that soil series name you can enter

1234
01:01:56,569 --> 01:02:02,420
it you can do and you go to the nrcs

1235
01:02:00,859 --> 01:02:05,809
Natural Resource Conservation Service

1236
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:09,920
website and you you can do a search

1237
01:02:05,809 --> 01:02:12,609
there for for for soils series

1238
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:14,809
description and you can enter in the

1239
01:02:12,609 --> 01:02:17,660
soil series name and get a full

1240
01:02:14,809 --> 01:02:20,599
description of the soil and how it acts

1241
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:22,549
what kind of drainage it has what kind

1242
01:02:20,599 --> 01:02:25,010
of crops grow there in the native

1243
01:02:22,549 --> 01:02:26,990
habitat and all kinds of other other

1244
01:02:25,010 --> 01:02:29,660
factors you know how deep the soil is to

1245
01:02:26,990 --> 01:02:32,059
bedrock into water table what kind of

1246
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:35,390
soil is it is a sandy soil is a clay

1247
01:02:32,059 --> 01:02:38,270
soils are predominated by silt you can

1248
01:02:35,390 --> 01:02:40,569
really learn a ton from knowing what

1249
01:02:38,270 --> 01:02:44,630
soil series exists in the particular

1250
01:02:40,569 --> 01:02:46,880
parcels that you're interested and again

1251
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:48,589
you can do some detailed probing and

1252
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:51,230
again have permission before you do this

1253
01:02:48,589 --> 01:02:56,390
and try to cover up the holes that

1254
01:02:51,230 --> 01:03:00,559
you've dug for building purposes if you

1255
01:02:56,390 --> 01:03:01,579
are looking to lease or own land and you

1256
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:05,089
and you know that you might need

1257
01:03:01,579 --> 01:03:08,089
buildings most states have permitting

1258
01:03:05,089 --> 01:03:11,480
requirements for erecting buildings for

1259
01:03:08,089 --> 01:03:15,160
for making the for building dwellings

1260
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:17,569
especially and the permits usually

1261
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:19,369
relate to what kind of septic systems

1262
01:03:17,569 --> 01:03:21,380
what kind of wastewater disposal systems

1263
01:03:19,369 --> 01:03:23,359
are going to need to be installed

1264
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:26,539
on-site according to the regulations

1265
01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:28,069
that each state has so in Vermont here

1266
01:03:26,539 --> 01:03:30,079
it's the Department of Environmental

1267
01:03:28,069 --> 01:03:32,480
Conservation wastewater management

1268
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:36,349
division that handles those permanent

1269
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:37,740
regulations and there's you know it's in

1270
01:03:36,349 --> 01:03:39,600
all of these states

1271
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:41,400
it's these are laws that have been

1272
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:42,780
passed so this is public information you

1273
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:46,590
can have dig into the law that was

1274
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:47,910
passed related to the requirements that

1275
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:50,400
are needed to install a septic system

1276
01:03:47,910 --> 01:03:51,960
and you can say okay if I want to put a

1277
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:54,000
one bedroom house I'm going to need to

1278
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:55,560
build this size septic system that's all

1279
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:59,280
that's all been written into law at one

1280
01:03:55,560 --> 01:04:01,230
time or another and then the states have

1281
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:03,230
various permitting processes to in order

1282
01:04:01,230 --> 01:04:05,850
to for the state to give the go-ahead

1283
01:04:03,230 --> 01:04:13,200
for you to build or not but it really

1284
01:04:05,850 --> 01:04:14,910
all depends on soils so the the

1285
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:16,170
particular soils that exists on site are

1286
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:18,930
going to determine the potential for

1287
01:04:16,170 --> 01:04:22,020
building potential for for installing a

1288
01:04:18,930 --> 01:04:26,970
septic system or a potable water supply

1289
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:28,920
system so oftentimes if you're looking

1290
01:04:26,970 --> 01:04:32,460
to purchase if you're set to purchase

1291
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:34,170
land the before you actually sign a

1292
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:35,880
contractor you'll sign the purchase and

1293
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:36,960
sales agreement which is a contract that

1294
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:40,080
says you're going to purchase the

1295
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:44,550
property based on the contingency that

1296
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:46,380
the site passes a percolation test based

1297
01:04:44,550 --> 01:04:48,330
on the soils will exist there so that's

1298
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:51,710
you know that's often a condition that

1299
01:04:48,330 --> 01:04:56,190
will exist within your purchase contract

1300
01:04:51,710 --> 01:04:57,840
and it's generally not wise to to

1301
01:04:56,190 --> 01:05:00,180
purchase a property if you don't know

1302
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:01,560
that it's going to percolate that it's

1303
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:03,450
going to pass these certain tests that

1304
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:05,040
are going to allow you for building some

1305
01:05:03,450 --> 01:05:07,740
cases you might not care at all you

1306
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:10,050
might not have you might not really care

1307
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:15,000
about building or the potential do so in

1308
01:05:10,050 --> 01:05:16,800
that case this does not apply there are

1309
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:19,470
other ways to assess various natural

1310
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:21,869
features or properties in Vermont we

1311
01:05:19,470 --> 01:05:23,369
have a service that's it's an online

1312
01:05:21,869 --> 01:05:26,790
service that's run by the agency of

1313
01:05:23,369 --> 01:05:31,320
natural resources I'm not sure if other

1314
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:33,900
states have this kind of service but you

1315
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:36,240
you're able to get online and search

1316
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:37,290
through all of these if you have a

1317
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,910
particular property in mind you're

1318
01:05:37,290 --> 01:05:42,090
you're able to build through all of

1319
01:05:38,910 --> 01:05:43,320
these variables and learn more about

1320
01:05:42,090 --> 01:05:45,720
your particular property again there be

1321
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:48,720
an aerial map associated with it with

1322
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:50,700
your search and you can have different

1323
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:51,460
layers and determine whether or not

1324
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:53,830
storm

1325
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:56,890
water permits are needed if the areas

1326
01:05:53,830 --> 01:05:58,930
have been demarcated as wildlife habitat

1327
01:05:56,890 --> 01:06:02,080
or not if there's sensitive wetlands

1328
01:05:58,930 --> 01:06:03,850
there if there's legal permits that have

1329
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:07,270
been issued according to environmental

1330
01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:11,220
uses all kinds of things can be learned

1331
01:06:07,270 --> 01:06:11,220
about properties by using that service

1332
01:06:13,290 --> 01:06:18,340
again you want to assess the quality of

1333
01:06:17,170 --> 01:06:22,450
infrastructure that you're going to be

1334
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:23,980
dealing with well whether how much are

1335
01:06:22,450 --> 01:06:26,670
you going to be how much do you estimate

1336
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:28,870
putting into repairing and maintaining

1337
01:06:26,670 --> 01:06:31,660
all the equipment that you're about to

1338
01:06:28,870 --> 01:06:33,010
acquire or make use of or all the

1339
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:35,320
buildings that you're about to inhabit

1340
01:06:33,010 --> 01:06:37,390
or use as storage sheds what what are

1341
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:38,530
you going to have to do what's what are

1342
01:06:37,390 --> 01:06:39,550
you going to have to build their what

1343
01:06:38,530 --> 01:06:44,020
kind of roof are you going to have to

1344
01:06:39,550 --> 01:06:45,250
repair and you know what's what are the

1345
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:48,220
repairs and manage and how can they be

1346
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:51,900
distinguished from the major overhauls

1347
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:54,460
and upgrades that need to happen this is

1348
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:58,660
important especially if you're

1349
01:06:54,460 --> 01:07:02,170
developing a lease agreement to agree

1350
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:04,870
with with the landowner what is

1351
01:07:02,170 --> 01:07:08,050
considered a major overhaul versus a

1352
01:07:04,870 --> 01:07:09,760
routine maintenance of most commonly the

1353
01:07:08,050 --> 01:07:11,620
farmer tenant is expected to handle

1354
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:15,040
route between and cover the cost of

1355
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:16,840
routine maintenance and repairs whereas

1356
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:20,610
if it's a major overhaul that's going to

1357
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:23,860
considerably alter the value of an asset

1358
01:07:20,610 --> 01:07:25,300
if it's a major repair you're replacing

1359
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:27,580
an engine and a tractor or something

1360
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:29,260
that's going to really increase the

1361
01:07:27,580 --> 01:07:31,330
value of that tractor by three thousand

1362
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:34,260
dollars or it's it's it's obviously a

1363
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:36,850
major overhaul the landowners usually

1364
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:40,530
are expected to cover that cost unless

1365
01:07:36,850 --> 01:07:40,530
you have a specific agreement otherwise

1366
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:46,300
so a lot of times it's obvious but the

1367
01:07:44,710 --> 01:07:48,730
bottom line is that a lot of times it's

1368
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:50,860
not and it's really worthwhile to have a

1369
01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:52,810
conversation about what is maintenance

1370
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:55,230
what what needs to be repaired and what

1371
01:07:52,810 --> 01:07:58,510
needs to be overhauled in a major way

1372
01:07:55,230 --> 01:08:00,610
and again there there are some

1373
01:07:58,510 --> 01:08:03,160
permitting issues involved in major

1374
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:05,200
construction if you are building a road

1375
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:07,089
for instance to access a particular

1376
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:09,670
property you might need to look into the

1377
01:08:07,089 --> 01:08:12,130
town permitting regulations there might

1378
01:08:09,670 --> 01:08:15,250
be state permits involved in disturbing

1379
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:17,170
a certain amount of soil in Vermont for

1380
01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:19,029
example if you disturb more than one

1381
01:08:17,170 --> 01:08:20,469
acre of soil on with the development you

1382
01:08:19,029 --> 01:08:24,130
need a special permit you need an act

1383
01:08:20,469 --> 01:08:27,640
250 you need to go through and an act

1384
01:08:24,130 --> 01:08:36,130
250 permit with sediment and erosion

1385
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:41,770
control plans in place so back to the

1386
01:08:36,130 --> 01:08:43,569
tax issue and this might sound

1387
01:08:41,770 --> 01:08:46,870
repetitive but again it's extremely

1388
01:08:43,569 --> 01:08:49,660
important to assess what are the taxes

1389
01:08:46,870 --> 01:08:53,440
you be paying on a particular parcel and

1390
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:57,989
this speaks to if you're purchasing a

1391
01:08:53,440 --> 01:09:00,219
little bit more than if you are leasing

1392
01:08:57,989 --> 01:09:01,569
again going back a few slides you get

1393
01:09:00,219 --> 01:09:03,730
even get a tax deduction if you're

1394
01:09:01,569 --> 01:09:05,410
leasing land if you're if you own land

1395
01:09:03,730 --> 01:09:11,350
you're going to be paying a lot of Texas

1396
01:09:05,410 --> 01:09:13,989
and again a vermont-based example there

1397
01:09:11,350 --> 01:09:16,350
is a special program here that allows

1398
01:09:13,989 --> 01:09:19,000
farmers in certain cases to get a

1399
01:09:16,350 --> 01:09:23,560
significant tax benefit if they are

1400
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:25,270
actively farming here in Vermont it's

1401
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:27,130
called the Vermont use value appraisal

1402
01:09:25,270 --> 01:09:28,900
program and you can get information

1403
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:31,569
about that at the Vermont State

1404
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:33,160
Department of taxes as you can get

1405
01:09:31,569 --> 01:09:36,069
information at the various State

1406
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:38,259
Department of taxes wherever you're from

1407
01:09:36,069 --> 01:09:41,859
or wherever you're you're looking at

1408
01:09:38,259 --> 01:09:43,750
properties and at the department of

1409
01:09:41,859 --> 01:09:45,759
taxes you'll find eligibility

1410
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:49,420
requirements for getting into these tax

1411
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:51,160
benefit programs for example in Vermont

1412
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:53,739
if you're going to enroll agricultural

1413
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:56,020
land that land has to be producing two

1414
01:09:53,739 --> 01:09:58,900
thousand dollars worth of income for

1415
01:09:56,020 --> 01:10:03,760
with regard sorry gross revenue for the

1416
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:05,080
farmer per year once once the farmer on

1417
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:06,250
that land is making more than two

1418
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:09,400
thousand dollars a year from

1419
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:10,930
agricultural products the land can be

1420
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:12,219
enrolled in the tax benefit program that

1421
01:10:10,930 --> 01:10:14,770
means the town is not going to be able

1422
01:10:12,219 --> 01:10:19,150
to assess that land at fair market value

1423
01:10:14,770 --> 01:10:21,790
for taxes here land is often

1424
01:10:19,150 --> 01:10:23,770
test it about ten to twenty percent a

1425
01:10:21,790 --> 01:10:25,630
fair market value for tax purposes

1426
01:10:23,770 --> 01:10:27,940
that's you know it's a significant

1427
01:10:25,630 --> 01:10:31,210
savings to get into these tax benefit

1428
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:33,400
programs for forest land another example

1429
01:10:31,210 --> 01:10:35,440
here in Vermont you need more than 25

1430
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:38,530
acres of continued contiguous forest

1431
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:41,800
land in order for you to enroll that

1432
01:10:38,530 --> 01:10:44,560
land in the tax benefit program farm

1433
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:47,500
buildings can be a step assessed at zero

1434
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:51,130
percent tax value it again it all

1435
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:52,770
depends on the particular program where

1436
01:10:51,130 --> 01:10:55,239
you reside or where you're looking and

1437
01:10:52,770 --> 01:11:00,460
there is potential for housing for farm

1438
01:10:55,239 --> 01:11:02,739
employees to be taxed at zero percent

1439
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:05,110
base in other words housing for our

1440
01:11:02,739 --> 01:11:10,000
employees is not text if it's enrolled

1441
01:11:05,110 --> 01:11:12,340
in the tax benefit program and this this

1442
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:15,730
is for example here and promote this is

1443
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:19,120
special to are specific to where there's

1444
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:22,270
a and employee relationship this would

1445
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:24,699
not apply for a tenant for a farmer

1446
01:11:22,270 --> 01:11:27,480
who's renting a house on a piece of

1447
01:11:24,699 --> 01:11:31,560
farmland if you're renting a house that

1448
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:34,120
and you're not an employee of a farm you

1449
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:37,719
know that that house is going to still

1450
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:39,719
be taxed at normal fair market value but

1451
01:11:37,719 --> 01:11:44,830
again that's a Vermont specific example

1452
01:11:39,719 --> 01:11:46,390
I don't know if caffeine olds any more

1453
01:11:44,830 --> 01:11:48,190
about the other states programs or if

1454
01:11:46,390 --> 01:11:51,449
there any if there's any major

1455
01:11:48,190 --> 01:11:51,449
differences to what I just mentioned

1456
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:57,750
Kathy are you available

1457
01:12:03,729 --> 01:12:06,729
ok

1458
01:12:09,770 --> 01:12:16,600
I'll come back to that let's see the

1459
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:28,400
town office is a wealth of information

1460
01:12:22,990 --> 01:12:32,710
if you're talking about taxes you can

1461
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:35,270
get at at the town you can get the exact

1462
01:12:32,710 --> 01:12:36,890
map and the exact acreage that the

1463
01:12:35,270 --> 01:12:38,750
town's going off of for you know what

1464
01:12:36,890 --> 01:12:39,980
what what the acreage is of the

1465
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:42,530
particular parcel that they're assessing

1466
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:44,810
it's not necessarily the actual acreage

1467
01:12:42,530 --> 01:12:46,280
that exists on a particular parcel for

1468
01:12:44,810 --> 01:12:47,660
actual acreage you're going to need to

1469
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:51,560
have a professional soil or a

1470
01:12:47,660 --> 01:12:55,550
professional survey done of the land but

1471
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:57,950
oftentimes the towns will have estimates

1472
01:12:55,550 --> 01:13:00,740
of acres that are very very close to

1473
01:12:57,950 --> 01:13:02,420
those at those surveyed measurements you

1474
01:13:00,740 --> 01:13:05,330
know oftentimes there was a survey that

1475
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:09,050
was done 50 years ago or a hundred years

1476
01:13:05,330 --> 01:13:10,630
ago so the the amount of acreage at the

1477
01:13:09,050 --> 01:13:12,920
town is taxing might be plus or minus

1478
01:13:10,630 --> 01:13:18,890
but you can get all that information at

1479
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:20,360
the town office you can get aerial maps

1480
01:13:18,890 --> 01:13:22,010
of the properties that you're looking at

1481
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:24,020
that often helps if you're walking

1482
01:13:22,010 --> 01:13:26,270
properties to understand what kind of

1483
01:13:24,020 --> 01:13:27,950
patches of pasture exists here and what

1484
01:13:26,270 --> 01:13:29,840
kind of patches of forest exist there

1485
01:13:27,950 --> 01:13:32,090
and where are the exact of the actual

1486
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:35,540
borders you can get current title

1487
01:13:32,090 --> 01:13:38,060
information you know this is important

1488
01:13:35,540 --> 01:13:39,230
if you you know you need to know that

1489
01:13:38,060 --> 01:13:41,900
the person you're dealing with actually

1490
01:13:39,230 --> 01:13:43,990
owns the land it's not you're not

1491
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:46,730
dealing with the uncle or something and

1492
01:13:43,990 --> 01:13:47,930
someone comes home from Florida and all

1493
01:13:46,730 --> 01:13:50,270
of a sudden you're leasing their land

1494
01:13:47,930 --> 01:13:53,270
and they don't know about it at the town

1495
01:13:50,270 --> 01:13:54,470
office you can ascertain that the person

1496
01:13:53,270 --> 01:13:57,980
who you're dealing with actually has

1497
01:13:54,470 --> 01:13:59,870
title to the land and this is something

1498
01:13:57,980 --> 01:14:01,940
that attorneys will access if they're

1499
01:13:59,870 --> 01:14:03,530
doing a title search on to make sure

1500
01:14:01,940 --> 01:14:04,940
there aren't any other encumbrances on

1501
01:14:03,530 --> 01:14:08,480
the land they'll go through all the town

1502
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:12,350
records and really look closely at at

1503
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:15,890
this item zoning regulations you can get

1504
01:14:12,350 --> 01:14:17,540
that information at the town in a lot of

1505
01:14:15,890 --> 01:14:20,210
states there is a right to farm law

1506
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:23,150
where agriculture is not zoned against

1507
01:14:20,210 --> 01:14:37,429
in other words

1508
01:14:23,150 --> 01:14:43,310
they're at least in Vermont so I'm sorry

1509
01:14:37,429 --> 01:14:45,230
in Vermont there there isn't any zoning

1510
01:14:43,310 --> 01:14:47,920
regulations that would preclude anyone

1511
01:14:45,230 --> 01:14:50,179
from farming in any particular location

1512
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:52,460
everyone has a right to farm assuming

1513
01:14:50,179 --> 01:14:55,460
that you're not posing a hazard to

1514
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:59,690
public health but there are nuisance

1515
01:14:55,460 --> 01:15:02,239
laws that can go into effect that that

1516
01:14:59,690 --> 01:15:06,219
farmer should should be aware of in

1517
01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:06,219
other words even though there's no

1518
01:15:06,310 --> 01:15:14,120
regulation to to prohibit anyone from

1519
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:17,090
farming if the farmer comes in two moves

1520
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:18,590
into an area and is new there and starts

1521
01:15:17,090 --> 01:15:20,360
running an operation that it is

1522
01:15:18,590 --> 01:15:23,120
obviously detracting from other

1523
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:25,670
bordering properties owners ability to

1524
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:29,449
enjoy the use of their land then the

1525
01:15:25,670 --> 01:15:36,739
farmer can fall victim to a nuisance

1526
01:15:29,449 --> 01:15:39,320
lawsuit so just address this question

1527
01:15:36,739 --> 01:15:41,210
here I've heard many tales of issues

1528
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:43,820
with easements and grandfather roads

1529
01:15:41,210 --> 01:15:48,469
crossing farmland and how to address

1530
01:15:43,820 --> 01:15:50,210
this area this is this is another

1531
01:15:48,469 --> 01:15:52,070
crucial bit of information that can be

1532
01:15:50,210 --> 01:15:53,300
accessed at the town office you

1533
01:15:52,070 --> 01:15:55,100
definitely need to know if there's any

1534
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:59,540
easements whatsoever on a particular

1535
01:15:55,100 --> 01:16:01,280
property and you can't you know you

1536
01:15:59,540 --> 01:16:03,920
can't really if there is an easement on

1537
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:05,449
a particular property that's a legal

1538
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:08,989
right for another on't for another

1539
01:16:05,449 --> 01:16:10,310
person to you know access to you if

1540
01:16:08,989 --> 01:16:13,520
there if it's an easement for a road

1541
01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:16,239
there that person is gonna have legal

1542
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:18,469
ability to use that road no matter what

1543
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:22,010
if it's a power company they're going to

1544
01:16:18,469 --> 01:16:24,949
have the legal right to own the land

1545
01:16:22,010 --> 01:16:26,390
that the power lines go through even if

1546
01:16:24,949 --> 01:16:31,070
even though they're running through your

1547
01:16:26,390 --> 01:16:35,000
land so I guess the only way to address

1548
01:16:31,070 --> 01:16:36,640
this area is to have knowledge of the

1549
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,840
particular

1550
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:41,320
terms that are associated with that

1551
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:44,780
easement to know exactly how many feet

1552
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:46,340
within either side of the power pole for

1553
01:16:44,780 --> 01:16:48,650
example are covered within that easement

1554
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:51,080
and to understand who owns the easement

1555
01:16:48,650 --> 01:16:54,680
and what attitude they're going to have

1556
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:56,390
about you acquiring the rest of the

1557
01:16:54,680 --> 01:17:08,900
property that surrounds that that area

1558
01:16:56,390 --> 01:17:14,530
that's applicable to the easement so did

1559
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:14,530
that answer your question Nate

1560
01:17:30,630 --> 01:17:36,460
comparable sales data this is a way to

1561
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:38,800
determine the fair market value of a

1562
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:40,840
particular property this kind of

1563
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:44,620
information I've been told is available

1564
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:46,780
at the town offices I'm not I haven't

1565
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:50,410
ever gone to the towns and asked them to

1566
01:17:46,780 --> 01:17:52,540
see records of recent sales I'm not sure

1567
01:17:50,410 --> 01:17:54,640
how far back they keep records this

1568
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:56,350
might be different from town to town but

1569
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:58,360
essentially real estate agents when they

1570
01:17:56,350 --> 01:18:00,250
go to appraise a particular property

1571
01:17:58,360 --> 01:18:03,880
this is the kind of they're going to the

1572
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:05,920
town records or the state records and

1573
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:11,350
they're they're accessing this kind of

1574
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:12,880
data to to determine a fair market value

1575
01:18:11,350 --> 01:18:16,330
for a particular property they're basing

1576
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:18,910
that fair market value on the sales the

1577
01:18:16,330 --> 01:18:21,400
sale prices of comparable properties in

1578
01:18:18,910 --> 01:18:23,040
the area and I've been told that this is

1579
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:24,880
something you can do on your own

1580
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:26,260
although I'm not sure again it would

1581
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:28,600
probably depend on from town to town

1582
01:18:26,260 --> 01:18:31,570
what kind of data is available and how

1583
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:32,920
it's available but this is essentially

1584
01:18:31,570 --> 01:18:37,060
something that a real estate agent would

1585
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:38,620
do which is another not so bad idea if

1586
01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:40,330
you are looking to purchase a piece of

1587
01:18:38,620 --> 01:18:41,980
property to get a real estate agent of

1588
01:18:40,330 --> 01:18:43,750
yours on board to represent you so they

1589
01:18:41,980 --> 01:18:46,600
can they're going to be the experts at

1590
01:18:43,750 --> 01:18:50,710
determining the fair price to pay for a

1591
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:52,660
particular property it's hard to go in

1592
01:18:50,710 --> 01:18:54,970
alone I know the tendency is to be

1593
01:18:52,660 --> 01:18:57,310
reluctant to pay three percent in a

1594
01:18:54,970 --> 01:19:00,490
commission just to have a real estate

1595
01:18:57,310 --> 01:19:01,980
agent help you through some listings

1596
01:19:00,490 --> 01:19:05,290
that you could access on your own but

1597
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:07,360
sometimes it pays especially if the real

1598
01:19:05,290 --> 01:19:09,430
estate agent can really confirm the the

1599
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:11,860
fair price that could that can be paid

1600
01:19:09,430 --> 01:19:13,330
for particular property that may might

1601
01:19:11,860 --> 01:19:15,160
be a lot less than you would ordinarily

1602
01:19:13,330 --> 01:19:18,480
pay if you were trying to determine that

1603
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:18,480
fair market value on your own

1604
01:19:26,209 --> 01:19:34,499
so are there any other questions before

1605
01:19:29,369 --> 01:19:42,030
I move on are there any that I have not

1606
01:19:34,499 --> 01:19:47,070
addressed yeah I think we're going to be

1607
01:19:42,030 --> 01:19:49,380
wrapping up in about 10 minutes here 830

1608
01:19:47,070 --> 01:19:51,979
is our cutoff time I appreciate everyone

1609
01:19:49,380 --> 01:19:56,209
bearing with us up to now I hope that

1610
01:19:51,979 --> 01:19:56,209
you're getting something out of this ah

1611
01:19:58,669 --> 01:20:08,219
this is a great thing to not be shy

1612
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:11,070
about if you're trying to assess the

1613
01:20:08,219 --> 01:20:14,579
particular property it's a don't be shy

1614
01:20:11,070 --> 01:20:17,249
to talk with neighbors and and and

1615
01:20:14,579 --> 01:20:19,139
people who have been who know the land

1616
01:20:17,249 --> 01:20:21,360
would prove and hunting on a particular

1617
01:20:19,139 --> 01:20:23,789
property for for ages throughout

1618
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:31,590
generations we really know the ins and

1619
01:20:23,789 --> 01:20:33,479
outs on how a property acts over time

1620
01:20:31,590 --> 01:20:35,159
you know I throughout the seasons all

1621
01:20:33,479 --> 01:20:37,679
the people who live right around your

1622
01:20:35,159 --> 01:20:39,689
neighbors there or people with that kind

1623
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:42,510
of local knowledge exist and you know

1624
01:20:39,689 --> 01:20:48,869
it's really a great thing to be able to

1625
01:20:42,510 --> 01:20:50,729
talk with him if they're willing so just

1626
01:20:48,869 --> 01:20:52,650
to jump back here a little bit can tax

1627
01:20:50,729 --> 01:20:55,889
records Dave to be used to assess

1628
01:20:52,650 --> 01:20:57,419
potential value of a property they could

1629
01:20:55,889 --> 01:21:01,829
if you know the tax rate for a

1630
01:20:57,419 --> 01:21:04,380
particular town at least the town

1631
01:21:01,829 --> 01:21:06,959
Lister's are going to have the value of

1632
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:09,959
a property that they have assessed there

1633
01:21:06,959 --> 01:21:11,820
that you know I might it's probably

1634
01:21:09,959 --> 01:21:14,639
easier in other words to go directly to

1635
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:16,409
the town lister and figure out what is

1636
01:21:14,639 --> 01:21:20,010
the value of the land that they're

1637
01:21:16,409 --> 01:21:21,570
basing the tax on because they have

1638
01:21:20,010 --> 01:21:22,919
assessed the property and they have

1639
01:21:21,570 --> 01:21:24,900
assessed the fair market value of the

1640
01:21:22,919 --> 01:21:27,479
property at some time or another it

1641
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:28,709
might have been seven years ago it might

1642
01:21:27,479 --> 01:21:32,130
have been just last year that's

1643
01:21:28,709 --> 01:21:35,309
something you need to ask so in other

1644
01:21:32,130 --> 01:21:37,619
words the value that the real estate

1645
01:21:35,309 --> 01:21:40,079
sisters at the town level and work for

1646
01:21:37,619 --> 01:21:42,030
the town office of have appraised might

1647
01:21:40,079 --> 01:21:44,969
not be the actual fair market value of

1648
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:46,559
the land the land owner might be able to

1649
01:21:44,969 --> 01:21:48,269
get a lot more for that right now based

1650
01:21:46,559 --> 01:21:50,579
on the market conditions or orb or it

1651
01:21:48,269 --> 01:21:53,550
might be even let you know less value

1652
01:21:50,579 --> 01:21:56,219
depending on the situation but at least

1653
01:21:53,550 --> 01:21:59,129
you can use that that basic list value

1654
01:21:56,219 --> 01:22:01,739
that the the appraisers at the town

1655
01:21:59,129 --> 01:22:04,530
level that have used and if you're savvy

1656
01:22:01,739 --> 01:22:09,209
you can use the tax form those two to

1657
01:22:04,530 --> 01:22:14,039
arrive at that figure up as well there

1658
01:22:09,209 --> 01:22:17,369
are resources for help in filing for

1659
01:22:14,039 --> 01:22:20,219
current you status in Vermont at least

1660
01:22:17,369 --> 01:22:24,959
it's the county foresters who are that

1661
01:22:20,219 --> 01:22:29,249
resource the county foresters job is to

1662
01:22:24,959 --> 01:22:32,309
administer and check up on all of the

1663
01:22:29,249 --> 01:22:34,229
current use management plans so when you

1664
01:22:32,309 --> 01:22:35,849
when someone doesn't roll into a tax

1665
01:22:34,229 --> 01:22:38,099
benefit program they usually submit a

1666
01:22:35,849 --> 01:22:39,300
management plan that states how they're

1667
01:22:38,099 --> 01:22:40,739
going to manage the forest for

1668
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:42,209
productivity and how are they you know

1669
01:22:40,739 --> 01:22:44,189
what they're doing to AG land and so on

1670
01:22:42,209 --> 01:22:46,050
and here in Vermont it's the county

1671
01:22:44,189 --> 01:22:47,339
foresters that that have files on all

1672
01:22:46,050 --> 01:22:48,689
the properties and manage that

1673
01:22:47,339 --> 01:22:50,099
information from time to time they'll

1674
01:22:48,689 --> 01:22:52,019
actually visit properties are checked up

1675
01:22:50,099 --> 01:22:54,300
on whether management plans are being

1676
01:22:52,019 --> 01:22:55,919
enforced so the county foresters can

1677
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:58,979
really walk you through what it takes to

1678
01:22:55,919 --> 01:23:01,739
enroll in current use they might be able

1679
01:22:58,979 --> 01:23:03,869
to help you figuring out what figure out

1680
01:23:01,739 --> 01:23:06,119
whether or not you're eligible and then

1681
01:23:03,869 --> 01:23:09,389
that the county foresters will refer you

1682
01:23:06,119 --> 01:23:12,119
to consulting foresters and these are

1683
01:23:09,389 --> 01:23:13,530
consulting land use planners they're you

1684
01:23:12,119 --> 01:23:15,679
know they're they're not always just

1685
01:23:13,530 --> 01:23:18,449
foresters but they have experience in

1686
01:23:15,679 --> 01:23:21,239
helping people enroll in the current use

1687
01:23:18,449 --> 01:23:25,169
plans the Vermont woodlands Association

1688
01:23:21,239 --> 01:23:27,510
has certified Forester consultants you

1689
01:23:25,169 --> 01:23:29,760
know most towns have someone or most

1690
01:23:27,510 --> 01:23:32,269
areas have someone that's experienced in

1691
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:34,519
consulting with private landowners on

1692
01:23:32,269 --> 01:23:38,999
whether or not they're eligible for

1693
01:23:34,519 --> 01:23:44,069
current use I'm assuming the same case

1694
01:23:38,999 --> 01:23:45,839
in other states yeah the main goal of

1695
01:23:44,069 --> 01:23:48,910
these tax benefit programs is to keep

1696
01:23:45,839 --> 01:23:50,800
the land open and productive so there is

1697
01:23:48,910 --> 01:23:52,420
if it's not private consulting foresters

1698
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:55,090
it's going to be some other agricultural

1699
01:23:52,420 --> 01:23:57,880
service provider organization that can

1700
01:23:55,090 --> 01:24:00,250
assist you in support you as a landowner

1701
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:03,730
whose will it is to keep the land open

1702
01:24:00,250 --> 01:24:06,250
and productive you know that might be a

1703
01:24:03,730 --> 01:24:09,940
state agency of Agriculture it might be

1704
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:11,830
a cooperative extension service you know

1705
01:24:09,940 --> 01:24:15,130
I can definitely help anyone that's

1706
01:24:11,830 --> 01:24:17,410
something that I do I I know the the

1707
01:24:15,130 --> 01:24:18,760
basic ins and outs of the Vermont

1708
01:24:17,410 --> 01:24:21,850
current use burger and I consult with

1709
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:24,550
with farmers and landowners I'd be happy

1710
01:24:21,850 --> 01:24:29,080
to talk with anyone hear about that at

1711
01:24:24,550 --> 01:24:33,340
any time so again back to community

1712
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:38,650
don't don't be afraid to partner are

1713
01:24:33,340 --> 01:24:40,360
sorry don't be afraid to talk with

1714
01:24:38,650 --> 01:24:42,960
current tenants but at the same time be

1715
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:45,010
sensitive that they are not always

1716
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:46,990
obligated to share information with you

1717
01:24:45,010 --> 01:24:48,520
you have to be sensitive to the fact

1718
01:24:46,990 --> 01:24:49,870
that if you're looking to lease land if

1719
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:51,790
there's a current tenant there already

1720
01:24:49,870 --> 01:24:54,970
that tenant might not know that the

1721
01:24:51,790 --> 01:24:57,880
landowner wants to lease land to you you

1722
01:24:54,970 --> 01:25:00,280
know and maybe not least as much land to

1723
01:24:57,880 --> 01:25:01,660
the current tenant as as before you have

1724
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:03,880
to be sensitive to that fact when you

1725
01:25:01,660 --> 01:25:06,880
approach current tenants and and you

1726
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:11,830
know it's just approach the matter was

1727
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:15,160
some respect and humility um you know

1728
01:25:11,830 --> 01:25:17,740
and I think it's always good to ask the

1729
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:21,010
landowner or the tenants if it would be

1730
01:25:17,740 --> 01:25:27,070
okay to to access records or talk with

1731
01:25:21,010 --> 01:25:32,020
them from time to time so we're running

1732
01:25:27,070 --> 01:25:33,310
out of time here I'll just sift through

1733
01:25:32,020 --> 01:25:36,070
this quickly here's another resource

1734
01:25:33,310 --> 01:25:38,850
that's available at UVM extensions new

1735
01:25:36,070 --> 01:25:41,830
farmer project this is going through

1736
01:25:38,850 --> 01:25:43,540
various considerations this is a

1737
01:25:41,830 --> 01:25:45,130
checklist that's similar to the one that

1738
01:25:43,540 --> 01:25:48,220
we brought up earlier that's in holding

1739
01:25:45,130 --> 01:25:51,960
ground it goes through all detailed

1740
01:25:48,220 --> 01:25:51,960
considerations and assessing properties

1741
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:57,340
here are some additional resources these

1742
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:59,080
are organizations you can go to if you

1743
01:25:57,340 --> 01:26:00,520
have any other questions about any of

1744
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:02,469
the topics that were covered in either

1745
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:07,599
of these two webinars

1746
01:26:02,469 --> 01:26:10,599
