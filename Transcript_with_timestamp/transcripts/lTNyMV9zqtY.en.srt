1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:05,130
what do all of these things have in

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:07,560
common protein today I want to talk to

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,440
you guys about how you can grow protein

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:26,270
in your garden

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:29,100
[Music]

6
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:32,489
hey friends it's Jen at the sunshine

7
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:34,170
farm this year I am planting a lot of

8
00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:38,160
new varieties and one thing I'm really

9
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:42,330
trying to jump into is planting protein

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:46,290
so things like beans and lentils and

11
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:47,910
peas and soy even quinoa and spinach

12
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,680
have a lot of protein so I'm planting

13
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:53,100
all of these things this year I'm sure

14
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,830
many of them won't do very well but I'm

15
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,440
excited for the future that all of these

16
00:00:55,830 --> 00:01:02,280
things will mean whether it's making

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:05,430
things like homemade soy milk or grains

18
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:08,280
like quinoa and amaranth I'm even trying

19
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,590
rice this year even potatoes are packed

20
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,720
with protein so I'm really excited about

21
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,280
all these things we're growing because I

22
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,869
think there's just such a common

23
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,610
misconception that if your plant-based

24
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:19,920
or if you're vegan or vegetarian that

25
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,510
you need to get protein we actually as

26
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,240
Americans get a whole lot more protein

27
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:26,490
than we really need and Chris and I have

28
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,110
never had an issue with protein but

29
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,720
nonetheless I really want to show you

30
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:33,480
guys how you can actually get a lot of

31
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,270
really nutritious plant-based protein in

32
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,800
the garden and I'm excited to share this

33
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,850
with you so let's just talk about a few

34
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,440
of the things we're growing this year

35
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,420
I'm going to show you at the end

36
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:45,360
planting one of these things in the

37
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,880
garden today and I also have some little

38
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,380
seedlings coming up right now that I'm

39
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,750
really looking forward to and I'll show

40
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,940
you guys those as well so let's go ahead

41
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,320
and get started so what proteins are we

42
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:58,110
planning on growing in the garden

43
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,750
the first is peas and lentils these guys

44
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:03,210
are in the same family we have some door

45
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:05,130
snow peas and I already planted these

46
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,720
guys just a couple weeks ago and I'm

47
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,849
just waiting for them to come on up

48
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,349
we're also doing lentils and so we're

49
00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:13,170
doing two different kinds of lentils

50
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:15,569
Spanish Brown and French green and these

51
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:18,690
guys are heirloom seeds they do better

52
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:21,269
in cooler climates we actually should

53
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:23,640
have some success growing them here

54
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:25,709
because our summers don't get all that

55
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,650
hot but we're gonna see it's totally a

56
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:30,360
trial year with lentils and if they

57
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,920
don't grow well then maybe I'll just

58
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,080
have to barter lentils for things like

59
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,900
soy from somebody

60
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,090
so many across the country so lentils

61
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:42,180
are great source of protein lentils make

62
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,560
an amazing base for a soup I'm really

63
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,000
looking forward to this and I'm excited

64
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,790
to try all sorts of different ways to

65
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,230
cook and prepare lentils a couple

66
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,570
different grains that were growing that

67
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:53,460
have protein in them and I believe rice

68
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:55,380
does as well but I didn't grab that one

69
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,280
from my seat collection so we are

70
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,140
growing amaranth

71
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,990
this year and we're also growing quinoa

72
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:02,640
these two crops you generally have to go

73
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:06,390
a fair amount of in order to actually

74
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,860
get a decent harvest but I hope

75
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,750
eventually that we can really just

76
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,640
expand our garden space that we can do

77
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,110
that that we can plant tons of quinoa

78
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,090
and tons of amaranth and really have

79
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:17,220
enough grains for for Chris and I and

80
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:19,710
future kiddos that might join the family

81
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,720
we have peas so far we have lentils Lee

82
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:23,340
of amaranth and we have quinoa and an

83
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,420
even growing rice let's talk about a

84
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,760
couple more things that I'm growing

85
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,740
things that are packed with protein and

86
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:33,720
you probably know where I'm going with

87
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:36,780
this one beans beans are a great source

88
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,550
of protein and super good for you a lot

89
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,650
of people think that beans can be hard

90
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:43,050
in the digestive system there's actually

91
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:45,900
a way that you can do you can sprout

92
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:48,150
legumes before cooking them or preparing

93
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,190
them for a meal and they're much easier

94
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:54,720
on the digestive system that way we're

95
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:57,480
also doing soybean soy bean has a bad

96
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,820
rap kind of like potatoes right because

97
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,340
they're just thought of as lacking a lot

98
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:04,830
of nutrition I think a lot of this isn't

99
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,290
from the soy itself but actually the way

100
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:11,100
we grow it here in the u.s. we tend to

101
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:13,250
grow GMO soy bean in organically mass

102
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:17,520
production and we're growing things

103
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:20,100
varieties that are not matching the way

104
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,600
the crop was initially designed so I'm

105
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,840
really excited because I'm growing

106
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,700
soybeans here heirloom organic soybeans

107
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,020
and I think they're going to be really

108
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,840
different in terms of how they affect

109
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:33,270
our health and just the amount of

110
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,340
nutrients in those soy because if you

111
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:37,290
think about it plants absorb nutrients

112
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,360
from the soil so if you are filling your

113
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:41,490
soil with a lot of nutrients and you're

114
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,050
treating your soil well those plans are

115
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:45,030
going to be much healthier and packed

116
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:46,689
with a lot more nutrients so you're

117
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:48,999
going to see a big difference in terms

118
00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:50,199
the tofu that you might by the store or

119
00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:52,419
tofu that you make at home with

120
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:53,860
homegrown soybean now on top of the

121
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:55,449
black beans and the soybean we're also

122
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,759
growing all different kinds of beans

123
00:04:55,449 --> 00:05:00,849
this one right here is scarlet Ember

124
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:03,099
it's a pull runner bean and it climbs as

125
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:04,899
it grows and it's just beautiful so you

126
00:05:03,099 --> 00:05:06,429
can eat it as green beans or you can let

127
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:08,319
the pods dry out and you can cook up the

128
00:05:06,429 --> 00:05:09,219
beans later a couple more fun things to

129
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:11,769
share with you guys

130
00:05:09,219 --> 00:05:13,360
spinach spinach is a great source of

131
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:16,089
protein and iron and all sorts of

132
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,759
wonderful things I just direct seeded

133
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:21,579
some spinach a few days ago so hoping it

134
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:24,069
comes up soon it can be a tricky crop to

135
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:26,169
grow because it likes cool weather and

136
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:27,669
so if your spring jumps to summer really

137
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:29,229
quick you can have a hard time with

138
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:31,959
spinach but there's actually a variety

139
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:34,300
of spinach called Asian spinach that can

140
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:36,879
handle warmer temperatures so if you're

141
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,319
looking for the goodness of spinach but

142
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:39,659
you don't have the cool weather and you

143
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:42,189
don't have a long enough spring or fall

144
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:45,249
try Asian spinach maybe it works for you

145
00:05:42,189 --> 00:05:48,219
guys and the last thing I'm so excited

146
00:05:45,249 --> 00:05:50,469
about peanuts now we have two different

147
00:05:48,219 --> 00:05:52,449
peanuts we're trying out this year and

148
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:54,610
peanuts are traditionally thought of as

149
00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:57,159
a southern crop because they really like

150
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:59,409
heat but here in New York we have a

151
00:05:57,159 --> 00:06:02,259
company's called fruition seeds that

152
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:04,569
works to adapt crops to the northern

153
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:05,949
climate and really test things out in

154
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:07,689
the northern climate to make sure that

155
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:09,399
they work before selling them to

156
00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:12,129
consumers so these are two varieties

157
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:13,599
that I got ahold of from that wonderful

158
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:15,550
company and I'm really excited to grow

159
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:17,259
them these are super simple because you

160
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:19,059
just direct sow them in the ground and

161
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:21,189
then actually at the end of the season

162
00:06:19,059 --> 00:06:23,829
you pull them up and the peanuts are

163
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:26,409
growing all along the roots just like

164
00:06:23,829 --> 00:06:27,969
potatoes would so those are a few things

165
00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:30,309
that were growing this year in terms of

166
00:06:27,969 --> 00:06:32,860
protein and I'm really really excited

167
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:35,349
about it mostly because there's so many

168
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:37,089
different kinds of things and a lot of

169
00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:39,399
these things I don't traditionally seen

170
00:06:37,089 --> 00:06:41,469
grown in backyard gardens so I'm going

171
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,999
to just show you guys this one green

172
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:46,169
that we are growing that I'm really

173
00:06:42,999 --> 00:06:50,889
excited about okay guys so over here our

174
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:52,089
DIY grow shelves are very empty right

175
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:54,309
now because most of the plants are

176
00:06:52,089 --> 00:06:56,949
outside but I do have some starts in

177
00:06:54,309 --> 00:06:58,669
here that are just coming up see these

178
00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:02,509
guys right here

179
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:04,969
that is quinoa and then over here we got

180
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:08,689
some rice look at that little baby rice

181
00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:11,469
I also got some a sesame Chia and

182
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:13,400
rosemary that hasn't quite come up yet

183
00:07:11,469 --> 00:07:16,279
the other thing I wanted to show you

184
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,349
guys is this right here might not look

185
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:20,509
like a lot but it's a start

186
00:07:18,349 --> 00:07:23,210
this was the soy that I saved last year

187
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:25,849
from our soy crop and I'm actually going

188
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:27,499
to be going and making some soy milk

189
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:29,479
following a recipe from one of my

190
00:07:27,499 --> 00:07:31,610
favorite cookbooks called the vegan

191
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:33,919
pantry it's an amazing cookbook it's

192
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:36,020
really simple recipes all about

193
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,599
different staples you can make for your

194
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,050
home things like bread and pasta soy

195
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:41,629
milk

196
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:43,310
tempeh tofu all these things that I'm

197
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:45,020
hoping that we can make here at the

198
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:46,279
sunshine farm it's perfect if your

199
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:49,520
plant-based like we are if you're

200
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:51,289
vegetarian or vegan because a lot of

201
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,599
these things if you buy in the store

202
00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:55,460
they're full of additives and

203
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,129
preservatives you're really looking for

204
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:59,479
that natural lifestyle it's so important

205
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:01,279
to be connected with the process and try

206
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:03,560
making some of these things yourself at

207
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:06,289
home so I'm gonna be making some soy

208
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,330
milk with this soy bean and I think we

209
00:08:06,289 --> 00:08:09,889
just have enough to be able to make a

210
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,729
good amount this is the book I was

211
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:14,000
telling you guys about

212
00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:16,879
by Miyoko I think it's Shin er Miyoko

213
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,610
has this amazing non-dairy cheese

214
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,830
company that you can get at all sorts of

215
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:24,680
grocery stores and they're not based in

216
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:26,509
coconut based cheeses and they're really

217
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,180
delicious guys if you have octopus

218
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:30,770
intolerance if you avoid dairy for

219
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,449
ethical reasons or environmental reasons

220
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:34,610
or maybe you just want to try a

221
00:08:32,449 --> 00:08:36,919
healthier cheese alternative so this is

222
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:39,740
the creamy soy milk that I'm gonna be

223
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:41,659
making with our with our homegrown soy

224
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,099
bean I'll have to share a video all

225
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:46,610
about this later

226
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:50,089
because I might apically fail come on

227
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:53,240
outside with me let's plant some lentils

228
00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:56,390
and I'll show you guys how easy it

229
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:59,089
really is to grow your own protein in

230
00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:01,820
the garden right now I'm about to plant

231
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:04,160
some lentils and lentils are like peas

232
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:06,529
so you're planting them before the last

233
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,209
frost when it's still early spring as

234
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:10,220
soon as that ground can be worked but

235
00:09:08,209 --> 00:09:12,079
the ground is not too - at that you draw

236
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,440
on your seeds so you can see our ground

237
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:15,410
here

238
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:18,110
is nice and wet and I've spent some time

239
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:19,730
prepping this pad to be planted it might

240
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:23,360
look a little strange but what I'm doing

241
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:25,520
here is I put all the woodchips aside to

242
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,470
reveal the soil underneath making sure

243
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,660
that I didn't mix the woodchips in with

244
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:31,400
the soil and then I dug like kind of

245
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,810
like just a little mini trench so I can

246
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,000
go ahead and plant these seeds an inch

247
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:37,520
deep in the trench this is a first-year

248
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,380
bed so a lot of the soil isn't nice and

249
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,300
aerated enough so that's why I want to

250
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:43,340
add the nice loose compost on top so

251
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,650
those plants have a chance to come on up

252
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:47,390
this one's a hundred days this one's 115

253
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:51,020
days we're doing French green lentils

254
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:52,460
and / Dena lentils Spanish Brown on both

255
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:54,200
of these are heirloom varieties I got

256
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,880
them from Annie's heirloom seeds they're

257
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,260
organic they're pretty cool I'm really

258
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,510
excited about lentils

259
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:01,340
I like lentil soup I like alts of other

260
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:03,050
lentil things I'm gonna go ahead and get

261
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:04,640
these lentils planted instead of just

262
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:07,280
having traditional grow planting I'm

263
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,960
gonna stagger the lentils so that I can

264
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,730
get more in one space so I'll show you

265
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:13,490
what I'm gonna do right now with the

266
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:16,760
French green lentils see these those

267
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:24,530
lentils looks just like what you eat

268
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:31,400
right here what I just talked about get

269
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:35,120
them very careful when you are holding

270
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:36,770
seeds you can drop them and not see

271
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,930
where they land luckily these aren't

272
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:40,930
carrot seeds so I can kind of see them

273
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:52,139
[Music]

274
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,940
whoops

275
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:10,830
walking is hard then what I'm gonna do

276
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:13,920
is in the middle between the mini rows

277
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:16,470
I'm gonna plant some beets and radishes

278
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:19,560
maybe even some carrots because those

279
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:20,640
things will mature before these lentils

280
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,890
are really big

281
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,589
well the lentils are planted they should

282
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:27,420
be coming up soon and it was so fun

283
00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:29,100
talking to you guys about how to grow

284
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,600
plant based protein so thank you for

285
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,529
being here and I can't wait to share my

286
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,130

287
00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:34,130
