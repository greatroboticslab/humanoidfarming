think you can keep track of everything

51
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,590
in your head but the more you have

52

anticipated to keep good records and

57
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:26,700

encourage keeping good records for

60
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:33,750
regulatory purposes but good records

61
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,270
could be valuable if you were audited or

62
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:38,970
examined as it can clear up confusion or

63
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:41,220
can conclude an audit much quicker the

64
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,900

65
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,880
records but states that you can choose

66
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:49,980
any system that clearly shows your

67
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:52,680
income and expenses start small and

68
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,240
continue to work on each area if you

69
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,010
would never developed a marketing plan

70
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,200

72
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,520
be a big step for a new producer

73
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:05,100
planting crops for the first time is a

74
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:07,140
big deal starting small keeps things

75
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:09,690
manageable and allows room to grow the

to have all of your crop in a new market

80
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:21,510

81
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,370
develop it over time relationships are

82
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,209
