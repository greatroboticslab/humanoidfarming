1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
I'm a sixth generation farmer I want

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,040
this land and these resources to be

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,720
available to my children and their

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,519
children and future Generations so

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,980
caranada has the potential to improve

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,839
soil Health has immediate benefits and

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,160
potentially long-term benefits as well

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,960
it's a crop with a high level of biomass

9
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:24,060
so if you consider like the nutrient

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,580
content and that new crop that's not

11
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,980
normally in the system being introduced

12
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,199
back into the rotation whether it's

13
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,020
cultivated and minimally or in a minimal

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,000
or no-till situation that decomposition

15
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,620
is going to just bring a level of

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
nutrients back to the to the soil

17
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,800
profile it's going to be available for

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,420
the next crop and because of the layer

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,059
of residue that it leaves behind you

20
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,680
have improvements in water retention and

21
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:48,840
nutrient retention for the next cash

22
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,940
crop for the farmers so there's all of

23
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,039
these benefits aside from having

24
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,600
Financial benefits for the grower

25
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,879
it's hard to get good nutrient and water

26
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,039
retention in our sandy soil caranata has

27
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,559
a great fit in our system it kind of

28
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,780
breaks up the monotony of the same crop

29
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:05,040
year after year or two crops in rotation

30
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,080
year after year by adding some

31
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,000
biodiversity into the soil putting in

32
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,500
nutrients back to the soil that we

33
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,080
didn't previously have introduced there

34
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,760
but the biggest thing is if there is

35
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,040
some economic benefit to the grower

36
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,619
market prices don't really change when

37
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,140
our commodity crops fertilizer costs

38
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:24,840
fuel costs continue to go up and up and

39
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:27,659
up and so if you add in a new crop into

40
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,000
a farming system that's very low input

41
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:32,159
and you get so many benefits from it in

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,080
terms of the soil Health aspect but also

43
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,020
an immediate benefit because it's a

44
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:40,020
harvestable grain crop

45
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,020
foreign
