1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,680
a five member technical team from Guyana

2
00:00:02,679 --> 00:00:06,319
has successfully completed the

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,800
infrastructure for the national

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,880
agriculture Innovation and Technology

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,120
Center marking a significant step

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,400
forward in St Lucia's drive for

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,760
agricultural modernization the project a

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,840
product of the collaboration between the

9
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:24,680
government of St Lucia and Guyana for

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,480
agricultural technology adaptation and

11
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:30,240
Innovation features two tunnel green

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,160
houses equipped with a nutrient fi

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:36,079
technique hydroponic system the

14
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:38,239
initiative is set to revolutionize St

15
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,760
Lucia's agricultural sector by

16
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:43,360
integrating sustainable practices with

17
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,640
cuttingedge hydroponic technology the

18
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,640
system offers a more efficient approach

19
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:51,399
to farming particularly beneficial in

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,640
combating challenges posed by the dry

21
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:57,399
season Hydroponics reduces water and

22
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,399
fertilizer waste while ensuring optimal

23
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:02,800
crop growth making it an environment Al

24
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,640
friendly and cost effective alternative

25
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,799
to traditional farming the hydroponic

26
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,920
system an ideal solution for Farmers

27
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:14,560
with limited land space allowing them to

28
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,840
maximize productivity in small areas

29
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,840
with the completion of this facility the

30
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,799
Ministry of Agriculture now has a

31
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,479
powerful tool to educate and showcase to

32
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:27,759
the local farmers the tangible benefits

33
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:31,400
of Hydroponics farming lead Hydroponics

34
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:33,960
technician khil Benjamin emphasize that

35
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,840
this Innovation is expected to improve

36
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,159
food security and economic resilience

37
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,840
within the agricultural sector by using

38
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:44,560
less water and fertilizer while yielding

39
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,280
higher productivity yeah so today uh we

40
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,079
finished the project uh the two B tunnel

41
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,840
houses are completed and with the

42
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:54,320
hydroponic system um this will be of a

43
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:59,079
great benefit to the St Luan people

44
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:01,280
right um hydroponic it's uh not a new

45
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:04,240
technique it has been over here for 2 to

46
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,119
3,000 years it's a very old technology

47
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,640
but uh what we did was we refined the

48
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,800
the the the the technique and we did it

49
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,800
it's called Precision agriculture

50
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,080
because what we're doing we're not

51
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,879
wasting fertilizers right we're not

52
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,519
wasting fertilizers we're not wasting

53
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:20,680
water especially right in in a system

54
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:23,560
like if you have a say we have an area

55
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:26,480
like as we have 32 by 100 ft you may use

56
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,720
about 450 gallons of water per day right

57
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,120
on on your crop uh with this hydroponic

58
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,879
system you use that actually every 3

59
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,480
weeks right so so when we go we know we

60
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:38,599
have have dry periods to go into so that

61
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,680
can be a great benefit for the farmers

62
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:42,840
so you can always have no short of

63
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,159
production through that system the two

64
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,040
tunnel green houses have a combined

65
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:51,959
capacity of growing over 2,600 plants

66
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:55,480
with one Greenhouse supporting

67
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:58,319
1,425 plants and the other

68
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,640
1,200 this advancement signifies a

69
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,480
transformative step towards modern

70
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:06,040
technology driven farming in St Lua

71
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,280
fostering increased efficiency

72
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,400
sustainability and resilience in food

73
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,239
production this what we have here today

74
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,200
is a nft system so n is called a

75
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:17,040
nutrient film technique which just means

76
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,200
a tin film of water is running on the

77
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,319
root of the plant right the system is a

78
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,640
recyclable system so it's goes from uh

79
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,959
30 ft in length and it comes back up

80
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,319
again on a pump right we also have a

81
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,519
AirStone to create oxygen for the system

82
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:32,040
so everything is in place every

83
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:34,319
parameters is in place and checked we

84
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,040
also have filters on the system to to

85
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,920
ensure that there's no uh clogging or

86
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,319
anything that happens to the system so

87
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,319
you need to maintain that as well right

88
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:45,480
so we have a today we have the school

89
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:47,239
kids so we want to do an introduction

90
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,080
with them too as well the successful

91
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:52,360
completion of this initiative highlights

92
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,840
the strengthening of agricultural ties

93
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:57,239
between St Lucia and Guyana showcasing

94
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,760
Regional cooporation in the adoption of

95
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:02,760
advanced farming Technologies as the fa

96
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:05,120
faity becomes operational it is expected

97
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,360
to serve as a model for the future of

98
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,840
agriculture in the region empowering

99
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,959
local farmers with Innovative techniques

100
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,720
