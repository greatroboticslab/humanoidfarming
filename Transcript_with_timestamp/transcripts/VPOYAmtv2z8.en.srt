1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,919
what is going on everybody sorry for the

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,440
delay in videos posting we've been

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,120
really busy here on the property

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,160
and one of those things we've been doing

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,599
is growing grass or trying to grow grass

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,519
in this video what we're going to be

7
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,920
doing is hooking up that

8
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,920
two-inch trash pump from harbor freight

9
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,520
to a normal sprinkler system

10
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,720
i didn't know if you could do this so i

11
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,160
looked up on youtube and i started

12
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,119
looking around online and people

13
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,599
were doing it but they kind of left out

14
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,400
that little

15
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,320
important part like what is needed to do

16
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,040
it and can this pump do it without

17
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,040
any additional adjustments to the pump

18
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,280
so of course the big thing that comes to

19
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,320
mind is this thing pushes a massive

20
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,640
amount of water uh in relation to

21
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,800
what a normal hose does but the water

22
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,600
pressure doesn't seem to be

23
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,239
different now i didn't know if you could

24
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,320
block

25
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,399
the pump on the water pump and still

26
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,000
have it run like if there was a bypass

27
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,120
valve

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,879
or i still don't however i do know

29
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,600
that this does work without any

30
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,239
modification to the actual pump housing

31
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,920
itself

32
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,119
you will need a couple little pieces and

33
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,159
i'll show you what i did it's

34
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,920
frankenstein

35
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,200
so bear with me but if you have a better

36
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,320
way of doing this go ahead and post them

37
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,640
down in the comments

38
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,479
we're going from a two-inch hose down to

39
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,799
a normal garden hose which might be like

40
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,720
5

41
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,799
8 garden hose which is your normal

42
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,840
garden hose so i went down to the parts

43
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,799
store and i put together this

44
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,280
frankenstein

45
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,200
all right so what we have here is a

46
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,240
frankenstein if you look at this

47
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,600
this thing seems crazy but it actually

48
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:34,159
does a lot that i need it to so

49
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,200
first off it's good for when i'm putting

50
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,200
chemicals

51
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,280
or wanting to spray the pond i did it

52
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,320
earlier it's like a fire hose man i'll

53
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,439
tell you what this thing shot all the

54
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,399
way across the pond

55
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:46,399
but let me go over what this is so you

56
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,439
guys could uh possibly go and pick this

57
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,640
up and build something like this

58
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,720
yourself

59
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,680
this is a two inch standard adapter with

60
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,759
a screw

61
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,000
uh it is the only thread size that i've

62
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,799
seen so this just screwed right on to

63
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,719
the tip

64
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,479
no questions asked so don't worry about

65
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,280
the thread on that but this is a two

66
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,560
inch

67
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,320
uh female coupler

68
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,119
and then you got a two inch reducer down

69
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:12,160
to an inch and a half reducer

70
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:14,480
and then the next piece here is a

71
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,160
inch and a half reducer down to a three

72
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,920
quarter inch reducer

73
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,560
the three quarter inch reducer is a

74
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:23,760
threaded three quarter inch reducer

75
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:27,280
and then it has a threaded

76
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:30,720
three-quarter inch thread to

77
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:34,000
a three-quarter inch pipe

78
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,840
now this three-quarter inch pvc pipe is

79
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,519
two feet long i picked it up i did not

80
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,760
cut it and that's why i put it

81
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,200
together looking like this ginormous

82
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,640
thing on the very

83
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,800
end of this i have the same adapter

84
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,319
on the other from the other side a

85
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,519
three-quarter inch

86
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:54,720
to a three-quarter inch thread

87
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,519
this thread happens to screw right into

88
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,920
the end of the hose

89
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,159
so i can screw the hose onto this and

90
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,879
then run

91
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,000
the hose to the sprinkler system and the

92
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,000
sprinkler system

93
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,120
actually works guys it's kind of crazy

94
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,519
let's go ahead and

95
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,319
hook up the hose to this and show you

96
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,800
guys

97
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,840
how this connects how it looks and then

98
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,879
we're going to start this up and i'm

99
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,440
going to show you that it

100
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:22,400
literally just works

101
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,280
all right so we have our garden hose and

102
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,120
then we have this

103
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,040
crazy little contraption that i just

104
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,159
went over you with

105
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,519
this little this big adapter piece is

106
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,120
connected to the flat

107
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,799
hose two inch hose that you would pick

108
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,000
up from harbor freight for the two inch

109
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,239
trash pump

110
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,440
and it just screws right into the pvc

111
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,280
pipe

112
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,599
and like i said before the end adapter

113
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,440
will go into a basic

114
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:50,560
or standard hose

115
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,879
and it just screws right on

116
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,159
no problem now this is a little loose it

117
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,080
does spray a little bit

118
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,840
it leaks a little bit but it gets the

119
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,519
job done

120
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,040
so let's go ahead and let's turn on the

121
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:15,250
pump

122
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:18,310
and see what we got

123
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,310
[Music]

124
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,320
all right so there it is it seems to be

125
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,080
working i have the pump on low just for

126
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,600
reference

127
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,120
but the pump seems to be working it

128
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,120
seems to be spraying just fine

129
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,320
again the garden hose it leaks a little

130
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,280
bit here

131
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,560
but it's just water from the pond so i'm

132
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,800
not too worried about it

133
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,320
the pump is on low it's just idling so

134
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:57,840
we're going to go ahead and turn it up

135
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:57,840
and see what happens

136
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:07,120
all right so i turned it up about uh

137
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,560
about a quarter way of what the pump is

138
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,240
and this thing

139
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,039
is just pumping away i don't see any

140
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,880
issue at all

141
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,039
guys i think this is gonna work just

142
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,600
fine for anybody's use

143
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,240
the big question is if i take that off

144
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,880
of there

145
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,520
and then i hook up the normal like a

146
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,800
hand

147
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,560
the hand tool i can't think of it right

148
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,520
now post dominant confidence but

149
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,800
if i hook it up to the hand piece and

150
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,199
then i don't use it

151
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,240
what will happen to the pump does it

152
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:41,280
have a bypass is it going to break

153
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,759
but this is pretty cool uh this works

154
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,160
literally with doing nothing to the pump

155
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,240
and it pumps it

156
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,520
right down into a normal hose and then

157
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,520
right into a sprinkler system

158
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,759
again i seen this video posted on

159
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,600
youtube all over the place

160
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,039
but it didn't really address the simple

161
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,960
question that i had

162
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,960
will my pump do it without any

163
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,080
modification and the answer is

164
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,120
yes it seems like it is yet all right so

165
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,240
now the question is

166
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,319
will it work with this will it work on

167
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,639
and off and what will happen if i don't

168
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,840
use it and i just let it sit there

169
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,000
all right so here's the deal i have it

170
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,120
hooked up to the hose i'm going to start

171
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,800
the pump on low

172
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:25,280
have the handle fully open and

173
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,720
see what happens we know guys from the

174
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,680
sprinkler system obviously

175
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,680
this is going to work

176
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,840
but what will happen when we take it off

177
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,840
that is the big question

178
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,560
it works just like you had your

179
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,680
sprinkler system on

180
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,960
your water pressure on all right making

181
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,280
going to turn this off and see what

182
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,280
happens

183
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,840
nothing happens the pump doesn't even

184
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,840
change

185
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,880
it takes a minute for it to kick in pull

186
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,360
it and it gives a minute

187
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,759
let's go ahead and turn it up see what

188
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,759
happens

189
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,840
all right ready

190
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:59,840
let's go all the way

191
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,879
all right so you might be saying justin

192
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,520
you're an idiot

193
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,080
we i knew that like we all knew that i'm

194
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,080
gonna say

195
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,360
i didn't i did not know that that pump

196
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,400
would do that so

197
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,639
now i know and hopefully you know

198
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,680
that you can hook up your two inch trash

199
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,199
pump or just

200
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,639
i'm gonna assume that you can go across

201
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,120
the board with these type of pumps from

202
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,199
harbor freight or whoever sells them

203
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,879
that you can go from that pump to an

204
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,960
adapter to a normal hose

205
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,279
to a sprinkler system for irrigation in

206
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,719
this case it is irrigation on some form

207
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,159
i need to water some grass and get some

208
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,399
grass going

209
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,839
this means i can go over to my garden on

210
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,760
this side and do that

211
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,959
and i can also eventually we're going to

212
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,440
be putting a

213
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:47,839
garden over there an actual like tilled

214
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,720
garden with the tractor

215
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,880
and i could irrigate that too as well

216
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,920
this is a great little

217
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,920
like find that i i

218
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,680
seen online and i'm glad that i figured

219
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,560
it out and it put it went together so

220
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,600
easy guys it was

221
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:06,080
super easy so now i can

222
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,200
i'm actually more happy uh that i can

223
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,760
clean my four-wheeler

224
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,640
and tractor off here instead of doing it

225
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,120
at home

226
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,560
so my neighbors don't get mad at me in

227
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,800
my neighborhood when there's a

228
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,160
mud river running down down the road so

229
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,360
i hope this helped you out if you had

230
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,720
any doubts or

231
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,480
