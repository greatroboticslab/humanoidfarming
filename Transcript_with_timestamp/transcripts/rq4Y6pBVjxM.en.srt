00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:23,110
equipment editor's blog for august 9

3
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,880
2011 just a few weeks ago we conducted a

4
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:27,790
survey of dealers to see where things

5
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,710
stand with the great EGR versus scr

6
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:32,140
debate taking place among the farm

7
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:34,150
equipment manufacturers it was a

8
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,680
follow-up to the survey we took a year

9
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:38,199
ago on dealers concerns about

10
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,500
introducing exhaust gas recirculation

11
00:00:38,199 --> 00:00:44,670
and selective catalytic reduction engine

12
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:47,890
technologies to meet tier for interim

13
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,870
requirements you can read about the

14
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,420
survey results in the august issue of

15
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:54,100
egg equipment intelligence sometimes the

16
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,960
more interesting story comes from the

17
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,360
dealer commentary than from the hard

18
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,699
numbers so we asked dealers the

19
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:03,940
open-ended question what could

20
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:06,100
manufacturers do to help ease your and

21
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:09,040
your customer's concerns about the new

22
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:11,409
engine technologies far away dealers

23
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,900
most often set educate advertise and

24
00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:17,100
promote that is continue to get the word

25
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:19,930
out about the new engine technologies

26
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,120
comments included better public

27
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:24,670
awareness from the manufacturers as

28
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:26,850
needed educate the customer through

29
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:29,950
advertising develop and distribute

30
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,330
educational marketing pieces the dealer

31
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,950
commentary was also rife with

32
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,900
frustration mostly with the

33
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:37,870
contradictory claims coming from the

34
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:39,610
manufacturers as one dealer put it we

35
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:41,920
need information to set the record

36
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:44,800
straight for the customer it does not

37
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,410
need to appear as a sales approach just

38
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:50,230
the facts please another said run

39
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:52,810
real-world side-by-side test of tractors

40
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:55,510
using the different technologies and

41
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:58,300
compiled maintenance fuel efficiency and

42
00:01:55,510 --> 00:02:00,520
repair data comparisons this should be

43
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:03,190
done on a farm and not not at the

44
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,930
Nebraska test labs they should be done

45
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:08,200
more like the real world tests being

46
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:10,840
done in Europe yet another dealer really

47
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,090
hit it dead on money rollin they need to

48
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,610
do fact-based education about the

49
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:18,760
different methods which would apply to

50
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:21,040
all vehicles manufacturers tend to put

51
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,950
their spin on this which in this case is

52
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,780
wrong we all know what the deals are

53
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:27,850
talking about their real frustration

54
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:29,710
comes from the confusing claims come

55
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:31,840
from the manufacturers about the

56
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:33,990
efficiency maintenance power and other

57
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,490
assorted benefits of their new engines

58
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:38,020
when all is said and done I don't

59
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,760
believe any of the manufacturers are

60
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:42,310
misrepresenting the benefits of the new

61
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,130
engines they're simply using selective

62
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:46,870
data as they're selling points which of

63
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:50,050
course is the major contributor to

64
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:52,060
customer confusion it's difficult at

65
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:54,310
best sorting through all of it in

66
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:56,920
considering a lot of new farm equipment

67
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:59,110
costs as much or more than the houses we

68
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,210
live in the snow wonder that farmers may

69
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:04,450
hesitate when making buying decisions

70
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:06,250
about something so new several dealers

71
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,870
suggested that manufacturers could

72
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,510
extend the warranties on the new

73
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:11,680
equipment as a way of demonstrating

74
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:14,050
confidence in the technology they're

75
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,300
putting out there and to ease customer

76
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:18,610
concerns but don't hold your breath on

77
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:21,010
this one as long as the market for new

78
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:23,560
machinery remains as strong as it has

79
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:26,140
been manufacturers don't have to do it

80
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,000
you know and I know the real solution to

81
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:30,640
this challenge as always we'll come down

82
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,500
to the dealer your customers want you to

83
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,230
sort through all the spin and selective

84
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,970
data for them the better you do it the

85
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:38,460
more confidence the customer will have

86
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,750
in you and the product you're selling

87
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:43,210
this means you need to know your

88
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:45,760
competitors products as well as you know

89
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:48,390
your own thanks for checking in we'll

90
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,390
see you next time

91
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,459
