1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:06,899
yes and now we are discussing about

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:08,820
agricultural videos in that tutorial we

3
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,780
are discussing about grain farming

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,960
process

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:15,960
what is the process of grain growing

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,500
these steps include planting growing

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:22,260
harvesting threshing and restoring the

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,779
final product by breaking down each step

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,720
of the process you will gain a better

10
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:30,960
understanding of how to produce

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:34,020
a high quality product with minimal

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,620
waste and the next point is what are the

13
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,719
steps in processing grains primary

14
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:43,140
processing involves several different

15
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,180
processes designed to clean sort and

16
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,239
remove

17
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:50,219
inedible fractions from the grains

18
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:55,520
primary processing of cereals includes

19
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:58,260
cleaning grading heel hurling Milling

20
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,079
pounding grinding

21
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:05,220
tempering

22
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:07,740
proper par boiling soaking drying and

23
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,020
sieving and the next point is what are

24
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:12,659
the seven steps of agriculture

25
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:16,040
the seven steps involved

26
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,040
in agriculture

27
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,979
in agricultural stamina steps involved

28
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:39,439
in agriculture practices are mentioned

29
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:43,220
below probing sowing adding nutrients

30
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:45,840
irrigation producting protecting plants

31
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:47,759
harvesting and Storage

32
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,299
our next point is what are the five

33
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:54,180
stages of grain

34
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:56,159
Oaks decimal growth scale is based on 10

35
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:59,040
cereal growth stages

36
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,320
these are germination number one is

37
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,960
germination seeding growth seedling

38
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:08,160
growth then a Tailoring

39
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:10,800
then stem elongation under booting

40
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,280
next year emergence

41
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,800
then flowering then milk development

42
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:20,040
then the dove development under ripening

43
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,920
these are the five stages of a grain

44
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:26,300
next point is what are the six stages of

45
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,300
grain farming

46
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,580
let us learn about how to form grains in

47
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:34,440
six simple steps understand the forms

48
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,959
production goals

49
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:40,400
survey the Farmland prepare the Farm

50
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:43,940
soil finally the Farm soil Harvest and

51
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,940
thresh the grains

52
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:49,560
store the grains our next point is what

53
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:52,319
are the methods of green harvesting with

54
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:55,860
cereals the crop is first cut either as

55
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:58,680
a whole are partially

56
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:01,379
and then the threshed and clean to

57
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,340
separate the grain from the years and

58
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:05,040
strong

59
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,300
in the latter case two main Alternatives

60
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,180
exist

61
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:13,459
separate harvesting and threshing

62
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,459
our combined harvesting and refreshing

63
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,040
and the next point is what are the seven

64
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:22,319
steps of grains there are many different

65
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,239
types of grains but some of the most

66
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,200
common types of grains

67
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,200
are wheat

68
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,280
barley Woods

69
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,540
and

70
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:42,060
rice and common types of grains to eat

71
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:47,940
is wheat

72
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:52,019
rice barley oats quinoa that is q u i n

73
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:54,480
o a kuna and Rai means Rye

74
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:56,580
and next point is what tools do green

75
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,480
farmers use

76
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:03,299
while a truck is often stamped of a

77
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,239
farming life there are several other

78
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:07,379
Farms specific

79
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:09,900
vehicles too

80
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:12,680
attract us to say that a tractor is a

81
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:16,380
broad category is an understand

82
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:19,320
underestimate understand understatement

83
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:23,540
a broad category is an understatement

84
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:27,840
combine or Harvester ATV or UTV close

85
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:31,860
Harrows fertilizer system spreaders

86
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:34,199
Cedars under balance

87
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,460
next point is what are 10 examples of

88
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,919
grains

89
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,560
the examples of all whole grains and

90
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,060
whole grain foods include barley

91
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,600
bulgar

92
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:48,240
Furrow Millet

93
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:52,979
that is q-u-i-n-o-a

94
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:55,500
black rice brown rice and then red rice

95
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:59,699
next point is what are the steps of

96
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:02,040
farming agricultural and

97
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:04,979
Agriculture and agricultural practices

98
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,840
soil preparation before raising a crop

99
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:09,540
the soil is

100
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:12,860
the soil in which it is to be grown is

101
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:17,220
prepared by a plowing leveling and

102
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:20,820
manuring sowing selection of seeds of

103
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:24,620
good quality crop strains is the primary

104
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:28,259
stage of sowing manure irrigation

105
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:30,680
weeding harvesting storage

106
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:33,720
what are the farming methods

107
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:37,620
permaculture biodynamic

108
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:41,780
farming hydroponic phonics and anapon

109
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:44,940
aquaponics Urban agriculture

110
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:47,400
agroforestry and food forests

111
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,900
in the farming methods Hydroponics and

112
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:52,320
aquaponics

113
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:54,360
is very good subject and science

114
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,440
next point is what is the life of

115
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:02,340
farming cultivation processing packaging

116
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:04,440
Transportation consumption disposal

117
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:07,919
what are the most common green topics

118
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:11,580
green types next point is what are the

119
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:13,740
most common grain types rice corn and

120
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,520
wheat are the most common stable food on

121
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,979
yet

122
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,800
grains are so important because they are

123
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:21,780
a good source of important nutrients

124
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,900
called carbohydrates

125
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:27,539
carbohydrates are a type of sugar that

126
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:30,000
provides energy for organisms to

127
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:32,759
function the next point is what are the

128
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,460
three common methods of preparing grains

129
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:38,580
the three most basic techniques for

130
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:42,000
cooking grains are boiling absorption

131
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:45,199
and steaming lend the best ways to

132
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,580
prepare and cook different grain times

133
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,660
including some different cooking

134
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:51,780
techniques

135
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:55,380
including frying stir frying still

136
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:57,539
frying and banking

137
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:00,660
next point is which machine is used to

138
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:04,139
cut grain crops

139
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:08,300
a machine used for cutting

140
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:08,300
the mature crop is Harvester

141
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:12,960
what is the next point is what is the

142
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,440
best method of farming

143
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:19,199
taking on agroforestry practices this is

144
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:21,500
one of the best farming techniques using

145
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,819
natural resources

146
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:28,099
mixing in trees

147
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:28,099
within your farming operations

148
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:34,919
these trees provide shade and shelter

149
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:37,800
for plants and animals in addition they

150
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:39,780
provide extra income by allowing you to

151
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,759
sell food or Lumber

152
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:44,340
next point is what is the traditional

153
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,680
method of processing the grain

154
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:50,039
traditional Crossing is usually referred

155
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:53,039
to as primary or secondary

156
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:55,080
milling and grinding the grain are

157
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:58,259
considered

158
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:01,919
primary processing processes for example

159
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:03,720
while baking the grain into Brent in

160
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:07,139
secondary processing

161
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:11,699
the less acceptable form of a processed

162
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:13,979
food is the result of territory

163
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:15,900
tertiary processing this is the

164
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:17,120
information regarding grain farming and

165
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,520
processing

166
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,800
brain forming process it is most

167
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,599
important and it will be this video will

168
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,900
be useful to so much

169
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:31,139
the methods of Performing processes Etc

170
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:33,500
by agricultural risks wishing you all

171
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:33,500
the best
