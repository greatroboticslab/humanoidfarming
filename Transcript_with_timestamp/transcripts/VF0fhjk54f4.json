  "text": "hello viewers welcome to elim TV a station where you watch interact and also learn your teacher today is Mr an agriculture teacher in today's lesson we are in form four Lesson 12 and the topic is Portrait production and the subtopic is routine management practices in poy on to the lesson objectives uh by the end of this lesson you should be able to explain the various routine management practices in ptry uh number two uh methods used in identifying a good uh layer uh the routine management practices in portrait include number one feeding and number two control of diseases and and um the disease that you're supposed to control uh you're supposed to control goomo then we have nucum and uh you have full typhoid and number three we have control of parasite using appropriate method you can do dusting also you can use a dust bath and as uh the dust bath uh dusting uh and also the waras so that you can uh get r of the worms then uh we'll go to the control of parasite and the control of parasite you have the dusting as I've said then we have warmers and then number number four we'll go to egg collection that is another control management practices that is supposed to be carried out during pot production you're supposed to regularly control the to collect the egg so that you can control the vies of egg eating then the perpetual egg eater and the Perpetual cannibals are supposed to be deied uh this is the process as I explained the previous lesson of cutting short the uh some section of the upper P to control the egg eating Vice and also cannibalism curling is also another one and we'll go to the characteristic for birds to be Cur what are the characteristic what are the traits are we supposed to check so that we can know that this bir is supposed to be called and this is this bird is supposed to be left to continue with production uh the first one poor growth those birds which have poor growth should be C out then number two chronic disease then number three old age those birs which are old of age they are supposed to be called uh by selling them you sell them or you slaughter them uh because they have a less level of production they normally lay few eggs and also so the body weight is also very very small so they it is uneconomical because they are feeding a lot but they don't produce a lot of uh eggs then portra VI uh that is also uh the eggs which are the Potter which normally feed on egg egg eaters and also the cannibas are supposed to be C out then you have the poor layer uh how do we know a poor layer and a good layer how do we differentiate a poor layer is the one that allow only one egg in between the pelvic bone well a good layer should allow two to three fingers and that that that is it then methods used to identify good layer and poor layer as uh you can see the first one is observation of physical treat of the BL uh for example the the peak those which have yob Bic poor layers and therefore they supposed to be eliminated then we have trap nesting method and in trap nesting method uh you can identify uh which bird is a good and which B is but in uh trap nesting method uh you put a nest where the bird goes to R and upon laying it is trapped there and therefore you mark it then you remove it then next time another B is is is U is trapped and marked and uh after several uh occasions you find that there are few Birds which will remain unmarked meaning that those birs which will not have any Mark meaning that they are all poor layers or they don't ex then characteristic of a good layer we have coms and a large warm wax and red number two eyes are bright orange and the bird is very very alert then number three uh vent is oval moist red and active and number four temperament they are alert and active then bigs is pale and six space between the kill and the pelvic G pelvic bone or gido should allow two to three fingers uh then broodiness is rare for those good layers they rarely come brooded then we have the space between the pelvic gido you can see in the diagram there for a good layer there is a wider space and for for n layer there is a smaller space and also you can see the finger one finger uh that is for a n layer n layer then we have three fingers for a good layer then the three fingers are supposed to fit exactly in between that space then we go to the images of coms and wats uh for a good layer you can see these are good layers uh then we have car of shuns uh you can see this one uh the shuns are red for a good layer and those that are yellow is for a poor or n layer then n BR and BR hand you can see uh Nan BR the appearance of Nan BR and The Brood uh you can see it in the second image and you can see even in the third image we have a brood head there and then uh there is a continuation of good layers you can see uh them the diagrams and we have come come to the end of the today's lesson and the following questions are supposed to be answered by you number one explain any two methods used to identify a good layer and number two discuss the routine management practices in a port are four reference you can refer from secondary agriculture students book four and the publish is the Kenya literature bu for more information you can contact us through the following addresses as well Illustrated and displayed for you thank you for joining me in today's lesson uh until next lesson bye-bye",
