1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,240
many people come in they say how can i

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,480
start and i've got this one eight kalan

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,040
and i said well start with fruit trees

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,719
and around each fruit tree make a garden

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,120
you know so you're watering those fruit

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,799
trees and that water will also go for

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,800
that garden so around each fruit tree

8
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:19,279
you have like a a two and a half meter

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,680
diameter circle where you have

10
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,359
tapioca the marawi kalinga kappa you

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,199
have drumstick you have a papaya you

12
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,519
have a couple of bananas and maybe you

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,599
have pumpkins that go out so instead of

14
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,359
trying to you know irrigate the whole

15
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,399
field and take care of a whole field

16
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,920
you've actually got say 20 or 30 circles

17
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,559
that you take care of and you could even

18
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,960
put a drip on each circle because you

19
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,719
have to be practical you know this is a

20
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,879
very romantic

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:50,800
idea that we're presenting but it's

22
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:50,800
grounded in utter pragmatism and reality
