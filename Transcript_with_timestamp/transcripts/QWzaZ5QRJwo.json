  "text": "so my name is david forster and this talk is introduction to soil minerals and um to just to warn anyone who was here last year i'm basically doing the exact same talk i did last year on the exact same subject uh there seems to be enough confusion around it that it's good to hear it a few times um i'm not an exception that took me a long time comparing the same thing over and over to learn it so to warn you though if you thought you got everything out of it last year you may want to try a different one um i have a little more time this year so i'll cover things in a little more depth that i did last year basically my goal with this is to give you a foundation for understanding uh the soil system and what we at the bfa talk about and what really is it the the one way of looking at what is at the root of what basically every one of the other speakers here is talking about what's going on in the soil and i look at the soil minerals because it's very concrete it's something i can start with i'm going to leave a lot of space at the end of this talk a lot of time for questions q a um some of the other speakers here at the conference i think have brought up some issues that uh may make me think that i'm perhaps crazy to focus on this and i want to leave time to have those discussions because i think that there are nuances to all this they are very important soil minerals are very important um but they are not the most important thing but they're a good place for people who are just starting to start looking at so with that introduction i'll get started so like i said i'm david forster i'm the bfa agronomist staff agronomist i also have my own consulting company i consult with private clients doing soil and farm consulting and what i always focus on is looking at the soil and i look at what are the limiting factors to soil health and so that's where i start every conversation and everything when i'm talking to pharmacists what are the limiting factors to get the results that you want so that's another key point here is that it depends on what you're trying to accomplish uh and that sets sort of the framework for how to think about this stuff um the other goal with this talk is to demystify the entire thought process around this if you go out and start reading books on this you will likely get overwhelmed i mean raise your hand if you've been overwhelmed if you've been reading about this stuff it's very really very well and one of the main reasons is because we're dealing with living systems they're complex and there is more in those books that you've read more of it is dedicated to the sort of nuances the what-ifs the things that you're frankly most people aren't ever going to deal with the actual fundamental baseline of this is is not that complicated it only gets complicated when you start adding on all the well what if you have this what if you have too much magnesium what do you have all these little things that in reality if you're farming a piece of ground you probably only have to deal with a couple of your personal what-ifs so i'm going to try to point out how to think about it so that you can get quickly to what you need to worry about and stop worrying about all the other stuff that you only need to worry about if you want to do what i do so so the other thing i want to do here is before i forget to do this before i lose track of time talk about some of the resources you have available when we leave here so financing.org the website we have a lot of information there in the growers section especially uh we're reorganizing and trying to do a better job of presenting it these prep my presentation and all the presentations here at the conference with maybe one or two exceptions uh will be made available to everyone on the website um that's a really gonna be a really good resource we also have our conference recording from past years we have uh you can download the audio from every one of them i believe uh and there will be video for the ones that we successfully have managed a video this year as well so that's a good place to go i do free agronomy consulting calls once a month virtually and um if you go to this website tiny dot cc slash soil health that's the media trans version of the link and you can learn about how to get connected with that there and that is free as in like action prayers and free and you know free beer don't if you remember the bfa you can tell your friends tell anyone who might be interested in learning how to create better food or you know grow better anything really um so that's a great one if you're the only one who calls in it's an hour of one-on-one free consulting time so i encourage people to call in the uh next one is december 12th uh tuesday december 12th so it's coming up soon um i also do through the bfa discounted one-on-one in group consulting um for anyone who wants that the one-on-one is generally to help people interpret their soil test results get them started and then group is something i would love to do more of and that would be if you have a local horticulture group or a local vfa chapter something like that i could come and give a talk and then we also have local chapters throughout the country they keep popping up uh more and more if you anyone here wants to start one get in touch with us we have a mineral depot system we buy in bulk many of the minerals that you might need and and the biology and some of the other products that are hard to find and we make them available to chapters um as best we can and that's a really good way to get things that are hard to find so uh all right i start with this picture if you were here last year you've seen this picture uh this is in minnesota and it's one of the first places on earth there's i think two inches of elevation change in five miles it's the bottom of an ancient seabed and places in this valley are extremely salty as in sodium salt and things grow really well when you have everything working well but um i'll talk about this a little more later but i just wanted to mention now that when the group that i was working with started in this field about 20 to 25 percent of this field had nothing going on so it looked like these areas here totally back up 20 to 25 percent around the perimeter of all these fields looked like that not even weeds wouldn't even correct something they were spraying ground up there just weeds would not grow and not only did weeds not grow but the soil wasn't this sort of darkish gray color it was white it looked like it had just snowed in the middle of summer and that's because of all the salt the sodium that was in that field and this picture was taken just about i think it was three years uh after that after that point here it was 20 assault and all but just this little part around the outside edge was planted uh it no longer looks white and they were actually growing really really healthy sunflowers there i mean it's still a modern crop cultivation system but uh they were actually building organic matter in the soil and it wasn't organic but practically might as well have been they were not certified almost entirely organic practices there and so in a very short period of time they took soil that literally wouldn't grow anything and they turned it around to grow healthy plants and they did that with a combination of minerals and biology people around there tried it with just biology people around there try to adjust minerals and it doesn't work or it takes a lot longer so when you work together and figure out what the limiting factors are in your system you can have some tremendous results so i'll come back to exactly how this was done when we're talking about soil test results and working with your soil system so i want to start sort of letting this foundation with a discussion of what is soil fertility and soil fertility is the harmonious interaction of a number of components of soil so their air water the physical chemical so it's minerals it's biology they all have to work together to create healthy living soils if you're missing any one piece of that then you don't really have healthy living soils you have dirt basically or or something that's not working at its maximum potential and so if you don't have these things you don't have clay silk sand water air minerals biology you cannot build soil you cannot grow healthy plants you may be able to grow plants that look healthy but they're going to be limited or they're going to be expensive in the sense that you have to continuously dump something on there to keep them alive and growing and happy in this picture here it's just a sort of standard chart of the physical composition of soil in terms of clay uh silt sand and various compositions of type various categories of loam in the middle and so the key thing about fertile healthy living soils is they are compounded when you have healthy soil pretty much by definition you're creating more of it the the great plains uh had in places many dozens of feet of soil that were built over many millions of years and that was done through the healthy symbiotic relationships between the various components of soil biology the minerals the air the water the plants etc and as they grow they actually produce more soil they produce topsoil and they do that by breaking down the rock breaking down the parent material incorporating organic matter and that that process creates what we think of as top soil and that topsoil is able to support life and grow abundance and continue to create more of it and this is something that our industrial agricultural system has been mining this soil for a number of years and until we can get away from that and start building soil uh we aren't really it's not a sustainable model uh it is just like mining in any other sense and so what i'm really talking here is called pedogenesis this is the building of soil and creation of soil and there's an equation made up by a russian geologist that defines how you create soil and creative soil is a function of these things that are down here at the bottom it's a function of climate prepared material biological process and time and there's only certain multiples that i can control i cannot control time it can be kind of cool i can control somewhat climate like in terms of i can make sure that my plants have enough water i can make sure i can do mean differences make sure that they have so i have hair uh that there's stuff happening around them you know the gases they need etc i can do that to some degree i can impact biological processes for sure i can bring in inoculants i can feed microbes i can um i can bring in the things that are missing and try to balance and keep them alive and then i can also do this this apparent material so we think of soil as this sort of stamped stable thing it's been there for a long time we go out there we just look at soil and assume that that dirt out there it's always been there but in many cases around here one of the ways it got there is through glaciation it's been through geological processes these things take millions and millions of years and so the way i think about building soil is that what i'm trying to do is make this equation as efficient as time or as efficient as possible and the thing i can't control is this one so i worry about these so i always tell people if you can't maintain hydration you can't keep your plants moist none of these things matter violet's going to die the minerals are going to sit there doesn't matter don't waste your money if you can't do that so um and the same thing applies to any other ones if you have biology but you don't have uh the hydration if you don't have the minerals necessary to have as much diversity as you can in biological processes as much vibrancy there then you are to some degree wasting some of that investment of time or money and so i like to look at all of them together find where my weaknesses are and focus on those i'm a lean sigma black belt by training as an industrial engineering uh methodology and so what i learned was always find your um your weakest link link in the system and that's where you want to focus because until you fix that one everything else you're doing is a waste of your time and in farming it's very similar if you're spending all your time um making really awesome compost tea but you're not making sure your plants maintain hydration or that you've got a little bit of boron there then you might actually just be wasting your time so try not to get stuck on in a dogmatic approach to your farming your growing practices i think that's one of the things that where a lot of people get tripped up they hear a great idea and it's a great idea and they think it's a great idea for them and then they wonder why it doesn't work and it doesn't work probably because they've never thought of this so um and why is pedogenesis important pedogenesis is important because basically if you aren't growing soil you are likely destroying it soil is rather easy to destroy and so if you're not making your decisions in a way that you're really consciously thinking about how can i grow more soil make it healthier and heavier you're likely destroyed um you're likely not sitting on the knife edge of in between perfectly balanced between um just barely not destroying it or not building it so if you're not seeing new soil being created you're not seeing improvements in your soil over time then you're probably engaged in mining so keep that in mind um so what i like to do when i look at accelerated heterogenesis and that's what i want to do to make this equation as efficient as possible and what i like to do when i do that i don't just you know go out and try to throw chemical fertilizer or anything like that what i do is mimic natural processes so i try to eliminate the inefficiencies in them what i see in my system and mimic natural processes if i didn't care about making money i didn't care about feeding my family i could wait for the next glacier but i have a short life span and i'd like to be a shepherd to the land that i take care of i like to teach my farmers and science staff as well and so that to me is really important so if you have enough time to wait you don't have to really worry about this but most of us don't have those types of time scales available to us and i would propose that what we need to be doing is helping nature out a little bit what we're doing is not necessarily counter to what nature intends we're just trying to work within those systems accelerate them for our own purposes so these are the things i i look at i look at creating more perfect climate um ensuring that we have adequate and balanced minerals so that's the parent materials and also eliminating stress on biology so that might mean you may not have biology that's a thing that happens uh so you may have to bring it in and then you may have to feed it and take care of it um people here that's not a big shock to when i talk to conventional growers generally when they hear soil biology um if they've really thought about it all they've usually thought about it in terms of um something trying to kill their plants that they have to spray and so it's this is a big leap for some people um but at the same time it doesn't take much to get this the one thing many a lot of the soil the pathogens and soil they actually have protective properties for other pathogens and when they're balanced uh they actually help plants uh grow better so um i'm gonna blank on the example i had in mind then that's great but we'll get back to that so delving into the sort of nitrate of what how of soil and how some of the minerals place a role in healthy soils um starting i'll start with this so for this picture so this is how you can think of how minerals stick into soil so this box represents the clay portion of soil and these minerals are some of the cation elements that are in those soils so cations cats generally think of as positive unless you're allergic anions are like ants and you know they're you know positive unless they're in your kitchen so we you know that let's call it negative so ants are negative cancer positive and so these are cations which means that they can stick to soil uh soil colloid the clay particles and soil because they have an electrostatic charge where they're attracted to each other so what what soil is made up of what the clay component of soil we're going to talk a lot about clay and i'll tell you why in a second but clay soil particles stick minerals to them and the amount of play you have can vary tremendously and also how many sites can be on the play so this is a box it's a certain size box and the same size box in different types of clay can have a different number of these elements stuck to it and that's based on the age the weathering the type of clay it is some clays just naturally hold more minerals and some clays are very weathered so in the south southeast united states for instance a lot of the clays are very old geologically and weathered and the soil may be pure clay practically but they hold very little nutrients some people have heard of this um and we'll talk about how you address that in just a moment uh but what i want to point out here too is that clay isn't in a box shape like this clay is is comes in sheets so there's layers of clay and on the outside edges of those clay you'll have a lot of these elements and sometimes you'll have some of those stuck between the layers of clay and the size of these elements actually will influence how closely those clay layers are stick to each other and so one thing i'll talk about a little later in more detail is that certain things like calcium make those clay layers get further apart things like magnesium tend to have them stuck closer together and when they're close together they can trap things inside of them and it can change the physical properties of how the clay reacts in soil and this is the piece where where it's important to realize that when you're adding soil minerals you're not just adding soil minerals because you think that there's not enough in the soil it's also about changing the physical and uh the physical properties of that soil and how biology works within it and to create a more efficient system so we're going to talk about that more in a minute um changing gears slightly here um there's this concept that there is an ideal cation balance um dr william albright came up with this concept he did a lot of research around the world studying places where animals uh and people but mostly animals uh nutrition and health was higher than in other places and he found that there was this correlation between the health of the animals and the soil in which their food was grown and the and basically what he found was that anywhere in the world and almost and then he started looking on the cross anybody wrote any props if they if it approximated this ideal cation balance everything seemed to work better and so he spent basically the rest of his career studying this and so that ideal cation balance is approximately 68 calcium 12 percent magnesium four percent potassium one percent sodium and the trace elements the trace electron now one important thing here is that um going back to this the amount of minerals that can be held onto the tight portion of the soil remember these are cations there's a name for that and that's called the total exchange capacity so it's the total capacity of your soil of your mostly it's clay because it plays tiny it has a huge surface area which is why so many things can stick to it uh very many orders of magnitude less things stick to silt and many orders of magnitude less things stick to sand so the clay is really where most stuff sticks in terms of cations and so the amount of this stuff that can stick to this size box of clay or soil is the total exchange capacity that's an important thing to keep in mind because that is what relates the percent of these elements to the actual amount of pounds you need to have in your soil to have a balanced soil that works well and um when you have this in your soil it leads to a ph of 6.4 every time when you are higher or lower in some of the cations it changes your ph and this is also why ph is a core metric for soil health and mineral balance it's because basically all of these things in all of these things impact ph but we don't know which ones and so for instance this calcium actually impacts ph less than magnesium which is less than catalyst potassium which is less than sodium so you may have and actually this goes back to the minnesota picture um the ph in that soil was i think 8.4 so it's very basic uh if you're from new england we'll see of you can't imagine at 8.4 ph uh you're usually 5.4 maybe six if you're you know been working on for a while um but out there was 8.4 it was because they had super high sodium and magnesium which has a big influence on ph and the solution to their many of their issues which we'll get to a minute was adding calcium they literally added basically limestone and their ph went down this is totally count counter to the sort of accepted uh truth about lyme and ph normally you have low ph you add mind with ph goes up well that's only if uh you need the um if you're deficient in in these in these catalysts if you're excessive in anything but calcium you can actually see the ph go down when you enlarge them so there's a lot of nuances here about things that are like half truths that get just sort of repeated because it's simple and i'm going to try to explain them in enough detail that you understand it without current confusion so uh anyway so then one last caveat to this is that this ideal balance this ideal count imbalance is subject to change a little bit based on your exchange capacity you have low exchange capacity you have to modify these numbers a little bit if you have super high uh you have to modify them a little bit but by and large that's that's a good target all right and so um these are what these are our recommended values for the elements of soil tests and this is a logan lab soil test and i want you to be very clear if you're taking notes that this is based on a logan labs base saturation test any other lab any other type of soil test you cannot use these numbers very clear here if you apply these numbers to other people's tests you likely will screw things up because they don't all test the same way um it is not that they test something that it's uh it's not wrong it's not bad it's that this cannot apply in the same way the best thing to do is ask your lab what they recommend um mandy lab will be happy to do so my only issue is that many labs do not even look at half of these things and that's a problem for me um but that being said people after using labs that do different methods they get good results uh i'm not saying my way is the only way or even remotely the best way but it does work and i don't work so this is this is on the website this uh here's the link to it tiny dot cc slash mineral targets if you don't want to scribble it down it is also on your handout again menu doesn't have a handout um grab one we're gonna get to that on the far left side of the handout is a quick dirty version of this all right all right all right so we're going to jump into the soil the soil tests um on the sheet on the handout you've got three different sort of tests representing some variation that i was able to pull together to show some uh interesting things to should be aware of and make some points and every time i look at soil tests um the first thing you always want to look at is your tc numbers so at the toward the top about the third line down you've got tc for the vegetable garden sample it's 10.29 and if you remember i was mentioning that that's a really important number that's important because it is what tells you how much nutrients your soil can hold which then also tells you if you have to modify that that ideal cation balance that we were talking about and so when you have a tc above about an eight it means you can hold theoretically enough nutrients in an extractable form for an entire year growing season for an annual crop generally speaking if you're below a tc of eight it will mean that organic matter becomes more important for you because you are able to hold fewer minerals on your clay colloid and so that's something to keep in mind so organic matter is always great you always want to work on that the best way to get good organic matter is to grow healthy crops we'll talk about that later in terms of the chicken and the egg problem of growing healthy crops when you don't already have healthy soil but um for now what you need to know is that if you're above eight you're pretty good if you're above 10 you're definitely pretty solid in terms of being able to hold your nutrients and that gets important when you start talking about the back we're going to skip down here a little bit the most important thing after tc is looking at the base saturation percent numbers which is in the middle gray area of your soil test and there you can see numbers on that first one 59 and 32 and this is where you want to pay attention to the recommended base saturation percent numbers so basically for base saturation of calcium you're looking for 60 to 68 percent magnesium is 12 to 20 potassium's three to six sodium is point five to three and so if you look at that first one you've got 59 calcium 32 magnesium 3 potassium 1 a little bit more of sodium so right away this is basically how i assess soil testing services laboratories uh if they claim to do this type of soil test where they're actually interested in base base saturation cation balancing and they don't they either don't give you this percentage or the percentages don't make sense when you actually look at the field and you know something's up but in this particular case you've got low calcium and high magnesium and what that does in soils is it makes the clay particles stick together more closely it makes your soil slimy and kind of smear and this this is a 10.29 this particular was not high in clay necessarily but they described it as heavy placed oil this is one of those little triggers every time someone describes your soil as have you played soil i say what's your base saturation magnesium and nine plus times out of ten it is higher than it's supposed to be usually by a lot and this is one example of that being true so the magnesium acts to actually stick the soil together more tightly and what that does is it makes act like clay uh or what we think of this cloud it reduces the porous pore spaces where there's oxygen where there's air it reduces the rate of influx of water basically it causes an awful lot of it causes compaction or it causes recompaction very quickly and it causes it actually traps minerals so when you have high magnesium you can actually get potassium gets trapped in the layers of clay and even though it may show up on your soil test when your plants really need it it may not be available to them in the amount that you think you might have so in this particular case this garden was exhibiting uh it had uh prone to root diseases it had poor uh soil soil flocculation so like it wasn't really crumbly like you've ever seen really nice crumbly soil um that's a well flocculated soil you can get that a lot easier if you have a good calcium magnesium balance they didn't have that here they had potassium deficiency symptoms far excess of one of three might indicate normally on a soil test uh and that was because the magnesium was blocking uptake of potassium and if you read i didn't mention it before but there are several really good books i recommend on this one is um the ideal soil by michael astaire that's probably the easiest one to digest as a beginner and then there's sort of the bible for this which would be in my mind neil kinsey's neil kinsey's book hands-on agronomy and in that book he goes through a whole slew of examples of many examples of of all the different interactions between these elements so what i just mentioned one high magnesium ties up potassium that's one example uh another one behind nitrogen ties up potassium uh high phosphorus times up zinc hydrogen phosphorus these are things that are in um hands-on agronomy that really are really valuable when you're trying to understand your soil system and so when you have when you're looking at soils that's the first thing you want to look for is you go down through you highlight anything that's deficient and he's below your target highlight preferably a different color anything that's excessive so above your target and that's where you really want to focus your effort and try to tease out what the things are that you need to work on and so cation base saturation percents that's the that's the first place you look if you have a big imbalance between magnesium calcium potassium and sodium that's has a huge impact the nice thing is it's one of the easiest things to fix so say you're low in calcium you need usually a high calcium limestone or gypsum if you're excessive in something like magnesium gypsum is often best because gypsum helps to break up that the bond between the magnesium and the soil colloids split that magnesium off uh and replace it with the calcium so gypsum is good when you have excess of something other than calcium um and so those are the first places to look there the other thing um at the far right side is this test called salem and this is something that most people in new england i don't think have seen where you have excessive calcium i've seen it sometimes when people are adding compost that they add a lot of egg shells to a lot of limestone too and in that particular case you can also have the same kind of problem you have uh you decrease potassium availability so you need to try to get it within the targets you try to um try to address the deficiencies by adding things and then with the excesses that's a little bit trickier and i'll talk about that in just a few minutes i want to get to the back to the the top of the sheet i'm just going to run through how i do it uh when i'm looking at these so you've identified your your deficiencies you looked at your excesses so looking at sulfur this is one that is almost always deficient unless you've been adding lots of sulfur for many years or you live in some place uh that has sulfur vines which is as far as i don't know where east of the mississippi river um so this one's 14 parts per million sulfur the target is 75 parts per million sulfur and so here we go to some math and i forgot to warn people there would be a little bit of math um so you take 75 you or in well let me back up when you're really low you don't want to do everything at once that's an important thing that i haven't mentioned um often times so a lot of the arguments against using minerals is that they kill soil life but they can actually negatively impact the biology and to some degree that's definitely true everything you do every step you take in a field every element you add does kill soil but it also creates conditions where other life can live and potentially increase the diversity and how healthy that life is so in the case of sulfur if you're like a 14 in this case or 20 i like to target 50 parts per million that's the beginning of good 75 would be considered sort of excellent so if you're targeting 50 you take the 14 parts per million you subtract your take 50 subtract 14. so you need 36 parts per million sulfur and to get to from part per million to pounds per acre you multiply by two so you have 36 you multiply that by two you have 72 and then you have to divide that by the amount of sulfur in the material you're at and here's another point where people get very confused i think that's 50 minus 14 i've been here so the fifth sorry yes the 50 yes that's because i wrote 75 and i didn't write 50. 50 is the minimum target 75 is the ideal target it is not on there because i screwed up is the minimum target like for good and 75 is ideal um and so then once you get once you figure out you're taking your your target you subtract what you have so 15 minus 14. you get 36 you multiply it by 2 to get pounds per acre so you get 72 and then you divide that by in 0.9 or whatever the composition of the material you have is so if you're using elemental sulfur which is my preferred method of adding sulfur and i'll tell you why in a minute it's 90 sulfur so 90 0.9 so you take the 72 that you got before and you divide it by 0.9 and you get let me write this down somewhere in the neighborhood of 80-ish pounds of elemental sulfur so you need to add 80 pounds elemental sulfur to get you from 14 to 50. and that's in a perfect world we do not live in one of those so you'll add that and you will not get to 50 you will get to something else usually with sulfur there is such a need for it in the systems that you will put 50 down or you'll put you know 80 pounds down should be enough to get to 50 but you won't get there you'll come up somewhere short um don't fret about that the sulfur didn't just go away what it probably did is went to fixing some other aspect of your soil system so when you have an excess light in excess of magnesium like in the soil um some of that sulfur is going to go to fixing the excess so when you add when you have an excess of a cation sulfur helps to get rid of that excess it helps to strip that element off the soil colloid and make it and flush it out of the system making space for other things so a lot of that sulfur is going to go to that and so i would always i would round up to about 100 pounds of sulfur on this instead of the 80 and that will give you a little bit more but honestly this soil will take probably three years of adding that to get enough sulfur the sulfur doesn't go where you think it's going to yeah yeah so there's basically a big sulphur sink in your soil it's going into the it's going to attach itself to the magnesium that's excessive to help remove it from the system because in reality the idea of soil balance isn't just ideal because we think it works the best it actually the soil almost seems to want to approach that balance on its own so when we actually have a sulfur the soil system it's not necessarily intelligent but it uh certainly acts that way it'll the sulfur will attach to the most excessive cation and it will remove it from the soil the clay which will make the space you need for the things that are deficient so it'll make the space you need for the calcium or the potassium or whatever and the magnesium will flush out to the soil and um and you'll lose it that way basically it'll still be there available to plants as a fertilizer element and sulfur is extremely vital to plant health and human health but you won't show up on the soil test until you've addressed until it has basically worked on all of those excesses so it um it's one of those things that triggers i get a lot so many calls about sulfur it's crazy the other piece about sulfur is people don't don't understand this but um sulfate is not the same as sulfur sulfate is an oxidized sulfur and when it is in sulfate form it is a water-soluble form of sulfur and it does not act the same it will quickly leach out of your system it doesn't really build sulfur on your soil test it will help feed a crop sulfur and but it will not stick around sulfur to be transferred from sulfur to a plant available water soluble form takes something like 56 biological sort of steps and processes biochemical steps and so each one of those there's things in the soil that will grab a hold of it there's bacteria that will chelate it which means bind it up into organic compounds and it will help to keep it around a lot longer so a lot of people like i don't want to use elements of sulfur it's super acidic it kills microbes sure yeah it does every microbe within maybe a quarter inch of each little pellet is probably going to be dead but when you actually spread 100 pounds of sulfur over an acre of ground i do everything by the acre that's how my mind works but when you do that you put 100 pounds per acre the pellets are about maybe this far apart and they're only going to impact the biology in that little quarter inch around it you've got six inches or more of soil below it so you're killing yes you're killing microbes but you're killing microbes on a tiny fraction of your total soil and you're adding the things that are holding back your system and functioning better the things that are holding your system back from more efficiently building soil uh in a lot of cases sulfur is one of the top ones and until you can address it you're not working as efficiently as you can so can i ask you another question sure certainly uh all right so this first quick one is the 72 times 0.9 you're saying why is it and um is there a chart that shows kind of like a standard uh let's say like elemental sulfur it's 90 percent they are online i can quickly i could also i can give a list maybe remind me at the end and if we still have time i'll give you a list verbally and they are available even google them is a good way to search online also keep in mind that every material you might buy may be a different number so always check the bag or the source of what you're using you can get a lot of trouble doing that with trace elements especially if you're assuming it's five percent but it's actually 39 that's a molybdenum example for instance um you always check the bag of music is there one more another question back there yeah can you explain the why as far as these targets go but it only works in the local lab versus yes thanks for bringing that up and um so loganlab does this very specific test basically what they're looking at when they give you a base center is that they're looking for extractable minerals they're not looking for water soluble and they're not looking at total elemental so our total elements will be like everything that's in your soil like a geological assessment every element um and water soluble is what it sounds like it's the water soluble nutrients in solution um that you can get out of your soil their test is an extractable so it assumes that you have some biology it assumes you have a system that's working together they use different acids basically to break some things apart so the number will be higher and water soluble but less than the total elemental and every lab does that test a little differently and the reason we can't apply the same numbers is because many labs over the years have to cut costs and save time etc have changed how they do that many of the labs don't necessarily know how to use these numbers the way that i'm trying to teach people to use them and so that they have made they've changed how they do it and the numbers don't work out the same anymore and that's why i also say it's not that this is the right way this is the way i know how to make it work and um and i guarantee you the numbers that you get on a load and lab test are wrong in the sense that your plant doesn't necessarily see exactly these numbers but that's not really the point because the point is that when you when these numbers are approximately where they're supposed to be the whole system actually does work better and it works better because of the how calcium magnesium work together to change the structure the physical structure the amount of air and water in your soil the relative amounts of some of these things are really important to which species of microbes are living or not in your soil and so that's why there's these general recommendations they're not hard to fast rules i don't want anyone to leave here thinking that they need to like farm to a soil test it's a good way to throw money away um but they are a good place to start and so if you have major imbalances like what some of these are on the soil test those major imbalances are going to point you in a direction it's going to be helpful for you to make decisions um sometimes you'll see something that's out of whack in your soil tests but you won't actually do anything about it you know i have high phosphorus here all right so the biggest thing you want to look for when you have high phosphorus is where's my zinc because those are that's a really tightly correlated um nutrient system there so when you high phosphorus it ties up zinc and when your eyes dig it ties up phosphorus so when you apply phosphorus you want to make sure you also have um towards the higher end of sink so if you look at look down there zinc the recommendation is eight plus and it's eight plus because when phosphorus is much higher than it's supposed to be as it is in this case you actually need to double or maybe even a little more in your level of zinc to make sure that you can maintain zinc availability um so that's like that's how this works and why when you cut your corners and you make it a little cheaper you make or you just change it because you think it's a better way of doing it so it no longer the ratios no longer work the relationships no longer work so that's a key point there [Applause] are you familiar with working with any other lab reports like csi so not particularly i've seen many of them um i've worked with some of them i've talked to some of the people there i mean there are good consultants and around us getting results with a lot of different sort of claps and so i'm just teaching you what you can do on your this so one reason we like logan is it's not there not very expensive and you don't have to work with a consultant to use it so you can take serial tests yourself send them there and get your results and then we try to teach you how to interpret them yourself many other labs you have to actually work with a consultant in order to even access the lab so we're trying to we're trying to basically give you the tools to do it yourself and so that's a big reason why we've done that i have an issue when i'm doing calculations because i'm working with a lot of very small spaces they're not any cars right they're um you know hundreds of square feet right and i get really prolifed up in terms of where the decimal place is going when yeah so so i'll just tell so when i look at it i think in terms of in acres um a lot of them i like to start with acres even if i'm doing a thousand square feet i start i can make all the recommendations in terms of acres and i divide by 43 and that gets you thousands per thousand square feet and if you need to go smaller than that it's pretty easy to just lock off a decimal point or and uh to get a hundred square feet so that's how i do it do it in acres divide by forty three thousand square feet and that is usually where people like to like to end up and then when you start really dividing it you're starting to talk about tiny amounts and we can talk about that later if we have time about how you actually apply a half an ounce of something yeah yeah yeah um how do you go about correcting this um phosphorus yeah yeah so um the first thing i want to point out on phosphorus is that you may notice that the numbers are different between these two recommendations um and this is really another important point that i kind of left it confusing like this for a reason is to draw your attention to it remind you of this these are in parts per million if you look at this sheet you'll see that it's in pounds per acre it's my one biggest pet peeve with logan labs is that sometimes you get your results and parts familiar and sometimes you get a passport and if you don't notice that you can kind of screw up your map a little bit so just i want to point that out it's a good opportunity to do that this particular one your phosphorus on here is in pounds per acre so that's why there's the discrepancy um what that means in reality is that while it says you have 2427 on here thousand it's actually and thirteen or fourteen um based on parts per minute but it's still high obviously yeah um so there's a couple things um phosphorus is often high it's often low because there's a huge range in available phosphorus um i constantly see people who've added a ton of compost over the years who have astronomically high phosphorus levels and there's not anything like specific you can do to address that not necessarily even a problem if you can bring everything else up to an ideal level if you've got good phosphorus that's actually an expensive thing to fix when you're deficient so count yourself it's somewhat of a blessing but you do have to keep it in mind and work extra hard to bring everything else up because um because if you have high phosphorus and you're deficient other things that makes the high phosphorus worse it doesn't does if that makes sense the other thing is sometimes um the phosphor is a good example you can have other things that will tie it up so phosphorus and calcium uh tend to get along so well that they don't like to ever split apart again and so when you apply phosphorus adding adding calcium sometimes you'll add a lot of calcium you think you're going to get your calcium where it needs to be and it just won't show up but slowly your phosphorus will come down and that's because phosphorus and calcium like to tie up in the mineral called it's a appetite apatite rock it it basically turns back into a hard rock and both of them become unavailable so one approach if you've got super high phosphorus is to add um keep your calcium high keep your calcium available and it will slowly tie up some of that phosphorus so that's one way to do that but again really just making sure when you have an excess in in phosphorus and many other ones bring everything else up to the target that's the first thing to focus on um so hopefully that helps to answer that question find your you have 150 prosperous up there you have 75 right and that's the whole that's what i was talking about with that's in parts per million and this one is in pounds per acre so the 150 right here over in that column right that's pounds per acre so that's the important consideration that first of all the math to go from one to the other is you multiply your parts per million times two and that gets two pounds per acre that's because they assume that an acre of soil the top six inches of an acre soil weighs two million pounds so if you want to like your math to make sure that these numbers make sense that's where it comes from um so yeah um and the phosphorus in the loading lab is about just p205 exactly yes i'm glad you mentioned that so um when when agronomists farmers fertilizer sales people talk about phosphorus they're usually basically always actually talking about phosphate phosphate is what um they're actually measuring what they're actually concerned about so it's not actually elemental phosphorus that they're looking at but it's phosphate um and it's you'll see that also when you start talking to people about potassium they often say potash potash would be um it's not actually potassium itself so that that's something to keep in mind the definitions in terms of an agriculture versus actual chemistry if there's chemists in the room or if there's chemicals who become farmers they're constantly frustrated by the fact that agriculture doesn't use the real the right words in quite a few examples so that's one of them phosphorus um all right but the so that 75 ppm is for phosphate it's for phosphate and even though many labs were reported as phosphorus i don't know if any of that are measuring it as anything other than phosphate um all right so let's see where do i want to go next um all right so there's so many nuances so this is another thing i want i want to mention um there's a lot of a lot of times when what people get messed up and why they really can't understand soil test results why they get frustrated that it doesn't make any sense is when they do something and then it doesn't behave like they expect it to and often that's because there's the interrelationships between these elements is what screws them up so in the case of this is a good example a lot of people have this problem they have low potassium and maybe they have high magnesium like this first example their ph is above seven and when your ph is above seven things don't exactly work the same as if they're lower than seven so one of the things that happens is that the soil when it has when the pitch is above seven there's not much room on that on that box on the soil box we look here it's full in fact not only is it full but it's kind of got extra stuff floating around it's not really attached but it's sort of attached and so there's no room there so if you want to add something like calcium the calcium is just going to like come in here and be like well there's no place for me to go and that's why what i was mentioning before sulfur is important the sulfur helps to like say this in our example on the sheet helps to cut this bond with magnesium making room for calcium and the same thing happens with potassium so if you in this soil your ph is above seven there's no room to add potassium to this and so until you can get calcium and sulfur and to start splitting off your excesses you're wasting money if you add any more potassium basically than what your plants need that year so in this particular example you um there's a deficit if you look at the exchangeable cations potassium growth guesses are 75 pounds per acre of potassium and that's how much you need to bring your soil test result to four percent but there's no room for 75 pounds of potassium on here and so what you would want to do is actually trickle feed your crop to make sure the crop has enough potassium until you can fix your imbalances here get rid of the excess magnesium make space here for the potassium otherwise you're literally just throwing money away because the potassium is going to go it's going to float up here so my god it's full i'm gonna go over here and it's gonna go down the stream into rivers it's going to um not not stick to your solar power um furthermore and this is where we're gonna start to talk about what lane you who i think told a lot of you is that it's ridiculous to add minerals because there's tons already there and potassium is a great example there's 40 000 pounds of potassium on average in every acre of topsoil and that's just actually the top six inches of topsoil forty thousand minutes and so it's a little bit ludicrous that we ever think to add potassium ever because there's tons there um but having it there and having to build plants of incredibly different things and it is true that biology will make things available if you have excellent excellent biology but the fact of that is it's really hard to good biology if you don't have good plants because then what's feeding the biology and it's really hard of good plants if you don't have any potassium so that's why when i say on an example like this where you have borderline deficient potassium your magnesium is really high so it's going to block the availability of some of that potassium if you're not adding some potassium that you're going to have a really hard time to keep plants healthy enough to be putting carbon into the soil and feeding the microbes that are then going to unlock more potassium for you so by adding a little bit you can potentially unlock a lot and so that's a key part of all of this to keep in mind like i said earlier we're not trying to get a perfect soil test we're trying to build soil and one of the ways to do that is to make the metal test a little better try to tweak it as best we can so that we can unlock the conditions for the biology to do the rest of the work for us um so that's gonna make that point um now i wanna talk a little bit about trace elements before i open up your questions um trace elements are something that people get stuck on they can be very difficult to understand like how to get the materials out there um we're dealing with tiny amounts uh in general and um but a couple there's a couple things that are pretty universal unless you're from the rocky mountains or points west you are unlikely to have enough boron in your soil it's just a fact of geology if you have really really really good biology you're going to find maybe be able to get enough for healthy plant growth but to add the maximum yearly application of boron costs seven dollars an acre boron is extremely important for moving elements up and down in plants and when plants can't move elements up and down it means that they run out of things when they're growing quickly which is invites disease which limits photosynthetic efficiency and limits the amount of carbon they're able to put in the soil to feed the microbes in the soil and so if you don't address these things when you have a deficiency in boron and you're just going to assume it's in your sword and hope for the best you're not going to get the best you're never going to get the best um and so while you may not have to get more and all the way to two or three parts per million in the target i would argue that your mid you're not well served to not add any and um and anyway so yeah i just wanna you should add some boron if you're deficient in warm like hands down i'll make that categorical statement um you may not need to add all of it but it's yeah it's cheap um so to understand how much more you can add every one of these things has a maximum yearly application rate every element borons is low so you only have two pounds of actual form per acre and if you're using a 10 boron that would come through 20 pounds of product if you're using a 20 boron it's 10 pounds of product per acre so giant small amounts those small amounts make a tremendous impact which is also crazy when you think about it because 10 pounds spread over an acre is not very much stuff um but that's how you look at that um i don't we'll see if we get time to go over the elements of where you get these things but um that's what you need to do for the whole question right so whether you need to or whether you're just going to blend it into something that isn't going to be isn't going to hurt you or it might be beneficial for other reasons so compost is a great one and after compost you can add it to um leaf mulch there's lots of ways if you're doing it diluted water you can dissolve it you can spray it on um i generally my recommendations are to use granular whenever possible by my my way of working it's a lot easier you can mix it with other granules you can spread them out easily the granular stuff generally is a slower release so you're less risk of burning plants when you use water-soluble things you you really need to cut the rate of application so i said two pounds of bond per acre per year but if you're using soluble and you put all two pounds at once you're liable to burn things like borax right yeah borax is one of those things that's not as soluble as soluble but it's soluble enough right and um if you applied it all at once so if you applied all 15 pounds or so borax at once then you could burn things um and so what you'd want to do is divide it into multiple smaller applications maybe divided at least by three or four and apply those as your liquids but it's not hard to add it to compost in fact i like to when i'm making my compost piles and things add these minerals to it so if i take a soil test i'm building compost the compost is eventually going to add up on that soil i add the elements to the compost that my soil needs and it helps to digest them gets them chelated in with organic compounds and that's really important because many of these things are can be harsh on soil life um and so the more carbon that you can put out when you put them out it'll buffers that effect so you kill less microbes and it doesn't have the harsh effects that people worry about so um but basically so i've talked a little bit about how to do the sulfur math uh in terms of you take your target you take how much you want uh to take your target take where you are now and then do the math in terms of parts and millions of pounds per acre and then you figure it out if you actually do that math on most of the trace elements so you have 80 to 90 part parts per million target say on manganese you have 31 you get 60 let's say um parts per million deficient multiplied by two to get pounds you get 120 pounds of manganese if you did all that at once you would burn everything and give everything manganese toxicity so and all the trace elements especially have to take into consideration maximum yield application rates those are on the resource on the resource page earlier i pointed to a um um here it is so at these minerals on this page i need signing fcc literal targets has the maximum yearly application rates very important for the trace elements so when you're doing your math have that sheet from you to make sure that you don't do anything you're not supposed to yeah yeah so the question is about time of year when you should have different minerals the general rule is you should add them yesterday if you need them but there are some things that are better to do in the spring than some better in the fall if it's a water-soluble element you need to feed a crop so in this example that i used before you have a potassium potential potassium deficiency issue that you might come up on that first one if you're trying to grow tomatoes or something there especially if you do in the fall you're going to lose some bleaching over winter essentially so you might want to do that one in the spring or during the growing season if you're adding limestone uh you want to have that the winter time helps to break it down so anytime you're adding rock dust rock powder type of material uh fall is a really good time to use that winter rest period um when it helps to unlock those the compounds from those materials um and then anything that's leachable water soluble is best in the spring when you have a lot of biological activity that can chelate it or bind it up into organic molecules so it doesn't run away uh and leave your leave your farm so that would be like boron phosphates sulfates would be a springtime thing sulfur limestone azomite some of the rock powers would be fall everything else is sort of in the gray area you can do either one but those are the general rules is that information um no but i'll simplify so i'll simplify i'll say it again um rock dust that dump that are not water soluble plant foods some limestone sulfur that requires biological process to break down things like that are best in the fall but you can do it in the spring but they're best to say in the fall and anything is water soluble so those would be the things that are commonly thought of as fertilizers so potassium sulfate kmag or sulfur mag any of the phosphate the the sulfate fertilizer any of them really they're going to leach more readily so you want to apply them in the spring when you have a lot of biological activity to tie them up to make sure they don't run away yeah can you like say for salt for sulphur can you just throw it on your soil or is it so uh you do not have to incorporate uh i certain if you're like if you're chilling just to incorporate minerals um i highly recommend you not do that uh if you are going to till anyway then it's nice to put the minerals down first because it is better to incorporate them but if you have healthy soil life they'll bring your they'll bring those minerals where they need to go quite quickly so yeah it's not necessary for sure how about if you have like a lot of organic matter yeah so if you have organic matter you can put it right on top if your organic matter is something like um if it's something like leaves that where it might sort of concentrate some of those things so if you it hits the leaf and then it rolls and it all goes to one place where you're gonna overdo the soil on a certain mineral then sometimes that's less than ideal um but most things you can put right on top without wearing so just kind of look at how it if you're spreading it by hand or whatever look at an area see how much it's concentrating in your particular type of mulch and see if you think it's going to be a problem and if it is you can always just put half as much down and then do the other half in the spring or at a later time um to make sure you don't overdo it at one time would you say azerite in the fall i would but i like his i mean if i'm going to use i might use a little bit involved a little bit again in the spring i actually really like to do that when i can if it's not adding a lot of extra work i do want to also mention that all of the recommendations on the website they are in terms of granular materials i really want to stress this if you're using water soluble you want to reduce your application rate it's an important piece all right so i didn't get through nearly as much as i wanted to um there's so much to this it is it is overwhelming um but i do want to just mention again the the thing you want to focus on is you look for the weakest link in your particular soil so that's where you want to focus don't get super into getting the soil test perfect um soil tests have a tendency of humbling you quite quickly you think you're doing everything perfect you take your next soil test and it's it's like what the heck just happened um it happens all the time generally there is an explanation for it uh but it can be frustrating um when you don't understand that explanation but generally speaking if it doesn't look like what you expected it to just do the whole exercise again what is now the weakest link and focus on that um some things that get people tripped up as they put line down the next year they test and they don't see anything improved and because they don't realize life takes three years to break down so if it takes three years and you're testing more frequently than that it's quite likely you're gonna see um nothing or a very reduced influence of that and so um keep in mind what you've applied in the past and if you use your intuition to somebody make sure you're thinking about that and don't overdo it so if you're testing every year and you're adding and you needed limestone and you had limestone last year don't add the same amount of lime again because you're probably gonna likely be overdoing a lot when all that becomes available in three years you will have a new problem you've created so um take a slow and steady approach to it remember that we're not actually trying to get a perfect soil test we're just trying to influence the soil structure and the biology in the system as a whole and and here's where i mean so the biology trumps all this stuff every time i mean if you had perfect soil biology like you could shred this and never look at it doesn't matter it doesn't matter at all um the key though is that i've not ever seen an example of really healthy um and i mean like perfectly efficient like super massively efficient systems where biology is working really well where the underlying soil chemistry was really screwed up i've never seen it maybe other people have but i would argue that even in that system you think it's functioning really well in biology alone add the minerals and see if it does even better because everything i've ever seen when you work with the whole system holistically look to try to figure out exactly all the places you can influence it it always works better than just looking at one thing at a time so that's that's a key thing i want to stress yeah so i'd like to open up the question because i don't have time to go to the next section of material um there's a lot of material in these slides at the end i talk about what i have in here every element what it does for plants how it works in soil just a really quick little slide on each one because then that that helps so if you understand what it's doing then it can help you can help to figure out what your plants might be lacking what your soil might prove um so take a look at the slides from the website well they'd be on the website they will be on the website yes and hopefully soon and there's more slides in here this uh mentioned something real quick so when you have uh imbalances you often will see them show up in different ways and so sometimes you'll see um you can find potassium deficiencies by looking at the leaves you can see calcium efficiency looking at the plants and so you can actually figure out a lot of what you might need based on just looking at your field of getting good at observing differences in changes in your plants um and sometimes you'll have plenty of say potassium control tests but you've got plants that look an act just like potassium deficient plants you see it actually all the time generally it'll it should tell you there's something else going on maybe your irrigation system is not working right there's not enough water or there's some other issue that what happens all the time and just real quick does anyone know um does anyone know what causes this calcium calcium there you go so if you have calcium getting your plant attitude amounts you will never see this ever um what is what is that what caused this one does anyone know is that what your tomatoes look like um that is potassium efficiency it's a pretty classic potassium deficiency if you don't have enough potassium getting your plants you don't get uh even ripening and you may not even have examples where you can get no ripening at all and it's really bad uh and what about this one does anyone recognize this first so this one's commonly uh uh this is commonly called early blight some people may have had it on their plants in the past and this and this are caused by the exact same thing if you have adequate potassium in your plants you will not get early blood your plants will die from frost at the end of the year with green leaves always from the ground all the way to the top so um these things you know so if you're seeing these things you have a sign of so underlying problems uh i would argue that there are a number of ways of addressing them uh the psa likes to talk about the soil the minerals the biology one thing that i have found extremely helpful is liquids foliar sprays inoculants these things are by my way thinking like cheating if you go out when you spray really good foliar amendments uh plant shore from agridynamics foley 8k uh people out there talking we have them in the mineral depot you spray those once a week tiny amounts like tiny tiny amounts off in the grand steaming land they can keep you from having any of these problems they keep your plants healthier and then what i have seen is one of the best ways to build biology in your soil is you use the foliar sprays you inoculate and what happens is your plants stay at you know one percent more efficient or so at say photosynthesizing um than the sun that one percent say they're they need this much and they sprung synthesize and they're photosynthesizing this much so they're putting this much into the soil and you're able to increase it one percent more of that one percent increase is going to go into the soil um so little tiny influences on photosynthetic efficiency can quickly double triple et cetera the amount of carbon that your plant can put into the soil because it's creating now excess energy and that is what feeds soil life that's what builds biology builds uh healthy biologically active soils and so anything you can do in my book anything you can do to keep plants a little bit healthier whether that's soil minerals whether that's foliars or anything else it's going to um improve the biological function in that system so that's the last thing i wanted to stress i think and so i will stay as long as people want to stay and ask can you questions about aluminum a little bit aluminum yeah it's always on this oil it's always not sort of this yeah so aluminum is always on uh at least logan left soil tests and many others uh the recommendations for aluminum i don't know where they come from they i have to see 200 250 parts per million i almost never maximum with 250. i almost never see one in range so i basically disregard the recommended range because as with literally all of these elements the target amounts are basically just our best guess and aluminum is one of those things that um our best guess just isn't that good so i don't worry too much basically aluminum is a problem where you get toxic aluminum toxicity the main issue there um aluminum is everywhere it's the foundation of clay uh play is aluminum silica so it's in every like clay molecule and so it's everywhere and the only issue is when it becomes toxic the only way it becomes toxic is if you're massively deficient in in your soil and other areas so that the plant is trying so desperately to get the nutrients it needs that it's making extremely harsh acids dissolving aluminum and sucking a little bit of the plant and causing a little toxicity so if you have balanced soil if you are if you're even anywhere close on your soil test i've never seen aluminum toxicity the only place i've seen it is where you have people going blueberries where they've been told the only way to grow good blueberries is to lower your ph which by the way is not painful to blueberries or anyone wants to know um and then they push it so low they make it so imbalanced that aluminum toxicity so um i don't really worry about it unless i'm working with a blueberry farmer is there a visible sign or something there is i don't know off the top of my head i would google that there's a lot of resources online um i mentioned in one of these slides this one i believe for looking at nutrient impacts on plants so how you scout for nutrient deficiency or excess is that related to arsenic yeah i mean it's just a similar thing applies so people are really worried about heavy metals metal toxicity in the soil lead uptake by plants my understanding is most like heavy metal issues with produce is from physically splashing lead contaminated soil on your feet and very little is picked up by the plants but everything i've read suggests that if you're if your soil balance the more balance your soil the less of those heavy metals are actually brought up into your plant tissue and also the more biology you have the more of that gets chelated in such a way that that's not a problem yeah um [Music] yeah so um well first of all i recommend testing soil about every two years every other year testing or even every three depending so that's the first thing uh and then uh so where what other that was [Music] right it's a different focus perhaps yes but i'd say they're complementary they're not mutually exclusive um i think that i don't i try not to get very dogmatic about this and it kind of bothers me when others do um because uh we don't it's not helpful to be dogmatic about this so no but no but plenty of people do and i just want to uh it's yeah basically um if you're thinking about it holistically you're trying to make improvements um did you approach that field also improving the microbial yeah okay yes absolutely so if you look at no no so this is what i've been saying so just doing the middle approach does is not the best way to do it if you're if you need biology and minerals you do both um so this field we could not have gotten this in three years with minerals alone and i would argue i don't know anyone to do with biology alone either now if someone can please talk to me um but people were trying to fix these fields with biology alone and people were trying to fix it with minerals alone and no one had as much successes when they put it together so this field got the minerals it needed so it got um so this field in particular it had it was like a tc exchange capacity like 80 plus so it's like pure clay if people know that uh the sodium percent was 30. the magnesium was 30 and the calcium was 25 and so like look here they have to totally screw up soil and that's why nothing literally nothing would grow and we probably could have added biology alone to that but you add biology along with that with something where you can't even get weeds to grow the body just dies there's nothing to feed it so what we did was we we broke every rule of the book we applied like 2 000 pounds of elemental sulfur we applied 10 tons per acre of gypsum by the way do not do this unless you have this soil don't do that um but it's exactly what this soil needed to jump start the system like you couldn't have jump started a functional system here unless you did something that radical most of the time you're not dealing with things that need radical change you're dealing with things that need like tweaking um but it works on when you have big problems it works and it works because you're addressing the your big challenges which then allows the whole system to work better so what we did is uh lots of gypsums what luckily jupiter was cheap in this area we used lots of sulfur to help get rid of that extra sodium and the magnesium we tried we grew whatever the heck we could uh we added a whole bunch of humates and carbon sources and microbes are not going to have microbes and then this so yeah if it works together it works really well yes uh yeah that kind of soil is somewhat similar it's over seven percent uh 7ph sorry okay and um i'm curious so they recommended some of the micronutrients in sulfate of copper sulfate because as the ph is going up some of those micronutrients i'm curious if they were recommending smaller amounts just because that was you can only add so much per year and how much of an impact will that potentially have on my ph smaller quantities not much what's your exchange capacity that's so that's partially what determines how much material it takes to increase protein so i mean i haven't seen the result your testosterone of course but i would say if you're not adding elemental sulfur you're not going to see your ph change dramatically um if you're adding just a little bit of sulfate fertilizers then it'll might change it marginally when you are adding those small amounts of those elements your in many cases they recommend them to to feed the crop model to get your crop healthy enough uh you can also use foliars in that case so if you're if your soil is really high ph a low sediment is not really high but if it is really high you can use foliars because if you add it to the soil it's not going to be available to plants so there's a lot of strategies that you can utilize in that example but if you're i mean i don't know what low numbers you were given like what whether it was 30 pounds it might have been like about 15 15. um if you're 15 pounds is basically nothing it's on a per acre basis for l slower so i mean if you were already basically at 50 million or already at your target or 75 even better 15 is probably a good maintenance application to keep it there um the sulfate oil is critically important ones and one thing that i'll mention is that um sulfur we used to barbecue get a lot of sulfur in their fertilizer when they used conventional phosphate fertilizers there was a there was gypsum mixed in so they got calcium sulfur and phosphorus all together and then they they started moving to triple super phosphate because it was more efficient because they had always stripped out all the calcium sulfur is just phosphorus great great idea um and then the other thing that happened in the last couple decades is the clean air act uh has dramatically reduced the amount of sulfur in the atmosphere coming out of coal-fired power plants and farmers we're actually getting a reasonable dose of sulfur sulfur fertilizer everywhere from acid rain and now we're not getting it and i would argue there's a lot of soil systems that kind of got used to it and they were hooked on it and now they're struggling because they're deficient and the sulfur was being rained on for so long was also stripping out some of those other elements like calcium so i think just thinking that we can just let nature take its course we've already screwed the pooch on that one so um you gotta do something a little better than that uh yeah please speak to uh the use of sea salt yeah um so sea salt is great uh basically anything from the ocean it's gonna have a lot of trace elements a lot of like micro trace elements so we only looked at a couple of elements here on the soil before but there's plenty of evidence to suggest at least 42 maybe 46 elements are necessary for enzyme pathogens that have been identified there are 92 naturally occurring elements and there is probably an enzyme pathway that needs every single one uranium included um just haven't discovered it i've seriously spent money on that um and what that means is if you can get those in there in tiny trace amounts you might be actually um increasing your your the efficiency of your system um salt water is going to have most if not all of those naturally occurring elements in it so you're going to get those tiny trace amounts which is really all you need if you don't have them um if you have too much sodium you definitely want to avoid the sodium uh the sea salts that don't have the sodium removed there are some processes you can use to actually remove most of the sodium from seawater and still keep the trace elements um but yeah it's it's great i like that uh azomite it has a lot of trace elements um that's why we have to recommend like the salt rock dust or any rock dust really because there's a lot of those trace elements um well that don't think i mentioned was that we're talking about biological diversity but one thing that spurs biological diversity is diversity of things in the soil parent materials so a diverse diversity of minerals in your soil will actually spur a diversity of biology because different types of biology are are better or worse at digesting different things in your soil so um i mean there's microbes that eat you know sulfur sulfur sulfur vents under the ocean there's like the microbes that literally live off of that and so it's um when we add sulfur we're probably keeping entire new species of life alive in our soil and giving them conditions to thrive so anytime you can add diverse sources of things i like to do it yeah just back to your question about test frequency once every two years um i wanted to steer away from doing mineral testing chemicals because of the very inherent variability in the sampling yeah yeah and then so i love your comments on that plus seasonality impacts the window or do you or or does it somehow wash out the little matter excuse me so the way i recommend the question about the variability in the testing itself and procedures what i like to say is basically when you test try to do the same way because you're really going to compare you want to compare yourself over time to your same you have to start somewhere but then you want to kind of do an applesauce comparison do the same time of year do it in the same way you always want to make sure you take your samples from multiple places in the field so you want to try to get a representative sample the best way is to figure out this i want to test this area so basically try to do random tests don't like let your biases influence where you go or you might find that you go to the places that are the best if you're like i just ate a really good carrot from here or the worst where you're because you're thinking like man this is not a good field so you're gonna go to the worst and then you're gonna you know it'll but you can buy us your soil sample with how you take your test and so try to do randomly try to do at least seven to 12 ish that's a good branch for the number of cores that go into a bag the other thing you want to do is many people take it put into a bucket mix it up take a sample put in a bag and chip it not the best way to do it because soil is not homogeneous it does not break up the same way so when you mix it you're not actually mixing and making homogeneous usually unless you're really and diligent about it and so what that's why soil probes are really nice they don't have to cost a lot um you get them i think for as little as fifteen twenty dollars or you can pay 120 um but basically anything that takes a core sample push the whole sample right into the bag don't mix it the lab will mix it when they get it they got the equipment to do it and homogenize it that's the best way you also avoid a potential route for contamination which would be your bucket i've seen soil tests come back where i'm like that doesn't make any sense i'm like where'd you put your sample and then i put it in the bucket i said what did you use the bucket for last fall and they're like well used i planted some bulbs and so uh oh bone meal and limestone okay there you go just a little bit that's left over is enough to contaminate a sample so um if you can eliminate those sources of contamination and think about that when you're doing it so um does that answer the question so best time to test take soil tests uh was yesterday um if yesterday isn't an option then tomorrow and uh fall i like if you want to know um the worst your worst case scenario spring is best if you want to know your best case scenario assuming you live in a place that has winters and that's because soil rests over the winter time and things become more available generally speaking so your numbers and spring will generally be higher your numbers and fall and so whenever you're taking soil tests kind of think about what what are the questions you're trying to answer the results you're trying to get because um that will help you to figure out should i do it now with the original sprint and it might change depending on whether it's an existing field or a new field or there's lots of lots of new ones there's no simple answer unfortunately all right uh yeah i'll stay as long as you want to stay but it is um the closing remarks happened in three minutes yeah you need water",
