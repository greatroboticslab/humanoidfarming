  "text": "Our last speaker for today is Mark Storman and he is the chief operating officer for nutrient. Uh Mark came to this position as an outgrowth of his experience with with developing and building CG systems. Right. Wow. Anorobic digestion CG at Fair Oaks. at Ferros and he's continuing in that view. Yeah, it's a new new name today, but he's he's dealt with a lot of other renewable energy industry types of things and he's been working on that for the last 35 years. So, with that, I'm going to turn it over to give give control to Mark. Thanks, Jeff. I want to just touch on a little bit of the question because one of the things that we're really working on is at nutrient is product orientation. You know, you're the question that was asked of Jeff is what's important, you know, the operating cost or the the what's really important is the net cost. And if we can't create products that drive projects that make product but makes a make a profit, we just won't have projects. We're just they're not going to happen. And that's what we see over and over again. So, uh, nutrient was was formed because we have this dilemma. You've all heard the joke. Two little twins, one's a optimist, one's a pessimist. Well, that's where we're at, right? Take him to a psychiatrist. Psychiatrist takes the one kid, puts him in a room full of horsemen, closes the door. That'll take care of his optimism. Takes the other young man, puts him in a room full of toys, and the kid sits right down and starts crying. And he's like,\"Wh are you crying?\" And the young man says, \"Because I know sooner or later you're going to take all these toys away from me.\" The psychiatrist goes, \"I can't believe this.\" Well, at least this other young man cannot have found a positive in that room full of horse manure. So, he goes to the room full of horse manure. He opens the door and the kid is having a ball. He is throwing manure everywhere. And the psychiatrist goes, \"Why are you so happy?\" and he's like, \"If there's this much horse manure, there's got to be a pony in here somewhere.\" Well, this is kind of the situation we're in in the animal agriculture neighborhood. You've got optimists and you've got pessimists. And nutrient is kind of formed to help optimists be a little bit more realistic, shall we say, and pessimists to be a little less negative, if we can. We were actually formed by uh an group of dairy cooperatives. DMI is this this group above the line represents about 50% of the milk in the United States and 50% of the cows. Uh DMI and National Milk represent certainly a larger group and they both are on our board. And the idea behind it was that the dairy industry didn't really have an environmental management group that took care of the third M on the dairy, the back end of the dairy. Um we currently see that we have increased regulatory pressure, increased environmental issues, increased societal pressure on our producers. But what we'd like to see is that we would be solving those issues that we would realize economic benefits for solving those issues and that we would become the producers of choice. Now that doesn't mean we don't want other but we would like people to say I wish everybody would do it like the dairy community does and that's what we're trying to work toward and we're trying to work toward products products that lead to incentivized projects that increase the profits for the dairy mill long-term it comes down to sustainability is all about staying in business. That was a definition that wasn't listed, but it's all about staying in business. And so what we've done is we've asked the question, what technologies are out there to produce products? And so we as nutrient were only formed about 2 years ago, but we started out by saying, what technologies are out there? So we were launched in July of 2015. We formed a technology team. Um there's there's more of us now than this select group. And we set out with the goal to evaluate what technologies are out there and how can we put vendors and technologies together with dairy farms that need this technology and how can we help incentivize both. And so we had to actually go through a couple iterations. We we actually launched a SharePoint site to work internally to be able to work on our documents. and we we built out our first edition of our catalog on that SharePoint site. Um it turned out to be really too big and too robust like everything everything grows to fit the space. So we actually transitioned after we launched our website to a a computer system called Sitecore and then we launched our beta version to our board in November and December and in March 1st we actually launched the nutrient catalog. If you go to nutrient.com and it says catalog up there, you can go to the nutrient catalog right now. So don't everybody pull it up on their phones. We're going to stay with the slides, but afterwards I'll show you what we're doing. So what did we do to evaluate technologies? How how do you how do you go about looking at everything from anorobic digesttors to slope screens to generators to CNG stations and things like that? Well, the first thing we said is let's let's catalog the technologies and then let's ask them what their business is like. So, we created a business information request and then we said, okay, that's your business, but do you have specific technologies that you sell in your business? And I'm going to pick on a couple of different different technology providers. Car's in the room, so I'll pick on him a little bit because he deserves it. And then there's other guys out there. There are people that sell multiple technologies. As a matter of fact, car's technology breaks down into two or three different technologies. So you might have two or three different pages in the catalog. You would use the same business information. It's not doesn't change his business, but it does change the technology and and that's how we make the information available to people. And then we wanted to do on-site visits for those technologies that showed real promise. We wanted to create a standardized case study where the nutrient technology people would go to the vendor and say, \"Take us to your site. Take us to somewhere where you can say, \"This is it. This it doesn't get much better than this if you put that in.\" Now, I had an advantage. Car's Carrie's system at at Fair Oaks is 20 minutes from my house. So, I've been to his site multiple times and I helped build the site, but we had an opportunity to walk through there and look at it and to talk to people and to do an evaluation. And then we wrote up a case study and then we shared that case study and went back and forth so we could really document what's happening there when this works, right? And then finally, we compiled all this information, assessed it, and synthesized it and put it into the catalog. But then we decided to go one step further because it's it's one thing to have a catalog. It's another thing to actually have information that goes beyond the catalog. And so what that team of experts that I showed you on the first page was is we tried to use a criteria scale to help make informed decisions and to make recommendations about technologies. And and so we created the nine-point scoring system. And then we actually created a couple of different categories to recognize technologies. And when we say rig recognized technologies or we we consider it a technology an emerging technology, here's the criteria that we use. Two farmers walk out of the coffee shop, they walk out, they get to the front of their truck, and one farmer says, \"Hey, I heard you bought name the technology.\" and they lean for five minutes on the front of somebody's pickup truck and they talk about that technology. That's what we're trying to do. We're not trying to say, \"Oh, this is the technology you have to buy.\" We're trying to say, \"This is information you'd like to know about this technology.\" If we're saying it's emerging, it's probably something you want to talk a little more about. This is worth looking at. If it's recognized, it's probably established. there's probably a reason that it got to where it is, but and you should probably consider this if you're going to put in that type of system. So certainly if you have no reason to do clear water, then you don't want to go to the nutrient recognized technologies that produce clean water because you're unless of course you're just so cash you'd like to invest in things and try them. But we're trying to say if you're going to put in something to get clean water, then if there's a nutrient recognized vendor, you should consider talking to them as part of your research. So that was the idea behind the catalog. The nine-point criteria was actually grew out of a lot of struggle within our group. Our technology advancement team, part of us wanted to just really have numbers like we want to put everybody's numbers right out there. But then you have such divergent technologies that what does a number mean? I mean, and then another part of us said, well, let's just be subjective. Let's just put comments out there. We didn't really like that either. So, what we ended up doing was we came up with this nine-point system. And you can see they're kind of divided into three groups. The first group was about commercial viability. Do you have an operational history? Do you have third three systems operating on a dairy farm? If you do, that goes from white to brown. Do you have a record of 12 months of reliability on those three? Another another point, market penetration. Once you get 10, you get the third one. And you can see how it works. Have you in that business and economic transparency um technology, have you really explain what your capex is or is it to be determined by site? Right? And we all know that there are technologies that the price of the technology depends on who they are talking to, right? So we try to get as much quantifiable as we can in those TIS and BIS. We every everybody's got acronyms, right? Business information request, BIR, technology information request, TIR, operation and maintenance cost. And then um we actually switched these around because we did we wanted this value proposition with the economics. But the value proposition doesn't have to necessarily be dollars. It's value to the farm. And I'll give you Fair Oaks is a great example. When I first started working for Fair Oaks, there wasn't a single dig. There were nine dairy farms. Almost not drive down I65. The smell was so bad. And people weren't liking it. Local people were upset. Over the next five years, every digtor near the highway put in an anorobic digesttor. 100% almost 30,000 cows going into anorobic digesttor. You didn't smell it. If we had tried to build a tent farm without those digesttors, we' have never got a permit. County wouldn't have issued it. We had had riots. Now we built a visitor center, actually four visitor centers, and a half a million people a year visit the Fair Oaks Farms agurism site. Completely different situation. Did did the digesttors add value? Absolutely. Can you quantitize the odor reduction value? No. we were able to expand. We were able to build other businesses around it. And then finally, real quickly, those um vendor information sharing and business technology information, those case studies I referred to. And then the last part is through constant contact, we actually allow the vendors to reach out to their customers, to the people they've sold systems to and ask for a rating. And the rating is very simple. On a scale of 1 to 10, would you recommend this technology to another farmer? And why? That's it. You get over seven from three of your vendors, you get that last point. So, this is a mockup of the catalog real quickly because every time I go out and do this, I try to do it online, right, to actually show you the catalog and every time there's a technical D. So, I doing this on the slide and then I actually have it pulled up and it's working on Google. So, if you want to look at it live, we can do that afterwards. But basically the first thing you do is you sign on to the technology and it gives you an explanation of how the thing works and it gives you criteria that you may want to use. And when you say you type in tried it or you click on nutrient recognized technologies it would fill in here in what we call the landing page all of the technologies that met your criteria. So you can do very in-depth searches there or you can just hit I want to see all technologies and it pops up 17 pages and 178 some technologies. Right now when you click on the individual pages you go to the technology page and I'm going to actually get a little bit more into that. This is what happened when we um taking it for a test drive when I put in the category nutrient recognized. These are the two that popped up right now. Part of that is because we're still in the process of getting a lot of the material done. So this is the DVO what we all have come to know as mixed complete mixed digtor or mixed plug flow digtor. And this is the mlina hand sand separators. Two established technologies lots of history. You know those were done fairly early on because we did a lot of testing with them. I could have also clicked on emerging technologies in Udys and carry system there and also a couple of other systems. You've heard of the Vanguard business model. That's another one. But here is where you you'd click on one of these and then you'd move on. And I just happen to use the Mlanahan sand separation because it didn't really apply as much to the individual. So we can talk about the website, not the technology. But there's the company description. the company description, all of this information on this half of the page. Nutrient through the technology team and the leadership they provide works to develop all of this information with the vendor. So there's a brief company description, a picture of the technology, a description of the technology, all of their contact information, if they've got a YouTube site, a LinkedIn site, a Facebook site, everything they might want to put there. These are the categories that they fall in. And then business information, equipment insights, photo links, video links, case studies, all go right here below the fold. This is our little box for the lawyers, the legal disclaimer that says all of the things that anyone says a lot. It basically says that we got this from public information. We're not going to defame anybody and stuff like that. Below the line, we have basic information. If there is a if it's a standard system for say slope screens or solid separation, there might be a little description of what the big process does. And then there's actually specifics to let you know and understand what the technology advancement team understands about that technology. And then you can real quickly look at this. And of course with a pointer it's not moused over but when you mouse over it it actually explains to you which of these categories are you click in the center of that score you end up knowing what the final is what it'll take you to a page where it explains everything. I'm going to share with you that we're actually continuing to work on this. This is a suspended solid. So here's that little kind of table of what the technology is like. We're kind of working on a way to add a add a criteria at the technology level that would help people see how these would perform on your farm. So for example, you would have N recovery, P recovery, greenhouse gas reduction, storage reduction, odor reduction, and pathogen reduction. How does this perform to the baseline for a flush dairy, a dry lot dairy, or a scrape dairy? And so that a farmer could very quickly see, oh that that I'm a flush. That's not going to do anything for me. Now, I just made that up. These are just mocked up because we haven't gotten through that process. That's a process we're working on to take it to the next level. Questions? How much does it cost for a vendor to be out there? Nothing. How much does it cost for a producer to go there? Nothing. They do have to put in their name and their email address. So, how do you pay for all this? We are funded out of a very small check off portion from those 12 dairy cooperatives and some money from DMI. And and this portion, just so that people kind of understand, DMI is checkoff dollars. This portion primarily is checkoff dollars because it's all pre-ompetitive. It's all done on a very non-competitive. We're just evaluating technologies that are out there basis. Jordan, uh, do you when you like when you get numbers the pathogen removal and things like that, how where do those numbers come from? What we're what we're in the process of doing right now is having those discussions. The idea is that we would start by quantifying what's out there in peer-reviewed literature, what's out there in thirdparty validated literature, and then we'll probably end up going to ex putting together a room full of people like this to get expert opinion for those missing gaps. But that process is actually we launched this in March. So that's kind of the discussion around version 2.0. That probably won't happen till next year sometime. That I mean that would seem quite expensive as the trouble coordinators always have with creating paintings is it is it is quite expensive and and part of the reason that we can do this is we have distributed and work with a lot of consultants. We don't have a lot of full-time employees but we do try to get a lot accomplished. So let's go to Bill and then we'll get Jeremy. So, uh, you heard Jeff say that the producer wants to go to capital cost. Um, in your in your model, your online form is for Mlanahan, for example, is there something in there that that gives you cost for we ask we ask specifically if they have if in the technical information, if you click on that, you'll download a PDF. It's 17 pages long. It asks things like what kind of water connection do you need? what kind of power connection do you need? And it asks specifically, what is the capital cost of this equipment? And is it scalable? So, for instance, somebody might say, our system for 1,000 cows is $500,000. I'm just making up numbers right now. And it's scalable up, but not down. This is as small as we make it. So, again, it depends on the technology. And that's why we've we've talked about in this in this model having some sort of quantifiable, you know, idea of what the impact is. We've actually even talked about on the outside edges putting in capital cost and operating cost and just doing something like you see in a restaurant of $1 sign to $4 signs. But you know, it's very difficult to do because something might be a very high capital cost but very low operating cost and that might work fine for somebody because it's so it's a one-time commitment and I can get a equip grant to help cover the cost. I'll put it in. So it that becomes really tricky when you start dealing with relative cost of technologies from anorobic digestion down to a slope screen. Yeah, that was another Yeah, let's go to Jeremy. Um well this might be pretty quick. Um so you mentioned like 178 so far in there. It looks like I'm assuming these are all onfarm systems or are there dairy based technologies that would be centralized or mobile that work across multiple operations? There are a few centralized and mobile systems. This this is actually because it did work. This is the actual page. So you can see here's how it works and those sort of things. And what I'm going to do just to what I'm going to do if I can get the mouse to work for me is I I'll just quickly take you to the uh all technology so you see how it pops up. So you get about 10 10 pages if if we haven't been able to validate the information on the top page. So we build these websites out of the publicly available information, but we do put a signal on it if it's not validated yet. So like makes a gas upgrading system. So but we haven't been able to get a hold of them to validate all the numbers and and the information that's there and get a BIR and TI. So we just put that as a flag up there. It's there's nothing wrong with it. It's just we're still in the process of working on it. But there's about 17 pages like that. Got two questions and we're going to have to wrap it up. So Mark, but I'm willing to stay and if you want to see stuff, we'll play with it. But you guys are all free to go after the next two. These two questions. Just to follow up on the on the cost in and and maybe uh on that where you're where you're going back and making some judgment calls on that. Is there going to be an opportunity to then to for your ex your panel or experts or whatever to say is that a realistic cost? Because if if the technology provider they're giving a c cost for the piece of equipment, they're not necessarily going to be saying what's it going to cost to retrofit that into your existing system. So we we definitely again remember the goal is you're leaning on your pickup truck. Should I call this vendor or not? So we're not trying to replace any vendor. I mean if you ask me should I call them? Absolutely you should. But what I'm trying to do is help guide you in a direction. And so, you know, if if it looks to us like there may have been issues with a technology, then as politely as we can without saying don't call these people, we say make sure you ask about reliability. You know, have this discussion with the vendor, right? So, and your idea what's too high a cost and my idea might be different. And so we're just trying to get the information out there. We're trying to be very fair to the vendors and the people who are providing the technologies. At the same time, we're probably trying to add value to the dairy farmer who may be looking at these technologies. Nick, do you evaluate um only US companies or is it other? What we've done, and there's a few exceptions in here, but what we've done is we've only looked at US dairy installations. Now, there are a few companies that have joined with us that seem to have good technologies that have promised for use in the United States that have not yet been able to find someone. What happens in those cases is we'll put in the comments that this has not been evaluated using the nine-point system because it's not operational on a dairy, but the technology looks like it could work. So until you actually have something on a dairy, we're not going to do an evaluation because even though it even though you have 10 of them in Italy, I'm not familiar with the I mean, I'd love to go and spend a few weeks studying the dairy practices of Italy, don't get me wrong, but I'm not familiar enough with it to say that that's going to be transferable. Does that make sense? Let's give it We might close it off from there.",
