  "text": "hello everyone on behalf of Agri links be the future and the USAID bureau for food security I would like to welcome you to our webinar today on strengthening private sector Extension and advisory services in an international development context my name is Julie McCarty and I am your Agri links webinar host with the USAID bureau for food security I'll be your webinar facilitator today so you'll hear my voice periodically especially during our question-and-answer session but before we dive into the content I would like to go over a few items to orient you to the webinar first please do use the chat box to introduce yourself to ask questions at any point and to share any resources you may have that are relevant to the topic today and thank you to everyone who's introduced yourselves already we always love to see that we have a global audience for these webinars we'll be collecting your questions throughout the webinar and will pause after each speaker for a couple of questions and the speakers will also answer some of the questions in the chat box along the way and then we'll probably wind up saving the bulk of the questions until after the three presentations today lastly we are recording this webinar and we will e-mail you the recording the transcript and any additional recommended resources once they are already perhaps in about a week and half time or so and they'll also be posted on the Agri links org website okay onwards to our presentations and our discussions on extension in today's webinar the Feed the Future developing a local extension capacity project also known as Dilek will present results of a portfolio review exploring recent experience and potential for expanding private sector extension and advisory services for the AG sector in addition to the initial presentation on this select study our webinar today will also cover two case studies of private sector extension which I'm really excited about one in Senegal and one in Uganda the webinar speakers will give recommendations for expanding private sector extension services through future US aid projects and other investments okay I think we're pretty much ready to dive in so I'm going to introduce our first speaker who will then introduce our subsequent speakers and then we can get started Christine Davis is a senior research fellow with the International Food Policy Research Institute or if pre where she has been since 2004 and her work involves research and capacity strengthening on Agricultural Extension education and agricultural innovation systems and she is currently the project co-director for the Felix project funded by US aid which she will be talking about now during a webinar so I'll pass the microphone over to Kristin thanks very much Julie good day to everyone yeah from my side I'll be presenting the study that Julie has mentioned on private sector extension and then we'll be hearing from two case studies from Uganda and Senegal and as Julie mentioned there'll be questions in between you can use the chat box for questions too so after I present the study which you can download in the links box on the Left there's an overview and the full study after my presentation we'll hear from Robert and Yong from Kim onyx international Roberts and agricultural value trained improvement and marking a marketing expert he's got 23 years of experience applying the facilitative approach to market systems and value chain development so you'll be hearing about that when he presents the village agent model from Uganda he's currently the agriculture and food security adviser for eastern and southern Africa region 4 come onyx and Robert has worked in extension programs in 19 countries in sub-saharan Africa working to strengthen public private extension capacity and also with digital technologies and then we'll hear also from John Michelle Michelle visage from RTI he's based in the car in Senegal and is a senior market systems advisor at RTI International and jean-michel has worked twenty years in the West African region linking private sector banks grassroots rural organizations to build sustainable market systems that benefit small farmers and jean-michel has been a chief of party and technical advisor to the Feed the Future that's Harlan by projects so he'll be presenting that but let me give a little bit of introduction to delectable ocol extension capacity this is a Feed the Future project implemented by digital green together with if free care international the Global Forum for rural advisory services and we do work closely with the CGIAR research program on policies institutions and markets Dilek strengthens extension in Feed the Future and aligned countries through three interlay interrelated sets of activities these are Diagnostics studies such as we're presenting today on the private sector extension we've also done 10 or 11 studies on assessments of extension in Feed the Future countries we also get involved in pilot engagements on the ground in different countries implementing best practices that we found through the Diagnostics and then we bring all the learning from the Diagnostics and engagements to the extension community in countries and globally through communities of practice such as we're doing today so let me dive right in I think Julie mentioned that we want to summarize lessons learned and also options to expand private sector extension and advisory services we call it EAS at times through future US aid projects but also other investments and the study inputs are including a global literature review I'll touch on that briefly and also a rapid desk review of US aid investments in 28 Feed the Future and aligned countries as I'm sure you're aware extension is recognized as essential for program who are trying to transform AG systems governments and other investors who want to address global social and economic development objectives such as reducing food insecurity poverty etc and both public and private organizations are active in extension and advisory services in most countries just to define for you who are we talking about with private sector actors and you'll hear excellent examples from Robert and Jean Michel we're talking about basically all the non-governmental actors so we're talking about both nonprofit and for-profit entities these includes civil society and NGOs who are trying to advance their organisational mandate it includes input suppliers and other for-profit entities they want to sell products they want to please their customers it includes people like product buyers who are trying to get adequate supplies of good quality commodities we also have consultants and consulting firms who are selling their services the media are also often for-profit marketing information services and then we have producer organizations who want to service or represent their groups interests so we'll be hearing about them in more detail from my presentation and the case studies the private sector has always complimented public sector extension and advisory services and you might notice in the report and then the presentation that we talk a lot about the public sector still and that comes because of the portfolio review that we did we saw a strong role still of the public sector they important to complement the private sector and essential really to meet objectives of different development partners and so that's why you hear about the public sector in this private sector webinar but I'd like to jump also into the literature review why the private sector why private sector extension and advisory services well there's a lot of potential for private sector in terms of providing sustainability of extension services of meeting needs of farmers I'll mention a few of these here they do increase profits to both the service provider and to the clientele of the farmer so their shared value there it's also used to strengthen long term business relationships private sector is good for promoting innovation and service delivery including the use of ICTs and the private sector helps to ensure adequate quantities and quality of market products and they do participate as as financers as service providers as users of extension and advisory services and we saw that most US aid extension and advisory service projects implement by using private contractors or grantees in addition to the potential of private sector there's of course limitations as well and of course one of these is that they need cost recovery they're trying to get their cost back and even make some money in providing these services and as a result the coverage isn't always perfect it's sometimes limited to people who can afford to pay for services to people with the higher value crops and other products sometimes there's a perceived or an actual conflict of interest for people like maybe some input providers who people think are just trying to flog their product without necessarily you know caring about the bigger picture of what the producers need there's also the case that many extension providers from the private sector actually lack experience they lack capacity and interest in extension and advisory service provision there's also the issue of the nature of innovations you know there's the public versus the private goods and so certain innovations are better for the private sector because commercialization is possible and then there's other goods such as public goods natural resource management and so forth that is less interesting for the private sector so that's quickly a review of the literature we want to make time for the case studies but now I want to walk into the portfolio review we looked at 28 feed the future and aligned countries they're listed here and we've been in touch with many of you we looked at a hundred and thirty three projects from the year 2010 to 2019 and these projects that we looked at these programs were actually quite complex they had on average three point six different components or objectives and some had more than ten so it's quite a lot that they were taking on only five of the projects were solely extension and advisory services and these two of these were actually implemented by USDA the United States Department of Agriculture and about five to ten percent of the funding of these projects were for the extension and advisory services component so that's an overview of what we looked at for the portfolio review what we found we looked at first of all some design considerations when we looked at these 28 countries and 133 projects design of programs is important because it establishes the base for investment success or failure it determines the nature and extent of the impact and what we found is there appear to be some significant design issues for extension and advisory services and for effective private sector participation in the systems the first of these is that there appeared to be a weak analytical base for design a lot of the planning seem to have been maybe ad hoc done by contractors and grantees during planning or as they started implementation and it didn't seem like the strategy and approach was necessarily linked to some evidence base relatedly we didn't find much of an evidence base for the content that was being promoted so we weren't sure why these innovations were being promoted and how they were linked back to the needs from the clientele thirdly as I mentioned the projects are quite complex you know there's a lot of activities in many of these projects there's extension services financial services input supply producer organizations irrigation mechanization market development all of these are needed to enable change at the farm but of course with so much complexity so much going on it's hard to give due attention to the extension component specifically and then we found very ambitious targets many of these were actually met or even exceeded but one wonder is when you're trying to reach such large targets in clientele does it compromise the quality and the intensity of the services so those are some design considerations we also looked at some of the implementation considerations too and as I mentioned we found this surprisingly strong reliance on public extension and advisory services this was true in almost all the projects even those with weak extension services and of course it's necessary to gain access to communities validate legitimacy and of course to provide content backup and so forth but that was found across the board in terms of methodologies very traditional we found farmer training demonstration field days and a sprinkling of others like mass media Affairs and so forth which is fine traditional methodologies are great where they work and as you see in point three radio was very common and very effective but we found limited applications of other information and communication technologies or ICTs and effective communication is really at the heart of extension and advisory services so we might want to consider other applications of ICTs fourthly subsidies for inputs were very common they're often used to encourage adoption which is great but they are well known to distort market decisions and to be unsustainable of course most EAS programs are essentially subsidies themselves so then the issue becomes what do we subsidize how much and for how long and then lastly decentralization was a common issue 15 countries had decentralized their public systems while carrying potential benefits they can be really chaotic disruptive they give new responsibilities it requires you know different financial arrangements different budgeting and so forth so it's it's quite a long process and takes a lot of thinking we then looked at the different project roles that we found across the board and we found that producer organizations were ubiquitous they were used in all of the projects in all the countries most projects or evaluation reports that we looked at identified them as needed strengthening but very little was actually provided and now you'll hear more from John Michell about the use of producer organizations in the project he's presenting contact lead farmers farmer volunteers there's many different names these were also ubiquitous and they're important because they link the providers and the communities they expand the reach but of course you know there's there's issues with them which we can discuss if we have time at the end as well and then you'll be hearing more from Robert about the input dealers but they were very common as well across the board there's a strong common interest for promoting the use of inputs from both you know the projects and the input providers themselves but we did find that the capacity the range of services of input providers was often limited I want to move now to just talking about how can we invest what do we want to promote so that we can expand and strengthen private sector extension and advisory services what interventions can we bring in and I realize this is a very long list but I'm gonna talk about each of these points one by one excuse me so firstly I think this is a big systems area we need to develop national extension policies and strategies or if they are already developed they need to be strengthened and implemented so the coherent public sector policies on extension are key they provide an enabling environment they either enable or disable private sector to come in and so they're very important and one intervention here for funders whether there may be programs or projects or fun of any type including government you can support formulation of national extension and advisory service policies a second intervention is to strengthen the public sector this as I said before is a bit counterintuitive but the public sector really serves as a backbone of the full extension and advisory service system so it's important to have a strong public sector so that we can have a strong private sector as well thirdly we need to improve support services for extension these include things like training research subject matter specialists backstopping communications monitoring and evaluation and so forth this is important for the private sector fifthly we want to strengthen producer organizations they are private sector entities they're key players for effective and sustainable extension systems and I think more intentional effort is needed to bring more innovative approaches and to develop further these organizations and I think we'll hear more about that from Jean Michel the sixth point is to strengthen the input suppliers they were also an important element for private sector extension and here we want to focus on improving professionalism management quality consciousness and things like that there's other private sector providers also that needs strengthening number seven we need we need to strengthen potential private sector providers who might be weak it might be more efficient it might be more preferable to strengthen their capacity give them business plans and business models before expecting them to engage effectively in provision of EIS themselves number eight we want to strengthen quality certification system so when we're talking about the private sector we want to pay attention to the quality the objectivity the qualifications of these different providers and their accountability and a possibility here might be to fund technical assistance training or development costs for a system to establish standards to register certified extension providers I think Roberts gonna touch on that in his presentation from Uganda and then number 9 there's a need to strengthen and to establish stakeholder consultation programs things like innovation platforms where you bring together the public sector the private sector researchers agribusiness farmers to address specific problems or opportunities and then there's the issue of subsidies so you know you might want to subsidize so that you're promoting adoption or uptake of innovations early in a project so you might want to think about strategically subsidizing and give things maybe for free or subsidized initially or or to get things going but be aware and have a sort of an exit strategy for how you're gonna phase that out in the end and then finally the last investment intervention I think is to actually directly fund extension delivery and this is especially the case where it might be appropriate for post-crisis countries fragile states where you're serving disadvantaged populations or in natural resource conservation programs so these kinds of programs have an advantage that there's a direct link between the funding and the clientele and their impacts the disadvantage on the other hand is that they're generally time can time limited not sustainable and they're limited in terms of scale as well one more slide and then I'll talk about how delet can come in and help some of the missions and so forth on this but we sort of these four recommendations according to four different scenarios from a very weak public and weak private extension system to a very strong and strong public and strong private system and if you look in the report on the on the left that you can download you'll find preliminary recommendations for each of the 28 countries the 28 portfolios that of course these recommendations are highly tentative because this was a rapid review for detailed analysis is needed but we can offer that I'll tell you in a minute how so starting in the top box if you have a weak public and a weak private system like in post crisis countries those with limited economic development you might want to have direct delivery so you want to address these immediate needs and you want to focus probably on capacity development as a high priority especially that of producer organizations moving down to the second row if you do have a weak public but a strong private system this is probably rare if it exists at all but you can think about pockets of strong private sector extension maybe in countries that have plantation crops or something like that here you want to establish the necessary foundation you want to provide capacity for the public sector as a priority and in the third scenario where you have a strong public but a weak private sector extensions here's where you want to target support to strengthen the private sector and have support services strengthened technical specialist support and communications as well and then lastly if you're in a fortuitous situation that has a strong public and a strong private sector you have the basis for a strong and effective national system and activities here from donors and other funders should strengthen capacities but also focus on coordination and may be gaps in serving underserved clientele as well so the takeaway here that we really want to give you from the report is that this is a call to investment in national extension and advisory service system development so looking at the whole picture all the different providers from a pluralistic environment I think the system development is key for sustainability efficiency effectiveness of the private sector and it's been neglected in the past with inadequate attention to local capacity development and to analytical work in extension and advisory services there's a lot more recommendations in the overview that you can download and in the file the full file as well that I hope you'll take a look at and give us comments on I just want to close here before I turn it back to Julie with mentioning that D Lake the developing local extension capacity project can assist us aid missions with analyses further analysis like a deep dive into why the private sector is not working or how it can be strengthened we can help with project design review scopes of works or help with workshops for project design and implementation suggest consultants and even do evaluation of extension and advisory service activities so with that I'm gonna pause let Julie see if there's some key questions we want to answer before turning over to Robert to present the case study on Uganda great thank you so much Kristin for that excellent presentation we've had a few questions come in at all to you before we move on let's see do t-pain former USAID member asked do you have any sense of the number of farmers reached by various approaches in this study radio is of course common and effective do you have any numbers on other digital tools or services Thanks hi hi Judy I knew we'd hear from you on the digital side we don't have specific we'd we didn't aggregate as to the number reached by different tools and approaches in all from the the review the portfolio review it was reported that 89 million farmers were reached so it was a huge reach but I think it was through all the different methods and of course radio Reach is probably by far the most of them but we don't have specific information at the at this report level of how many were reached by the different digital tools great thank you and a question from Gordon OTN Oh ones are how do you assess the strength weakness of an extension and advisory service public or private is there a specific tool that you use for assessing then thanks Gordon we don't have a specific tool I think there's people working on these types of issues we can sort of use the elements that I've outlined here in in the presentation and the report and if you go to download the huge report the big full report we have sort of a decision tree at the end which can help you see which direction you should go in in order to intervene but I can I can talk to you maybe I can use the chat box after and talk about some other initiatives that are going on to assess extension in general not just private sector great thank you I think we'll throw in one or two more short questions and then if you also wouldn't mind helping to answer some in the chat box once Robert gets underway let's see Liz so go to asked do you have any scenario time scales for how long it would take to implement some of these best fit recommendations assuming some regionality or shared environment etc scenario timelines everything takes longer than you expect for instance I I'm based in South Africa and I have been assisting or I had assisted with the development of a national extension policy and it took years I know you you know Uganda has been going through something similar and Malawi is in the in the process of sort of revising their national policy it takes a long time and you have to be ready you know for sort of the long haul in some of these systems development areas in terms of regionality yeah I'm assuming you're talking about learning across the region but yeah I think we always need to plan for longer longer than we expect [Music] you have any any plans perhaps for a question from Erna Abidine are there any plans for how to link this USAID funded program to any nonprofit NGOs outside of US aid or or to other entities outside of US aid or outside of it free yeah thanks yeah so so the developing local extension capacity is a is a Feed the Future project that's focused on Feed the Future countries those are listed I'll share the link or somebody can share the link in the chat box in a moment what the Feed the Future countries are but we do work with other partners depending on what the needs are in that country so for instance in Nigeria we worked with a private sector company that wasn't you know part of Feed the Future necessarily and in other countries we've been working with with NGOs in Bangladesh for instance so it's not you know we can link up with other with other nonprofit entities depending on you know the joint interests the the shared objectives in the country where we're working great Thank You Christian in the interest of time I think we can move along but we will continue to address questions in the chat box and at the end of the presentation so next we'll move along to Robert and yang for his portion of the presentation Thank You Julia Thank You Julie and thanks a lot Christian for that wonderful presentation I am also very super excited to talk about extension after spending 90 years trying to find ways to make it cheaper and affordable to most care FAMAS the late norman borlaug used to tell us I actually work for Sasakawa epic Association before I joined harmonics if you say take technology closer to the farmers in terms of innovations and information and instead employers find means of doing that so that can be sustainable over the years we try so many models with my man league's approach the these quality community-based by setting by another day as soon as we stop funding it it all stops so we start taking how do we do it better and that's what I want to share with you today we all know in extension the biggest cost is not wages or salary the biggest cost is logistics and training actually logistic takes 58% of all extension delivery both public and private sector extension systems now let's talk about the public a second delivery system in Uganda I'm sure it's not different from any other countries we we do have a ratio of extension worker to Pharma at one one one essential worker to want other iterate farmers may be unconscious like utopia I can't find one to 500 meaning we are not reaching out to farmers in a proper way and if we take a look at the advert the private sector you know the private sector has about four models they promote the family led model which is mostly to improve formal situation and offer them better opportunities which I did for 14 years and to empower farmer and we the donors keep on finding aids as soon as we pull out it it goes back to the same way we met it the global sourcing module is a welder modules across in big commodities mostly to secure life supplies and have like impact on on farmers but it also have their drawbacks mostly you find there's a high rates of side selling by the same producers and it sometimes offer the systems of commercial service to these farmers then you have the local traders models they are very efficient in sourcing they reach the farmer home they these guys you find on bicycle go to Amazon to pick up one bag of maize but did there's always issue of mistrust among each of them and and definitely always causing problems between farmers and traders then we'll have the specialized models like Christy mentioned about consultants yeah just are the ones trying to improve and innovate I gotta buy the chains use of ICT user means over here for mass but make it for profits but is also his own drawbacks is have high initial cost of investment so we keep on thinking how do we do it in an effective and affordable way I was the chief of party of a project called the commodity production market activity Uganda that ended in March 2018 and then we decided to combine all of these models together they form a late models the specialized models the local traders and the global sourcing and we find a commonality among all this we try to find out we the last person the rich other farmer in all these models they all have alcohol and agents and why do we decide to work with such people we believe the biggest problem in supply chain is size selling and reaching out from us on terms of quality and quantity so but but working with the same guys that does in most Harbach which are the traders may be we able to improve the system by a coaching and mentoring them so on that our program we can what we call the village agent model and this height works is a market-driven approach we first engaged a market pool the market pool means the end buyer the person that signals what he wants in terms of quantity and quality is at an exporter or or an buyer or likes processing companies then he and the five traders traders can be cooperatives or modernizations hoppers organizations or miss Morley traders individual traders and these same contracts and say okay this is what we want to do this is the amount of maize or coffee or beans I like to buy so can you please make up how you gonna do the production contract if you have signed a contract with the exporter and each other and advice relate agent who a lawyer to him remember the village agent is the one that lives in the village with it with your farmer easy one to push to call the shack the coyote the long shot that give loans to farmers and high rates but he knows every farmer in the village because he stays in there and he is a point of entry because he moves from home to home to pick a bag of maize or two bags of maize so if you train those ones to provide extension in terms of production and marketing services maybe we're able to be able to improve the life of the farmer because remember I said the biggest cost in extension is logistics this agent go from home to home to pick back up maze without being paid but I get it Commission for do units so they are being motivated by based on the volume they collect and which they get paid by their traders in terms of Commission so what we do as CPM we call it the comma to push on magnet IVA T we mentor and coach them in different services on the up pre-production production and post office emergency services and part of them we would train them to be crop insurance agents because it was demand for crop insurance we train them to be Impuls of supply services because they can actually forecast demand between the needs Alfama and seed companies they provide planted services they were training winning services we are traded in fortune services but I agent takes only four to five of these services to get yourself a Popeye the wall yeah let me tell you what makes it interesting for them to do it the agent makes an average of four thousand dollars in profits from doing this twenty services and that's a motivation that drives them to reach out to the farmers knowing fully well the more farmers will improve their production the more Commission I get from my trader and how did it deliver services to farmers because they are used to Vince from us at the home so individual farmers it was easy for them to understand to do but we incorporate things like ammunition videos on their tablets I think Christian has been talked about edited means of linking from us we develop animation videos to help them pass the message in a very eloquent way to promise because you know most of us who are not well trained extension workers so we have to make sure the messages is clear and able to divide they also promote do a second delivery by doing one called demand created demonstrations these are the typical demonstrations they have signed contract with input companies but this is to create demand so they can make money from it and they often provide direct service to farmers by going there to spray take care of the coffee and wait for them amazing other methods we use was user I see I see because definitely they are very versatile in in communicating in their local languages so we translate that with the mission of Agriculture all the essential materials into local languages for them to achieve delivered from us and it's often to use the nice group training I'm home visit among all these associate degree methods they use the individual visits and all visits was the most common among which was effective to reach out the numbers of Hamas how did they make money and sustain a model and a bag of on one bad or fatality cell and agent make within five to six dollar profits so meaning if I have to read from a problem for me I said 20 bucks or fertilizers that means I can be able to get 100 dollars and how I will surely get his money remember every seed company or fertilizer company needs to reach out to the plumber the cost of the reaching out to the farmer is almost around 35% so this money is now half of it is not given to the agent because Dave we find out where the farm as a and they would deliver it but Reza to the farmer at his doorstep and also provide were called and better services and this was worked well and in terms of soy testing they provide such tests in the mill at five dollars what would this site testing companies they had like my fear is when they spray the megabyte 0.5 dollars in every liter they make money along the chain every service they provide overall I was like to measure impact and say okay as it's making any changes in the period of five years from 2013 to 2018 we found a lot of changes are out goes truth just quick to the slide that was about their districts tension our target was to reach our two numbers of Hamas who have applied new technologies our baseline was 52,000 but but because the extension ID built agent model work effectively we're able to reach by for a ninety six thousand the a great numbers of family agent was around to hundreds of per agent meaning closer and easy tool to manage the investment by the private sector because they found that they could get more supplies and more a better quality they invested in things like prison facilities they invested in things like a provide loans to trade us to buy more and you know the see the inputs delivery oh by a pillar of five years this agent was able to sell 5 million dollars worth of inputs that reach out to farmer and we did a survey trying to find out how many this farmers actually an apposite benefits of using inputs we found our seventy percent of these people appreciate them village agent driven service to them in a better way now in every model there's things that can make it's filled and I've talked about this more during our inception period we found out most people tend to see the traders at the battery put to work weights and most donors and angels don't want to associate with them but if you look at the value chain it trader has been there all these days and meaning we can work with the traders to reach out to farmers because yet it closes in that model to a farmer if it do not refuse to work with the middle actors the VA would not work because every farmer sees the donors and NGOs as the next ATM machine meaning they look for free services they are looking for dependence on a subsidized ation if there's no access to finance it will not work and if there's no lack of instrument to import production in practice and behaviors among Aptos the model would not walk so all this was considered we are trying to do this what have you learned there must be a link here buyer you can owe increase production without selling it out will it adjust it to be trained about it's a visa offer the job decrypt must be passive as formal well must be willing to pay for service in cash or in kind at the same time of delivery ICT is key to reduce costs of transaction and there must be a behavior change strategy for all Aptos work together over the years the government of Uganda adopted the model and then it was under idea called international approach to extension policy where you have all essential services both public and private sector come to work together and the government fraternity right now they are providing support to certify these agents they provide allies for their staff to reach out to this agent and also provide the essential material for this agent to walk on the private sector this support is the assertion of workers which depends to enumerate them to organize training I also supported us vh2 decimated knowledge and conduct demonstrations and it is a perfect way where you find - straighten both public and private sector we know the purpose of Mendoza have sufficient money of funds to reach out to farmers but the private sector is with feisty-pants to support a double session water had to trim agents who in turn chain the farmers and it's easy to manage so what is unique about the agent village agent model is market driven service appropriate to farmer because the agents leaves the same trick with the farm inputs genuine inputs because the agent is screwed up to the farm and there's no way he don't sell fake fake inputs compared to stockists wolves in town there's real-time guidance they form a character to refer to the to the agent who would live next door to him is self-sustaining because the agent mixed money with it was working and it creates employment I like to talk about the top takeaways here remember all key for actors should be involved exporter traders agent and fama technology is key as innovations to deliver better services a man should be willing to pay for service in Pinal - the most beautiful incentives around service delivery racial building is fee based on trust and loyalty you need to enhanced against knowledge in relevant fields and answer to finance by all the form a Aptos is team thank you very much wonderful thank you so much Robert will pause here for a few questions for you as we've had some great questions for you come in the first one that I'll ask you is from mark blackish who asks what do you think of the strategy for the Ministry of Ag in Uganda to lead on the village agent model do you think this should be a joint initiative with the Ministry of Trade industry and cooperative thank you Mark yes I believe it should be joint effort between the Ministry of choice you take the lead of trying to promote the village against model in this aspect because this false trade falls under the mission of trade and definitely walk into the district commercial business but the myths about culture can provide ETA to improve the production petabytes remember this model is both production and marketing the brush size is where the missile culture tried to make sure to improve the yields by training the VHD provided right services the McArdle part is where the myth of trade takes object trading compa\u00f1ero bit but overall it was with joint initiative right now we definitely had a joint initiative between the Minister of Trade and industries and the Michelin culture and a miss of local governments these are three key partners what take initiative in this from Jonathan Hobson how do you ensure that the village agent model promotes improved cultural practices I believe thanks Jonathan the assistant of a bridge agent is based on a two-way walking with the with a farmer because input is part of it but remember inputs alone cannot really buddy the yield you want so he was traded from us to adopt better practices and in doing so he's ensure that better yields is there so the training they get from things like donors like a like a car program and also a miserable culture is true for them to train to finance better to use the inputs input is not already and means we have a lot to do with in it most of this agent are also involved in output marketing while they do both ways input and output marketing so they have to make sure that he used is sourced and for them for the farmers to get more yield so they can buy more from the farmers so definitely beyond inputs they have to train from us on how to improve but therefore our practices and the return let me be honest with you they do it because of the motivation of getting more more yields from the farmers by training these people thanks so much over another couple of questions I'll combine a couple from Gordon ones re and from Henry Perry what are some of the risks associated with the village agents for example monopoly in the village biased towards some farming families trust or mistrust and how did the project handle these risk and kind of in a similar vein what is one way to eliminate people's mistrust of agents in this model thank you very much as I said one of the kitchens need to do is you have to have a behavior change strategy in place but the mistress has been a long way you cannot change overnight so during the program we try to create internship between traders and farmers bring them together to understand what are the key problems affecting the relationships we spend over two years doing that after five years and when the pharmacy that he needs the agents more and the agency DePalma then he had people call a lawyer and Trust and we develop some materials that have system to able to understand the biggest problem in mistrust between an agent and a farmer is Chile as it's cheating most from us will say triggers cheats off by tampering with his skills and moisture doesn't say from us cheetahs by adding stones in a bag so we decided to tap out the skills but when you build a very good bigger chain strategy teaching everybody the reason why you are trying to cheat each other is because your production is not efficient and if we here here is going to train you how to produce better in so are we getting eight bags of maize and an acre you can definitely get twenty bucks an acre so why do you decide to cheat by adding those two each and this in turn returns back to the agent it doesn't to tamp out the with the woody scale anymore now how do you reduce monopoly now I'm tell you from us knows what to do there's no issue monopoly a farmer live in a village with different shoes would walk with the there are no good agents and in no bad agents they know where as we assisted them in kind of their need so is the choices made up to the mama and the family decide who to work with in a village you may find about four agents working for different traders or you may find one age for traders at one village agent working for one trader but the pharma is wise enough to decide we want to walk with Miss on a JPL's build a long time ago great thank you so much Robert let me toss out one or two more questions to you before we move on who sustains the cost of the ICTs and data storage in your model the pharmacist changes with the trailer the data collected currently right now from as a pain about $2 $2 to get a land to get the Lance profile the land size the data collect from them it was about $2 and I believe $2 is like a five kilos of maize all right what now often traders pay for this on behalf of the farmer and adopted from the amazement at delivering it so and that data is kept by a company called Orion and other ones in settle and this is high source in itself but in Uganda the actual cost for pulling that data is only two dollars which is sometimes five kilos of maize or two pillars of beans and it should happen wide and PMPA with the pharma and adopt is when if I'm eyes delivering it goes to him great thank you Robert in the interest of time I think we'll move on to our next case study and next presenters but Robert please do take a look at the additional questions that have come in for you in case you can answer some of the chatbox and of course we can also answer some more at the end of the presentation so I'd like to pass the microphone over to Jean Michelle buzzard who has another case study for us so Michelle okay hello Julie thank you can you hear me yes you sound clear okay great well hello everyone from Senegal okay so this is about the Senegal net found by project which actually was closed out last June Senegal natal bag was a feed the future value chain activity that targeted the Nogales three main cereals rice maize and millet it came after a predecessor project called project cotton economy that had successfully tested a bottom-up approach that relied on local farmer organizations for the delivery of extension and value change services so Nathon buys goal was to scale the adoption of technologies and practices that were identified as promising and that network model was expected to be scaled up now not owned by as the project had a very ambitious coverage target the idea was to cover forty percent on average of the household the rural household with its zone of influence which is quite large it also had ambitious technical goals for example achieving widespread Geographic and population coverage making sure that adoption of technologies was lasting across the board and that all of this results in systemic transformation in the delivery of production post harvest and financial services so we were really looking at something transformational however apart from direct technical assistance and facilitation the project was only able to rely on the subcontracting fund with a focus on local service contracts and we did not have any grant facility so wait wait here we go sorry I went through that first insurance slide but the most important one is the next one so strategically to be able to achieve that scaling and and also having in-depth technology adoption we the project established its total footprint during the first year I mean right from the start this gave it for seasonal cycle over which targeted communities could progressively adopt technologies and practices while expanding their membership through what you know is today called scaling in process the project then selected therefore selected a base of 120 pre established producer networks made up mainly of cooperatives but also some very local NGOs and a handful of SME aggregators that relied exclusively on small holder sourcing in a structured way now these networks were contracted on a year-to-year basis to be the ones that deliver productivity training and develop new value change services in an independent way now under these contracts that works typically needed to set up a homegrown extension team composed of a database manager field agent and leaf farmers who acted as village contact points the database managers and the database managers and the field agent roles required advanced literacy and the ability to adopt IT technologies and so were generally recruited locally by the networks amongst the zones young educated youth there are some even in the most remote area but the minimum schooling level was set at tenth grade level and that was sufficient to ensure competent database managers so as we said you know the project picked us on the technological portfolio that was inherited from this year but that eventually evolved the idea here is was to have the network's progressively become trusted market agents at their community level the result that has been partially attained under the method and the predecessor project so this market driven extension went beyond strict economic messaging and sought to strengthen the agency of the farmer based organizations within the value chain so really make them full-fledged market actors several these packages were adapted from national extension technical documents the regulations research material technical recommendations but also inspired by private sector practices and requirements so that output could conform to norm by the end of the project this footprint and the networks had developed his own of influence footprint of 5000 field based agents who provide services to more than 150,000 farmers and generally the ratio for the contact points is 1 to 30 and 150 for one to 50 which is a you know an efficient way of ensuring constant outreach the representation of women within the extension system this private extension system is still far from well hi everyone I have we have also lost to Jean Michel temporarily he's joining us from Senegal and so there may be an issue with his phone if you wouldn't mind hanging tight for just a moment while we tried to get him back that would be excellent gotta roll with the punches on these webinars though the ones been so great so far so we're trying to get him back hello where are we at did you pick up I really lost maybe 30 seconds of yours again I was talking about I was talking about gender disparity did you hear about that I kid that's a good place to pick up okay so the representation of women in the system is not at parity 20% of database managers are women and 23% of field agents and 18% of Lee farmers now by comparison 40% of the total farmer population reached by the project were women so that comes from various factors first well corn millet and irrigated rice are traditionally male-dominated commodities rain-fed rice itself is a women's crop with 64% of women practicing it but the key element was the differing literacy levels amongst genders and that played a role and as did the requirements for mobility between communities which favors men for the field agent roles however the improving rural literacy with young women is gradually changing that profile now now the approach here since we were establishing a footprint for continuity the idea was to provide continuous facilitation and gradually have networks progress in terms of competencies and autonomy so you the initial objective was to have farmers work with their membership to achieve a productivity level that were that produced consistent surpluses gradually progressing to developing sound input financing plans and marketing plan finding intensification solutions in terms of mechanization practices and gradually you know being able to manage a web of various contractual arrangements with banks insurance companies input providers it arise even developing linkages with the National Extension Service to do information exchange now this required learning element so we the project facilitated learning meet you know from year to year various networks with me at the regional and the crop level to exchange best practices and would discuss issues such as seed variety performance we discussed quality standards pricing thresholds climate response strategies and in the end would adopt their internal functioning to take account of the various recommendations that they made themselves now an innovative element of the program was to download completely the data processing work at the farmer level using very basic data services off-the-shelf or open source and having the farmers manage it themselves so that really had a big impact in building trust and and building competency it turned the farmer led intention into it that's a driven process people were talking in numbers it's establishing sowing thresholds in terms of duration at a certain number of millimeters you know and assessing yields with high precision and even doing crosshair comparisons I mean I've been told that so one assisted a crop meeting and said that he was surprised to have farmers regular farmers talking about their three-year yield profile and saying how they were progressing now the data getting data processing services at the farmer level was also a stage program it was like a learning activity that had networks start with a profiling phase like learning how to profile their membership so working with static databases but that were descriptive and enabled them to really monitor who was who and who had what in terms of product and capacity then fall it was followed by a more analytical learning phase where the focus was put on how to mine those statistics and assess their own performance and finally the more advanced team's graduated to real-time data to support more transactional and tracking activities such as like loan and insurance application input procurement and distribution real-time local weather data collection and just managing overall crop aggregation now these these system did not work in vacuum or let's say in just within the network I mean throughout the program these farmers use this data to enter interact with their partners interact with government authorities interact you know with the environment at large and the the effect has been to build a climate of trust and really an evidence-based climate of discussion both with trading partners farmers and the government and that was a very critical element in terms of reinforcement okay NLM is and I'll be quick on that one because that's a subject in itself but I just want to mention that the level of reinforcement attained by these farmer organizations really made them like independent agents in negotiating with the outside world and so we call that you know a shift from a classic vertical structure you have the central organizing firm or entity that groups all that and does a lot of work on the farmers behalf to a system where the farmers are empowered to transact with a variety of banks of clients of service providers inputs of providers and and are able to get the best possible price and so that actually was very conducive in building value and was an essentially a very data-driven process just to say that you know these farmer organizations on their own like managed successfully more than hundred fifty million dollars in short-term loans thirty-four thousand of them managed to access agricultural insurance it simulated the emergence of the mechanized service providers in terms of land preparation and harvesting etcetera etcetera that the the indicators are interesting and but what's more interesting is the agency that the networks had in developing those linkages and those activities they're now the project closed out last June okay so that's pretty much a hard stuff I mean Senegal still eventually will be getting feed the future support but this season the farmers have been left fending for themselves so what happened did everything go crashing now you see on the slide in that the ia president of pepper Maxwell I met with her along with a few networks across the country went to visit just to see what was going on I mean for for the current grain team are they by they carrying on and what's interesting is that the majority of them I mean all the ones I visited I know that a few smaller organizations don't yet have the their full autonomy but most of them have been able to maintain and grow their service levels of farmers they maintain low those who were working with loan applications managing insurance all these elements were maintaining their activity and some even had begun diversifying their portfolio of activities by monitoring horticulture and livestock activities each group we surveyed had developed its own cost recovery approach through a mix of rationalization of the extension team adaptation of the databases to simplify them introduction or increase in membership dues and developing service charges or specific services such as real-time rainfall tracking and GPS field surveying some of them had deals with the insurance company to have Commission on the management of the insuring process and you know selling insurance and also they some of them negotiated deals with input supplier and allocated a portion of the volume rebates to the actual extension work in some cases brokerage fees were allowed and margins on sale or you know volumes allocated to loan reimbursements were allocated to the funding system and in some cases agreements with buyers actually to fund the part of the Extension Service were negotiated but there's you know this clear a Latina that was interesting and that was permitted by the agency that the network's had and the knowledge level they had to develop something that fit their own circumstances and I well I'm pretty encouraged by that I'm pretty happy with that they're doing well now where are they gonna go so what's the future challenges well the network's okay they demonstrated a capacity to play a very positive role in the delivery of extension and more than that value to farmers I mean that is what keeps them in business the fact that they're getting value value in terms of productivity value in terms of market access but also value in terms of risk reduction which is one of the critical value points for the very small rain-fed challenge farmers that are challenged every year by a whole series of risks there's an expressed need by them to further develop the model to adapt to new crops and new services that would effectively leverage the power of digital technology so there's a demand for new technologies adaptive technologies that accelerate the system what we're seeing is that the inclusion of women farmers as fully empowered agents remains a challenge because of the size of the farm but there are solutions that are there but they they really need to be to be expanded and diversified but they they do have a market justification all networks see the inclusion of their communities use as an opportunity especially as far as the you know downstream organization of the activities such as like data collection and the various tracking and management activities where youth really excel however networks it should be said that net these networks cannot replace the foundational need for public good knowledge and services that's provided by agronomic research for the regulation of the perceived quality and inputs or the production of meteo data or and forecast these networks cannot either self-financed roads or improvements in rural IT nor can they yet fully finance large-scale storage infrastructure so government has to interact with these groups and and actually they've begun doing that in Senegal that's what's interesting I mean they there are clear platforms that have been developed between these farmer organizations and the various decentralized governance services and that's very promising USAID is also using these networks to to do as far as their nutrition program which gives them a more resilience role just by their skills and permanence in terms of organizing local capacity so finally what I want to say is that the level of self-organization these neat networks have it she can be leveraged by government to maximize the impact of public investment and they can become effective relays of extension messaging but beyond that they are fully empowered value chain actors and have to a role to play in that domain from now on so okay I'm looking forward to your questions and thank you for your attention great thank you so much Joe Michel let's see we have had a couple of questions come in for you and then we'll open it up to some further questions for all three of our presenters and we have about 15 minutes left for questions so Zoe so mark blackett asked is the farmer owned database system available for others to use an ongoing our new projects to help prevent reinventing the wheel in this case yes well what I want to say is that there is no software that for that market farmer owned database system it's actually a hack a hack of the various Excel Dropbox and other software's the more advanced will work with the open source con care platform which was engineered into an agricultural extension activity system and that also is available on open source on the web it's more skilled here that that's required it's not the the software itself various applications have been developed and plug into these systems but they they are independent and freestanding as we speak so they are available there will be documentation on what they represent they that will be available but the the approaches are a really open source and based on making sure that you have people who can manage the data at the local level and this is where having farmers that are able to handle Excel having you know locally based people that can even do pivottables and doing pretty sophisticated analysis really makes it a very very resilient system one of the most popular apps now that was a byproduct of the digital expansion we did is actually what's up you know and there's a I think there's a lot of work to be done in how to hack together interesting application using either social media or generic software great thank you an interesting question just came in from Sara Huber how are these farmer organizations in your example so high-functioning were they selected carefully or was there some sort of significant training provided and also a separate question how were the bank loans facilitated and what did they cover yeah so that that's the question is always that's where some people often talk about a senegalese exception in terms of organizational development I want to say that an organization like diplomats for example where you know we had Nina there talking about her thing is actually made of you know 12 highly dysfunctional small farmer groups but that at one point decided to join forces and asked us to be empowered and manage their own thing really you know it's not like we invented that it was a reaction to a very dysfunctional top-down extension system where the lead firm was actually taking advantage of his father his position and the farmers told us rather than dropping the program what if we got together and provided our own extension so the key word is motivation you know and then testing them you want to have a basic legal structure you want to have had a certain level of self-organization but then you want to give them a motive their initial motive will be productivity their initial then it follows on as they see that the risk is reduced they they'll want to find markets they'll want to find financing and this is where you know you have different middle facilitation components that come in but you really want to select the farmer organization that have a will to succeed and we did capitalize on the initial group of 10 or 20 farmer organization but where locally it generated a series of application and n-by-n and and then the idea here is to provide continuity and really build them up over a period of time but not in theoretical capacity building but capacity building that is oriented towards very clear value proposition by farmers and that really really creates a momentum for the bank loans well the bank loan essentially for the farmer organizations cover inputs okay there has been other series of bank loan we facilitated for their clients what's interesting with the bank loan is to to develop the the to make it happen was to develop how can I say collateral strategies and risk management strategy and so this is where inventory collateral system not necessarily warehouse receipts but collateral systems that are oriented towards quick trading you know warehouse receipt is about waiting collateral loans are more about securing the reimbursement by stocks that are then transferred on to a buyer and there you have interlocking credit mechanisms so that that has been documented on the project there will be further documentation on how we did that but this system that secures the product by quality products really is a very powerful way of growing of growing loans of growing finance in a secure way AG insurance is also very important I mean the especially for rain-fed zones having that protects the farmer in the bank as to the loan reimbursement against the climate event was also a very very powerful tool to boost volumes in those areas and that's actually very popular with women's organizations to protect the meager amount that they will put to adopt input these kinds of index insurance based on rainfall have gone a long way with them it's actually very popular thanks so much Don Michele we have about ten minutes left for questions but before we ask a few more I wanted to open up our ending polls for all of you to answer we'd appreciate if you would just take a moment to chime in on these polls and to let us know how we can continue to improve our Agri links webinars going forward and as a reminder for any of you who do need to leave early we will be sending you the recording the transcript and some additional resources from this presentation by email and encourage you to share it with your colleagues if you think that they would be interested as well right let's see me show we had a question from Stafford Francis mom bola about sustainability what are the incentives for the network leaders to continue to maintain their networks after closeout are they paid or and if so who pays them well the the farmer what's interesting with this is that the leaders are all farmers themselves you know so they have an interest in developing this pooling and this grouping so you know they're not huge farmers but there'll be farmers who who have graduated to from let's say two hectares to let's say 15 hectares some of them will you know own a tractor and they they're actually you know very community-based people and so for them you know the the organization it's not just a simple business venture it does have a social aspect to it okay and the the leadership it's not just one person's usually a group of people and who together you know manage this so they make their money in there with their product some of them are let's say certified seed producers so the group also provides them with a ready market and you know they will get involved in sales and all that also but you know it's it's really a very grassroots vision on things and and then they these organization then negotiate with the outside world but you know in terms of needs you know they they have income expectations that are very reasonable for people who are present in those communities and in those environments and that's what makes it so powerful it's the same thing for the field agents people who know I t understand IT but are used to living in those conditions who do not want to migrate back to city thank you Joe Michel and I think on top of just one final quick question to you from Judy Payne wondering if you capitalized on enabling farmers being able to compare their own data which of course would open up some questions why is that other farmer more productive than me comparing numbers could be an interesting way of promoting learning and she was wondering if she did any of that yes that was the big thing that was it you know when you when the data is shared amongst the farmers within the community not in the project and then a guy's wife sees on the on a flip chart that she's actually making more than her husband in terms of maize production well that raises interesting discussions and when you see that the neighboring Network have higher yields that creates also interesting discussions so that's why you know this stage discussion based on data was so important and really starting at community level and we found that farmers actually can understand histograms you know I mean they they understand distribution curves and things like that they really do after a while and they start talking into very precise terms and so that's what's so powerful with it is that the data processing look is very short and the the information remains within the community but gradually also can is consolidated and transmitted to the government extension system also and who actually prizes that data because it's so it's actually very accurate wonderful thank you we have still about five minutes to squeeze in some questions I wish that we were we could keep going forever or that we were all at networking in person because it's been so great to see the engagement that's been going on in the chat box some people challenging each other's comments asking each other questions it's really wonderful so thank you to our audience you are the most important part of any Agri links webinar and we really appreciate your engagement before we officially wrap up I think our last question or two that came in closer to the beginning of our presentation that I think you know still proves relevant so a question from Ilan Gilbert perhaps first director you Kristen in some countries development projects seriously blur the lines between public and private extension with HR moving back and forth which complicates the institutional strengthening and sustainability across the board hi yes thanks for that question I was just about to write the answer and I was hoping you were still on but yes we we have seen this as a big problem in many countries where you know there's this so-called poaching or so-called brain drain often people moving from the public sector to work for NGOs or projects or the private sector and so forth and I guess I would say two major lessons here one is the need to strengthen both simultaneously so we talked a lot about strengthening public and private sector the producer organizations the input suppliers the public people and so forth secondly this is an issue of incentives and it goes back to the overall professionalization of extension and advisory services and I think that's something many public services in particular need to pay attention to and we have some examples from Uganda and South Africa on that related to regulation certification and all these things but incentives are so poor for rural extension agents who work for for government or you know district or federal systems or whatever this this needs to be looked at and improved great Thank You Kristen um and let's see ha ha so we've had so many great questions and we've been I think answering as many of them as we could and we will certainly be sharing the chatbox transcripts with the presenters after the fact in case there's any opportunity to include a few more questions in our post-event resources and I also have a few more that I will copy and paste some written answers as soon as we wrap up perhaps maybe the last question I know that Joe Michele that you touched on gender integrate integration but it's always a question that comes up with Julie every other links webinar people are wanting more information about how to integrate gender concerns into programming and Lea on the kinga at the beginning asked how do extension advisory services ensure gender integration into their program and there was someone who wanted to just elaborate more on what you said so perhaps you could touch on a couple of important gender issues before we wrap up yes okay one thing I want to say that was interesting is we check the age of the death dates and the field agents who work with data and what's interesting is that men were 30 years old on average and women were actually younger they were 28 and also what we saw is that even though in Cosimo's witness literacy was very low when you look at the younger generation there's like a literacy surge for the you know the 10 to 18 year old who eventually become candidates for being future field agents and and hold these kind of of management capacity so what I want to say is that even if in I mean in the poor countries that the case and so I really encourage projects to be poised for that for that little that way of literate and trained women like I said you know 10th grade is accessible I mean for pretty sophisticated data processing you can for field agent level it can be less than that and you really want to integrate them in there one of the elements are saying is that for Williams organization women have generally smaller plot sizes and are concentrated in various pools of areas and and that requires having a strategy that adapted to that so so that because they have less mobility so you can have more you know responsible field agents per basin and rather than having a multi Basin approach so that's also another another element but I also want to say that the the strongest network leaders are generally women it's in the top management posts that's been our experience and that's why you really want to promote that that integration and all that I think another domain that can be very strong in bringing women into those extension system is that those networks want to co-op young people and and very often like women's group will co-op young women I mean you want to make sure that that happens what's important is is really to promote that integration throughout the program and that's where projects have a role to play but once they've been in the system for a few for a few cycles the women then develop entrepreneurial programs and a bit like what Robert was describing you know some of them migrate and and can become village agents connected with banks with insurance companies with input distributors a bit like that I mean the networks are are kind of but they're also a ready market for those entrepreneurial businesses for youth and women are very good in that I just want to say that the young woman you saw in the slide I presented is now as graduated from being a database manager for a write company and is now created her own company as a write aggregator she she actually owns a car now wonderful thank you John Michelle all right we are 2 minutes past the hour so we're going to go ahead and officially wrap up this webinar I would like to extend a sincere thank you to our presenters to our participants and to the Agri links team who always supports these webinars with enthusiasm and excellent support so thank you all for attending and keep your eye on the other links newsletter for announcements for upcoming webinars thank you all and have a great rest of your day",
