00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,920
bye

2
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,279
sweet corn is an important vegetable

3
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,599
crop in the northeast

4
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,359
freshly picked locally grown sweet corn

5
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,800
is popular among consumers

6
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,960
who like to be able to buy it at

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,000
roadside stands farmers markets

8
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,200
and supermarkets to grow a marketable

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,280
crop of sweet corn

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,559
farmers must provide adequate soil

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,320
fertility

12
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:48,239
control insect pests and manage weeds

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,160
in this video farmers describe

14
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,840
production practices that they use to

15
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,680
grow a good crop of corn without

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,960
excessive use of fertilizers

17
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,199
insecticides or herbicides

18
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,640
these ecological production practices

19
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,199
can help enhance profits

20
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,960
while protecting natural resources

21
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,640
farmers can decide for themselves which

22
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:13,840
of these practices makes sense

23
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:13,840
for their operation

24
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,600
i'm alex mclennan and i farm in the

25
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,880
connecticut river valley in windsor

26
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,799
vermont

27
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:42,000
on sandy silt loam soils i grow about

28
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:45,040
50 acres of vegetables

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,799
that's about 20 acres in sweet corn

30
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:55,840
20 acres in pumpkins and about 10 acres

31
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:55,840
of green beans

32
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,119
i started using hairy vetch oh i'd say

33
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,200
about four or five years ago now

34
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,040
basically i was looking for something i

35
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,280
don't have animals i don't have

36
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,200
manure so i've been trying to find cover

37
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,520
crops that that fit in well with a

38
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,440
fairly intensive vegetable production so

39
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,440
that we don't wear out the soil

40
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,720
i like the veg for a source of nitrogen

41
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,560
because i'm looking for something with a

42
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,160
bit of a time release to it

43
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,400
as opposed to just throwing on urea and

44
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,680
having it having it

45
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,800
go into solution too quickly

46
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,640
i also use the vetch specifically

47
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,200
because i don't take land out of

48
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,519
production for an entire growing season

49
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,720
so i'm trying to have a cover crop on

50
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,720
the land

51
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,200
basically all the time that there's not

52
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,480
a there's not a cash crop on there

53
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,360
i seed vetch from 15 to 30 pounds to the

54
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,080
acre

55
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,720
the 30 pound rate gives a real nice

56
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,160
stand

57
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,400
but some years of etch seed is very

58
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,480
expensive and sometimes i just economize

59
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,760
by cutting back to a rate as low as 15

60
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,159
pounds i still get a reasonably good

61
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,319
stand with 15 pounds to the acre

62
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,800
that is seeded at the same time as the

63
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,159
oats which is usually at about a bushel

64
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,599
to the acre

65
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,879
and that seems to work out well for

66
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:12,159
giving me a fall cover

67
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,720
we inoculate the vetch seed

68
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,280
to make sure that we get good nodulation

69
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,200
because

70
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,959
the whole purpose really of the of the

71
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,599
hairy vetch cover crop is to get

72
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,640
nitrogen

73
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,680
fixation we turn the vetch under in

74
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,920
preparation for

75
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,680
for planting usually around the second

76
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,640
to third week of may i like to i like to

77
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,360
hold off as long as i possibly can

78
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,560
and get as much nitrogen out of the veg

79
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,799
as i can before i

80
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,760
plow it under hairy vetch has never been

81
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,200
a problem in

82
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,840
in in volunteer production or

83
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,440
or weed production we never had any

84
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,000
problem turning it under and killing it

85
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,920
very easily

86
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,879
without any chemical use so the vetch

87
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,159
gives me additional biomass a little bit

88
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,280
better soil structure

89
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,920
additional nitrogen and erosion

90
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,159
protection

91
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,080
for the winter and early spring the

92
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,519
major drawback to using vetch has been

93
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,040
the cost of the seed

94
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,360
but as long as it stays under two

95
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,879
dollars a pound i intend to continue to

96
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,040
use it and i think it's done a great job

97
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,040
in my soils
