  "text": "[Music] you are at fickle Creek Farm in effland North Carolina which is in Orange County right in the center of the pedmont region of North Carolina and we describe pickle Creek Farm as a small scale Diversified sustainable farm this farm right here is 61 Acres that's kind of the the size of it the sustainability part comes in with our practices we are trying to produce food at the same time that we protect the environment and bring in minimal inputs from the outside and that's always a challenge the produce we we grow is completely by organic standards and practices however we've chosen to not get certified because sometimes the what I call technically organic but not sustainable option just doesn't make sense we've decided to use locally milled feed for example the reason for that is to get the certified organic feed that we had available at the time it came from a much longer distance we sell retail direct we do very little wholesale so it's not like our product is on a shelf somewhere and the only thing the consumer has to go by is the the stamp on it that says certified organic we're very lucky in that we have a customer base that really supports us they come out to the markets and rain or shine um they appreciate what we're doing and how we're doing it but that helps financially of course but that also gets us into kind of communally sustainable the farmer and the Farm Workers have to make a living along the way too so it has to be sustainable for the farmer first this Farm is what I would call a Agro forestry system a definition for Agro forestry the inclusion of a Woody perennial component in a farming system meant to produce livestock and or produce so our trees just like our livestock we look at in two ways they have service benefits and they have product benefits so examples that we get from the trees are shade um improved as Aesthetics erosion control the trees are doing doing a lot of things that aren't necessarily monetary income but they they are important services to be sustainable and to be an enjoyable place to to farm we heat our home with firewood and so firewood is an actual product so there are products as well from the trees by having not only our crops and our pastures but then completely natural forested areas are biodiversity is much much higher than most agricultural systems the livestock that we have brought to the farm and that we have now all got here because we were trying to to meet a need of the farm sustainability chickens for example we started with laying hands and yes we want needed the income but we also needed the fertilizer that they were producing and so not only did they produce the fertilizer but they spread it and Incorporated it for us the chickens are really good for insect control as well so we'll and weed seed control all of those are again our services first then I think we got pigs next their service at at the very outset was to eradicate noxious weeds that we couldn't get rid of any other way because of course we don't use herbicides and then we found out just serendipitously that they're also great for ra amazing Rock from pastures and they bring them to the surface and then we can just go out and collect them much more readily they are great for understory clearing so we'll take a managed small wood lot area and we'll put pigs in it and they'll clear it the understory for us so then we can get in to do the thinning that we want to do now what we do as part of our standard procedure is to clear a a paddock that has um produce in it with sheep so they eat all the vegetation the remnants of of a crop then we bring in chickens typically and they eat down even further and they eat weed seeds and scratch and then um finally we bring in the Ducks and they just go right down the rows just like kind of shoveling along with their their beaks and the Slugs are gone so and and of course again they produce um eggs so they're paying for themselves we're at the very top of K Creek Watershed which is the water for Carbone Chapel Hill this Farm is a farm conservation eent and that means we sold our development rights um so there will never be development on this property beyond what is here now you've probably heard many times farming is really hard work and it is I do feel like we're just one of many farms in this area that are farming along these lines and and we do make a significant impact",
