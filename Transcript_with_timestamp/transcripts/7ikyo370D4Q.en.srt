1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,480
have you ever wondered when the absolute

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,399
best time to start your seeds are no

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,880
matter what gardening zone you live in I

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:11,080
had the exact same question it came from

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,360
my second year of gardening when I

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,920
planted most of my vegetables at the

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,279
wrong times because I didn't know this

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,240
gave me almost no Harvest I was

9
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:23,560
discouraged but I knew there had to be a

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,880
better way last December I spent 30 days

11
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,880
and going through over 60 websites

12
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:30,039
trying to design the best Garden

13
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:32,360
planning schedule that work for anyone

14
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:34,360
one no matter where you lived in this

15
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,559
video I'm going to show you the Zone 8

16
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:39,079
garden planting schedule in four easy

17
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,800
steps and how to use it as a secret

18
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:43,200
weapon that will evolve your gardening

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,559
skills before we get started if you are

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,199
interested in picking one of these

21
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,600
secret weapons up then check out the

22
00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:51,000
pinned Link in the description so far I

23
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,800
have made them for zones 3 to 9 if you

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,960
live in one of those zones you're in

25
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,519
luck goal number one 35 of the world's

26
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,359
most popular for the first two years of

27
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:02,440
gardening I would actually go to the

28
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,640
nurseries to find out what I could plant

29
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,280
in my zone 4 if I saw something they

30
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,400
were selling then I knew I could plant

31
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,320
it in my garden but they didn't always

32
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,360
have everything in stock over the years

33
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,320
I kept the list and on the left of the

34
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,759
garden planting schedule I put 35 of the

35
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:20,079
world's most popular vegetables in

36
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,040
alphabetical order so anyone could find

37
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:24,680
what they looking for faster plus it

38
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,920
looks cooler goal number two seeing the

39
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,759
whole year I always felt overwhelmed and

40
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,119
found that the gardening season crept up

41
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:32,680
on me too fast never felt as prepared as

42
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,119
I should have been so I wanted to see

43
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,640
the whole year of gardening on this

44
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:37,079
planting schedule then you would at

45
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,360
least see how many months you have to

46
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:41,439
prepare for your next gardening season I

47
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,119
put in all 12 months on this calendar

48
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,000
and the white spots are the areas where

49
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,479
you can't grow anything most of the time

50
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,040
that'll be your winter and the weather

51
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,920
won't be right and you'll be able to

52
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,680
visualize how many months you have to

53
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,360
prepare for the next gardening season

54
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,240
goal number three protecting some plants

55
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,799
when it comes to cool season or warm

56
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,799
season crops they do vary with kale

57
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,840
it'll taste better with a a little Frost

58
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,079
but for tomatoes plants die right away

59
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,920
in Canada we have a long period of snow

60
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:09,759
and the weather can change quickly I

61
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,800
went through different forums websites

62
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,360
and took the average last than the first

63
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,560
expected Frost AES for each Zone just to

64
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,480
warn you it is an average even a few

65
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,239
miles away from where you live now could

66
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,879
have different weather so use these

67
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,840
Frost dates as a reference when it gets

68
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,040
closer to those Frost dates check your

69
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,160
local weather daily at the top I wrote

70
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,920
both Frost dates and made both different

71
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,560
colors putting them in the 12-month

72
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,680
planting schedule running them all the

73
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,000
way down so you can see it with each

74
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,640
vegetable goal number four when should

75
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,519
everything happen timing is everything

76
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,360
in your garden it just so happens if you

77
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:44,319
want to get a few Harvest out of certain

78
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,000
vegetables or to just get the most out

79
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,720
of your garden you have to plant things

80
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,959
at the proper times it's a pretty easy

81
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,400
thing to fix let me help you I added red

82
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:53,280
for when you should start your seeds

83
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,599
indoors yellow for when you should

84
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,680
transplant outdoors and green for direct

85
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,400
sewing and harvesting on the 12-month

86
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,280
calendar you will start sum your seeds

87
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,400
indoors

88
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,720
for example Tomatoes get started at the

89
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,640
beginning of February or within the red

90
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,560
then transplanted Outdoors at the

91
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,560
beginning of April after there is no

92
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,640
chance of frost and green you can start

93
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,440
harvesting your Tomatoes some vegetables

94
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,879
such as spinach can be direct sewed

95
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,200
before the last frost date with the

96
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:20,200
green but bell peppers with a red will

97
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,040
start indoors to get a head start and

98
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,159
Transplant it out in the yellow and then

99
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,000
any vegetables that has two sets of red

100
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,519
yellow and green means you can start

101
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,200
them indoors transplant them and harvest

102
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:32,599
them twice in a growing season

103
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,959
I also found rooted crops were really

104
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:36,439
hard to tell when they're ready to

105
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,480
harvest most of the final growth comes

106
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:40,680
quickly and underground I've let some

107
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,439
beets grow for too long and the flavor

108
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,720
and how hard they are changes quite a

109
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:45,720
bit you want to harvest most of your

110
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,640
vegetables at the proper time on the

111
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,040
right I took the average harvesting days

112
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,560
across many Seed Company websites and

113
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,480
Seed packages so you'll know around what

114
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,159
time you should Harvest so here it is

115
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,959
the final copy after a 50-day design the

116
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:00,680
idea behind the Zone garden planting

117
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,920
schedule was was that I wanted to find

118
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,760
out what I can plant in my zone and when

119
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:08,239
I can plant everything I designed it to

120
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:10,200
be a 24 in x 36 in poster size so you

121
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,120
can frame it and use it as a reference

122
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,120
anytime you want or even put it on your

123
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,479
wall in your grow room now that you know

124
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,600
