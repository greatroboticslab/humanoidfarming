  "text": "[Music] [Music] so [Music] okay today we'll start with a new topic the topic on strength irrigation system and during the discussion when we had discussed the various methods of irrigation we had discussed in brief what do we mean by what we understand by the sprinkle irrigation system but we have not gone beyond that we had not looked into one of the various types of sprinkler irrigation systems today we'll start first with what are the various types of sprinkler irrigation system which are there are many many different uh modes of sprinkler irrigation method which is being used all over the world but there are some some method which have become more popular so we'll try to look at those methods first what are the various types of sprinkler systems out of the various types existing which are very common there are some systems conventional systems which are moved with the manual labor let me first put all those which we are going to have a look at hand move solid set side roll then center pivot then you have that gun these variations they have come about with respect to the requirements in terms of in some cases with respect to the requirements of labor in some cases you will find that the labor requirement is very low so let's have a look at these different types one by one the hand move is the one which we had discussed during last the period when we were discussing the various methods of irrigation where we had said that there is a i mean line and that my line will have different literals if we say that this is the main line now these littles are moved from one position on the lateral to another position using the manual labor you might again the this hand move system you can also call this as a portable portable system the level of portability again can vary in some cases it can be it can be completely portable in terms of you might be replacing the main line also and moving it from one plate and one place to another the next place but that normally happens when you have availability of water along a channel whereas in some other cases it might be called semi semi portable right now what we are referring to is a semi portable system where you are only removing the laterals the main line remains fixed you might move the laterals from one position to another position so that the level of portability can be varying from situation to situation there is no such rule the extent of portability can vary so the other the other extreme can be the solid set and this in the case of the solid set system we might be keeping everything fixed the laterals as well as the main lines they might be remaining fixed if not permanently at least for the duration of the crop so if you keep the the little uh fixed for the duration of the crop which in in turn what it will mean it will mean that you will have to have those number of lectures which you are going to use in any position so the number of literals requirement will be very high in that situation where you are not willing to remove the laters you might not be running all the literals at the same time you might be running only one segment at a time because these things are again will come to those details when we'll discuss that how many liters you can run at a particular time because all these things are dependent on what is the source of water supply was the quantity of water which is available and the relevant pressure so in other words what is the pump which you are using on the side of the pump and that will decide how much how many liters can be used in one set or atom at a particular time that in turn also is dependent on what is the pressure requirement in each each later because that is what is going to decide the distribution pattern of the directed area or that sprinkler head so in the case of solid set system you will keep the literals permanently fixed if your labor is very expensive you might decide to do that but that will be at the cost of more investment in terms of having more number of lectures then the the side drawn system in the case of side growth system this is to avoid the use of labor if the labor is very expensive you might want to have a trade-off between the situation that in one case in one extreme you have the solid charge system where you need number of liters which have to be bought and fixed permanently in position or at least for the the time for the duration of the crop the other extreme is that every time you remove the electrode from its position on the main line and then move the little to the the next position after physically dismantling it which requires a very regular labor so to avoid that avoid that situation and still reduce the number of liters a system was a wall where you can have a little mounted on some aluminium wheels and that you can roll for example you might be having a little might have this little and this little is mounted on [Applause] some reasons so through this mounting now you can roll the whole thing and this itself is a literal that means there might be there will be a nozzle a sprinkler nozzle mounted on this now you might feel that in in some cases if the sprinkler is the nozzle is mounted on this since the whole thing is rolling it might change the direction of the sprinkler head so to avoid that there was a there's a mechanism by which you can avoid that by having a some mechanism by which you have a counterweight which is put so that to keep the sprinkler head always and there's that there's a weight which is put which is uh quite heavy so because of that weight the position of the leaf the the sprinkler head will always be in the same position in which you want it that means the inner position the vertical position so those things are taken care of by having a specialized those sprinkler heads which can be mounted on these neutrals but the advantage of this is that once you have done the irrigation or once you have applied the water by keeping this in one position you can roll it to the next and that rolling also can be done to a motor it can be some equipment which can have some driving force so that driving can also be the equipment can also be having that mechanism which can give you the driving force also or you can you can move it manually it depends on what is the size of the whole the whole set that is what we call the side roll system which is quite uh reasonably useful in some situations but is used only in those situations where you cannot afford to employ the labor whereas in our country our conditions in our country the labor is not that big a problem so you might not need such a system then the central pivot center pivot system is another system which requires very less amount of labor first of all what the system was the philosophy of this system and this particular system the source of water is at a central point and then from this source you are having a pivot arm one pivot arm which is quite a long arm on which you mount the later so this pivot can be i can show you a figure of what this pivot arm can be is this clear this figure now this is the pivot term this pivot arm is having at different locations these sprinkler nozzles are attached at different locations all along the pivotal and this pivot arm if you can notice here this is mounted on these wheels so the whole arm can move in one direction it can move about this pivot point which is the central point which is the source this can move in the in the circular direction that means if you look at the total and this since is mounted on a different job the mountings are available and this there's a mounted all along on these tripods which are in turn which are mounted on the wheels you can give it a rotation that means overall as this moves in this direction as this moves in this direction each individual you will be having at each location uh the location of this sprinkler head either it can be up here or it can be down there that varies so in either case as you have seen in the figure you have these sprinkler heads somewhere mounted here at these locations in either direction so when you are operating these each one is is wetting area which has its own area of influence so at a at a particular time you are wetting up a strip and as it moves in this circular direction at each individual time you will find that ultimately you are wetting a circular area which which is being wetted by the single neutral now this pivot is it can be very depends how big the pipe you are you have installed or the pressures under which is operating but is a real big area the extent can be in hundreds of meters so ultimately you will find that you have through a central pivot system the source was at the central point this source can either be in the form of a valve or it can be in the form of a buried main line which has been tapped here and you will be you will be getting an area covered which is a circular area the disadvantage of this central pivot system that you are you are wasting lot of area which is the cognition if i if i have cover this area with the central pivot system which is the extent of the pivot so ultimately i have covered this area and normally whenever you go in for the the agricultural operations you won't have the circular radius covered this is a very big area so it will be covering many many fields all along but still it'll be much more advantageous if you can if you can have some way of covering these corner portions which are not being covered in this in this system so you are wasting this area is not getting any water to avoid this problem the centripetal pivot system the movement of the central pivot system is varied and is called a linear move system with the same as central pivot but instead of getting rotated you are you are moving this pivot along some channel or some supply source which is a linear supply source only then it can it can be taken care of so and under those conditions where you can have a linear movement of this pivot you can avoid getting this these corner areas solved you can you can you can you can solve these areas you can avoid the situation where where you are having these corner areas are not served by the application of irrigation water so that is what is is only the operation of the pivot system or of the similar pivot which can be moved in a linear manner and you can you can take care of rectangular areas which are more useful than the circular areas then the big gun now this system is having a philosophy that you are having a big nozzle which is operating under much higher pressures so what you are doing is that instead of using many number of sprinkler heads you are using a sink single nozzle which is having a very distance very very large distance coverage and through the use of that single nozzle you are irrigating the areas the only disadvantage is that the pressures which are required they are very very high pressures and the distribution is also not very uniform in the case of big gun system but in some situations the big gun system can be useful where you're not very much bothered about the uniformity the type of crops are not very sensitive crops and you have the prevailing pressures which are required now having discussed the different types of irrigation systems under the sprinkler irrigation system which are available we will go on to the other related aspects of the system but most of the times we will be discussing the the conventional sprinkler irrigation systems where we have a main line and the laterals either flexible or the the neutrals which are having portability all the other fixed neutrals that that is only the method of application basically it doesn't make any difference as far as the design is concerned in the case of design you have to decide on what are the pressures what are the sizes what are the spacings those things will come but we are not going to cover the designs of big gun or of the central pivot systems they are beyond the scope of our coverage here we are just in many cases the designs are not much different or similar because the the basis behind those designs is the same it's not very much different only thing is that you will have to take in into consideration their overlaps how those overlaps have to be considered what will be the difference in the overlap when you have a pivot system or when you have a linear system or the conventional system so let's go on to the system components what are the basic system components which have to be to be taken care of the first thing is that in all these systems this is true for all the system which we have just mentioned that you need pressurized water source that is a must the extent of this pressures might be different from one system to another system this for example the the system which we have just mentioned for example in the case of big gun the prevailing pressures might vary between 830 kilopascal to 1035 kilopascal and the impact sprinklers now these impact sprinklers are the the conventional systems where we have the sprinkler heads mounted on the the littles and the littles are getting watched from the main line and those systems the pressures will vary between these limits and the pivot systems are the system which comparatively lower pressures so these are the pressure ranges now you can see here that the pressure requirement of the big gun is almost four times that of the impact sprinkler which is conventionally used for the the areas which are the reasonably the reasonable areas which you normally handle whereas in the case of pivot system the areas which you handle they're very large areas and that is possible only in the case of cooperative farming or where you have very big farms which are under the same uh farmers or under you might have a cooperative so only in those situations you will find that the pivot systems are of much use and you have for many many hectares you have the same crop but as in our conventional systems as we know that in most of our projects the availability of the crops is very high you might have very small size fields which are having the same crop and for each individual field you will have to have the spectral system if you are using one and the impact impact sprinklers will be the one which will be quite useful in other situations and besides the pressurized water source you will need a mini line a main line is mill line is the connection between the the pressurized source of water and the point of delivery this main line might not be required for some systems for example when we have discussed the the pivot system in that case the main line is not required directly you are having the connection between the source and the later the main line is not available in those systems but in most of the systems you will find that the main line is a very important component of the system then besides the main line you have electric line the lecture line is the line which comes after comes off of the the main line and it delivers the water too to the individual sprinkler taking a conventional system let's say that this is the source this is the main line out of the main line you will draw the the little from the main line so this is the later and on the later these are the positions of the sprinkler heads so these are the sprinkler nozzles then the other system components which are related are that you would like to know what is the lateral spacing and at what spacing you have to provide these sprinkle nozzles on a particular lecture now if we call this as sl and what is the spacing between the two lateral positions on the middle line so this is known as main line spacing and normally designated by sm then besides this we'll also be interested in what is the vector diameter so if you look at the the area of influence of this individual sprinkler nozzle and this is this is the wetted area individual spray pattern and this area this nozzle is the paper spray pattern of this nozzle that is designated by a parameter which is known as wetted diameter and designated by dw these are the main quantities or some of the main items which will be referring to quite often these are the the design parameters you can see which will be very important from the consideration of our the objectives of the design and is very essential to to know these parameters what these parameters mean so let us now look at what are our design objectives by now we know that the generic design objectives which we have which are true for all the irrigation methods irrespective of which method you use and these the design objectives are that we have to take care of the water requirements we have to avoid the losses so as to keep those losses as the minimum ones they are the same they are not going to vary much from one method to another method but let's have a relook into those design objectives the the required depth of application this required depth of application has to be satisfied as a prime design objective because you want the crop to grow well without without stresses which it cannot sustain those stresses we have to avoid that those stresses should be allowed to develop in the crop so for that purpose we have to ensure that the required depth of application has to be provided to the soil at the time whenever it is needed and this we know that this required depth of application is dependent on many factors is dependent on the peak period evapotranspiration rate which is a function of the climate so you have to it will be a function of what is the peak you have a transportation date during that period which is under concentration and that will decide what is the required depth of application will also be dependent on what is the water holding capacity of the soil the roots on depth as the these two put together the extent of the soil profile which is providing moisture to the crop and the water holding capacity these two put together will decide what is the available washer and the management allowed depletion these are the major factors which will decide because when at what exact time you want to irrigate that there is some level of flexibility in that and that is a function of decision made either by the farmer or the management so that is what we have discussed earlier that the management allowed depletion of the deficit can also influence how much is the requirement at that particular time then the other design objective is which is true for this particular case and the previous methods which we have considered so far this objective was not the one which is which we are going to discuss right now this is a very particular objective which is only true for the case of sprint irrigation system and that is that the integrate the integrate of soil should not exceed so as to avoid and in and off from the irrigation regit field so in this particular method we don't allow any enough to generate which means we will have to control the irrigation application to the extent that the there shouldn't be any surface runoff which which might crop up which means that you'll have to you'll have to take into consideration what are the variations and they integrate because integrate is something which is dependent on the soil moisture conditions is not fixed it varies with respect to the soil object moisture condition so when we are designing the the sprinkler irrigation will have to consider what is the prevailing intake rate of the soil under those conditions and control the irrigation application in such a manner that you don't get any surface runoff then we also want the uniformity of application so which is a objective which is common objective that was the objective earlier also and this uniformity of application will result in reduction in the leak population so if your depoculation losses are large the uniformity will be the uniformity of application will be low we have to design the system in such a manner the uniformity of application can be as much as possible under the prevailing conditions now the uniformity of application at this stage we can just at least mention that in in the case of sprinkler irrigation system you are getting a depth of application by the overlap of different different application patterns which are for individual sprinkler heads so there will be some level of inaccuracies involved or some level of non-uniformities which will be involved because of these overlaps and that will be dependent on many other factors for example the wind conditions which is going to be a major factor in deciding how well you can have the overlap how effective overlap can be obtained under those prevailing wind conditions will be a function of the level of wind conditions if the wind conditions are very excessive the wind speeds are very excessive you might find that the overlaps might be very difficult to obtain the uniformity throughout the area we'll discuss those things in detail i thought i'll just mention make a mention at this stage that this is one of the the condition which will decide how much will be the uniformity which can be achieved in this system another design objective which is very often can be a deciding factor is the trade-off between the achieving the physical conditions the physical requirements of the crop and in achieving those requirements how much you have to incur how much expensive the system can be or how much expense you have to incur so the economy of the overall system is going to be a very major factor in this tradeoff between physical plus biological requirements and on the other hand the economic cause of equipment plus labor these two factors are going to be the deciding ones in some cases if you change the design you might that your initial cost goes up very much you might have to invest a lot of money in providing all those equipment example if you go in for the permanent set system is going to be the fixed system you will require a lot of pipes which will which will add to your initial investment whereas if you go in for a flexible system your label costs will be quite excessive similarly the costs like maintenance cause the recurring cost all those things you'll have to see and compare them under different options but at the same time you'll also have to look at how well you are by choosing a particular system how well you are in a position to cater to the requirements which is the basic need of the education system so this trade-off is a very important aspect and as a very subjective thing this trade-off will vary from place to place and those conditions are in those countries where the equipment is very expensive people might go in for the labor is cheap you might choose a different option than in those places where is the other way around so uh is this totally is a very subjective objective the design objective and vary from place to place is very essential to understand that but it can be a deciding factor in many situations then let's go on to the some other aspects which are uh which we must understand before we go on to the next level of looking into the designs of these systems as the uniformity of applications we just mentioned in our objectives that we need to get uniformity of application that uniformity of application is dependent on two basic factors one is the the pressure the prevailing pressure and the others the wind conditions how the pressure influences the uniformity of application let's take three different cases when we operate the sprinkler nozzle under three different pressures and this is my location of the sprinkler nozzle let's say that this is the distance this is the zero level 10 20 30 meters so this is the central point where the the sprinkler is fixed now if the pressure is too low we won't get the order of magnitude we are just saying relatively because that will be the the this variation of the distribution of water will vary with respect to the size of the nozzle and the pressure so we are just trying to look at how relatively the special distribution will change the pressure variation will change the distribution fraction when the pressure is low you might find that you might get a distribution of water which is something of this this nature because in this case what is happening is that since the pressure is low when the the jet comes out of the nozzle is not broken up into smaller particles is not fully broken up is not broken up to the extent that it can get distributed over this area of influence in a uniform manner it might be having some still some streams which are going as a stream of water there is some breakage of jet but not is only partial breakage so if that happens you will find that this type of variation will be absorbed on the other hand if the pressure is too high you might get a variation which is something of this nature and the pressure the variation of the distribution might be something like a triangular variation if the pressure is satisfactory now why we are saying that this is this variation this distribution is more acceptable because ultimately we have to get the overall distribution by overlapping these individual distribution patterns and is very difficult to get a uniform distribution the overall uniform distribution by having either of these two distribution patterns that's the reason otherwise there's no other reason this is the only reason that why we want a distribution pattern of this type why we are calling this pressure to be satisfactory because by having this type of precedent distribution is much easier to have a better uniformity of application okay any question so stop here [Music] [Music] you",
