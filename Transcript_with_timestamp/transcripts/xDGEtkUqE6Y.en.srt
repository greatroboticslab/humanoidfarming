00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,680
hi there

3
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,880
i'm farmer brad and i'm gonna talk about

4
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:40,320
chicken rental packages that i offer we

5
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,200
offer two or four hens for three or six

6
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,280
months

7
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,800
then at the end of the rental period you

8
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,360
have the option to

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,399
buy out and keep everything so what i

10
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,920
provide is

11
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:55,120
the coupe the hens the feeder

12
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,280
the water and some feed to start with

13
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,280
the goal with the chicken rental package

14
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,480
is that on day one

15
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,960
of the rental you get fresh eggs

16
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,320
in your backyard now i source the hens

17
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,720
either from our farm

18
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,240
or from a nearby farm so that they are

19
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,520
just starting to lay

20
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:17,119
so this coupe here is five feet by eight

21
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:20,400
feet and uh

22
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,200
this door you open up and that is where

23
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,479
you access

24
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,720
the feed and the water

25
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,159
and over here is where the nest boxes

26
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,119
are and that's where

27
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,159
you get your eggs i designed this coop

28
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,560
so that

29
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,200
majority of taking care of the chickens

30
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,479
can be done

31
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:41,520
from standing upright so there

32
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:44,320
is a release

33
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,920
for the door on the other side and you

34
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,000
end up pulling this cable

35
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,360
and then that will keep the door open

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,360
this is large enough

37
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,399
coupe that if you don't have a fenced in

38
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,119
backyard

39
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,680
you can just let the chickens be in

40
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,680
there

41
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,200
and then i can also add wheels to this

42
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,240
so it's easier to move around on your

43
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,520
backyard

44
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,240
now there are some additional fees such

45
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,600
as the

46
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,800
chicken replacement fee and the

47
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,080
mileage uh delivery fee so there's free

48
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,040
delivery

49
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,920
uh one way within 50 miles of greens

50
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,440
fork

51
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:23,760
and then beyond that it is uh

52
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:27,120
there's a surcharge per mile

53
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,840
also this year i'm going to be offering

54
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,040
up

55
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,080
a senior citizen bantam chicken rental

56
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,599
package

57
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,319
and uh kovit has hit a senior citizens

58
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,920
the hardest and sometimes you just need

59
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,360
that companionship

60
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,280
now the bantams are smaller hens so they

61
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,800
lay smaller eggs

62
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,319
but they take up less space so

63
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,959
when you go to the website you'll be

64
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:56,080
able to see the pricing for those

65
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,560
in order to get the uh

66
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,840
ball rolling there is a hundred dollar

67
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,239
down payment

68
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,840
so that way if i don't have a coupe on

69
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,920
hand

70
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,400
then that's enough up front cash that i

71
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,840
can start building one

72
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:15,280
the phantom

73
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:18,720
rental packages will be smaller

74
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,920
coupes and it will be a little bit more

75
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,040
affordable

76
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,799
