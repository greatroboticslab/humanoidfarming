1
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:14,360
the tractor is the essential tool that

2
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:16,010
farmers use to do their job the tractor

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:19,190
operator must become very knowledgeable

4
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:22,070
about his or her tractor what it can and

5
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:24,260
what it cannot do he or she must

6
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:26,720
understand the function of all controls

7
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:30,830
and wood they should and when they

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:33,020
shouldn't be used it is easy to assume

9
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:36,440
that the tractor operator sees

10
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:40,190
everything that attitude will get you

11
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:42,199
into trouble very fast to be safe you

12
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:45,170
must assume that the tractor operator

13
00:00:42,199 --> 00:00:48,379
doesn't have any idea that you are in

14
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:51,379
the area stay at a safe distance until

15
00:00:48,379 --> 00:00:55,149
you have eyeball-to-eyeball contact and

16
00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:58,249
the operator acknowledges your presence

17
00:00:55,149 --> 00:01:00,679
the area between the tractor and a PTO

18
00:00:58,249 --> 00:01:04,339
driven implement is one of the most

19
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:07,340
dangerous areas on the farm some call it

20
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:09,530
the no zone when in operation don't

21
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:12,079
enter it unless the tractor is stopped

22
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:14,960
the power to the PTO has been shut off

23
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:17,360
all moving parts have come to a complete

24
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:22,399
stop and the driver knows what you're

25
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:24,110
going to do and has acknowledged it if

26
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:27,890
you're not familiar with a particular

27
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:31,850
field or area walk it first become aware

28
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:33,920
of any hazards if your tractor is

29
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:36,020
equipped with a front-end loader you

30
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,020
have another set of dangers to deal with

31
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:41,750
always carry your load as low as

32
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:44,329
possible if your back wheels are

33
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:47,180
somewhat light and bouncy as the loader

34
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:49,729
starts to lift the load add additional

35
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:52,579
ballast to the rear of the machine be

36
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:55,340
aware that a D ballast is not always the

37
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:58,700
answer make sure you're not overloading

38
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:00,679
the equipment farm workers have been

39
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:03,200
fatally crushed because they didn't use

40
00:02:00,679 --> 00:02:06,289
the proper attachment to carry the big

41
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,080
round bales of hay the bales roll over

42
00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:12,170
on top of them one option would be to

43
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:15,140
use a spear type bale mover on the other

44
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:17,569
hand if you use grapple forks make sure

45
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:19,340
they're the correct size to handle the

46
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:22,049
bales you're moving

47
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:24,840
the master tractor driver keeps his

48
00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:27,599
speed down especially when carrying a

49
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,030
heavy load the rig is already top-heavy

50
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:35,159
making it easier to tip over from

51
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:37,920
momentum and/or centrifugal force when

52
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:40,260
approaching a blind corner don't assume

53
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,260
someone coming around the other way can

54
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:47,250
hear you they might be driving a rig as

55
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:50,209
noisy as yours slow down don't drive any

56
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:53,639
faster then you can stop if suddenly

57
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:57,230
someone or something appears in your

58
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:59,760
path keep in mind your own reaction time

59
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:00,620
the same is true when driving around

60
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,200
curves

61
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:06,180
this is especially true at night know

62
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:10,290
the stopping distance of your tractor

63
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:14,719
and your load if you need to cross a

64
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:17,459
slope or uneven ground slow down any

65
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:21,389
irregularity in the ground might be just

66
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:24,000
enough to roll the tractor if you're

67
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:26,900
going up or down a slope don't depress

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,989
your clutch or try to change gears

69
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:34,470
always back up a slope drive down the

70
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:38,090
slope but back up it will greatly reduce

71
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:40,439
your chances of a rear rollover

72
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:42,540
sometimes you have to work in inclement

73
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:45,720
weather or after dark

74
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:48,359
often the drivers visibility is greatly

75
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:52,379
diminished cut your speed to a minimum

76
00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:55,439
stay alert for holes and ditches in a

77
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:58,949
thunderstorm unless you're in a totally

78
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:01,680
enclosed cab shut the engine off set the

79
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:04,530
brakes remove the key and get off the

80
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,540
tractor if you're in an open field you

81
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,909
had a safe distance from the tractor and

82
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:12,900
lay down in the lowest ditch you can

83
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:14,939
find never stand under a tree if you're

84
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:18,259
close enough get inside a barn or

85
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:20,909
enclosed vehicle if you can hear thunder

86
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:24,169
you are within striking distance of

87
00:04:20,909 --> 00:04:28,440
lightning seek safe shelter immediately

88
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:30,690
don't wait for the rain 62 people die

89
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:33,650
each year in the United States from

90
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,650
lightning strikes

91
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:42,479
one third of all fatal tractor accidents

92
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:45,060
happen on public roadways one third the

93
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,880
problem this sometimes happens when the

94
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:50,820
tractor is not the right size for towing

95
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:53,340
a certain implement but most of the time

96
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:56,580
it's the other drivers will have little

97
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:59,550
or no experience driving on country

98
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:01,500
roads that's why the tractor drivers

99
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:04,070
have to not only be concerned about

100
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:07,190
their own rate but try to anticipate

101
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:10,490
what the other drivers are going to do

102
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:13,320
don't try to keep up with road vehicles

103
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:16,650
tractors don't handle well at higher

104
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:19,970
speeds and observe the maximum highway

105
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:22,860
speed for the implement you're towing

106
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:24,570
before you set out on the highway make

107
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,810
sure all your hazard warning lights

108
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:30,840
headlights taillights and turn signals

109
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:33,840
are in working order be sure your smv

110
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:36,750
sign the slow moving vehicle sign is

111
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,090
clean and visible these will help

112
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:42,780
provide advance warning for the other

113
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:44,970
drivers sharing the roadway lock your

114
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:47,639
brake pedals together so you'll have a

115
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:50,250
dual braking system if you don't and

116
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:53,610
your foot slips you might roll the

117
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:55,760
tractor if at all possible try not to

118
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:58,289
drive on country roads at night

119
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,720
distances and closing speeds are very

120
00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:03,720
hard to judge when the other drivers can

121
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,780
only see your lights the other drivers

122
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:10,680
may come up on you too fast to stop it's

123
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:12,720
their fault but it's your life be

124
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,630
careful before you try to get off the

125
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:19,260
road the unpaved ground may be very soft

126
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:21,720
you may end up rolling over also watch

127
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:25,440
out for mailboxes they are generally

128
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:27,419
closer to the road in the country the

129
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,180
most dangerous part of driving a tractor

130
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:33,570
on public roads is turning left when

131
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:35,310
another vehicle is wanting to pass use

132
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:36,510
your mirrors to keep track of the other

133
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:39,140
traffic

134
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:42,390
make sure all traffic behind you and

135
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:45,210
oncoming knows that your intention is to

136
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:48,030
make a left-hand turn use your turn

137
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:52,760
signal and wait until the traffic stops

138
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:56,250
to allow you to make the turn safely

139
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:58,830
after a hard day at work is time to shut

140
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:01,980
down set the parking brake

141
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:05,400
try not to park on it in time but if you

142
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:08,370
must set wheel chocks

143
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:11,820
but the transmission in neutral lower

144
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:14,699
all implements to the ground slow the

145
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:18,770
engine down as far as it will go shut it

146
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:22,169
off and remove the key from the ignition

147
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:26,340
wait until morning to refuel when the

148
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:29,070
engine is cooled this section on the

149
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:31,160
basic operation of the tractor is very

150
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:35,160
important and we have a lot of

151
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:39,000
information to review work hard to

152
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:42,330
become a master tractor operator when

153
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:46,710
working near a tractor always assume the

154
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:48,840
tractor operator doesn't see you never

155
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:52,370
enter the space between the tractor and

156
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:55,260
the implement when the engine is running

157
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:59,760
if you are unfamiliar with the field

158
00:07:55,260 --> 00:08:03,930
walk it first carry your load low with a

159
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:06,509
front-end loader don't overload don't

160
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:11,070
try to move round bales of hay without

161
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:14,030
the proper tool keep your speed down it

162
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:17,120
will reduce your chances of a rollover

163
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:20,280
in approaching a blind corner or curves

164
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:24,630
slow to a speed that you can stop within

165
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:28,620
sight just slow down when crossing a

166
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:32,580
slope in bad weather and/or at night

167
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:35,690
slow down in a thunderstorm

168
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:38,940
get off your tractor and take shelter

169
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:42,409
when driving a public highway make sure

170
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:45,810
the other drivers know your intentions

171
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:47,910
don't get off a tractor without setting

172
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:50,570
the parking brakes lowering the

173
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:53,959
implements shutting the engine off and

174
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:53,959
removing the key
