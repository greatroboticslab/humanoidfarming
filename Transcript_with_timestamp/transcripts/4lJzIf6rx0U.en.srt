00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,560
jeremiah jones field agronomist with

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,480
pioneer kelly robertson granular csa

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,320
with precision crop services

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,920
so kelly you and i have been talking the

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,599
last three or four weeks about some

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,599
observations that we're seeing out in

7
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,480
the fields yeah we're starting to see a

8
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,800
lot of problems crop up as a result of

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,480
the wet spring we've had

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,039
so we've been talking about uneven

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,279
stands we're seeing in corn and soybeans

12
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,199
both and a lot of those uneven stands

13
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,800
first of all get attributed back to

14
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,519
tillage done when it was too wet so

15
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,280
we're starting to see a lot of

16
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,880
the results of tillage done wet

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,040
restricted layers caused by tillage

18
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,760
compaction and whatnot yes

19
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,360
so

20
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,200
talking about that we're seeing

21
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,680
restricted root growth so we're seeing a

22
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,079
lot of nutrient deficiencies showing up

23
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,079
you know sulfur or nitrogen

24
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,680
so in addition to the tillage that was

25
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,640
done too i had a lot of

26
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,000
corn and soybeans were planted into wet

27
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,760
conditions so we've got sidewall

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,280
compaction so we've got restricted root

29
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,520
growth

30
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,520
and as a result of that and the tillage

31
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,600
uh the plants are just not able to get

32
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:07,439
to the nutrients that are there

33
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,760
so we we sidewalled in our nitrogen we

34
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,439
got sidewall compaction there

35
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,600
yeah we're seeing a lot of fields with

36
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,799
the pre-plant anhydrous that you can you

37
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,119
can still see the the application pass

38
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,640
at an angle through the field

39
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,400
when you you can literally in some

40
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,840
fields even after the anhydrous was

41
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,040
applied and tillage was done you can

42
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,119
still see

43
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,280
where the anhydrous toolbar went through

44
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,360
the field when you dig into those areas

45
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,920
what you're finding is a very restricted

46
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,320
sidewall compacted knife slot and so you

47
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,240
see yellow plants that have a restricted

48
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,680
root that can't get to the nitrogen and

49
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,280
then you're seeing nitrogen still

50
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,920
staying in that slot

51
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,399
so by no means is this um

52
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,799
the world ended but so what are we going

53
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,320
to do about these problems well the the

54
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,360
first problem is is going to be that

55
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,720
there's going to be people that are

56
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,479
going to come and tell you that you need

57
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,240
to apply more nitrogen or that you need

58
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,680
to put a foliar on to correct a nutrient

59
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,600
deficiency or do something with an input

60
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,600
to try to fix this and the first thing

61
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,880
we want to recognize is we're not going

62
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,119
to fix these problems with any more of

63
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,120
something so adding more of a chemical

64
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,120
or a fertilizer or anything is not going

65
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,440
to fix a mechanical issue that we

66
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,520
created early in the season

67
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,959
i know that in some of your updates i

68
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,160
received from him you got a good

69
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,560
statement it says what is go yeah a goal

70
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,160
so that's our theme this year gold get

71
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,319
out and look

72
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,319
most problems can be avoided if you get

73
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,080
out of the tractor cab get out in the

74
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,080
field look at the tillage tool look at

75
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,080
the soil look at the planter and not

76
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,680
rely on a monitor or what you're seeing

77
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,640
six feet above the ground in a glass

78
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,800
bubble so goal get out and look and i

79
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,519
would encourage you when you see these

80
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,920
areas in the fields get out look at them

81
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,319
look at imagery and if you have any

82
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,239
questions please reach out to your local

83
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,800
