00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,679
hi

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,519
my name is carl hoppy i'm the extension

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,599
livestock specialist at the carrington

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,800
research extension center

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,800
and today i'm going to visit about feed

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,800
rations for background in cattle and

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,800
this is the fall

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:26,720
2020.

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:30,080
this is brought to you by ndsu extension

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,800
well new calf crops are here 2020

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,719
uh time to place them on feed and look

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,640
at what type of calves we have you know

13
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,960
these january-born calves are going to

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,079
be big these april and june born calves

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,600
are going to be smaller

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,719
so we got a little bit of everything out

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,559
there in the pen we have different

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,680
colors we have different types

19
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,200
sexes uh bulls steers heifer hopefully

20
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,800
most of them are castrated if they're

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,840
going to the commercial market

22
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,440
and uh there's just a lot of differences

23
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,039
out there but it's a new year and a new

24
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,440
season a new group of calves that need

25
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,559
to be placed on feet

26
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,879
a couple comments here

27
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,240
traditionally in background in calves we

28
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,280
grow cattle

29
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,200
and it takes feed

30
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,880
in the northern plains where

31
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,240
backgrounding state if we're in the

32
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,240
southern plains we would still have

33
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,799
grass or some type of feed resources out

34
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,680
there

35
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,280
which to graze so in the northern plains

36
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,400
it ends up being a feeding state so

37
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,439
that's kind of the difference between

38
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,920
backgrounding

39
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,600
and stalker cattle backgrounding means

40
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,720
we're feeding them for a period of time

41
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,280
after weaning

42
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,759
now the feed prices follow the corn

43
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,600
price

44
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,680
that's traditionally what's been going

45
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,400
on and it continues to go on

46
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,159
that way so as corn prices are increased

47
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,280
so does the overall prices of other

48
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,520
feedstuffs

49
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,360
increase as well let's go through some

50
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,720
examples let's take a walk back in

51
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,479
memory lane i like to

52
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,720
i like to reflect on these just to have

53
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,840
an idea of what prices were just a few

54
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,439
years ago because

55
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,200
you know we tend to even remember we

56
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,520
only remember about a year back

57
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,000
so not even that far at times what

58
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,920
happened but in 2017 our corn price is

59
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,560
288 a bushel

60
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,200
and our distiller's greens was a dollar

61
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,000
i was 113 dollars a ton

62
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,200
hays were anywhere from 65 to 85 a ton

63
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,360
depending upon what it was and wheat

64
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,040
mixes were at 95 and at that time

65
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,200
we still had barley mulch sprouts in the

66
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,520
region in which to feed

67
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,879
in 2018 the price of corn went up to

68
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,800
three bucks a bushel

69
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,560
hay remained about the same price of

70
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,840
distillage grains went up slightly as

71
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,440
well as wheat meds and barley malt

72
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,800
sprouts are not available

73
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:33,200
in north made in north dakota at least

74
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,160
now for 2019 just last year the price of

75
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,760
corn did go up another 10 percent hayes

76
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,120
remain about the same price wheat beds

77
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,680
are a little bit lower

78
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,599
and and distillers grains reflected the

79
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,440
corn price and it increased as well

80
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:50,800
now let's see what's happened for 2020

81
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:54,000
corn prices increase slightly

82
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,080
hey in both alfalfa and grassy at least

83
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,319
this is alfalfa hay for

84
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,920
steers for beef cattle not necessarily

85
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,440
for dairy cattle

86
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,120
um have remained the same compared to

87
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,040
previous years wheat meds has creeped up

88
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,920
just a little bit distillers grains has

89
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,440
increased

90
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,120
quite a bit there's been a demand for

91
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,360
distillers grains and the price is up

92
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,040
canola meal prices are up as well

93
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,640
and the price of corn size because the

94
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,599
price of corn has increased the price of

95
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,440
corn silage

96
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:21,599
has increased as well

97
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,680
must make note we have a lot of

98
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,280
processing plants in north dakota some

99
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,360
states don't have this

100
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,360
opportunity that we have but if you're

101
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,120
located in the right location

102
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,879
and need some supplemental feeds the

103
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,239
price of these feeds

104
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,920
along with your freight might make it

105
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,879
very competitive to bring that into your

106
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,720
feed yard

107
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,560
if you're in western north dakota you've

108
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,519
got a lot of freight compared to being

109
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,760
located in eastern north dakota

110
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,280
distillers grains is quite prevalent

111
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,920
throughout the

112
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,200
lower part of north dakota and even into

113
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,159
south dakota

114
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,159
so uh the amount of co-product feeds

115
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,959
better from distillers grains is

116
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,599
quite readily available as well as wheat

117
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,200
meds

118
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:05,200
and we have uh

119
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,760
oil crushes throughout north dakota that

120
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:11,599
would make um

121
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,360
soybean meal canola meal sunflower meal

122
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,120
those types of things where the oil's

123
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,359
been taken out we do have sugar

124
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,160
processing plants in the state

125
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:22,320
sugar beets that is and they produce

126
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,840
beet pulp we used to have tailings but

127
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,160
most of those might be going to the new

128
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:29,840
ethanol plant that's producing

129
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,840
up in grand forks north dakota

130
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,080
here's just to run down the co-product

131
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,360
feeds in north dakota rather than a map

132
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,280
as i said we got five different

133
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,880
distillery grain plants like

134
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,199
five different ethanol plants that

135
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,919
produce distillers greens

136
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,280
uh in north dakota and actually several

137
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,040
more throughout the region

138
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,800
they produce both wet which would be

139
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,360
like 60 moisture

140
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,880
modified which is 50 moisture and dried

141
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,520
which is basically

142
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,000
dried 95 percent dry matter feed

143
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,840
sometimes

144
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,600
they produce what's called corn syrup

145
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,759
but its real name is condensed

146
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,759
distillery solubles

147
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,280
most of these plants put this back onto

148
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,759
the distillers grains that's why it's

149
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,840
called

150
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,160
distillers distillers grains with

151
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,840
solubles

152
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,160
although most time we just shorten it up

153
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,880
and say ddgs which is dry distillers

154
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,320
grains or

155
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,560
just distillers grains we're talking

156
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,320
about the water modified and for those

157
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,440
people that do get distillers grains

158
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,600
with solubles

159
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,280
excuse me condensed cellular solubles

160
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,680
they just call it corn syrup

161
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,120
not to be confused with the corn syrup

162
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,840
that comes out of

163
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,360
a fructose refining plant a corn a wet

164
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,199
corn milling plant like there is down in

165
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,880
waffenton north dakota

166
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,880
but that usually goes to the human food

167
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,320
industry not to our livestock feeds so

168
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,840
usually we're talking corn syrup and

169
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,080
livestock it's always just

170
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,840
great we do have wheat millings in north

171
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,880
dakota the north dakota milan elevator

172
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,000
is the largest

173
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,520
mill in the world in one location and of

174
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,960
course we the

175
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,960
the taxpayers of north dakota own the

176
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,160
state mill and elevator in grand forks

177
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,440
and they're very competitively priced

178
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,000
when it comes to events of course we

179
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,800
have

180
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,520
a mill up in minot carrington and

181
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,440
fairmont

182
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,400
and even some milling is done up in can

183
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:12,319
do probably mild sprouts is only done in

184
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:15,600
is it done out of state now in

185
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:18,880
moorhead uh we don't have a milk

186
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,560
sprouting plant well it's closed now

187
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,360
has been for several years in north

188
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,080
dakota we do have a corn gluten feed

189
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,960
plant

190
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,520
or a fructose plant wet corn milling

191
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,600
plant

192
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,039
and produces corn gluten feed as well as

193
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,280
corn gluten meal

194
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,319
meals about 60 protein usually goes into

195
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,520
a lot of our

196
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,440
dog food type diets pet diets

197
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,639
not so much into our animal diets but

198
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,199
corn gluten feeds

199
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,120
widely utilized in the dairy industry

200
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,039
and can be in the beef industry too

201
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,720
uh the plant now produces only wet

202
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,160
product that's how much the demand there

203
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,080
is they don't even produce the dry

204
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,080
we do have a couple of potato proposing

205
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,319
plants in north dakota

206
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,960
one in grand forks one in jamestown if

207
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,520
you're on the list to get it year round

208
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,039
you are probably their favorite customer

209
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,199
it's really hard to get this product in

210
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:08,080
the off season but it is available

211
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,280
uh depending upon what the supply is b

212
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,039
tailings

213
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,960
again that used to be readily available

214
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,840
but now with the ethanol plant located

215
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,759
up in grand forks that

216
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:21,199
utilizes uh

217
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:24,080
potato waste as well as tailings um

218
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,440
beet tailings that they might be more

219
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,919
difficult to get a hold of

220
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,919
beet pulp is still available when the

221
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,520
dryers can't catch up or meet the demand

222
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,360
of drying down beet pulp

223
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,759
of course our meals kilometer linseed

224
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,319
mill which is from flax sunflower milk

225
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,280
and soybean meal are produced at several

226
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,759
plants across

227
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,080
north dakota one couple these plants are

228
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,759
swing plants where they produce other

229
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,440
it depends upon the time of the year

230
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,680
that they're crushing what particular

231
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,120
items right now we don't have a mill in

232
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,599
north dakota that is crushing

233
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,440
soybeans so consequently there would be

234
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,879
no soy hulls available in north dakota

235
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,240
but if you go across the border into

236
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,319
south dakota there is

237
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,280
plenty of million halls available in

238
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,199
aberdeen

239
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,879
of course there's always screenings that

240
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,199
are produced everywhere but be sure to

241
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:10,240
watch out for weed seeds that

242
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,560
might be in screenings the favorite one

243
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,599
now is palmer amaranth or

244
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,879
or palmer pigweed and if those seeds are

245
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,960
in some screenings that are brought in

246
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,919
from out of state you have just created

247
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,440
a

248
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:25,440
a very weed herbicide resistant plant

249
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,039
into your fields or your feedlot

250
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,560
and just be careful about what you're

251
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,080
buying when you're buying screening if

252
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,000
they're locally from north dakota and

253
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,000
sourced locally from north dakota

254
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,440
that problem shouldn't be there with not

255
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,919
swedes that can't be controlled with

256
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,839
herbicides

257
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,839
let's talk a little bit about cattle now

258
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:49,519
there is a daily nutrient need for

259
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,920
certain feed ingredients for cattle i'm

260
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,680
going to

261
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,760
try to lay out here that our most

262
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,040
expensive

263
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,760
costs for feeding cattle is in feeding

264
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,279
what we call

265
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,760
energy that'd be the starch and the

266
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,760
fiber the animals digest and utilize

267
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,600
to make their bodies grow a lot of times

268
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,920
you talk about proteins but

269
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,760
in reality it's the energy that costs

270
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,760
the most and we do buy protein

271
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,920
supplements to meet the needs

272
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,519
but usually energy is the biggest

273
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,160
expense so let's just use some

274
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,800
assumptions

275
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,959
we have a 700 pound steer he's eating

276
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,839
three percent of body weight

277
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,519
and that would calculate almost 18

278
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,920
pounds of dry matter feed

279
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,040
and if we look in the energy world we

280
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,800
can

281
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,080
utilize two different terms to describe

282
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,760
the amount of energy

283
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,160
the animal needs it's either in mega

284
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:39,360
cals of net energy for gain

285
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,920
or simply placed as tdn which

286
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,440
refers to as total digestible nutrients

287
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,040
well for easy math

288
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,720
we can use the 14.12 pounds of tdn

289
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,360
needed by the animal

290
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,800
and in order to get that the cost of

291
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,600
energy when you look at the price of

292
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,760
corn

293
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,360
and just do the calculations for the

294
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,240
cost per pound of tdn

295
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,200
it comes up to be 5 cents per bushel so

296
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,240
this example

297
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,240
14 times 5 gets 70 cents a day

298
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,480
for the pro for the energy cost to feed

299
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,959
an animal a 700 pounds tear

300
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,480
now they need 13.1 percent good protein

301
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,640
their diet if they're eating 18 pounds

302
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,000
of feed that roughly means 2.33 pounds

303
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,640
of crude protein

304
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,920
is needed per day good protein if you

305
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,200
look at the soybean meals

306
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,200
or the other meals um it's

307
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,440
18 cents a pound in this example which

308
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,800
means it costs almost 42 cents

309
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,000
a day just in protein costs so just in

310
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,519
that calculation alone

311
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,360
we spend more money and energy than we

312
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,800
do in protein but think of this when we

313
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,680
buy corn

314
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,279
uh we buy 80 almost 90 percent of the

315
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,200
corn is energy

316
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,880
but to eight percent of that corn or

317
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,560
nine or maybe even 10 percent of that

318
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,760
corn is going to be

319
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:52,240
protein so if we need 13

320
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,120
protein in the ration and we bought corn

321
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,920
and hay

322
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,160
that's averages 10 protein we only need

323
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,320
to

324
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:03,040
add an extra um

325
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,440
six tenths of a pound of crude protein a

326
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,720
day

327
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,360
so my math down there is 2.33 minus 1.74

328
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,440
pounds

329
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,720
that's the amount of protein that is in

330
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,120
the feed

331
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,720
that we bought for the energy so we need

332
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,640
to provide an additional

333
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,120
six tenths of a pound of protein to the

334
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,480
cattle at 18 cents a pound that means we

335
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,480
spent a penny

336
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:26,399
excuse me a dime so energy cost in this

337
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,480
ration would be 70 cents

338
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,519
the additional protein cost this ration

339
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,800
is 10 cents

340
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,800
and for those of you that wonder about

341
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,640
the cost of water roll water would cost

342
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,959
maybe two cents depending upon

343
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,480
what your rates are in your location and

344
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,399
the cost amount of water they

345
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,079
drink but i like to point that out that

346
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,720
water is actually a very cheap

347
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,519
part of our ration but energy is most

348
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,120
expensive

349
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,959
and protein while we usually talk about

350
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,160
protein a lot we do need protein to aid

351
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,079
in digestion

352
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,440
it's really only a small percentage the

353
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,880
total amount of feed that we provide

354
00:11:53,440 --> 00:12:00,240
their animals on a daily basis

355
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,720
let's calculate some numbers for feed

356
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,760
value in other words cost per pound of

357
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,279
nutrient

358
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,360
the two big nutrients here are going to

359
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:10,480
be crude protein and tdm

360
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,240
let's take the first example canola meal

361
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,079
uh it's ninety percent dry matter let's

362
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,839
use the math on as fed basis and the

363
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:19,279
crude protein in canola meal on an as

364
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:23,519
fed basis is 38.7 percent

365
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:24,720
the cost per ton as fed would be 255

366
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,160
dollars a ton

367
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,639
the cost per pound then as adult is 12.7

368
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:34,160
cents you take the 0.127

369
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:36,880
divide that by 0.387

370
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,480
that's the 38.7 percent good protein and

371
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,880
we end up with a 29

372
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,160
cent cost per pound of protein that's

373
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,839
how we calculate

374
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,240
cost per pound of protein coming out of

375
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,399
feedstuff now we do the same thing in

376
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:52,760
calculating cost per pound of tdn

377
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:55,680
except we use that 1.27 and divide it by

378
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,639
0.621 that's the tdn energy of the of

379
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,200
canola mil

380
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,279
and that ends up with 0.84 we do the

381
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,320
same math for wheat mints corn grain and

382
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,519
distillers

383
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,320
and as you look through there what's the

384
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,360
cheapest

385
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,800
cost of protein of a tdn

386
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,720
we normally think corn grains the

387
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,399
cheapest cost to tdn and that's exactly

388
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,240
what our math turns out to be

389
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,079
it's fairly cheap and it's it's a fairly

390
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,920
low cost feed weed mints

391
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:24,240
is right behind it uh fairly close and

392
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,440
distillerish grains are somewhat

393
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,040
competitive

394
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,279
now if you look at canola mill that is

395
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,800
definitely not an energy source

396
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,959
that would use in our rations because

397
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,000
the high cost for energy now let's look

398
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,160
at the cost per pound

399
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,600
of protein where's our cheapest cost per

400
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,160
pound of protein it's actually in the

401
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,720
distillers grains

402
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,079
and then wheat mints and then canola

403
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,320
meal

404
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,760
actually are cheaper sauces distillation

405
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,680
grains then canola meal

406
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,839
then wheat mints and of course corn

407
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,760
green would have a very high cost per

408
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,680
pound of protein because it's not

409
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,040
utilized for protein as a protein

410
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,320
supplement it's utilized

411
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:03,839
as an energy supplement so

412
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:06,800
if we need energy we look towards corn

413
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:09,199
if we need protein we usually look at

414
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,600
protein supplements like canola meal

415
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:13,360
however distillers grains can almost be

416
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,519
considered one of those as both

417
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,880
a protein supplement as well as an

418
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,800
energy source

419
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,399
and quite frankly wheat meds falls in

420
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,160
that same category too

421
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,760
so when you start looking at rations

422
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,120
please keep these in mind

423
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:31,839
as two co-product feed sources

424
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,839
that can help balance a ration

425
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,440
before i get into rations i'd like to

426
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,320
talk about some feed issues in north

427
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:41,440
dakota

428
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,440
2020. this year corn silage

429
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,000
it wasn't as difficult for harvest as it

430
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,399
was in previous years but we did

431
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,120
like last year but we did end up with an

432
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,480
early frost the first part of september

433
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,839
we've been kind of used to having a

434
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,440
frost that doesn't show up until the

435
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,839
first part of october

436
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:03,279
so he lost about a month worth of growth

437
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,279
and of course when it freezes

438
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,240
corn choppers are they want to have

439
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,760
every

440
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,360
everybody's asking for them to show up

441
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,600
their place now because

442
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,440
corn is ready at that particular time so

443
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,120
the amount of delay you have from the

444
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,880
time it froze to the time it actually

445
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,519
gets chopped

446
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,120
affects the moisture content of the feed

447
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,040
and that in turn can affect the feed

448
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,160
value so i always encourage you to feed

449
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,199
test

450
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,360
dryer silages like this picture of the

451
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:34,800
corn was froze and you can see that kind

452
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:37,920
of a light green color in the corn

453
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:40,560
it dries out and there will be some poor

454
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,680
fermentation due to x and metal lead to

455
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,880
excess heating

456
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,240
so i like this temperature gauge it's a

457
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,920
three foot long gauge

458
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,680
that you stick into the size pile and it

459
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,600
tells you what the temperature is

460
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,360
just a few weeks after chopping it was

461
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,279
only at 82 degrees

462
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,040
about a month and a half later it went

463
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,519
up to 100 degrees which indicates

464
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,519
there's more

465
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,000
more air or fermentation going into the

466
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:09,519
into the pile

467
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:11,920
because of the lower moisture content

468
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,199
one other issues that we've ran into

469
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,199
this year is

470
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,399
is dry edible beans it appears there's

471
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:19,920
enough moldy

472
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,959
and discolored beans that producers of

473
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,160
dry beans can't

474
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:25,600
sell them or market them consequently

475
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,920
they've offered these to beef cattle

476
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,880
producers say can you use those

477
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,639
and in reality we can unfortunately we

478
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,399
can't use a lot

479
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,759
some of the research projects have shown

480
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,480
that if you

481
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:40,639
feed it a high degree you can actually

482
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,560
like 20 30 percent

483
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,480
even more of the diet the cattle will

484
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,480
just stop eating so

485
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,320
the recommendation comes down to limit

486
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,279
to 10 of the rations you might be able

487
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,959
to go up to 20

488
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,560
but watch cattle performance and if they

489
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:55,360
don't decrease in performance

490
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:58,959
continue on here's the things you'll see

491
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:01,519
with cattle there'll be digestion issues

492
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:03,279
probably some scours decreased feed

493
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,240
intake and actually downright feed

494
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,839
refusal

495
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,280
remember one project using great

496
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,039
northern bean northern

497
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,720
great white northern great northern

498
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,959
whites and

499
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,400
the cattle actually i think 30 or 40

500
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,400
percent of the ration just stopped

501
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,799
eating the ration and wouldn't eat

502
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,480
actually had to discontinue eating that

503
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,919
because

504
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,520
you know animal health they'd die if

505
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,880
they won't eat so

506
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,160
cattle might eat it for a little bit be

507
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,160
careful how much you can put in i

508
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,520
suspect if you wanted to cook these you

509
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,559
could probably eat more

510
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,600
but cooking beans before feeding the

511
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,000
cattle

512
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:39,120
probably isn't a realistic thing for us

513
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,799
in the northern great plains

514
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,799
here's some rations for feeding cattle

515
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,120
for the next four slides you're going to

516
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,960
have different rations for 700 pound

517
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:52,799
steers

518
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,640
and different rates of gain

519
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,720
and correspondingly different feed costs

520
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,600
the first one is simply 13 pounds of

521
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,360
grass hay

522
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,360
and we need some protein and energy to

523
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,039
add to it in order to get enough gain

524
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,480
because grassy itself won't provide a

525
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,880
two pound a day gain

526
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,799
but thirteen pounds of grass hay and

527
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,200
then seven pounds of wheat mints

528
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,960
will give us a two pound a day gain the

529
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,080
rations around the sixty four percent

530
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:19,039
tdm the cost

531
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:21,600
to feed per pound of gain is 42 cents

532
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:23,280
if you look at a little bit better gain

533
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,440
we have to change our rational realm we

534
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,880
got to increase some alfalfa hay

535
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,880
actually pick up some wheat mints why do

536
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,960
we increase alfalfa hay because alfalfa

537
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,480
hay has got calcium in it

538
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,200
well wheat meds is really high in

539
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,440
phosphorus and without the adequate

540
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,039
two to one or one to one ratio of

541
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,960
calcium to phosphorus you can end up

542
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,559
with urinary calculating cattle

543
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,840
you don't want kidney stones in cattle

544
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,520
so you need to balance the rash for

545
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,960
calcium phosphorus as well

546
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,400
this is a real deal most time we don't

547
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,000
have a problem with it but it certainly

548
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,559
can if the rations are

549
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,160
improperly balanced okay so this

550
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,080
particular ratio will give you 2.6

551
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,600
pounds per day gain and 37

552
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:01,919
cost a gain please note that as

553
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,799
our gain increases our cost of grain

554
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,120
decreases

555
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:08,240
now let's just use a ration that's got

556
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,720
we go from 2.6 to 2.8 that's not much is

557
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,840
it

558
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,600
that's just uh just a few more pounds

559
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,400
in this ration we used eight pounds of

560
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:18,160
hay grass hey 12 pounds of wheat mids

561
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,520
and we had to include limestone in an

562
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,720
ounce per head per day

563
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,000
just because of the extra calcium needed

564
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,200
in this ration because wheat meals are

565
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,400
high in phosphorus

566
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,400
we need to add extra calcium so a 2.8

567
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,919
pound a day gain

568
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:37,120
feed costs is 35 cents per pound a gain

569
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:39,840
again as we pick up the rate of gain our

570
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,799
cost to feed our cost per pound a gain

571
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,799
tends to go less

572
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,880
now here's another set of rations say we

573
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,640
put up a lot of corn sides we had alpha

574
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,200
alpha hay so alfalfa hey

575
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,960
is the queen of forages corn slides is

576
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,360
the king of forages in this example

577
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,080
eight pounds alfalfa hey 29 pounds corn

578
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,679
salad

579
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,840
you might think that's a lot of feed but

580
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,320
that's 29 pounds of wet feed

581
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,400
which would be what's one third of 29

582
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,559
maybe 10 pounds of dry feed

583
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,000
so they gained 1.8 pounds on this

584
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:13,039
particular ration

585
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,960
and the feed cost is 0.48 that's 35

586
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,240
ton corn silage and 90 dollar to an

587
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,760
alfalfa hay

588
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,320
now let's cheapen this up with some

589
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,320
grass hay and corn grain and wheat mitts

590
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,480
and in this particular example we've got

591
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,280
2.6 pounds per day gain feeding six

592
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,600
pounds of hay

593
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,640
four pounds of alfalfa hay two pounds of

594
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,799
corn

595
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,960
grain and eight pounds of wheat millings

596
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,000
and our feed cost per pound to gain is

597
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,960
38 cents

598
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,600
again as we increase the gain the cost

599
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,400
of the gain

600
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,600
goes down and if we tweak this ration a

601
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,760
little bit more so we're giving them

602
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,799
even more corn grain

603
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,640
and uh less al they're only going to eat

604
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,919
so much so we have to if we give them

605
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,760
more corn grain we're going to have to

606
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,280
back something out of the ration

607
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,200
we give them less grass hay and a little

608
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,960
less wheat mitts and now we got three

609
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,960
pound a day gain and our feed cost per

610
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,720
pound again is 3.6

611
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,600
so again the same true message rings

612
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,360
true

613
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:10,559
um that as we increase the gain

614
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,320
the cost of the gain goes down uh

615
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:14,159
please note that corn size you always

616
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,679
get this comment wow i'm feeding a hell

617
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,320
out of pounds out there can they eat

618
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,120
that much

619
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,799
the answer is yes because it is mostly

620
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,640
water they're not going to be drinking

621
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:25,919
as much water because they

622
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,520
ate it in their feed okay

623
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:31,840
now here's another ration a simple

624
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:34,000
alfalfa hay and corn grain

625
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,919
no wet feed here we can feed an all dry

626
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,039
ration this particular one would be 2.3

627
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:40,799
pounds a day gain

628
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:44,559
and our feed cost is 46 cents

629
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:47,200
at 2.8 let's not go backwards to slide

630
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,200
for a second

631
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:53,440
uh but maybe i can't now we got another

632
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,240
ration that's alfalfa had seven pounds

633
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,159
corn grain 11.5 and then because we're

634
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,200
not feeding enough alfalfa hay and quite

635
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,679
a bit of corn grain

636
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,559
we need to add a provide and a protein

637
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,799
supplement

638
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,679
and it's going to have extra calcium in

639
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,760
it as well

640
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,039
so it's going to be 1.5 pounds of that

641
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,520
particular feed and then we're going to

642
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:14,159
get a 3.1 pound a day gain it's gonna

643
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,760
cost us 46 cents per pound to gain

644
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,520
if we tweak this ration a little bit

645
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,080
more and decrease the alfalfa hay and

646
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,520
increase the corn grain a couple pounds

647
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,760
i will get a little bit better gain at

648
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:27,840
3.4 and our feed costs are now down to

649
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,840
42 cents

650
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,200
well now let's do another ration using

651
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:39,039
grass hay and distillers greens

652
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,440
15 grass hay 5 pounds of distillers feed

653
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,280
cost

654
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,799
is going to be almost 550 cents per

655
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,559
pound a gain

656
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,720
if you look at grass hay corn grain and

657
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,880
distillers we're at 38 cents and if we

658
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,720
look at grass hay corn grain distillers

659
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,000
and limestone because we're feeding

660
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,159
quite a bit of distilleries and quite a

661
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,440
bit of grain and and we're not getting

662
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,640
calcium anywhere else but it's got to

663
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,000
come from limestone all of a sudden

664
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,840
we're at 35 cents

665
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,440
we've got quite a spread going on here

666
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:06,720
at cost of gains

667
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,720
anywhere from 50 cents down to 35 cents

668
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,320
and when you're doing your budgets uh

669
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,480
this certainly comes into a

670
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,080
consideration of what type of

671
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,159
profit you'll make because if you're

672
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,520
paying for feed and not getting gain

673
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,120
you need to be careful of how you're

674
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,039
doing things now we should talk about

675
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,799
rates of gain in cattle

676
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,480
low rates again are considered less than

677
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,960
two pounds a day gain that works quite

678
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,320
well for

679
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,480
cattle that are going to be heading for

680
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:31,679
grass cattle it also works quite well

681
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,280
for replacement heifers

682
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,440
we don't need to have a replacement

683
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,960
heifer away 1300 pounds when she goes

684
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,520
out on grass she's probably gonna go

685
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,360
backwards

686
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,279
lose weight if that's the case but if

687
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,799
you have her 1.8 pounds a day gained

688
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,600
throughout the whole winter and going up

689
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,520
the

690
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,080
breeding season she'll be in good

691
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:51,440
condition away the appropriate rate

692
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:53,120
um roughly heifers should weigh eighty

693
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,760
percent of mature weight at their first

694
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,919
calving

695
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,880
and eighty percent of their first

696
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,080
calving weight

697
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,919
at breeding so um

698
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,120
we're looking at an eight to nine weight

699
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,440
steer

700
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,200
excuse me heifer when it gets to be

701
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,320
breeding time and a lot of times if you

702
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,440
do the back math

703
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:14,080
here 150

704
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,840
180 days on feed at a pound and a half a

705
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,679
day will give us

706
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,200
enough weight on these heifers to make

707
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,679
them into breeding season without

708
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,200
spending too much money on feed and

709
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,480
getting them too fleshy because we are

710
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,159
inventorying them

711
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,919
until they're breedable and ready to go

712
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,679
out to grass

713
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,120
if you're looking to grow cattle without

714
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:34,000
adding too much condition

715
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,679
and conditions referred to as fat two to

716
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,760
three pound average daily gain is where

717
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:40,240
we look at

718
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,840
three pounds a day for sixty days as

719
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,840
compared to

720
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,240
um two pounds a day for a hundred days

721
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,400
uh

722
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,600
different ways to grow cattle remember

723
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:53,120
if you feed them really

724
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,919
heavy um you might end up with fleshy

725
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,679
cattle which

726
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,760
leads us to the next light rate which

727
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,120
should be greater than three pounds per

728
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,200
day average daily gain that's almost

729
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,279
what we call a finishing ration

730
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,799
and it really would be we can feed it to

731
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,320
young calves have just been weaned

732
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,640
they're just going to get fat

733
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,360
at an earlier age and if you're looking

734
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,120
to get them

735
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,480
harvested less than a year of age this

736
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,279
might be the way to do it

737
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,039
however feedlights feedlots like to buy

738
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,240
cattle that have not been fed at these

739
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,400
higher rates again

740
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,600
because it might reduce subsequent

741
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,320
feedlot performance

742
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,720
however some cattle are genetically

743
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,320
disposed to gain well even without any

744
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,600
loss of performance

745
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,120
and can grow and grade extremely well

746
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,480
even if they're fed at higher rates of

747
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,919
gain so if you know what type of animals

748
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,400
you have you might be able to get this

749
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,440
by

750
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,640
get by with this and it works quite well

751
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,919
especially if you're looking to get

752
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,279
animals and you can feed them on your

753
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:45,039
own farm until finish

754
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,640
this is something that we do routinely

755
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:49,120
on calves that are brought in

756
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,159
weighing 5 600 pounds and trying to be

757
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,320
sold at

758
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,600
11 to 12 months of age which can be done

759
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,799
it just needs to be pushed

760
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,080
you need to look at the historical

761
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,960
performance of the cattle what type of

762
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,320
cattle they are

763
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,919
they'll give you insight of how you want

764
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,720
to manage these of course the next piece

765
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,320
of the puzzle is

766
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,919
what is the market price going to be at

767
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,679
the time that you're looking to sell

768
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:08,240
these cattle

769
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,039
and usually most of our spring-borne

770
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,960
calves get

771
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:12,159
fed to be dead come the summer of the

772
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,320
next year

773
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,240
and that's usually when the market low

774
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,200
is so we try to background cattle or

775
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,799
feed cattle

776
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,880
to avoid marketing them into that

777
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:23,679
particular time frame

778
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,880
otherwise we end up getting a lower

779
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:26,480
price

780
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,640
so we can target calf gain with a

781
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,480
balanced ration

782
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,919
i always think of a balanced rational we

783
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,960
have adequate amounts of energy and

784
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,760
protein

785
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,039
to give us our better gains and feed

786
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,640
efficiency

787
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,640
but when we're looking at a target

788
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,640
weight i think about that

789
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,840
as being the ideal issue of

790
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,600
backgrounding

791
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,120
so we wean calves we want to feed them

792
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,840
for two months so we can get them sold

793
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,000
after the first

794
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,440
year we might have three pounds average

795
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,200
day the gainers are go

796
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,520
home that'd be 180 pounds in these

797
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,360
calves

798
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,200
or we might be looking at selling these

799
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,799
calves six months from now into the

800
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,039
grass cattle market

801
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:04,559
that would be come april and people be

802
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,159
looking for those calves there's usually

803
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,640
quite a price for

804
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,640
green type calves and green i mean under

805
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,200
flesh calves that time of the year

806
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,600
and uh 1.5 as your average daily gain

807
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,039
for 120 days is going to be 180 pounds

808
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,600
so in these two scenarios

809
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:21,279
we feed for 180 pounds but we certainly

810
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:26,559
changed the market window

811
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:26,559
by quite a bit

812
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,559
and of course different market windows

813
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,559
can lead to different prices

814
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,320
you can source core product feeds in

815
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,159
different locations

816
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,240
uh there is an info sheet on this

817
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:43,840
website that

818
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,880
shows where there is selected prices of

819
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,120
co-products

820
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,360
that are produced in north dakota with

821
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:51,840
phone numbers and a spot market price

822
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:54,080
available there

823
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,919
let me just note that we can contract

824
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:59,120
feed prices to cattle

825
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,520
and they're usually low during the

826
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,159
summer

827
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,679
times and if you can put in if you can

828
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,399
estimate what your need is for the fall

829
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,240
time

830
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:07,520
uh you can probably get into a contract

831
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,120
at that lower price

832
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,399
rather than waiting for the spot price

833
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,200
and it usually gets higher after the

834
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:14,159
first year

835
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,480
whenever people start feeding big issue

836
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,200
is

837
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,600
when it comes to feeding co-products is

838
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,200
how far the freight

839
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,520
how far you are away from the plant or

840
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:26,240
in other words how much freight there is

841
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:28,240
some people haul a wet product hundreds

842
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,360
of miles and i always have to do the

843
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,720
math and wonder why

844
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,720
they are doing that there must be other

845
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,720
reasons other than cost to feed

846
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,240
maybe they're looking for a wet product

847
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,919
maybe they've got a trucker or somebody

848
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,760
they're trying to keep in business

849
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,960
the the real issue though is we can't

850
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,080
afford to haul wet

851
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:46,399
feed too far because the high price of

852
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,720
of uh trucking after a while it gets to

853
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:50,480
be cheaper to haul dry product

854
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,039
if we're hauling it it's even cheaper if

855
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:56,720
we raise it on our own farm

856
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,720
and produce it that way

857
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,960
usually for background in cattle we look

858
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,960
for high fiber feeds

859
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,799
and a lot of these coke products are

860
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,080
high in protein as well

861
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,840
a lot of our hays are usually a little

862
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,000
bit lower in protein so by

863
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,679
adding in a co-product it mixes well

864
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,159
with our haste increase the protein

865
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,159
sources

866
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,600
ladies uh think about good feed bunk

867
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,799
management good feeding management for

868
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,720
your calves

869
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,559
this is the opportunity for you to train

870
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,240
them and how to develop their behavior

871
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:28,559
of eating out of a feed punk

872
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,520
when to eat develop their routine and

873
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,360
that'll stay with them

874
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,559
so far mother has been doing the mother

875
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,320
cow has been doing that

876
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:36,240
to the calf they graze the morning craze

877
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,880
at night now it's your opportunity

878
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,039
to train these cattle and how they are

879
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,640
going to be fed

880
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,480
we don't want to just keep the feed

881
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,320
bunks full that means they can eat

882
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,919
whenever they want to which we do want

883
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,880
is to have the feed bunks

884
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,760
filled to what the animal's intake will

885
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,520
be for the day

886
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,840
and then we put in new feed for what

887
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:58,960
their intake will be the following day

888
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:01,120
try to have the bunks cleaned up we

889
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,240
usually practice what i call slick bunk

890
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,919
philosophy

891
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,440
that's where when you come out to feed

892
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,799
in the morning their bunk should be

893
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,240
all slicked up cattle have eaten

894
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:09,919
everything they need and now they're

895
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:13,200
ready to eat more

896
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:15,360
and please practice that one of the

897
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,880
big issues we run into is when you have

898
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,120
variable intake

899
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,399
eat a bunch today not so hungry tomorrow

900
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,039
and then they eat a bunch on the second

901
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,480
third day

902
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,640
not so hungry they eat a bunch more on

903
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,159
the fifth day in doing so creates kind

904
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,279
of a yo-yo effect

905
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:31,120
and the animal's steady-state condition

906
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:33,600
and room and fermentation

907
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,640
goes haywire and the cattle are not as

908
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,120
efficient

909
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,760
in digesting that food as compared to

910
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,799
having

911
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:42,240
a meal every day at the same time don't

912
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,840
forget bedding we've done research at

913
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,200
the carrington research extension center

914
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,600
that shows where bedding can

915
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,480
improve average daily gain in these

916
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,440
calves

917
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,039
and uh and it's not because they're

918
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,360
eating the bedding it's because

919
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:56,159
it's a nicer environment for them to lay

920
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,559
on

921
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,360
water should be kept clean so cattle

922
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,760
will be readily

923
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,200
willing to drink it try to reduce the

924
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,960
amount of mold you feed the cattle

925
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,960
if you do feed it you'll notice there

926
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,320
will be digestive upsets especially in

927
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,799
these young calves that are just

928
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,720
developing onto a new ration

929
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:14,240
you can keep cattle healthy whether it

930
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,919
means antibiotics in the feed with a

931
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,440
veterinary feed directive

932
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:19,440
or working them through a shoot and

933
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,519
giving antibiotics if they're snotty or

934
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,279
just brief vaccinations there's a lot of

935
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,080
things you can do to keep cattle healthy

936
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:27,279
and when healthy

937
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:30,320
cattle are healthy they consume

938
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:31,039
lots of feed and grow very well adapt to

939
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,840
ration

940
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:35,840
slowly in other words we start with a

941
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,600
step up ration one that's higher in

942
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,000
forage and lower in

943
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,039
energy content and as the cattle are

944
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,440
filled up we

945
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:44,559
after three or four days or a week or

946
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,799
two weeks we

947
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:48,320
bump them up to a higher energy ration a

948
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,279
step up ration that would have a little

949
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,360
bit more

950
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:53,120
grain in it and then we might do that

951
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,919
two or three times depending upon

952
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:57,440
what our goal for rates of gains are we

953
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,720
just don't dump a whole bunch of grain

954
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,399
out there and hopefully they don't get

955
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,840
acidosis and die on you

956
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:03,679
that certainly is something that can

957
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,279
happen so that's why balanced

958
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,519
rations and step up rations are

959
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:10,320
certainly utilized by nutritionists

960
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:12,080
and it works quite well the old thumb

961
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,519
rule way of feeding is you give them a

962
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,600
couple pounds of grain

963
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,120
along with all the hay they want to eat

964
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,720
and then in two days we give them a

965
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,080
couple pounds of grain and another half

966
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,600
a pound of grain

967
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:25,440
and do that plus a full feet of hay

968
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,880
we do that for a few days and when

969
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,000
they're adapted to that rash then we

970
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,840
increase it again by another

971
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,159
half a pound for two days and keep

972
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:34,159
moving up the grain part of the ration

973
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,519
until the cattle have matched your

974
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:37,360
target goal

975
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,200
ration that you're using for whatever

976
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,200
gain it is we're looking for

977
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,480
again balance ration there's lots of

978
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,480
feed nutritionists

979
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,519
whether it be your county extension

980
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:50,240
agent or a feed company

981
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,760
that provides this service there's lots

982
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,799
of ways to put together rations for

983
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,360
cattle

984
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:56,000
and let's not forget there are the

985
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,159
things that can

986
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,080
prove feed efficiencies in cattle

987
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,000
ionophores remits in their bulb attack

988
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,880
can improve feed efficiency

989
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,039
by five to seven percent implants the

990
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,919
ear implants can increase average daily

991
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:10,080
gain

992
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,679
because there are steroid that'll in and

993
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,480
they can increase it by five to seven

994
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,880
percent

995
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,200
and your feed per pound of gain can be

996
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,039
improved by five to twelve percent

997
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,720
these things can also control

998
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:24,000
coccidiosis

999
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,840
um if you ever run into coccidiosis

1000
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,200
outbreak in a group of cattle you'll

1001
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,440
wish that never happened

1002
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,960
and you will do anything in the future

1003
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,279
to prevent that from happening

1004
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,159
and use the onofores or declinate or

1005
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:37,120
co-rid

1006
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:39,039
our options to our feed things that we

1007
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:41,200
can add to the feed

1008
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:43,360
to prevent coccidiosis of course

1009
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,320
coccidiosis is usually an opportunistic

1010
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,120
type thing that

1011
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,320
always develops after a stress so if you

1012
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,240
have a blizzard

1013
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,080
that would be a stress cold weather can

1014
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,039
be a stress co-mingling cavity others

1015
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,080
new stress

1016
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:57,600
just being lean can be a stress so pack

1017
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,519
all these stresses on top of each other

1018
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,679
and coccidiosis might break out

1019
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,919
especially if you make a diet change or

1020
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:06,960
a ration changes iron energy

1021
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:09,119
that can lead to an additional stress so

1022
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,879
only one stress at a time don't stack

1023
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:13,040
them up and make them endure and then

1024
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:14,720
you end up with a health issue

1025
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,960
well in summary here let me just say

1026
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,879
that it looks like feed prices are

1027
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,040
higher this year

1028
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:22,480
as true this year is in other years

1029
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,079
higher average yearly gains

1030
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,839
usually have a lower cost per pound of

1031
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,520
gain

1032
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:29,760
we have lots of options out here in

1033
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,520
developing rations we tend to always use

1034
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,639
distillers grains and rations because of

1035
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,320
where it's priced

1036
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,480
and the availability and it is quite

1037
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,679
availability quite available

1038
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,240
but there are other feeds that are

1039
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,000
available out here too and we can use

1040
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,520
those if that's what you need

1041
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,040
co-products are usually higher in

1042
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,280
protein and fiber

1043
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,800
and actually work into a background

1044
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,040
ration very well

1045
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,960
in a finishing ration maybe not so much

1046
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:55,520
because they just don't have the overall

1047
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,399
energy density to be included at a high

1048
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,400
rate in the

1049
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:00,160
in the ration but certainly a smaller

1050
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,520
percentage could work

1051
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:06,560
and again your management in feeding

1052
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,920
goes a long way to good calf gains if

1053
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,000
they're used to being fed at

1054
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,599
eight o'clock in the morning keep them

1055
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,200
fed every morning at eight o'clock

1056
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:15,119
making different changes going a little

1057
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,960
bit earlier going a little bit later

1058
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:25,599
all leads to behavioral changes in

1059
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:25,599
cattle that can lead to poorer gains
