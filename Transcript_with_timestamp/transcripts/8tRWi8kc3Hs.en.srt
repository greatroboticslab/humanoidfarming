00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:06,240
hi there and welcome to the channel

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:08,800
so it's an exciting day here down in my

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,599
uh growing room because it is time to

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,240
start planting tomatoes

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,800
indoors getting them ready for the

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,920
outdoor garden so i think starting

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,680
tomatoes indoors is one of my favorite

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,519
indoor starts

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,920
i find that they are

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,760
one of the easiest things to to get

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,320
growing indoors

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,239
so this year i am going to do things a

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,680
little differently

14
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:35,760
first of all i'm going to try a

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,840
different method of

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,120
starting these tomatoes and this is

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:44,640
something that i seen done on a channel

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,440
called next level gardening so brian is

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,000
the

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,320
host of that channel he is down in

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,480
southern california which is a

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,280
a very different growing zone than here

23
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,920
on saskatchewan prairies

24
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,680
i'm sure his zone must be around eight

25
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,239
or nine

26
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,400
of course here in saskatchewan we are in

27
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,439
zone three which is a very cold growing

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,760
zone

29
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,439
but a lot of the the methods that brian

30
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,840
shows on his channel

31
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,880
you know work in in various growing

32
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,280
zones

33
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,680
and i was really interested about this

34
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,600
technique that he showed on

35
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,799
how to start tomatoes

36
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,799
and create a very strong tomato with

37
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,720
very strong roots

38
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,280
that hopefully will give you a better

39
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,720
harvest at the end of the day

40
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,400
so that's one thing different that i'm

41
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,159
going to be doing this year

42
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,240
another thing that i'm going to try

43
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,439
doing this year is starting less

44
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,560
tomatoes

45
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,799
i always find that you know you if i

46
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,520
start them in smaller cells i'll have

47
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,360
like six of one kind six of another kind

48
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,040
six of another kind

49
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,040
just because you're not sure which ones

50
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,880
will germinate and then you have really

51
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,840
good germination

52
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,920
and they grow well and you just you know

53
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,799
don't end up getting rid of any and you

54
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,439
plant them all up into bigger containers

55
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:06,320
and you know six to eight weeks later

56
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:09,440
your whole countertop in the garage is

57
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,680
covered with tomatoes plus all the other

58
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,360
vegetables and flowers that i like to

59
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,520
start indoors

60
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,280
so i've told myself this year that i'm

61
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,760
going to limit

62
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,360
the amount of each variety that i'm

63
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,160
going to start

64
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,080
but i do have seven different varieties

65
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,640
that i want to try this year

66
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,360
so i'm going to be just starting

67
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:34,800
two seeds of each variety

68
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,480
in these red solo cups so that means

69
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,319
i only have seven

70
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,680
starts going here

71
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,920
and my hope is that these tomato plants

72
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,120
can stay in these red solo cups right

73
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,000
from the time they sprout until they are

74
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,280
ready to go out in the garden

75
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,599
so

76
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,800
looking at it this way

77
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:59,360
if all goes well and i get seven

78
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,159
plants going this is the only space that

79
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,159
they're going to take up

80
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,720
so getting back to this technique that

81
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,440
brian uh talks about on his channel it

82
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,319
is all about starting your tomato

83
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,519
in a

84
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:16,239
solo cup like this or a container uh

85
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,879
similar to this size it could be like a

86
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,840
four inch uh container

87
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,760
and

88
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,640
what he does is he only fills the

89
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,400
container up about halfway

90
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,280
plants the seeds

91
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,799
and lets the tomato germinate and grow

92
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,400
and as it grows

93
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,000
just to keep adding

94
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,640
soil around

95
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,400
the stem of the tomato

96
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,840
and the reason for that is because

97
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,080
tomatoes

98
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,959
as long as you bury their stem

99
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,040
all those little tiny hairs that i will

100
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,640
show you up close here in a minute will

101
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,080
turn into roots

102
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:55,599
so the theory behind this is as the

103
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,720
tomato grows we keep covering the stem

104
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,799
it shoots out more roots so by the time

105
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,760
this is ready to go into the ground you

106
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,920
have a very solid root ball

107
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,239
on a very strong plant

108
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,400
and hopefully we'll have a very good

109
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,080
harvest at the end of the season so here

110
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,200
on the saskatchewan prairies we have a

111
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,000
very short outdoor growing season

112
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,440
that

113
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,639
is usually approximately 110 days from

114
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,800
in between the two frost dates

115
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,639
so tomatoes are one of those things that

116
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,759
you have to start indoors there's just

117
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,440
no way you would ever be able to start

118
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,320
them outdoors

119
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,639
and i usually do them about

120
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,160
six to eight weeks prior to the last

121
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,639
frost date

122
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,800
here our last frost date is about the

123
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,560
third week of may

124
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,800
and for tomatoes i

125
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,800
personally usually wait a little bit

126
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,600
longer than that

127
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,440
last frost date and go with pretty much

128
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,600
the first week of june

129
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,160
i've had a lot of

130
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,880
experience with late frosts

131
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,639
coming at the end of may early june so i

132
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,160
consider myself just a small scale

133
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,960
gardener i don't grow a huge amount of

134
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,880
any type of vegetable for the purpose of

135
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,880
canning or

136
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,560
saving it for the winter being that i

137
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,520
work full time and have other hobbies

138
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,919
that i enjoy doing i try not to

139
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,440
grow too much of anything i want to be

140
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,680
able to just enjoy it throughout the

141
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,240
summer and into the fall

142
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,160
and any tomatoes that i do end up with

143
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,000
at the end of the season that doesn't

144
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,800
look like we're going to be able to eat

145
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,680
fresh you know i will do some freezing

146
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,520
but

147
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,919
for the most part i just like to grow

148
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,440
different varieties i like the cherry

149
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,720
type tomatoes i like the beef steaks and

150
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,560
i've been

151
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,639
very lucky to get a whole bunch of

152
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,320
different kinds of tomato seeds through

153
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:53,120
a seed exchange here in canada and i'm

154
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,199
pretty excited to try all of these and

155
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,960
see how they turn out

156
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,280
and because we do have a short growing

157
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,160
season here it's always good to try and

158
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,160
find tomatoes that have a shorter

159
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,160
growing period such as

160
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,520
this one here this is called the

161
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:12,240
roadster tomato but i received this from

162
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,960
dean scott birchwood builders is his

163
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,639
youtube channel he's in alberta

164
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:20,160
he sent these to me

165
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:22,960
they are a large meaty flavorful

166
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,880
determinate tomato so when i looked them

167
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,280
up online they're kind of a bigger one

168
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,639
it's a nice slicing tomato be great for

169
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,560
sandwiches

170
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:34,639
and these have a 65 days to maturity so

171
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,039
what that means is when these get

172
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,800
transplanted into the ground

173
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:42,080
you should have

174
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,759
tomatoes 65 days later so if i get these

175
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,600
into the ground

176
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,600
early june that means that i should have

177
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,520
some tomatoes before the

178
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,440
end of july

179
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,800
hickory crop farms is another youtube

180
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,199
channel that i do a lot of seed

181
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,440
exchanging with they are located in

182
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,800
ontario and they have sent me three

183
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,000
different kinds of

184
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:05,520
tomato seeds that i am excited to try

185
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,800
this one's called the palestinian tomato

186
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,440
it has a

187
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,880
longer maturity date so it says

188
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:15,440
85 to 100 days so that that is really

189
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,360
pushing it for saskatchewan

190
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,360
so it will be interesting to see if i

191
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,599
can get some of these

192
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,840
these are also a beef steak tomato but

193
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,759
they are an indeterminate variety which

194
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,400
means that they will keep growing and

195
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,400
producing all summer long until until

196
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,639
they die or

197
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,639
usually till the frost comes

198
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,680
the other one that they gave me was a

199
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:40,319
white tomasol tomato which again was a

200
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,160
very interesting looking tomato to me

201
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,960
it is also a

202
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:48,960
indeterminate variety it has a long

203
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:51,520
maturity date as well of 80 days

204
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,879
so we will see how those go

205
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,639
i also got a bush beefsteak determinant

206
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,400
from

207
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,879
plowman's backyard

208
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,520
youtube channel check it out

209
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,400
so this is a determinate short season

210
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,560
type tomato so i like that it's only 62

211
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,440
days to maturity

212
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,759
so the determinate tomatoes will only

213
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,960
grow so high usually about three or four

214
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,960
feet tall

215
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,280
they will bloom produce their fruit and

216
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,879
then they're done

217
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,919
this is one i'm very excited about

218
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,560
because i love sun gold cherry tomatoes

219
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:29,199
and i got these also from

220
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,280
dean at birchwood builders he sent me

221
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,760
some of those after i was asking for

222
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:37,599
them on a seed exchange video they have

223
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:39,680
a short growing season of 60 to 65 days

224
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,399
and he wrote on here that they are

225
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,560
yellow

226
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:46,880
sweet juicy and you can't eat just one

227
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,839
so looking forward to those

228
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:53,120
this is from heritage harvest seeds they

229
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:56,240
are located in manitoba

230
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:59,120
and this is called a pink ping pong

231
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,080
tomato so it is an indeterminate cherry

232
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,120
tomato

233
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,640
it's got a 75 day to maturity

234
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,800
period so

235
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,279
should see something from these you know

236
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,120
early august

237
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,120
this one doesn't really

238
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,760
qualify as a tomato but i'm going to be

239
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,080
planting it with my tomatoes anyway

240
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,480
another one from hickory crop farms it's

241
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,399
aunt molly's ground cherries these kind

242
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,959
of interests me i've seen a lot of

243
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,800
videos of people growing them i've seen

244
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,880
a lot of mixed reviews

245
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,279
from people as to whether they like them

246
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,040
or not but just a very interesting

247
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,320
looking plant that i'm going to try

248
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,360
growing

249
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:41,120
and we will see how they go so these are

250
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:43,760
70 days to maturity from transplant

251
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,120
so we will add this to my variety here

252
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,880
today

253
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,000
so i think i have a good variety i have

254
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:52,720
a few determinant type i have a few that

255
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,920
will be the larger beefsteak kind of

256
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,600
tomato

257
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,240
and i also have a couple of the cherry

258
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,800
varieties so i'm very excited to get

259
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,560
them planted here and show you

260
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,959
my method that i'm going to be following

261
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,800
so i think because i'm only going to be

262
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:10,320
starting one of each of these containers

263
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,839
i'm going to be

264
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,760
putting three seeds into each just to

265
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:19,560
ensure that i have

266
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,560
successful germination

267
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,519
i'm trying to just plant them close to

268
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,200
the center here because i know i'm only

269
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,839
going to be keeping one in here

270
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,839
something that brian also on his video

271
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,160
that i was watching used instead of

272
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:35,440
putting some more seed starting mix on

273
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,920
the top of the soil he used vermiculite

274
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,560
which i have been doing for

275
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,320
my other indoor starts the vericulite is

276
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,560
supposed to help prevent

277
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,680
damping off and

278
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,240
fungus gnats getting into your soil here

279
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,200
so with my seed starting mix here i also

280
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,240
add

281
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,600
boiling water to it to moisten the soil

282
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,200
and to kind of give it a bit of extra

283
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,040
sterilization to prevent

284
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,440
fungus gnats in case there happens to be

285
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,440
some eggs in the soil

286
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,320
it's just a little extra measure i like

287
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,160
to use just to help prevent the fungus

288
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,480
gnats getting into your

289
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,480
dirt in your house which is a can be a

290
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,640
real pain

291
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,440
so this is how it's going to look after

292
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,760
the

293
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,000
initial planting so i have put three

294
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,480
seeds in there put a light layer of

295
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,640
vermiculite on the top

296
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,200
with these red solo cups i've just taken

297
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,200
scissors and made a few little slits at

298
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,200
the bottom so that it has drainage and

299
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,279
somewhere for the roots to go because

300
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,560
i'm pretty sure by the time these are

301
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,680
ready to go outdoors they're going to

302
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,720
have roots

303
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,480
shooting out the bottom

304
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,720
so here's what the beefsteak tomato

305
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,600
looks like about i think it's been

306
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,839
almost a month since i planted these so

307
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,360
i have the cup filled halfway

308
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,560
planted them up

309
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,639
and now to take advantage of

310
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,040
this special

311
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,800
thing that tomatoes have

312
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,200
if you can see all those tiny little

313
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,160
fibers that are on the stem of a tomato

314
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,880
those

315
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,000
will turn into roots if you cover them

316
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,519
with soil

317
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,160
so this is the

318
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,800
technique that we are going to use today

319
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,040
i'm going to remove

320
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,519
those first two leaves

321
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:23,399
and this one as well

322
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,399
and this one here

323
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,519
so it doesn't look like you're left with

324
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
much but once we

325
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,000
top it up with soil right up to here

326
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,040
all these tiny little fibers that you

327
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,839
can see are going to turn into roots

328
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,200
and this will keep growing

329
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,399
upwards so then by the time we have this

330
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,240
in the garden this is going to be a

331
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,040
really nice strong

332
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,040
tomato plant

333
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,600
so this is what he looks like once he's

334
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:58,320
got another layer of soil he's still got

335
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,079
a lot of nice leaves here

336
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,160
growing and

337
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,880
as i said the stem that we just covered

338
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,920
up

339
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,600
will

340
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:09,200
shoot out a bunch more roots

341
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,920
so i'm just going to put this back under

342
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,920
the grow lights

343
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,839
so one thing that i just got thinking

344
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,000
about with these ground cherries is that

345
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,959
they don't have the same

346
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,720
special

347
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,680
properties that the tomatoes have where

348
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,880
their

349
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,120
stems

350
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,399
will shoot out roots if you bury them at

351
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,160
least not that i

352
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:32,560
read anywhere

353
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,560
so i'm going to fill this container

354
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,839
up all the way

355
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:46,839
just put about

356
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,839
four or five seeds

357
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:54,079
like i said i don't have a lot of

358
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,079
knowledge of ground cherries just a few

359
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,720
uh youtube videos i watched i would love

360
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:01,040
to hear anybody's comments on their

361
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,040
experiences with these like i said i it

362
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:06,560
seems like a really mixed reviews on

363
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,560
whether people like them or not

364
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,279
so to start these off i'm going to be

365
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,440
using this heat mat

366
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,199
it's not totally necessary to use one

367
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,560
but if you have one it's a good a good

368
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:21,120
way to to help kind of jump start the uh

369
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:25,519
this germination i'm going to put these

370
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,519
cups directly onto the mat for now

371
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,040
and just

372
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,839
keep them moist by spritzing the tops of

373
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,839
them

374
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,440
and i do have

375
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,600
a container all ready to put these into

376
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,519
once they get sprouting and i have them

377
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,320
under the lights that i can bottom water

378
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,839
them

379
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,040
directly into this tray

380
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,720
so i'm not going to have a grow light

381
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,279
going on them right now until they

382
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,279
germinate

383
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,000
if you have some kind of a dome type

384
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:01,279
thing that you can use

385
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,160
i always just use a plastic bag because

386
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:06,480
it's easy to maneuver and fit over any

387
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,240
sizes of cups that i

388
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,240
am working on here so i'm just going to

389
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,480
keep the plastic on here

390
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,279
until i start seeing germination

391
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,519
which

392
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,680
according to most of these packages is

393
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,839
within seven to ten days

394
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,600
i have found with tomatoes

395
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,680
that i've growing indoors that they do

396
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,279
germinate a lot quicker than that

397
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,480
sometimes within four days i see

398
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,920
germination

399
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,800
so once i have

400
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,839
a germination happening on all of these

401
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,920
i will

402
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,079
take off the plastic and

403
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,759
turn on the grow light maybe move them

404
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,079
up a little bit closer

405
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,759
so we'll just keep monitoring that so

406
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:45,680
that's pretty much all there is to

407
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:47,600
starting tomatoes indoors and i will be

408
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,160
starting a lot more things over the next

409
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:53,040
few weeks as we get closer to that lost

410
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,360
last frost date so i hope you will keep

411
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,360
watching if you haven't already done so
