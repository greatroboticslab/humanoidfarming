1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,240
when we think of farmers what image

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,759
comes to mind

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:10,400
chances are it's a man

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,759
but did you know that many rice farmers

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,320
are women

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,920
aside from being mothers and wives they

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,920
are farmers too

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,920
at least 500 million women around the

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,720
world are engaged in rice cultivation

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,320
women account for 47 of the global

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,880
agricultural labor

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,840
however 87 of women's agricultural labor

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,960
is unpaid

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,040
and unrecognized the role of women in

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,480
farming families varies in different

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,120
parts of the world

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,600
in sub-saharan africa and in south asia

18
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,520
women

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,039
are perceived to play supporting roles

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,399
and do not participate in

21
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,480
decision-making

22
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,960
while women in southeast asian countries

23
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,000
enjoy less restrictive social and gender

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,480
norms

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,920
women farmers have insufficient access

26
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,399
to farming resources

27
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,000
technologies and opportunities which are

28
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,000
mainly geared toward men

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,840
farmers in the philippines

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,960
women comprise around 26 of agricultural

31
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,119
workers

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,960
the country is the eighth largest rice

33
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,000
producer in the world

34
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:23,200
in 2019 the philippines grew more than

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,920
13 million metric tons of rice

36
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,960
producing rice is not an easy task

37
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,479
farmers start

38
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:33,119
working before sunup and endure

39
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:36,159
long hours under the sun to provide us

40
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,960
with our staple source of energy

41
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,799
despite this farmers are still among the

42
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,720
poorest in the country

43
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,640
they posted the highest poverty

44
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,240
incidents among the basic sectors in the

45
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,439
recent years

46
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,560
being a farmer is hard enough but

47
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,600
being a woman in a farming family can be

48
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,360
harder

49
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,920
around 35 of filipino women farmers

50
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,280
render

51
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,880
unpaid work 6 out of 10 unpaid women

52
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,000
family workers in the country

53
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,239
operate in the agriculture sector one of

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,200
the fundamental problems is that women

55
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,680
are not commonly recognized as farmers

56
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,200
their farm work is seen as an extension

57
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,160
of their duties at home

58
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,400
women's unpaid farm labor adds to their

59
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,200
burden of being the family's primary

60
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,400
caregiver

61
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,879
and homemaker to add to this

62
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,000
women generally have limited access to

63
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,319
resources

64
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
learning opportunities and farming

65
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,840
technologies

66
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,160
this hinders women from reaching their

67
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,519
full potential and locks them in a cycle

68
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,879
of low productivity

69
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:43,120
and poverty women in farming families

70
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,680
need support to work on the farm in a

71
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,680
way that

72
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,879
recognizes their other roles in the

73
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,959
family

74
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,120
programs and policies should recognize

75
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,560
women's role in agriculture and create

76
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,319
conditions that would make their

77
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,080
engagement beneficial

78
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,920
these can be realized through learning

79
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,560
and training opportunities and

80
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,640
credit facilities or financial products

81
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,560
that can help run their farms or

82
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,879
run farms single-handedly in more

83
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,560
efficient and effective ways

84
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,800
an enabling environment for women

85
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,319
farmers will help them access tools and

86
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,800
training to increase their productivity

87
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,200
this is the first step towards realizing

88
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,680
women's potential to be change agents in

89
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,599
their communities

90
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,680
women managing farms and making

91
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,400
decisions means higher income for

92
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,200
farming families

93
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,400
more resources and better access to

94
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,920
basic services like

95
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,840
education and healthcare this will give

96
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,319
farming families a fighting chance

97
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,799

opportunities to better their lives

100
