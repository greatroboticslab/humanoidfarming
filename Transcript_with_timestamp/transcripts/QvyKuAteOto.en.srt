1
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:30,420
turn this um what's on this in this

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,610
field here done this is sweet potatoes

3
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:38,830
that we had just planted okay we planted

4
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:40,780
solve them a week ago and then the ones

5
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:44,739
that are being irrigated now we planted

6
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,940
yesterday okay and it's very important

7
00:00:44,739 --> 00:00:47,920
that you don't get rain after your

8
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:50,559
planting too if you don't have

9
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,230
irrigation it's it makes it real

10
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,659
difficult for the weather the plants get

11
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:58,120
a established after your clowns

12
00:00:55,659 --> 00:01:00,640
you got your tractor hooked up to a pump

13
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,489
it's hooked up to a water pump that runs

14
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:09,970
out up on a PTO okay power take-off

15
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:12,790
power take-off okay and it it produces

16
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:15,360
about a hundred and ten gallons a lot of

17
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,360
a minute

18
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:33,509
you can use that for takeoff for any

19
00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:33,509
number of things right

20
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:39,799
most anything with applications at the

21
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:39,799
track

22
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:45,360
if it requires a PPO

23
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:45,360
adapted to

24
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,150
and that thing actually moves is that

25
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:59,250
correct you've got it on our cable and

26
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:02,430
it yeah it went is itself across the

27
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:06,900
field that's why they call it a water

28
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:09,270
that's a water winch okay they drag the

29
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:11,160
hose behind it and we hook it to a tree

30
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:15,260
and it winches itself across the field

31
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:18,209
nice got three different views on it and

32
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:20,100
depending upon how dry it is Oh as far

33
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:21,600
as the speed goes I like the speed go so

34
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,580
that's how you regulate how much water

35
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,010
you put down as by how fast it it

36
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,050
winches across right it's got one two

37
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:32,989
and three and if I put it in the fastest

38
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:32,989
Gill I can put out half an inch of a non

39
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:40,440
before you get any moisture so these are

40
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,330
these are no these are red potatoes what

41
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:52,110
kind of these are red potatoes can I get

42
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:54,630
you to hold those up again there you go

43
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,950
you say these are potatoes that this is

44
00:02:54,630 --> 00:03:00,390
what potatoes look like when they need a

45
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:02,579
little rain yeah see these actually if

46
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:06,239
we if we if we did not get any more rain

47
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:10,230
yeah or like let's say this crop didn't

48
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:12,269
get water anytime this week mm-hmm and

49
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:14,579
we didn't get irrigation on it then what

50
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:17,220
what happened is these small potatoes

51
00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:19,709
would size up as long as vines are still

52
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,690
green okay that's how they would size up

53
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:25,829
but that's not what you want do you want

54
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:28,739
two potatoes to size up with moisture

55
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:29,700
rather than from the vine Oh in other

56
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:31,829
words it would be taking the moisture

57
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,780
moisture out of the vine there it would

58
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:36,180
be that's and then when the vine is dead

59
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:38,850
the potatoes are done going okay I mean

60
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,109
there's at least at least a good month's

61
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:42,180
gross here

62
00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:46,410
yeah these potatoes could size this

63
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:50,100
potato being not much bigger than a

64
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:52,620
marble right would could size up to the

65
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:54,299
size of your fist by the time it's to be

66
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:58,650
harvested so that rain is really

67
00:03:54,299 --> 00:04:00,600
critical right now very critical so some

68
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,040
people go to Las Vegas to gamble and you

69
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:06,409
choose to fire my guess

70
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:08,940
that's exactly right

71
00:04:06,409 --> 00:04:13,440
well so here's the potatoes that we get

72
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:15,659
at the farmers market nice if we don't

73
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,880
get any rain if this storm misses us

74
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:19,290
tomorrow night I'll have to set up your

75
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,540
Legation over here and that's going to

76
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:23,250
take me a day over to one well at this

77
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:26,460
point every day is critical sure

78
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:28,229
brilliant so maybe maybe mother nature

79
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,919
will be kind to us tomorrow night and

80
00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:30,919
one hope so

81
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:53,030
how many feet long are these that

82
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:55,070
Greathouse is 128 feet long 128 feet

83
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:58,250
long and you've got all tomatoes in here

84
00:04:55,070 --> 00:05:00,860
all tomatoes in this box that you've got

85
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:03,050
in here what is that that box down there

86
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:06,080
is a beehive there's a beehive

87
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:07,640
it's got bumble bees in it okay and

88
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,500
that's how we pollinate the tomatoes

89
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,500
okay one

90
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:18,539
flowers flowers like this

91
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:20,699
when they open up the bee pollinates

92
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:22,889
maybe with a little luck we might see

93
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:25,110
some bees pollinating okay and then

94
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:27,479
again we may not it depends on what the

95
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:28,979
humidity is in here right in the only

96
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:31,590
pollinate when the humidity is just

97
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:32,940
right oh is that right but sometimes

98
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:36,630
you'll still see them flying around

99
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:39,090
pollinating it it looks like the more

100
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:40,800
ripe tomatoes are at the bottom is that

101
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:42,720
at the bottom and having ripe and then

102
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,120
you just

103
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,680
this would be picking this cluster next

104
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,930
week the next week if you take off of

105
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,700
this cluster this week will be taken off

106
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:52,110
of this cluster

107
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:56,160
so they're open from the bottom and then

108
00:05:52,110 --> 00:06:00,910
they keep on growing they grow up they

109
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:03,880
grow up to these schools that are

110
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:06,040
okay and if it will

111
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:08,890
you taken

112
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:11,470
let them down like that and move them to

113
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:13,660
the right that's what they call leaning

114
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:16,810
and lowering I've never heard of that

115
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:18,640
and then the vines eventually at the end

116
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:22,240
of season you'll have a big long column

117
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:24,310
of vines you can see this they've been a

118
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,830
roller to fight a few times already so

119
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:28,540
the findings are all leaning this way

120
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,620
and you've already picked the tomatoes

121
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:31,030
off the bottom

122
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:35,110
they're already been picked off the

123
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:37,240
bottom okay like some several weeks back

124
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:40,090
okay so you give them a little bit of

125
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:42,580
slack with the reel when the wheel the

126
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:45,390
right just like a domino effect and when

127
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,390
they reach the end

128
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,990
and what are they planted in their

129
00:06:50,300 --> 00:07:00,590
planet in media called pearl a pearl

130
00:06:53,990 --> 00:07:04,050
white pearl a okay it's a white media

131
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:06,380
it comes out of volcanoes

132
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:09,060
and then it felt like a vermiculite or

133
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:15,020
exactly and there's in the same family

134
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:17,300
is that it takes the place of soil okay

135
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:19,129
then how does it get watered they take

136
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,139
it out of volcanoes and then they pop it

137
00:07:19,129 --> 00:07:23,419
just like popcorn hello and then it

138
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:25,789
turns into this I didn't realize that it

139
00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:28,080
makes a good media base for soil I did

140
00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:30,690
not realize that

141
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:34,110
really holds water well and how does it

142
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:39,060
get watered two of these feed to each

143
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:40,770
tomato plant has its own feed too so

144
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,159
they have plenty of water and it's all

145
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:43,159
put out

146
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:45,919
okay

147
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,900
that's what they call cat face it can't

148
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,900
facing cat facing and it's due to cold

149
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:14,199
temperatures doing pollination

150
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:16,729
right after pollination ok so that's

151
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:20,330
that tomato was falling way back in

152
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:21,620
February very small tomato and that's

153
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:25,099
why it turned out that way

154
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:26,539
can't facing interesting so this is the

155
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:28,370
strawberry this is how we grow the

156
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:32,240
strawberries the Grauman's stack is like

157
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:36,050
this this is everbearing variety and

158
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:38,000
this another held up with pipes and then

159
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:40,729
you've got what this black pipe is what

160
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,250
water this is a feed tube and then

161
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:45,709
they're just put on stack is that we

162
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:50,390
evolve so when you're picking you can

163
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:52,730
just spin this like you can oh very

164
00:08:50,390 --> 00:09:01,070
convenient like a miniature carousel you

165
00:08:52,730 --> 00:09:03,410
might soon and here's this one that

166
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:08,990
being a burbank variety we'll see what

167
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:10,579
the summer brings i'm sure sure nice and

168
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:11,600
this is the same way we grow out greens

169
00:09:10,579 --> 00:09:13,550
for the winter time

170
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,820
oh is it right is that right winter

171
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:17,870
farmers market Oh in stackers like this

172
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:20,630
ok

173
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:24,740
this is probably this is probably

174
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:27,260
equivalent to maybe several acres of

175
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:29,060
greens outside sure because of the way

176
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:32,630
we grow this is the vertical stacking

177
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:35,770
exactly perfect and the same with the

178
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:38,810
strawberry operation sure that little

179
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:40,640
half acre of stackers is probably

180
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:42,589
equivalent to like five six acres of

181
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,870
strawberries that's amazing and the

182
00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:46,810
tomatoes the same thing Wow

183
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:50,209
same thing well would be equivalent to

184
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:51,770
well that particular house that tomatoes

185
00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:52,579
