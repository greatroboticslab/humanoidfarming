1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,120
right i think we'll make a start now uh

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,799
welcome back everyone really nice to see

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,360
you all again

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,480
and uh this is the the fourth and the

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,519
final webinar

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,679
in the series of the iedq workshop on

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,840
indigenous people's food systems

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,480
biocultural heritage and the sustainable

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,359
development goals

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,599
great so this final webinar is focusing

11
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,519
on exploring research methods

12
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,199
interdisciplinary methods and

13
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,039
decolonizing methods

14
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,800
for research on indigenous peoples food

15
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:36,000
systems

16
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,520
so we've had a very rich discussion in

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,559
the last three webinars

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,760
we've heard from many indigenous experts

19
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,680
and i would like to start by

20
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,879
highlighting some of the key points that

21
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,120
have been made

22
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,120
particularly relating to the priorities

23
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,120
for research

24
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,760
so we've heard that indigenous people's

25
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,879
food systems and biocultural heritage

26
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,079
are fundamental for indigenous people's

27
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,719
food sovereignty

28
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,760
identity spirituality health and

29
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,479
well-being

30
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:08,400
and for everyday life and that's um

31
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,520
we heard that they also play a

32
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,840
significant role

33
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,280
in the transition to sustainable food

34
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,320
systems and can make

35
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,479
important contributions to economic

36
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,880
uh national economies as we heard

37
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,159
yesterday from hindu ibrahim

38
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,400
a pastoralist from chad i think

39
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,280
a key message i've got also is that

40
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,799
there's a really

41
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,759
strong urgency um but indigenous food

42
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,159
systems

43
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,400
face many threats traditional knowledge

44
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,799
is disappearing very fast

45
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,479
and research must focus on these threats

46
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,280
and challenges and not only on the

47
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,520
indigenous food systems themselves

48
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,799
the threats include restrictions on

49
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,840
forest use

50
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,720
and resource use spread of of modern

51
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,280
agriculture

52
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,320
and modernization of cultures and

53
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,280
inappropriate

54
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,000
economic development and also education

55
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,200
western education systems

56
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
the second message that i got from

57
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,680
yesterday

58
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,479
is the critical need to do more research

59
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,520
on indigenous people's land rights

60
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,959
as hindu ibrahim explained most land

61
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,239
belongs to governments

62
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:20,319
and land that is vital for pastoralists

63
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,959
is being sold off to sedentary people

64
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,760
and that

65
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,280
is a massive threat to their indigenous

66
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,720
food system

67
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,879
we heard um also from the

68
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,879
uh representative from the arctic region

69
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:35,360
of russia

70
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,200
that the introduction of industrial

71
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,840
development has almost destroyed

72
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,480
their traditional way of life and that

73
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,959
traditional

74
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,400
food culture of hunting and fishing is

75
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,800
very close to nature

76
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,760
and that that diet is actually essential

77
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,680
for survival in that harsh climate

78
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,879
and that in response to the challenges

79
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,760
of climate change

80
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,800
and they must return to their indigenous

81
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,480
food system

82
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,159
and for this they need to preserve the

83
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,239
land

84
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,080
and we learnt that for hunter-gatherers

85
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,200
in tropical rainforests who

86
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,519
are mobile egalitarian very culturally

87
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,760
diverse

88
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,680
they are also facing many threats from

89
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,080
economic expansion and from protected

90
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,080
areas

91
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,400
so we also heard from um from the

92
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,360
academic side

93
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,200
that land rights is an issue which is

94
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,360
under-researched

95
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,120
we heard from hindu ibrahim that

96
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,560
indigenous peoples don't call it food

97
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,959
security they call it

98
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,280
food sovereignty and this is a priority

99
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,040
for research as well as food sovereignty

100
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,120
is essential to sustain indigenous

101
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,400
knowledge systems

102
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,879
and also she emphasized that maintaining

103
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,400
seven generations thinking is really

104
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,400
important

105
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,720
not only in chad but we also heard that

106
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,920
indigenous peoples in china have this

107
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,280
seven generation thinking hindu also

108
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,879
stressed the need to get

109
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,280
traditional knowledge respected on the

110
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:02,319
same level as science

111
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:05,599
and we heard from fao that um

112
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,319
traditional knowledge contains ancestral

113
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,000
wisdom

114
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,159
whereas often science is just

115
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,879
information

116
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,439
frang roy uh stressed the need to gather

117
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,920
evidence

118
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,120
of how destructive industrial

119
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,600
agriculture

120
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,799
is on indigenous peoples for example in

121
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,800
asia

122
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,800
and he also stressed the need for

123
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,160
researchers to respect the value

124
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,800
of indigenous knowledge rather than

125
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,840
viewing it

126
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,600
as backward as this sometimes happens

127
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,040
and the need to mainstream indigenous

128
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,360
perspectives

129
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,479
in research and to respect indigenous

130
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,960
people's rights

131
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,560
and the rights enshrined in the un

132
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,600
declaration on the rights of indigenous

133
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,360
peoples

134
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,240
and to support indigenous methods of

135
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,520
knowledge transmission like storytelling

136
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,680
and he stressed the need for a

137
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,639
multicultural research approach that

138
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:57,759
blends indigenous knowledge and science

139
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,120
and we heard that the multi multiple

140
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,639
evidence-based approach

141
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,160
is one method to do this we heard that

142
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,560
indigenous peoples would like

143
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,600
academics to recognize them as equally

144
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,000
expert

145
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,759
and the academics can play a useful role

146
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,479
in helping to show that indigenous

147
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,120
peoples are experts

148
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,919
and that they should support research

149
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,560
that is led

150
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,800
by indigenous peoples conventional

151
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,440
research that is externally led is not

152
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,360
useful

153
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,639
to indigenous peoples and can never

154
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,440
fully understand them

155
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,680
is something that hindu ibrahim

156
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,080
emphasized

157
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,919
but there's also we also heard that

158
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,880
there's much scope for collaboration

159
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,840
when there is

160
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,840
mutual respect

161
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,919
and um

162
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,280
we heard on the interdisciplinary issue

163
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,960
that

164
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,479
indigenous peoples don't have separate

165
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,600
fields of study everything is

166
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,759
interlinked

167
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:59,039
so community-led research can provide a

168
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,800
framework for interdisciplinary research

169
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,199
and we heard that it is crucial to

170
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,080
empower indigenous communities

171
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,880
and to support community networking and

172
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,680
to

173
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,759
also understand the governance issues

174
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,520
and engage at policy level

175
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,479
and that more research is needed on

176
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:19,520
gender and women's health issues

177
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:21,680
and finally we heard from fao about the

178
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,840
new global hub on indigenous

179
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,360
people's food systems that brings

180
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,759
together universities

181
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,120
un agencies and indigenous peoples and

182
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,759
seeks to inform

183
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,440
policy processes like the the world food

184
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,720
system summit in

185
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:39,360
in 2021 and um

186
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,240
uh just to mention that um john uh

187
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,319
fernandez de linoa uh from fao

188
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,560
replied to my question after the webinar

189
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:49,520
because there wasn't enough time

190
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,599
but um he confirmed that uk universities

191
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,199
can become members of the hub

192
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,039
and that the emphasis is placed on

193
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,639
institutions and research centers that

194
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,919
are doing hands-on research with

195
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,840
indigenous peoples

196
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:03,440
and they're respecting the principle of

197
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:05,919
free prior and informed consent

198
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,560
so for this webinar we will explore

199
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,560
indigenous

200
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,400
and decolonizing research methods and

201
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,199
we'll also explore

202
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,720
interdisciplinary research methods so

203
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,680
the first session

204
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,280
will focus on interdisciplinary methods

205
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,400
methods that draw on more than one

206
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,160
discipline

207
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,880
to better understand and protect

208
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,639
indigenous people's food systems

209
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,000
and to enhance the evidence of their

210
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,720
importance and to help

211
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,120
address the challenges they face and

212
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,440
then

213
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,639
after a 15-minute break we'll look at

214
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,680
the um

215
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,039
we're having a panel um of indigenous

216
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,960
peoples

217
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,039
talking about decolonizing and

218
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,840
indigenous research methods

219
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,759
that seek to empower indigenous peoples

220
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,479
and help to address the key challenges

221
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,639
they face

222
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,840
through the research process so they

223
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,919
strengthen culture

224
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,759
indigenous knowledge and help to

225
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:01,840
strengthen rights to land

226
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:04,400
and to to strengthen biodiversity etc

227
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,800
so i will hand over to philippa now

228
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,759
she's going to chair the first session

229
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,840
um just to briefly remind presenters

230
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,879
that we are a very diverse audience so

231
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,080
please don't use

232
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:18,879
um academic jargon and also

233
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,599
for the q a that follows um each session

234
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,440
today we would

235
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,039
prefer if everybody can raise their hand

236
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,319
or use the raised hand

237
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,080
function and briefly introduce

238
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,840
themselves rather than

239
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,520
using the chat but you can use the chat

240
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,280
if we run out of time

241
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,680
okay thank you so much i'll hand over to

242
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,680
philippa

243
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,039
morning everyone um so yeah this first

244
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,599
panel

245
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,800
on is on interdisciplinary methods for

246
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,760
research on

247
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,880
indigenous and traditional crops whole

248
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,160
food systems

249
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,240
and temporal changes and i'm going to

250
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,519
start by talking about combining

251
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,360
ethnobotanical and

252
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,800
historical approaches so ethnobotanical

253
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,200
approaches to studying

254
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,080
indigenous food systems can include

255
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,080
documenting crop diversity and uses

256
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,360
the relationships between crops and land

257
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,040
use and between crops and foods

258
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,080
all these elements are connected and

259
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,760
subject to dynamic change

260
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,480
there are multitudes of reasons for

261
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,480
growing crop varieties as we all know

262
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,800
including for different uses such as

263
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,240
food or fodder for their taste and

264
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,560
cooking properties

265
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,760
for their resilient traits or yield and

266
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,800
for their suitability

267
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,519
to specific moments within seasonal

268
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,560
cycles

269
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,800
or specific patches of land

270
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,680
for documenting crop diversity and uses

271
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,480
within the

272
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,600
local ecological context could include

273
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,600
recording

274
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,040
which crops are grown in different micro

275
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,839
environments and patches

276
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,600
created for example by differences in

277
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,120
soils or altitude

278
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,279
or through land use systems and

279
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,480
management such as terracing

280
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:58,399
and home gardens and studying crops from

281
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,519
cultivations through to cooking

282
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,839
practices

283
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,720
can include all the practical steps from

284
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,760
harvesting

285
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,600
food to storage and food preparation

286
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,600
and how they connect with material

287
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,120
culture technologies

288
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,680
cultural practices and knowledge so many

289
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,000
crops

290
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,160
considered minor today have been more

291
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,800
important in the past

292
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,480
and documenting farmers memories can

293
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:26,079
provide valuable information

294
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,440
about crop pieces about the advantages

295
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:30,959
of different crops

296
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,320
about growing methods that are useful in

297
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,839
being forgotten

298
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,120
and reasons for any of these changes

299
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,360
historical documents and

300
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,560
archaeobotanical data can then provide

301
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,440
further information

302
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,440
on the long-term crop histories and less

303
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,839
insights into their local environmental

304
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,839
suitability

305
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,440
over the past years i've been

306
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,040
collaborating with sudanese colleagues

307
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,040
in nubian communities studying

308
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,959
traditional crops

309
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,200
the project is based in the hyper arid

310
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,480
north where agriculture is centered on

311
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,040
family farms

312
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,200
and dependent on the river nile so i've

313
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,920
got a couple of slides to show now

314
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,839
um that introduced my collaborators and

315
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,760
some of the farming environments

316
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,959
and associated traditional material

317
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,560
culture so

318
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:18,880
i will just so we interviewed farmers

319
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,440
about crops they have grown today

320
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,959
and in the past to compare and their

321
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,800
uses and where they are grown

322
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,160
we recorded cultivation and crop

323
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,880
processing methods

324
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,800
focusing on cereals and pulses as well

325
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,760
as

326
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,680
associated foods elderly farmers were

327
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,360
also asked how practices have changed

328
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,079
with the introduction of new crops and

329
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,920
methods

330
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,680
especially since the mid-20th century

331
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,720
when traditional

332
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,240
irrigation systems changed so several

333
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,399
previously stapled crops

334
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,519
are now minor food crops and there are

335
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,000
many reasons for such

336
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,880
changes including shifts in food

337
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,600
preferences

338
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,120
and processing methods and many of these

339
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,600
crops are now just grown for

340
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,440
home use in small patches especially

341
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,600
along the river banks

342
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,440
tutorial beans are a dominant commercial

343
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,360
and food pulse crop

344
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,399
but previously a wide diversity of

345
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:13,279
pulses were eaten more frequently

346
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,880
especially lablab and cowpea and baked

347
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,639
wheat bread has also become an

348
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,000
increasingly dominant food partly

349
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,560
replacing flatbreads

350
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,040
which also used to be made with a wider

351
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,959
range

352
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:27,200
of cereal and pulse so changes in crops

353
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,920
and foods are also reflected by material

354
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,760
shifts

355
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,440
such as the disappearance of many

356
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,240
traditional kitchens

357
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,240
and storage rooms and the dominant

358
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,279
hybrid crops in use today can only be

359
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,959
grown in the winter

360
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:41,519
and then dependent on intensive

361
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,560
irrigation in contrast the local

362
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,880
cultivators of

363
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,600
african crops that were dominant in the

364
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,680
past

365
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,519
are low input and could be grown

366
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,120
throughout the year

367
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,120
and these previously important crop

368
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,440
species have a long history of use in

369
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,839
the archaeological record of the region

370
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,480
helping highlight their long-term

371
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,160
stories

372
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,839
and environmental suitability

373
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,000
the connecting botanical plant

374
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,440
identifications and local names

375
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,760
is always a key element of

376
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,760
ethno-botanical research

377
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,079
and recording the names of crops and

378
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:17,440
types of foods in nubian

379
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:20,160
as well as in arabic was also important

380
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,320
some words were more specific in libyans

381
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,920
and this knowledge is also endangered as

382
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,279
it is mostly held within the memories of

383
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,160
the older generations

384
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,920
and nubian languages are themselves also

385
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,600
endangered

386
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,600
so to help preserve the local

387
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,920
agricultural histories the findings were

388
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,639
summarized in a booklet that was shared

389
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,079
with local communities and its content

390
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,920
and design

391
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,800
involved the local community and

392
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,800
teachers throughout

393
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,480
i will now present a video from my

394
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,120
colleague mohamed saad

395
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,920
who discusses our research in sudan

396
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,800
further

397
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,480
mohammed works at the national museum in

398
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,639
khartoum

399
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,120
agriculture in the past depends on the

400
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:04,720
symbol system of irrigation

401
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:07,519
shadow as and sagia as well as

402
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,279
traditional tools to cultivate and

403
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,519
harvest the crops

404
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,199
it is very important to talk to the old

405
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,480
people

406
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:18,880
and all farmers about their

407
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,480
agriculture because some of them is

408
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:24,160
still they grow the all

409
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:27,040
all the crops for foods in a small area

410
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,160
because they are important as easy to

411
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,160
grow when it is

412
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:36,639
hot and the main crops is

413
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:39,199
wheat and beans and deaths

414
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,839
also the all farmers they have good

415
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,199
knowledge

416
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,639
especially about growing ropes season

417
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,760
snail float

418
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,760
some change happened

419
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:54,240
when the farmers use the modern

420
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,240
system of irrigation and

421
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,480
also they use a machine to cultivate

422
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,839
their crops

423
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,639
some farmers they change from food crops

424
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,760
to

425
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:08,000
cash crops as well as

426
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,000
also the some change happen because

427
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,120
people they grow like a big land instead

428
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,279
of a small

429
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,199
land brilliant thanks and now we're

430
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:18,000
going to move on quickly to

431
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,800
raj puri from the university of kent

432
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,199
who's going to

433
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:23,040
talk about using ethnobotany and

434
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,839
participatory action research to

435
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,680
document

436
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:31,440
agrobiodiversity over to you

437
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,000
okay uh hello everyone uh pleasure to be

438
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,040
here

439
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,639
um nice to see you all um

440
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,279
okay i'm gonna try and link these three

441
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:43,440
things um as best that i can

442
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:46,399
i don't have any slides but i'm happy to

443
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,360
answer questions afterwards okay

444
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,680
ethnobotany

445
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,800
then studies the relationship of people

446
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,199
to plants

447
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,240
and we think of that relationship as

448
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,839
mutual

449
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,639
an interdependency caused by

450
00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:00,480
co-evolutionary

451
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,320
processes that results in what we like

452
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,680
to call biocultural diversity

453
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,160
i'm sure many of you are familiar with

454
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,079
this so our food plants

455
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,519
and other cultivated crops are some of

456
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,399
the clearest examples

457
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,199
of this ongoing co-evolutionary process

458
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,120
wherein we have

459
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:17,680
manipulated and domesticated these

460
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:21,040
plants and produced

461
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:23,040
this agrobiodiversity but they have also

462
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,199
domesticated us

463
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,880
and produced the knowledge that we need

464
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:30,240
to grow protect

465
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:33,120
harvest uh store and use

466
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,399
those plants and those uses derive

467
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,399
ultimately

468
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,680
from the materials symbolic and

469
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,880
spiritual needs

470
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:43,440
beliefs practices and values that

471
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,839
underpin the cultural lives

472
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,839
of peoples around the world so when we

473
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:51,199
speak of agrobiodiversity

474
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,480
that's only half the story for what are

475
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,120
plant varieties

476
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,240
seeds and other plant parts without the

477
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,800
cultural context

478
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,880
and shared knowledges that enliven them

479
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,319
and give them meaning

480
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:06,400
so losing one aspect here necessarily

481
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,240
leads to losses in the other

482
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,400
maintaining crop diversity requires

483
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,120
maintaining the recipes for dishes

484
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,520
the celebratory feasts and rituals that

485
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,439
require these special varieties

486
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,720
conserving biocultural diversity

487
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:22,959
therefore is a multi-disciplinary task

488
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,559
requiring integrated research on this

489
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,839
co-evolutionary relationship

490
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,799
on this biocultural diversity on its

491
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,200
resilience

492
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:33,440
and threats to it from globalization and

493
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,760
climate change to name just a couple

494
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,360
and on its changing nature culture as it

495
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,039
transforms

496
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,559
in the face of both internal and

497
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:43,120
external forces

498
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,320
and trends of change so there are many

499
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,400
manuals out there

500
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,640
and many examples of research of this

501
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,120
kind being conducted around the world

502
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,440
i wanted today to focus on participatory

503
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,600
action research or par

504
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,720
using tested and tried ethnobotanical

505
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,840
methods to solve

506
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,520
problems and but being conducted by

507
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,919
residents of communities

508
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,600
who are trying to resolve these problems

509
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,600
and develop new directions for their

510
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:11,200
lives and livelihoods

511
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:14,400
so our role in this is as consultants

512
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,080
uh and trainers gathering together

513
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,960
people to help them think through

514
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:21,120
issues providing training and perhaps

515
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,400
funds to collect and analyze data for

516
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,360
themselves

517
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,200
about themselves uh helping them to

518
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,000
protect store and disseminate their

519
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,280
knowledge

520
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
as they see fit now one fact that we've

521
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,240
learned

522
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,280
is that no one knows everything about

523
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,679
the plants

524
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,520
people know and use and what people do

525
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,799
know often differs

526
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:45,600
there are knowledges of men of women

527
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:47,120
of children of elders of farmers of

528
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,240
gatherers of hunters

529
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,200
of fishers so one important role of an

530
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,400
ethnobotanist

531
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,919
in par is to find ways to get people to

532
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,039
share their own knowledge with each

533
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,799
other

534
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,720
you can think of great examples mark

535
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,400
plotkins sorcerer's apprentice in the

536
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,840
1980s and 90s

537
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,240
trying to get children to learn the

538
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,640
traditional medicine of their elders

539
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,000
in sabah we had a project studying

540
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,760
rattan and basketry

541
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,520
and the the elders of the community set

542
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,880
up workshops to teach their children

543
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,760
because they realized that they didn't

544
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,240
know

545
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:21,679
about basketry about rattan about the

546
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:24,799
plants and dyes that went into it

547
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,480
so we do this through interviewing for

548
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,440
instance in focus groups

549
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,480
of say only older women or only younger

550
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,559
men

551
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:36,160
so they can learn from each other in the

552
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,160
process of doing this research

553
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,360
and we do this through community mapping

554
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,880
exercises

555
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:45,120
through inventorying gardens or

556
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,080
interviewing along plant trails all of

557
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,640
these can be done by community members

558
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,640
so they may collect specimens and seeds

559
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,760
for a community herbarium

560
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,000
a garden or a seed bank or

561
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,320
sit down and write a plant manual in

562
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,240
local language for their kids

563
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,880
or they may choose to record it all on

564
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,600
video using what we call participatory

565
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,559
video

566
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:11,360
or pv developed by our friends at

567
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,360
insight share

568
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,799
i've been associated with several of

569
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,559
these projects over the years

570
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,799
and our students at kent have been sort

571
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,320
of leading the way with

572
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,400
their project's engagements with

573
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,039
communities to produce gardens manuals

574
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,159
and videos

575
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:28,000
around the world i'd also like to point

576
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,120
up the work done by the global diversity

577
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,200
foundation

578
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,400
uh who emphasized long-term commitments

579
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,440
to communities

580
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,600
to foster

581
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,200
[Music]

582
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,640
foster capacity building so that

583
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,159
communities can document their own

584
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,520
knowledges

585
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,600
in india where i've been working

586
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,280
recently a tree researchers have helped

587
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,360
communities deal with the impacts of

588
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,200
invasive species

589
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,280
on forest undergrowth by setting up

590
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,200
nurseries to grow some of their

591
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,280
important wild food and medicinal plants

592
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,000
in their own home gardens

593
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,600
in sabah gdf led a par project with

594
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,240
dusun communities

595
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:04,000
and ngos to use participatory resource

596
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,400
inventory methods

597
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
to document knowledge and use of plants

598
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,200
for the purposes of designing

599
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:15,360
community use zones in the crocker

600
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:18,000
state park all that research

601
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,440
uh and training and their gis maps that

602
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,679
they made themselves

603
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,080
became essential and vital when a

604
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:27,520
proposal to dam and flood their valley

605
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:29,679
was dramatically announced fortunately

606
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,679
they were successful in killing off this

607
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,200
this idea

608
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,360
so there are other examples i can talk

609
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,280
about and i'm interested to hear

610
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,559
from the other panel members what they

611
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,240
think

612
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:42,880
but that's all i have to say and thanks

613
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:46,159
very much for listening

614
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:48,320
thank you very much it was brilliant

615
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:51,200
um we're going to pass over quickly now

616
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:53,200
to roger blench who's going to

617
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,440
talk about using ethnobotanic

618
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,919
ethnobotany botanical linguistics

619
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,640
and anthropology to understand

620
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:02,400
indigenous

621
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,520
food systems okay i was ticked off for

622
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,840
not having pictures

623
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,080
in this slideshow so you'll just have to

624
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:11,919
put up with text sorry about that

625
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,520
okay um i'm not also going to talk about

626
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:17,280
the advertised topic

627
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:19,600
since but rather the whole issue of

628
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:22,880
documentation which is

629
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,880
a personal obsession

630
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,240
as far as i'm concerned the

631
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,360
documentation of basic ethnobiological

632
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,559
systems

633
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,480
remains in a very poor state and

634
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,960
in my view has in fact deteriorated in

635
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,120
the last 40 years

636
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,520
i mean a lot of discussion at this

637
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,400
workshop is about activism

638
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,200
and of course that is absolutely crucial

639
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,480
but

640
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:51,120
to my way of thinking activism has to

641
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,760
have an evidential base in other words

642
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,000
you know it's easy to say we must

643
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,919
protect xxxx but

644
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,520
exactly what are we protecting that

645
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,520
that's important to understand

646
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,120
there's also a problem of the making

647
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,080
useful

648
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,679
older documentation there's a load of

649
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,919
older documentation

650
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,840
often in obscure sources or in

651
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,960
problematic languages

652
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:22,159
these are not easily available

653
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:26,240
to present researchers present activists

654
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:28,720
so turning older stuff into useful

655
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,240
material also seems to me an important

656
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,720
priority

657
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,559
and making it accessible and and

658
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,799
something i i mentioned the other day

659
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:39,760
i've been working on which is turning

660
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:41,600
uh ethno-botanical stuff into android

661
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,679
applications that people can use on

662
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,640
their phones

663
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,960
i also mentioned an important uh thing

664
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,600
which seems to me

665
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,120
people put out ethnobotanical databases

666
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,559
on the internet

667
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:59,120
this is mainly because they get grants

668
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,640
and they have data and they put it up

669
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,679
and it's useful it's then

670
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:06,880
of course unmaintained because the grant

671
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:08,159
finishes and the creator of the project

672
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,480
moves on

673
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:15,520
um this goes back i think to what fao

674
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,640
was talking about we have to to scrape

675
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,360
if you like

676
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,520
all this documentation which people have

677
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:24,799
worked hard to prepare

678
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:27,279
and put it in a form that's accessible

679
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:29,120
and interlinked with other sources so so

680
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:32,320
there's a lot of stuff

681
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:35,120
to be done on making

682
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,720
data available in common formats which

683
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:40,159
can be consulted

684
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:46,600
by ngos by activists by scientists so

685
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:48,559
so it has a sort of multi-use format

686
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,400
interdisciplinary research well we've

687
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:54,080
heard a great deal about that and this

688
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:56,559
what this section is about um

689
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:59,120
my experience of certain organizations

690
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:01,760
even those represented this workshop

691
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,360
is that they speak in fork tongues in

692
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,279
other words you can certainly have a

693
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,679
unit that's interested in

694
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,559
local information and local cultural

695
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,919
practices

696
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:14,240
and useful plants but at the same time

697
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,240
there are other units in the same body

698
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,440
which are interested in promoting hard

699
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,760
science and

700
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,480
publishing papers in nature and science

701
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,960
and so on

702
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,720
for whom all this cultural stuff is a

703
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,640
load of hui frankly

704
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,799
and of course that's unfortunately where

705
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:32,000
the money is these days

706
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:34,960
and and we see this in lots of lots of

707
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:39,840
disciplines not only uh

708
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,840
archaeology as well as ethnobotany

709
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:45,600
there's a problem with funders funders

710
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,960
like to support advances in individual

711
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,880
disciplines

712
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,880
and this makes plant scientists in

713
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,840
particular turn away from economic

714
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,640
botany

715
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:57,039
um i've talked to many botanists for

716
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,840
whom this is all

717
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:01,520
just you know fluff if you like people

718
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,480
publish enormous

719
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:06,400
uh hardcore botanical surveys of

720
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,279
individual countries we're not a single

721
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,440
mention

722
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:11,440
of even whether plants are domestic or

723
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:14,159
non-domestic let alone anything to do

724
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,559
with uses and local names

725
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,440
similarly there's a major problem i

726
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,240
think

727
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,640
with the way information is reviewed in

728
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:25,520
journals in other words you know if you

729
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:28,880
do botanical documentation of a

730
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,880
particular group of people

731
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,679
actually publishing it in a in a journal

732
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,039
is really quite hard i mean you can put

733
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:37,279
it out there on the web and i think

734
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:40,400
that's what a lot of people do

735
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:41,840
but i think this there are great

736
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:47,520
difficulties

737
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:47,520
in even getting out basic documentation

738
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:52,960
i'll give you an example here i work in

739
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,080
nigeria and i work in northeast india

740
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:59,600
in those two places 502 and to

741
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:02,480
around 250 languages are spoken

742
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:05,919
i should say in nigeria there may be

743
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:08,640
satisfactory ethnobotanical and ethno

744
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:12,000
zoological documentation for maybe four

745
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:14,480
languages and none not one

746
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,039
in northeast india and i don't mean you

747
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,840
know a

748
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:19,039
list of a couple of plants but i mean a

749
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,600
proper

750
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:24,480
solid documentation such as been

751
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:27,679
undertaken in central america so

752
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:30,320
there's a real uphill task

753
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,919
a crucial thing in my view is a lack of

754
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:35,039
field guides

755
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:37,159
field guides are essential essential

756
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,799
to doing serious ethnoscience

757
00:27:37,159 --> 00:27:41,919
ethnobiology

758
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:44,399
if you can't even discuss you can't even

759
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:46,240
discuss the identification of

760
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:47,679
plants and animals with people because

761
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,679
you don't have

762
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:54,880
field guide so even if you are willing

763
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:59,919
for example you you can't easily get

764
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:02,480
uh you know a chance at identification

765
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,520
uh so i just want to want to emphasize

766
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,039
really

767
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:10,320
this absence of field guides and

768
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:13,120
maybe an absence of a data bank

769
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,960
of non-copyright photographs which can

770
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,360
be used to compile field guides

771
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,760
so i think all these are issues we have

772
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:22,720
to think about

773
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,159
okay brilliant thank you very much so

774
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:28,000
we're just going to start quickly

775
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:31,120
for um some questions

776
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:34,960
which just reset my clock

777
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:37,120
um how are we doing 35 so

778
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,960
yeah if we could just stop for around

779
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,520
five minutes of questions that would

780
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,880
be great um has anyone got any questions

781
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:46,159
they can

782
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,799
raise their hand um or or put a question

783
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,559
into the chat box and then afterwards

784
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:53,600
we'll move on to the next

785
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:53,600
round of flash talks

786
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,320
um sorry to have a question from me but

787
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:00,720
just

788
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,760
um as nobody raised their hand

789
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,679
immediately

790
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,279
um thank you very much all of you that

791
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:08,320
was really interesting

792
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:11,760
um i wanted to ask a question to roger

793
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:14,799
um i've worked quite a bit on

794
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:18,480
protecting traditional knowledge and

795
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:21,679
the main route by which um

796
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,919
biopiracy happens in

797
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,679
unauthorized use and commercial use of

798
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:28,880
traditional knowledge

799
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,480
is through published databases of

800
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,360
traditional knowledge

801
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,080
so i was just wondering how you address

802
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,399
that issue

803
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,880
because obviously this documentation

804
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:40,480
work is important

805
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,080
and as you say it's really important to

806
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,440
have the evidence base to support

807
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,320
activism

808
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,000
but um the concern is by making it

809
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,360
available that anybody could get their

810
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,440
hands on it and abuse

811
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,760
you know use it inappropriately and

812
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,679
without benefits for communities

813
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:58,640
so i'm just wondering how you address

814
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,640
that issue thanks

815
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,960
well obviously the first important thing

816
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,760
is that you

817
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,600
must get consent for dissemination of

818
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:11,360
knowledge from the people

819
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:13,440
you're working with um i have to say

820
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,200
i've never found this a problem

821
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,720
in the two areas of the world i work

822
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,760
people love

823
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,679
the idea that you know their culture is

824
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,559
being disseminated more widely in the

825
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,399
world

826
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,760
but these issues certainly have come up

827
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:28,080
in the amazon

828
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:30,240
although i do understand it's become

829
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,039
less of a problem in more in more recent

830
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,080
times because

831
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:37,120
more companies are less interested in

832
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,960
uh biodiversity chemicals and more

833
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,039
interested in in sort of mechanical

834
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,880
processes for developing things but

835
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:44,159
it remains an issue and i think the only

836
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,919
way around this

837
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,279
is to ensure that you definitely have

838
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:48,960
the consent

839
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,880
of the community for the dissemination

840
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,480
of knowledge and then

841
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,159
what can you do if it's out there it's

842
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,399
out there um

843
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,000
nobody can predict what might might be

844
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:02,080
found to be useful

845
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:05,039
um so there's no two way there's no real

846
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:08,880
way around this as far as i can see

847
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,880
uh it's consent is crucial

848
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:15,760
okay there's a question here um

849
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:18,320
from george mcallister um

850
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:20,240
about could the speakers share their

851
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,240
thoughts on how to undertake

852
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,440
participatory action research in a time

853
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,480
of covet

854
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,360
um perhaps in terms of ethics tools and

855
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,840
practices

856
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,679
for building trust and capacity for

857
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:34,799
community-led processes

858
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:38,080
raj i think this might be for you

859
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:39,919
yeah thanks good question very difficult

860
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,240
uh in fact we just submitted a grant to

861
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:44,320
the esrc here in the uk

862
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,440
to try and get funding to do just that

863
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,080
when it was uh

864
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,760
shot down as being uh one of the

865
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,679
comments one of their viewers said that

866
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,919
uh they wondered if it was unethical to

867
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:54,880
interview the same family three times in

868
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,200
a year

869
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,640
so that just goes to show you perhaps

870
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,600
who's reviewing these

871
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,320
these proposals but our our goal there

872
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,720
was to

873
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,399
uh work in pre-existing with

874
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,000
pre-existing relationships we have with

875
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:09,120
a couple of communities in london and

876
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,240
birmingham

877
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,279
uh already so making use of pre-existing

878
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,519
networks

879
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,960
and getting members of the the

880
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,240
communities that we were interested in

881
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,480
afro-jamaican

882
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,200
for caribbean communities and south

883
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,440
asian communities

884
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,000
to do research amongst their own people

885
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:31,760
amongst their own neighbors and families

886
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,840
to kind of get a sense of how they were

887
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,880
reacting to coven 19 in terms of their

888
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,039
use of

889
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,720
traditional healing methods self-care

890
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:41,679
etc

891
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,000
and so you know the way to do it really

892
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:45,519
is

893
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,000
again through good uh and close rapport

894
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:49,039
building and close relationships with

895
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,720
pre-existing

896
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:54,399
um uh networks in the case of covet 19.

897
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,720
starting something brand new might be a

898
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:59,039
bit difficult

899
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,760
we note i was also part of an online

900
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,880
survey

901
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:04,640
and we noted that very few members of

902
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,720
the south asian or the afro-caribbean

903
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,320
community were answering online surveys

904
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,600
about what they were doing during covet

905
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,919
19.

906
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:14,159
and it was clear that that's why

907
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:16,559
ethnographic research

908
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:18,159
as much as you could do in terms of

909
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,480
face-to-face interviewing whether it's

910
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,679
by

911
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:24,720
zoom or telephone or whatsapp or

912
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:26,720
on the doorstep was really important

913
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,919
you know people from minority groups

914
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,120
often

915
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:34,000
are just either don't have linguistic

916
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:39,279
or or digital capabilities for talents

917
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:40,720
for using those kinds of online surveys

918
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:43,120
i don't know i hope i hope that answered

919
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,200
some of your questions yeah thank you

920
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,240
thank you thank you if i can contact you

921
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,159
outside of this

922
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:53,360
forum that would be wonderful thanks oh

923
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:56,080
yeah pleasure pleasure

924
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,039
there's a few comments here in the in

925
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,279
the chat

926
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,279
um

927
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:08,399
i'm just reading harriet's

928
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:10,000
okay so that that might be something

929
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,839
that someone else could

930
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,599
is anyone could answer answer that

931
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:18,000
question but i think we also need to

932
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:18,000
to move on um with the

933
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,760
christine what's what's the best way to

934
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,520
carry

935
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,960
on answering some of the questions here

936
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,200
if we need to get going with the

937
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,359
the talks would it be good for people to

938
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,480
just send a couple of replies into the

939
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,560
chat

940
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,760
yes i think that would be the best um

941
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,079
while we move on if you

942
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,560
if you could reply to the question in

943
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:42,159
the chat i think

944
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:45,359
cool well anyway we better move on um

945
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:47,440
so then next um kind of talks

946
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:50,000
still talking about more different sort

947
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:53,040
of into multi-disciplinary methods

948
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,159
um and so we're going to start now with

949
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:58,800
paul wilkin from q um who's

950
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,680
going to present on botanical science

951
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,000
for conserving

952
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,520
orphan crops and indigenous knowledge

953
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,520
over to you paul

954
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,280
well if that isn't a big enough task for

955
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,760
three minutes i also thought i would say

956
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,599
that

957
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,079
the comments i'm about to make also

958
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:14,560
cover niche crops and wild

959
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:16,640
wild exploited plant resources really

960
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:19,680
across the whole spectrum

961
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,400
of domestication i think what we're

962
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,320
talking about

963
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,920
in terms of botanical science boils down

964
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,520
to four key questions

965
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,599
we've already started to touch on some

966
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:30,640
of those the first one is

967
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,359
what is it inventory is is a critical

968
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,000
part so

969
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:34,880
species uh land raises funds varieties

970
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,680
but also looking at

971
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,480
particular trait variation uh and in

972
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,720
current

973
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,800
uh research approaches we've also want

974
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,960
to look at genetics and genomics as ways

975
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,640
of describing and understanding

976
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,480
the diversity that we're seeing in front

977
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:51,040
of us and we want to see

978
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:53,520
participatory shared and restored

979
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:56,000
knowledge within that context

980
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,680
the next key question is where is it we

981
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
want to geolocate the material we're

982
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,560
looking

983
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,480
at and that brings into play a whole

984
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:05,040
load of spatial research methods

985
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,079
that i'm not going to talk about today

986
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,240
time

987
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:10,160
and then once we've done those

988
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,760
preliminary steps and those are the two

989
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,040
most critical first steps

990
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,040
then we start to think about

991
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:17,119
conservation uh

992
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,160
conservation is vital we are all aware

993
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:20,160
of that and the

994
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,680
population of the globe is increasingly

995
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,359
aware of that

996
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,800
so first we would look at in situ

997
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:27,040
methods of conservation

998
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,800
we'd look at cultivation either in situ

999
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,800
or close to in situ

1000
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,040
and then once those methods are exhorted

1001
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,640
we'd move to the ex-situ methods

1002
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,640
in particular around seed banking or

1003
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,000
cryo preservation

1004
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,000
and all of those are the suite of

1005
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,960
approaches that are open to us to make

1006
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,320
sure that we have access to the relevant

1007
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,839
germplasm

1008
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,480
uh and then the bit which is often

1009
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:50,800
forgotten the part on the end

1010
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,800
uh is what do we do with the conserved

1011
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,920
material how do we regenerate plants

1012
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,880
from that and how do we get them back

1013
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,680
where they're needed

1014
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,839
so we would be wanting to look at things

1015
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:02,880
like seed germination ecology

1016
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:04,640
uh and the extraction of

1017
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,359
preserved material and regeneration of

1018
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:09,440
it as the as critical approaches to

1019
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:10,640
delivering the plant resources that

1020
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:14,320
people need

1021
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,320
i think i will leave it at that

1022
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,480
thank you paul um i was wondering as

1023
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,160
well if you could just say

1024
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,520
something really briefly on um maybe how

1025
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,440
there's different approaches for

1026
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,440
different categories of crops so

1027
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,640
for example the the seed crops like

1028
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,760
cereals versus the

1029
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:35,200
vegetative vegetative crops

1030
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:37,920
um from the national perspective

1031
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,680
for many of the steps one to three

1032
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,640
really to be in situ

1033
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,320
for the in-situ work or or

1034
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:47,520
characterizing it

1035
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:50,240
evidently uh seed-bearing crops like

1036
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:53,760
cereals are relatively easy

1037
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:55,280
to bank crops which are

1038
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,880
based on underground organs which are

1039
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,079
vegetatively propagated

1040
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:03,440
are much harder to conserve they usually

1041
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:05,520
require geoplasm collections which are

1042
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:08,960
expensive to maintain and often

1043
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:10,640
uh find it very difficult to retain

1044
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,480
information associated with the

1045
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,640
accessions in those collections

1046
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,200
so they're often two or three years down

1047
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:19,680
the line are often quite worthless

1048
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:22,079
and then you end up resorting to cryo

1049
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:25,200
approaches which are extremely expensive

1050
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:27,599
uh and technical and difficult to

1051
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,560
approach but that may be the vital way

1052
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:32,320
of preserving so

1053
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:34,160
iota in nigeria uh concerns much of its

1054
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,240
yam diversity through cryo because it's

1055
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:38,320
the only approach that works

1056
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,320
okay thanks and now we're going to

1057
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,000
briefly explain what cryo is

1058
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,599
there's a lot of technical jargon coming

1059
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,359
through thank you yeah

1060
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,960
i forgot tissue culture which is another

1061
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:49,280
way to conserve material

1062
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,560
cryopreservation so freezing of of

1063
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,240
embryos

1064
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,760
down at very low temperatures and then

1065
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,880
they can then be re plants can be

1066
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:58,960
regrown

1067
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:03,359
from those preserved embryos thank you

1068
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:06,880
um and now we're going to move on to

1069
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:06,880
um where am i

1070
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,839
to typiana union from q who's going to

1071
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,359
talk about using plant diversity and

1072
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:16,720
ethnobotany to support

1073
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:18,480
community livelihoods thank you yes

1074
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:21,119
thank you philippe i'm going to share my

1075
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:24,560
screen i have a slide

1076
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:28,079
yeah okay well good morning everybody

1077
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:32,000
um so um i'm going here

1078
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:32,560
to talk about our research method

1079
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,960
through

1080
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:37,520
the project the youtube project that

1081
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:40,000
i've been coordinating for several years

1082
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,800
and this is a project um that was

1083
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,200
developed

1084
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,320
and carry out in africa and also latin

1085
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,920
america

1086
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:51,680
so um we the aim of this project

1087
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:54,800
was to um basically conserve xc2

1088
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:58,000
indigenous useful plants those one that

1089
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:00,240
were important for local community by

1090
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,839
building actually the local capacity

1091
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:07,839
to successfully conserve and

1092
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:10,319
use them so the main components

1093
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:13,040
of the project can be summarized as you

1094
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:15,119
follow so we have one part of targeting

1095
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:17,520
and prioritizing the species

1096
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,400
so by using different methods so one

1097
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,160
hand we did

1098
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,000
of course literature review to see what

1099
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,440
was already available there

1100
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
on the other hand we are being really

1101
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:28,319
carrying out electron botanica surveys

1102
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,359
um by working directly with the local

1103
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:31,920
community

1104
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:32,800
uh but uh at the end we had really to

1105
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,680
come up

1106
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:38,880
with a short list of most important

1107
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:42,240
species where we can we could focus um

1108
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:44,000
and on and do really our

1109
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:46,160
conservation and sustainable use

1110
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,200
activity and we did this through

1111
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:51,680
a workshop participatory workshop

1112
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,520
and then another component as being on

1113
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:57,520
the seed conservation

1114
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:59,920
social conservation um was applied to

1115
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,440
the priority species and we did the same

1116
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,560
conservation together with local

1117
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,119
community and with

1118
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,960
our collaborators in country by

1119
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:11,440
collecting and

1120
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:14,560
storing the seeds then we have been

1121
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:17,760
propagating those seeds in order to

1122
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:20,560
have them available and

1123
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,680
not only for research but of course for

1124
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,920
the community

1125
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,599
in a way in this way we establish

1126
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:28,880
community garden but also

1127
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:30,400
forestry plots in the case of of kenya

1128
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,920
where we've been propagating

1129
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,400
this priority and cultivating the

1130
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:37,839
species and lastly um

1131
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:40,800
we have been developing methods um

1132
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:41,920
and in order to create some income in

1133
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:45,119
the community

1134
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:47,520
uh through the um selling of uh

1135
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,720
plants directly sealing but also a plant

1136
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,760
product

1137
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:55,599
in particularly food products food

1138
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:57,680
products so how did we do all of this

1139
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:59,839
well we apply a participatory approach

1140
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,560
as i said by working together with the

1141
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:03,440
community

1142
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,079
from the beginning to the end and and

1143
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,800
also

1144
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:07,839
reaching out to other stakeholders by

1145
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,720
involving um

1146
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:11,680
them in our activities and in our

1147
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,960
products

1148
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,520
our approach uh was also

1149
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:17,200
multi-disciplinary

1150
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:19,280
as we carry out different kind of

1151
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,920
research we carry out a thrombotomical

1152
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,760
research

1153
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,280
but also we carry out research on c

1154
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,760
biology and ecology

1155
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:27,760
to inform both the management of the

1156
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,160
seeds but also the conservation of the

1157
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,200
seeds

1158
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:32,160
and how to propagate those seeds and

1159
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,480
then we develop

1160
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,359
propagation protocol and we have also

1161
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,640
established

1162
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:41,040
some um agricultural plots in order to

1163
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,720
look at the growth rate and the survival

1164
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:46,240
of these species

1165
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:48,319
and so to conclude um what did we do

1166
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,560
with all this information

1167
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:52,400
well the one that also we generated we

1168
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,280
give we give it back to the local

1169
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,119
community

1170
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:58,319
through training but also we help

1171
00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:00,960
enhancing the local facilities and and

1172
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:03,359
also we summarize all our um

1173
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,400
all our information in the in a book

1174
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:08,640
that you can see

1175
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:11,839
on here on um on the corner on the right

1176
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:14,000
and we produce this book so um which is

1177
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:16,640
a while plan for a sustainable future

1178
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,400
we compile all the information that we

1179
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,480
collected from the community

1180
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,560
our own information that we generated

1181
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,520
through the research and try to condense

1182
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:26,640
it in this

1183
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:28,800
in this book where we have uh in their

1184
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,720
eternal botanical information where

1185
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,560
other sort of botanical information

1186
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:35,760
species description

1187
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:37,680
so that people can identify the species

1188
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,960
and that's something that came out

1189
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,839
earlier in the talk

1190
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:44,079
but at the same time how to know how to

1191
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:45,359
deal with species from a conservation

1192
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:48,720
and sustainable

1193
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:50,640
um user point of view so

1194
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:54,160
this is a book that is aimed to

1195
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:54,720
practitioners and in country and um but

1196
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:57,920
also

1197
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:00,800
um that they work in development outside

1198
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,440
uh with aim really to help them use the

1199
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,240
species

1200
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,359
and conserve them and in a way that can

1201
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,200
help addressing

1202
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:09,760
uh community livelihoods and

1203
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:14,640
conservation at the same time

1204
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:14,640
thank you very much thank you so much

1205
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:22,720
um so we're gonna move on to

1206
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:24,480
um and julie and gary

1207
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,720
vasquez who's going to talk about

1208
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:29,119
identifying archaeo botanical evidence

1209
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:32,400
for plant processing techniques

1210
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:35,119
um yeah over to you so

1211
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:37,200
basically i am a phd student at

1212
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:40,000
university college london and i do

1213
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:41,359
arcu botanical analyses to understand

1214
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,760
human plant dynamics

1215
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:44,800
in of indigenous communities in the

1216
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,119
caribbean

1217
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,520
through archaeological methods and one

1218
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:52,160
of the things that i realized is that

1219
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,960
through our cubotany um you know we can

1220
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,960
identify

1221
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,040
many types of plants from the

1222
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:01,040
archaeological record however

1223
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:01,839
um at times we don't understand how to

1224
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:05,359
process them

1225
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:07,599
because as as has been said in the

1226
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:09,520
in the workshop that there's um

1227
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:12,800
indigenous knowledge that gets lost

1228
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:13,760
however i am here to kind of like

1229
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,240
control repose

1230
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:18,960
and the reality is that it's not lost

1231
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:22,000
our ancestors have this information

1232
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:24,319
um in the in the archaeological records

1233
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,960
you know they are the bearers the

1234
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:29,440
custodians of this information that got

1235
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:31,680
lost and we can work using our key

1236
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:34,000
botanical methods to

1237
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:35,599
bring it back to the present and this

1238
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,200
image is just um

1239
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:38,640
one of the activities that i do to

1240
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:41,440
understand

1241
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,560
the how the different methods of

1242
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:46,000
processing

1243
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:48,960
manioc which is here um

1244
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,720
and this also helps not just you know

1245
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,440
going through the motions of actually

1246
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:55,359
cooking

1247
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:58,640
the dish which is cassava bread

1248
00:45:55,359 --> 00:46:00,079
um which you can see here but also it

1249
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,599
helps you understand how those things

1250
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:04,280
get to the archaeological record

1251
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:06,319
and the way that i do this type of

1252
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:07,440
revitalization of indigenous food

1253
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:09,920
practices is by

1254
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,560
using collection of carbonized plant

1255
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,560
remains

1256
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:14,079
and then from those there are fragments

1257
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:17,599
which look like food

1258
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:21,440
or are especially also

1259
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:23,119
tuber fragments and using

1260
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:25,359
scanning electro microscope you can

1261
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:28,079
potentially identify those

1262
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:30,720
foods but beyond the simple

1263
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:32,560
identification of species or

1264
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,760
what type of food it is you can actually

1265
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:38,079
try to assess

1266
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:40,880
um food taste preferences

1267
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:42,400
and actually if this type of research is

1268
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,839
done on a more larger scale

1269
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:47,119
you can try and start getting a sense of

1270
00:46:44,839 --> 00:46:48,160
contextualizing the food habits of

1271
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:50,160
people

1272
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:52,160
um and that's something that i'm trying

1273
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:54,800
to work on throughout my

1274
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,839
work and not just as i said before

1275
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,880
revitalizing

1276
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:59,680
indigenous food practices which is this

1277
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,400
image

1278
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:03,760
which is from the taino new year

1279
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:07,280
celebration

1280
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,280
in my island of boriken

1281
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,319
thank you so much for that and really

1282
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:15,440
really great through

1283
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:18,880
love um seeing all those images as well

1284
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,880
we're all getting hungry already

1285
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:24,960
um and now we will talk about

1286
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:26,480
long-term um crop history of the

1287
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:29,280
archaeobotany of crop history

1288
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:31,599
so passing over to dorian fuller from

1289
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:34,720
ucl

1290
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:38,319
okay good so i'm i'm an archaeobotomist

1291
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:40,559
like uh julian who just heard from

1292
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:42,319
archaeobotany is the study of the

1293
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:44,240
preserved plants from ancient human

1294
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:46,079
sites so it's the archaeology of

1295
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:48,800
plants instead of the archaeology of

1296
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:51,839
pottery or some other kind of artifact

1297
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:54,079
and it can inform us about the

1298
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:56,319
history of crop repertoires within a

1299
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:59,280
region so which crops have come into use

1300
00:47:56,319 --> 00:48:01,119
and out of use over the long term

1301
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,359
it can tell us about ancient changes and

1302
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:06,079
diversification and crops

1303
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:07,839
it often tells us about within a

1304
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:10,079
particular region how

1305
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:11,520
much of an impact the post-columbian

1306
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:15,040
exchange has been

1307
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:15,520
between crops from the new world and old

1308
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:19,040
world

1309
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:21,040
being shifted around and we heard

1310
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:23,599
you know you will find maize in parts of

1311
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:24,960
asia and africa being very important

1312
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:28,640
and that's of course a change that's

1313
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:32,079
happened within recent centuries

1314
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:34,000
uh it can also tell us about lost crops

1315
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:35,520
or what we might call orphaned crops or

1316
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,280
crops that are disappearing and that's

1317
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,960
kind of what i wanted to focus on today

1318
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,119
with a few examples

1319
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,559
and i've listed some there in red and

1320
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:45,200
i'm going to quickly

1321
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:46,640
walk you through walk you through kind

1322
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:50,240
of three

1323
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:51,200
uh stories about lost or disappearing

1324
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,200
crops

1325
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,240
that archaeology can tell us about that

1326
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,960
you might not

1327
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:58,240
otherwise expect to learn very much

1328
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,960
about

1329
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:02,960
so it's something that can in a sense

1330
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:04,480
complement the kind of ethno-botanical

1331
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:07,839
documentation

1332
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,839
that we've been talking about

1333
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:12,240
so the first of those that i'd like to

1334
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:15,119
talk about is brown top millet

1335
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:17,839
or brachiaria ramosa and this is really

1336
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:18,720
the lost staple grain of south india of

1337
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:22,079
the deccan

1338
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:23,760
region uh now it's not completely lost

1339
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:27,119
there is a region

1340
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,079
in northwestern tamil nadu and adjacent

1341
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:30,480
karnataka

1342
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:32,000
where it is grown on a very small scale

1343
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,880
or at least it was still grown in the

1344
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,280
1990s on a very small scale the last

1345
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:39,040
documented reference to this i know of

1346
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:41,040
is from a paper published in economic

1347
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:43,040
botany in the year 2000

1348
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:45,200
by a japanese scholar and some indian

1349
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:48,319
colleagues and they documented i think

1350
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:51,119
two villages that grew this crop that

1351
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:51,520
in the late 1990s and i have a picture

1352
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:53,920
there

1353
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:55,440
of a map that shows the region where

1354
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:57,280
that modern cultivation was

1355
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,880
and some of the dishes and breads that

1356
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,800
were made out of this millet

1357
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,480
most of which were kind of ritual food

1358
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,880
so it was maintained mainly for

1359
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:07,119
particular festivals but the area

1360
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:09,440
highlighted in blue

1361
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:10,160
broadly speaking is and all those dots

1362
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,160
are where we have

1363
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:13,760
archaeological evidence for this as a

1364
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:16,000
grain

1365
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:18,160
and often as the dominant grain the

1366
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,720
staple grain on many of those sites

1367
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:23,119
so for from around four and a half

1368
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:25,280
thousand years ago up until

1369
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:27,599
maybe 1500 years ago this was in many

1370
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:29,599
regions a staple food so it is very much

1371
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:31,440
declined as a millet and that's a story

1372
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:33,359
that we can only learn about

1373
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,960
through the archaeological evidence

1374
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:37,280
which then tells us that it was

1375
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:40,160
suitable in much more of much more

1376
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:42,559
widespread importance and what remains

1377
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:45,040
in recent times is just a you know a

1378
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:48,559
small sample of its past

1379
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:51,520
diversity and cultural use

1380
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:53,040
another example of crops that are

1381
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:55,040
completely lost to us

1382
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:56,960
in the ethnographic present are some of

1383
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,319
the examples of north american

1384
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:01,440
domesticates

1385
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:04,480
uh and there are very two very well

1386
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,839
documented examples are a lost can a

1387
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:08,400
podium so this is a

1388
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:10,880
pseudo cereal similar to modern quinoa

1389
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:14,160
but a separate north american species

1390
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:15,920
and ice also iva annual oil seed and

1391
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,800
i've got pictures there of iva annual

1392
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:19,359
seeds it's

1393
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:21,440
distantly related to sunflower

1394
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:24,160
archaeological evidence

1395
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:26,559
shows that it undergoes domestication so

1396
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:29,520
you get a larger seeded variety

1397
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:31,119
so-called macrocarpa variety now this

1398
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:34,000
variety does not exist

1399
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:35,680
today there's no living biological

1400
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,559
versions of it it only exists in the

1401
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:40,800
archaeological record

1402
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:42,400
but it's a fairly major crop and oil

1403
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:46,160
seeded crop that's cultivated

1404
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:48,480
in this mississippi basin from about

1405
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:50,559
from more than 4 000 years ago up until

1406
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,400
at least a thousand years ago

1407
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:53,839
probably later we don't really know when

1408
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,440
it goes extinct as a crop

1409
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:57,839
and i would guess that it's around the

1410
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:59,280
time of european contact when you have

1411
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:01,440
such a large

1412
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:04,800
a decimation of native populations due

1413
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,800
to european diseases

1414
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,079
so again it's something that has

1415
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,160
potential but

1416
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:12,000
it's lost to our kind of ethnographic

1417
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,440
documentation

1418
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,440
and then the third case i'd like to give

1419
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,319
is one that would seem like a crop we

1420
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:19,040
know a lot about

1421
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:20,559
wheat but in fact there's a lot of kinds

1422
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:22,559
of wheat that we don't really know very

1423
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:25,119
much about

1424
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:27,119
today one thing to note is that wheat

1425
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:29,599
comes in lots of different genetic types

1426
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:31,760
as several species of wheat really

1427
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:33,280
today most of the wheat we eat and most

1428
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:36,640
of what's cultivated

1429
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:38,480
is either bread wheat or durum wheat

1430
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:40,000
durum wheat is u is cultivated

1431
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,720
especially in the mediterranean to make

1432
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,680
pasta

1433
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:45,040
and couscous but these are really quite

1434
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:46,880
recent phenomena

1435
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:49,119
these two species of wheat that dominate

1436
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,800
so they start to really become important

1437
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:52,000
in the roman period about two thousand

1438
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,559
years ago

1439
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,000
and in places like britain maybe only a

1440
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:57,359
thousand years ago

1441
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,760
and prior to that there's a real

1442
00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:01,200
diversity of wheat species and i've kind

1443
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,760
of circled them there with different

1444
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:05,599
colors

1445
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:07,599
durian i'll have to just wrap up quickly

1446
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:09,280
30 seconds more and what the one point i

1447
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:11,839
would say is that there's two

1448
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,559
varieties here which i've highlighted in

1449
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:14,240
uh

1450
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:16,400
two grade nine corner there's a there's

1451
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:18,240
a green arrow pointing to it

1452
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,520
and there's triticum timofevy there's a

1453
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,359
purple arrow pointing to it

1454
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:22,720
which are really dominant species in the

1455
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:24,400
neolithic and bronze age and have

1456
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:27,760
basically gone extinct

1457
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:30,800
since then so we can see that um

1458
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:32,319
the wheat diversity around us today and

1459
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,079
used traditionally

1460
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:36,000
is not necessarily doesn't necessarily

1461
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:38,319
reflect the long term so archaeology can

1462
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:42,480
reveal these patterns of long-term

1463
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:45,920
change and that's what i want to say

1464
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:50,160
brilliant thank you um cool so

1465
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:53,200
now we've going to um present a video

1466
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:54,720
from matthew davis at ucl who

1467
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,720
will be talking about documenting

1468
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:58,000
traditional crops agri systems and

1469
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:00,640
temporal changes

1470
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,640
in kenya

1471
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:05,200
many apologies that i cannot be with you

1472
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:06,960
today as i'm teaching and thanks for

1473
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:09,280
indulging me in this opportunity to

1474
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:11,200
record a short film

1475
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:13,200
my name is dr matthew davis and i work

1476
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:15,839
at the institute for global prosperity

1477
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:17,680
at university college london and most of

1478
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:18,160
my research has focused on how people

1479
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,839
manage

1480
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:22,240
agricultural landscapes in eastern

1481
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:23,480
africa and i briefly like to introduce a

1482
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,839
long-standing

1483
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:27,680
multi-disciplinary research project that

1484
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:30,880
has examined food systems

1485
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:32,640
in mariquette in northwest kenya this is

1486
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:34,559
led by a number of co-investigators

1487
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:35,359
including the pi professor henrietta

1488
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:37,359
moore

1489
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:38,400
dr wilson kip corey from the university

1490
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:40,000
of aldrat

1491
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,480
professor jacqueline mcglade from

1492
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:45,280
strathmore university and from ucl

1493
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:47,440
and dr sam lun rockcliff from ucl who

1494
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:49,920
should be with you all today

1495
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:51,520
it also includes multiple east african

1496
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,319
partners including the east africa

1497
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:54,319
herbarium

1498
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:56,640
and the british institute in eastern

1499
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:58,960
africa

1500
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:01,359
now mariquette is a rural area that

1501
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:02,480
straddles the eastern side of the cario

1502
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:04,480
valley

1503
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:06,160
it's well known for its extensive

1504
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:09,200
pre-colonial irrigation

1505
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:11,359
systems and our research project has a

1506
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:13,359
deep history led by professor moore with

1507
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:14,880
some continuity go back going back into

1508
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:16,559
the 1970s

1509
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,240
and including work by kenyan scholars

1510
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:21,440
such as ben kip courier

1511
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:22,160
jason younger s matissio and wilson kip

1512
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:24,079
corey

1513
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:27,040
as well as researchers including bill

1514
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:28,799
adams liz watson and ton dietz

1515
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:30,960
throughout our research has intersected

1516
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:32,880
with food systems and has often taken

1517
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,480
these as the central focus

1518
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:36,079
but it's also important to note that the

1519
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:38,079
work has

1520
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:39,839
also focused on many other related

1521
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:41,280
issues particularly broader development

1522
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:44,240
interventions

1523
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:46,559
such as this red cross irrigation scheme

1524
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,760
and wider processes of ecological

1525
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:49,520
management

1526
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:51,119
a key tenant of our research over the

1527
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:53,119
last decade has been to develop

1528
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:54,000
community-led research through citizen

1529
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:56,319
scientists

1530
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,319
who are community members and who who

1531
00:55:56,319 --> 00:56:00,319
helped determine the research questions

1532
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:02,160
methods and analyses

1533
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:04,000
this citizen science team is led by mr

1534
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:06,319
timothy kippkayokit ruto

1535
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,160
and miss helena cheptoe pictured here on

00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:13,680
members nelson valengo on the right

1538
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,520
research into food systems by this team

1539
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:18,799
has thus always been embedded in wider

1540
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:20,559
social economic and environmental agenda

1541
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:22,319
often defined by the priorities of the

1542
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:23,040
citizen scientists and the community

1543
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:25,119
itself

1544
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:26,960
rather than by strict singular research

1545
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:28,559
questions

1546
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:30,480
for example lines of research have

1547
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:31,440
examined failed histories of development

1548
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,119
interventions

1549
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:36,559
many of which have been agricultural in

1550
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:38,640
nature but many of which also have not

1551
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:40,079
a primary aim of this work has thus been

1552
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:42,319
to build a detailed history of the

1553
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:45,040
community the agricultural landscape the

1554
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:47,200
rural economy and its wider connections

1555
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:48,160
to food production which necessarily

1556
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:50,720
form a core

1557
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:52,559
aspect of this the methods employed have

1558
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:54,240
been diverse but often rooted in

1559
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:55,520
different ways of mapping and knowing

1560
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:58,480
the wider landscape

1561
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:59,760
and embedding analyses of things plants

1562
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:01,920
animals pathways

1564
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:05,520
within this landscape

1565
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:07,359
so this work has included everything

1566
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:08,000
from traditional archaeological field

1567
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:10,079
survey

1568
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,000
to surveys of colonial and postcolonial

1569
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:13,520
structures and interventions

1570
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,559
combined with multiple forms of

1571
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:19,440
ethnographic observation and interview

1572
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:22,079
spanning both his ethno-historical and

1573
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:23,760
contemporary topics

1574
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:25,280
particular attention has been paid to

1575
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:28,400
physically but

1576
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:30,720
to physically mapping with gps and gis

1577
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,599
the landscape led by the citizen science

1578
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:33,599
team

1579
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:35,599
including mapping contemporary and

1580
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:36,240
historic features in relation to food

1581
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:38,400

1585
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:45,280
structures

1586
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:47,920
participant-led mapping has planned

1587
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:49,520
individual fields as you can see here

1588
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:51,200
including their boundaries routes

1589
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:53,839
pathways and allowing for detailed

1590
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:54,960
in-situ ethnographic interviews of what

1591
00:57:53,839 --> 00:57:59,599
farmers produce

1592
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:59,599
where when how and in what combinations

1593
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:04,559
repeat mapping of nearly 100 film fields

1594
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:06,559
over the last eight years in particular

1595
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:08,720
has not only provided quantitative data

1596
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:11,520
on the types and combinations of crops

1597
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:13,520
both indigenous and hybrid but also for

1598
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,240
deeper conversations about decision

1599
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:17,839
making and

1600
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:20,000
innovative experimentation

1601
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:22,000
work on ethnobotany has thus been

1602
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,319
extensive including identifying

1603
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,280
the complex use of some different 10

1604
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:27,920
varieties

1605
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:29,200
of sorghum and 12 land race varieties of

1606
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:31,280
finger millet

1607
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:33,200
but we've always situated these in wider

1608
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,799
systems of food production through time

1609
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,880
and always focused on the intersection

1610
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:40,720
of both indigenous land races

1611
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:40,720
and more hybrid crops

1612
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:45,440
most recently we've worked on

1613
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,680
geo-referenced smartphone data recording

1614
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,839
of

1615
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:49,839
interviews features and photographs and

1616
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:51,920
have developed with pharma's bespoke

1617
00:58:49,839 --> 00:58:53,680
data collection applications using a

1618
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:55,760
software called sapele

1619
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:58,880
that allows farmers to record cropping

1620
00:58:55,760 --> 00:59:00,319
practices and associated challenges

1621
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:02,400
although these data are still being

1622
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:05,040
collected and are still under analysis

1623
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:06,640
this has resulted in some 29 major

1624
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:09,680
cultivated crops being

1625
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:12,640
um identified both new and old

1626
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:13,599
with some 36 wild food plants and these

1627
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:16,839
are used in

1628
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:18,000
literally hundreds of unique

1629
00:59:16,839 --> 00:59:19,359
combinations

1630
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,280
overall then although this work has

1631
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:22,799
documented indigenous food production

1632
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:25,200
the aim has not been to

1633
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:26,319
focus solely on the heritage of this but

1634
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:28,960
rather to try

1635
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:30,960
to place diverse food production systems

1636
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:33,440
within a complex narrative of change and

1637
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:35,359
continuity through time and space

1638
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:37,280
and to situate this within contemporary

1639
00:59:35,359 --> 00:59:38,799
food debates such as those surrounding

1640
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:41,280
the notion of an african green

1641
00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:43,520
revolution

1642
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:44,799
our aim i think has been particularly to

1643
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:46,720
help smallholders

1644
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:49,599
holder farmers show how diverse their

1645
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:52,400
practices and influences are

1646
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:54,559
and to situate their heritage alongside

1647
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:58,240
the dynamic use of modern materials

1648
00:59:54,559 --> 01:00:00,559
ideas and experimentation

1649
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:02,079
so in short then i think this our work

1650
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:03,920
has been about rethinking the

1651
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:06,559
distinctions between traditional

1652
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:07,839
and modern practice between continuity

1653
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:11,040
and innovation

1654
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:12,960
and to recenter smallholder farmers

1655
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:15,440
as sources of rather than as the

1656
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:17,920
recipients of innovation

1657
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:19,040
so i hope that this quick talk has not

1658
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:21,920
been too brief

1659
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:23,440
and too confused but i thank you all

1660
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:26,720
very much for listening

1661
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:28,240
and hope to hear feedback and questions

1662
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:29,839
through the grapevine thank you very

1663
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:32,880
much brilliant thanks

1664
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:34,400
when we move on to um questions after i

1665
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,960
think you could all see the the comment

1666
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,760
from

1667
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:38,559
from sam here in the chat so sam's with

1668
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:40,880
us today so

1669
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:43,119
he can address um questions and he's

1670
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:44,240
also posted a longer version of that

1671
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:47,440
video

1672
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:50,000
um so now we're going to move on to

1673
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:50,799
to sandeep hazard singh from open

1674
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,599
university

1675
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:55,520
who's going to talk about oral history

1676
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:58,160
is a method for studying

1677
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:59,200
the meaning of food waste in india thank

1678
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:02,480
you

1679
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:04,319
thank you deliver so this this talk is

1680
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:05,119
based on recorded and filmed oral

1681
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:08,319
history

1682
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:10,880
interviews with women small holders in

1683
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:11,559
karnataka india in the context of a

1684
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:14,559
recent

1685
01:01:11,559 --> 01:01:16,640
ahrc-funded collaborative project called

1686
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:20,079
changing farming lives in south india

1687
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:24,000
past and present from this experience

1688
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:26,720
and in the context of our discussion of

1689
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,599
food systems and heritage oral history

1690
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:30,000
might provide

1691
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:31,200
a particularly amenable entry point for

1692
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,040
research

1693
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:36,079
this is because oral history is about

1694
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:37,680
memory and remembering lived experience

1695
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:40,240
it can therefore document and

1696
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:42,559
communicate food traditions and heritage

1697
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:45,040
and the meanings and feelings involved

1698
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:47,760
in a particularly vivid manner

1699
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:50,000
secondly food tends to resonate

1700
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:52,400
particularly well with memory

1701
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,359
in terms of its sensorial ability to

1702
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:55,680
trigger

1703
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:56,720
rich memories and emotions of food

1704
01:01:55,680 --> 01:02:00,720
pleasures

1705
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:05,280
within home family and community

1706
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:07,440
this process is known as edible memory

1707
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:09,760
thirdly this method offers the

1708
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:12,799
capability of generating insights

1709
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:16,400
into meanings of food cultures over

1710
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:19,599
a significant historical duration

1711
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:22,480
um and it is also

1712
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:24,720
finally conducive to reclaiming the

1713
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:27,280
voices and life experiences

1714
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:27,760
of indigenous and sub-altern groups such

1715
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:30,559
as

1716
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:30,880
women presents and farmers who tend to

1717
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:35,839
be

1718
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:35,839
marginalized in written documents

1719
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:39,520
oral history essentially involves a

1720
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:42,960
process

1721
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:46,640
of co-creation between interviewer

1722
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:49,760
and narrator in a way that both

1723
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:53,359
highlights narrator agency and

1724
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:56,559
invites listeners or viewers into

1725
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:58,640
her lived experience

1726
01:02:56,559 --> 01:02:59,599
very often in development writings the

1727
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:02,720
voices of

1728
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:04,799
subaltern groups tend to be subsumed by

1729
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:06,880
the researchers interpretation

1730
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:09,359
which is what ultimately becomes

1731
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:12,160
authoritative

1732
01:03:09,359 --> 01:03:14,160
in our project we began by asking

1733
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:17,839
questions that of course were primarily

1734
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:17,839
of interest to us as researchers

1735
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:21,359
but participants were encouraged to

1736
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,720
shape their narratives

1737
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:28,240
as much as they wished by talking about

1738
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:30,559
food crops food activities

1739
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:32,000
other subjects and life episodes that

1740
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:35,440
they themselves regarded

1741
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:38,640
as significant and meaningful

1742
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:39,599
in the process uh we discovered that it

1743
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:42,400
was foods

1744
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:45,839
and diets that the women's smallholders

1745
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:45,839
were particularly passionate about

1746
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:49,200
especially the beliefs rituals and

1747
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:51,680
knowledges

1748
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:52,640
associated with finger millet based food

1749
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:56,400
ways

1750
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:56,400
that they were seeking to revive

1751
01:03:56,640 --> 01:04:02,880
rituals involved deities earth seeds

1752
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:03,520
animals birds and other more than human

1753
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:06,240
entities

1754
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:09,280
which have the power to affect food and

1755
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:09,280
farming outcomes

1756
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:14,799
in contrast they were much less

1757
01:04:11,839 --> 01:04:18,480
interested in the economic specificities

1758
01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:21,760
of crops and livelihoods

1759
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:23,839
so just to conclude i would say that

1760
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:25,039
oral history offers the capacities to

1761
01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:27,359
understand

1762
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:29,440
and change the present in the light of

1763
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:32,400
the past

1764
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:34,640
to identify patterns of local social and

1765
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:37,039
climate change

1766
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:39,200
to give voice to hidden and alternative

1767
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:41,920
narratives

1768
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:43,680
and finally to recall cultural memories

1769
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:44,559
as a repository of knowledge and

1770
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:49,200
resilience

1771
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:52,799
for ongoing innovations thank you

1772
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:56,400
thanks sandy that's brilliant um and uh

1773
01:04:52,799 --> 01:05:00,000
so we've just got one last uh video now

1774
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:02,480
um from harriet's cooling

1775
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,280
um who some of you might remember from

1776
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:05,839
monday

1777
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:06,640
um and she's talking about participatory

1778
01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:09,200
methods

1779
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:11,760
for exploring indigenous food systems

1780
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:13,520
health and well-being

1781
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:14,880
thank you for including me in this

1782
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:17,280
segment of the

1783
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:17,920
of the program that you have developed

1784
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:21,039
there at

1785
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:23,240
q and i i ed i'm very happy

1786
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:25,359
to be with you to be talking about

1787
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:27,760
participatory methods

1788
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:28,880
to explore indigenous peoples food

1789
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:32,240
systems

1790
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:34,160
health and well-being so my experience

1791
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:36,319
is through the center for indigenous

1792
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:39,280
peoples nutrition and environment

1793
01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:41,200
at mcgill university in montreal canada

1794
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:45,760
where i was founding director

1795
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:48,480
from 1985 until 2009

1796
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:49,440
and i'm still active in promoting the

1797
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:52,559
center

1798
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:55,280
as which is really why i'm here today

1799
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:56,319
so i have to give credit to many many

1800
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:58,160
people who

1801
01:05:56,319 --> 01:06:01,200
worked through the center over the years

1802
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:03,039
and our community collaborators

1803
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:05,440
not only for the data that we have

1804
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:09,280
provided in the many publications

1805
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:12,720
but also for building the strategies

1806
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:15,200
for community consultation when we

1807
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:18,400
started our work with the center we had

1808
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:18,880
the indigenous leaders in canada guiding

1809
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:22,000
us

1810
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:23,280
on how to have proper community

1811
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,920
consultation

1812
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:28,000
and in fact they even lobbied for

1813
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:30,240
funding with the canadian government to

1814
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,240
help establish the center

1815
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:34,799
so we're very grateful to them in

1816
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:38,720
particular to chief bill erasmus

1817
01:06:34,799 --> 01:06:40,960
from the denny nation so our work

1818
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:42,559
in the canadian arctic during that

1819
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:45,599
period of time

1820
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:47,920
led to many publications

1821
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:50,400
but i want to call your attention to

1822
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:53,630
this publication

1823
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:54,720
that uh was requested from the w.h.o

1824
01:06:53,630 --> 01:06:57,920
[Music]

1825
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:58,799
this was published in 2003 in english

1826
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:02,280
and spanish

1827
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:04,960
it's on the cine website as well as the

1828
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:06,400
whole website indigenous peoples and

1829
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:09,440
participatory

1830
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:13,200
health research planning management and

1831
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:15,119
preparing research agreements

1832
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:17,839
so we learned that there is no one

1833
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:20,079
single way to build collaboration

1834
01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:21,039
every community is different but there

1835
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:24,000
are a few

1836
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:25,920
key principles uh but i'd like to call

1837
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:29,039
your attention to

1838
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:29,839
first of all you have to listen you have

1839
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:33,039
to learn

1840
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:35,119
know how to carefully listen to your

1841
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:36,559
collaborators in the communities for

1842
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:38,960
their concerns

1843
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:40,319
for their ideas on how to do things

1844
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:43,200
right

1845
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:45,119
from their perspective so that means you

1846
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:48,000
have to maintain a respect

1847
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:49,520
for the people and that helps them

1848
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,839
respect you

1849
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:53,039
you need respect for the food system the

1850
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:56,480
environment

1851
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:59,920
and work uh to continue to build mutual

1852
01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:03,039
respect for mutual benefit

1853
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:03,920
so that leads to the important concept

1854
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:07,200
of trust

1855
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:10,240
you can't get anywhere in community work

1856
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:12,319
with research or development

1857
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:14,160
without having mutual trust with your

1858
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:17,120
community

1859
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:18,319
so one of those principles means you're

1860
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:20,640
working with them

1861
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:22,719
you're not working on them you're not

1862
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:25,839
working on nutrition

1863
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:27,199
on the people in x community you're

1864
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:29,279
working with them

1865
01:08:27,199 --> 01:08:31,040
so i also call your attention to the

1866
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:34,560
2016 publication

1867
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:35,920
from fao on free prior and informed

1868
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:38,319
consent

1869
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:40,000
and please always recognize that you

1870
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:42,799
need collective as well as

1871
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,159
individual consent in the research

1872
01:08:42,799 --> 01:08:47,199
processes

1873
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:48,239
and along the line uh always keep in

1874
01:08:47,199 --> 01:08:51,359
mind that when

1875
01:08:48,239 --> 01:08:53,600
we as academics prepare our publications

1876
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:54,560
it is very important for the community

1877
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:57,120
partners

1878
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:58,880
to know about them to participate in

1879
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:01,120
them to be co-authors

1880
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:03,679
and to have these publications returned

1881
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:04,960
to them so that they can be translated

1882
01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:07,120
if appropriate for

1883
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:08,400
the community members i think that's all

1884
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:12,960
i have time for

1885
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:16,480
thank you very much okay so

1886
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:20,319
um now we i think we're doing

1887
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:24,239
we're perfectly on time um

1888
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:28,159
so we can have some 10 minutes for

1889
01:09:24,239 --> 01:09:31,199
questions um i'm just trying to get my

1890
01:09:28,159 --> 01:09:34,319
speaker view back on great so has anyone

1891
01:09:31,199 --> 01:09:37,600
got any questions for anyone

1892
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:40,400
you can raise your your hands or put

1893
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:40,400
questions in the chat

1894
01:09:41,199 --> 01:09:45,199
excellent so i see quite a lot of

1895
01:09:43,199 --> 01:09:46,000
comments in the the chat box but i think

1896
01:09:45,199 --> 01:09:47,600
they're

1897
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,199
i haven't been able to follow those

1898
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:51,279
doing all of this i think

1899
01:09:49,199 --> 01:09:52,560
they're from the previous discussions so

1900
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:56,640
does anyone have any

1901
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:57,679
questions for the recent speakers of the

1902
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:01,280
flash talks

1903
01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:02,159
lucas hello everyone my name is lucas

1904
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:04,320
pavera and

1905
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:06,320
i'm researcher combining ethnobotanical

1906
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:08,239
and nutrition approaches

1907
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:10,400
and with the indigenous partnership and

1908
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:12,239
mr frank roy who is present we are

1909
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:14,960
working on indigenous food systems in

1910
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:16,080
indonesia northeast india and also a bit

1911
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:20,239
in ethiopia and

1912
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:23,120
mexico yucatan and uh i would like to

1913
01:10:20,239 --> 01:10:24,000
mention the presentation of dr tiziano

1914
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:25,840
which was

1915
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,000
i think this livelihood aspect is

1916
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:30,239
becoming more and more important

1917
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:32,480
and as we can see many indigenous

1918
01:10:30,239 --> 01:10:33,840
cultures and also the food systems are

1919
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:36,239
under pressure

1920
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:37,600
and changing from the intensification

1921
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:40,000
livelihood needs

1922
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:41,199
and also cash crops coming so i think

1923
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,719
the livelihood aspect

1924
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:44,719
is really that's something that should

1925
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:47,360
be strengthened

1926
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:49,120
but what we found is quite a challenge

1927
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:51,920
is how do we balance the trade-off

1928
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:55,040
between livelihood and commercialization

1929
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:57,840
and also own consumption for example

1930
01:10:55,040 --> 01:11:00,000
in indonesia or northeast india our

1931
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:02,320
studies are showing that

1932
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,199
farmers are producing nutritious food

1933
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:06,239
groups

1934
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:06,960
such as eggs or fruits but then they

1935
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:08,880
rather

1936
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:10,159
you know sell them because of the income

1937
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:12,239
opportunities

1938
01:11:10,159 --> 01:11:14,560
which a little bit compromised the diets

1939
01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:16,400
and dietary diversity in the end

1940
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:18,560
so you know how do we balance this this

1941
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:19,600
trade-off between livelihood and owned

1942
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:22,239
consumption

1943
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:22,800
that would be my question and yeah thank

1944
01:11:22,239 --> 01:11:25,120
you

1945
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:26,239
yeah thank you lucas for your very

1946
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:29,040
interesting question

1947
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:29,840
is actually a key question and i think

1948
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:32,000
um

1949
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:33,360
you know it is very important in terms

1950
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,880
of development

1951
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:36,880
and how to carry out the sustainable

1952
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:39,920
development as you are

1953
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:41,120
mentioning the problem is that you can

1954
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:44,719
support livelihood

1955
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:48,719
you can help commercializing one species

1956
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:50,640
but how can we stop by

1957
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:52,480
somehow how can bring the benefit into

1958
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:54,480
the community

1959
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:56,159
it's key and naturally it needs to be

1960
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:59,520
involved into the value chain

1961
01:11:56,159 --> 01:12:01,679
of that product and of course uh

1962
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:03,840
again this need to be multi-disciplinary

1963
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:07,840
and also involve different stakeholders

1964
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:08,480
and it's important to have uh even um

1965
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:11,760
some

1966
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:12,800
um like a at the country level some

1967
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:16,000
legislation

1968
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:17,760
that uh uh in a way that is need

1969
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,280
it's incorporated into the legal

1970
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:21,280
framework of the country

1971
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:23,600
uh because otherwise you need to to

1972
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:25,920
protect this product and actually

1973
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:27,040
more in the value chain you have a

1974
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:30,080
middle dealer

1975
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:30,400
more likely um less likely you're going

1976
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:33,520
to

1977
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:34,719
benefit the local community and so it's

1978
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:37,760
really a big problem

1979
01:12:34,719 --> 01:12:38,880
and i think it's something that we're

1980
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:41,360
always being

1981
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:42,560
aware through our work and through our

1982
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:44,719
research

1983
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:46,320
and uh for this we've been really

1984
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:47,280
working directly with the local

1985
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:50,560
community and

1986
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:51,679
and also with hgo because ngos somehow

1987
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:54,320
they are

1988
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:56,480
the voice in general of the local

1989
01:12:54,320 --> 01:13:00,080
community and they really can help us

1990
01:12:56,480 --> 01:13:03,040
in bringing the commercialization

1991
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:04,159
and from the community to the national

1992
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:06,320
regional level

1993
01:13:04,159 --> 01:13:07,520
national level and potentially at the

1994
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:09,920
international level

1995
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:10,719
so this is definitely a key step in

1996
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:13,040
order to

1997
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:14,159
support livelihood they need to be

1998
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:15,840
addressed and this

1999
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:17,760
again you need to be in the

2000
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:20,239
interdisciplinary and design

2001
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:22,400
at the same time to have a multi um

2002
01:13:20,239 --> 01:13:24,080
participatory approach not only at the

2003
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:27,840
research level but also

2004
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:30,000
by linking up with with the

2005
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:31,040
local government and national government

2006
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,840
at the same time

2007
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:33,840
thank you

2008
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:39,199
brilliant thank you um so i've got a

2009
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:41,760
couple of questions here

2010
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:42,239
paul's in the chat first and then on to

2011
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:45,600
roger

2012
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:47,440
so how widespread is the pattern of

2013
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:51,120
farmers selling production to the

2014
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:51,120
detriment of their nutrition

2015
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:59,440
sandy do you have any comments on that

2016
01:13:55,440 --> 01:14:02,880
um i think the

2017
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:06,800
the women farmers we spoke to actually

2018
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:07,920
very keen on the nutritional aspects of

2019
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:10,640
uh

2020
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:11,600
the foods they were they were seeking to

2021
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:16,640
revive

2022
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:19,199
um they were kind of very aware that

2023
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:19,920
it was particularly important to know to

2024
01:14:19,199 --> 01:14:22,560
to grow

2025
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:23,520
known foods and that there was no

2026
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:26,880
benefit

2027
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:29,199
in consuming foods from the outside as

2028
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:32,320
they put it which they did not know

2029
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:36,239
so this issue of knowledge um

2030
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:38,880
of foods was particularly important um

2031
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:41,120
and they were able to tell us in detail

2032
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:44,000
in in

2033
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:45,520
in in a considerable way the uh

2034
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:49,600
nutritional properties

2035
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:53,199
of uh foods like uh the various millets

2036
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:55,440
which uh they were growing um

2037
01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:56,320
and and and and the worst properties of

2038
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:59,360
the seeds they

2039
01:14:56,320 --> 01:15:02,239
they they were saving and exchanging

2040
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:02,239
as well um

2041
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:07,520
that's that's great thanks and i

2042
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:09,199
remember

2043
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:11,040
something from some of my interviews as

2044
01:15:09,199 --> 01:15:12,640
well that just things like qualities of

2045
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:15,120
taste could change when

2046
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:17,199
certain crops growing for food were

2047
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:17,840
growing different qualities of soils and

2048
01:15:17,199 --> 01:15:20,880
it's that

2049
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:22,080
very sort of precise local knowledge and

2050
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:24,880
so sometimes you could have the same

2051
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:28,000
crop being grown in some different soils

2052
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:30,400
for purposes of selling that crop or

2053
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:32,239
for using it for animal fodder then the

2054
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:33,760
same crop from the same

2055
01:15:32,239 --> 01:15:36,480
like land race being grown in a

2056
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:38,239
different patch of better quality soils

2057
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:41,840
when it was being

2058
01:15:38,239 --> 01:15:44,560
used to eat at home so and that sort of

2059
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:45,440
knowledge was being lost sort of locally

2060
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:49,679
as well

2061
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:49,679
um so roger you had a question as well

2062
01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:54,960
um i've been a surprise this conference

2063
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:57,840
is

2064
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:59,600
sort of entitled indigenous food systems

2065
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:03,360
there's been extraordinary little

2066
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:06,239
discussion of cookery itself and then

2067
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:06,960
you know actual actual ways that people

2068
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:09,600
think about

2069
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:10,880
preparing different foods now in

2070
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:13,760
etanagar

2071
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:16,320
in the capital of arunachal pradesh one

2072
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:19,840
of the fascinating things are the tribal

2073
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:22,719
food restaurants that's what they call

2074
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:24,960
the many different ethnic groups in 52

2075
01:16:22,719 --> 01:16:27,360
in arunachal pradesh

2076
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:28,719
many have their own quite specific

2077
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:30,640
cuisines

2078
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:33,120
and they have a restaurant system which

2079
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:36,400
has grown up to serve people

2080
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:38,960
who want to eat those particular foods

2081
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:41,840
i there's you know this sort of thing

2082
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:44,320
also happens a bit in nigeria and

2083
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:45,679
quite a lot in indonesia where in

2084
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:48,480
indonesia

2085
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:50,400
any big city has restaurants which serve

2086
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:53,520
people from different islands

2087
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:56,239
in indonesia i feel these are grossly

2088
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:56,960
understudied in other words these are

2089
01:16:56,239 --> 01:16:58,640
some of the

2090
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:00,840
institutions these commercial

2091
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:04,560
restaurants which are acting to

2092
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:05,920
propagate indigenous food systems

2093
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:08,080
in other words they're the people who

2094
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:09,840
who make money from actually

2095
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:12,159
selling people the food they really like

2096
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:13,920
to eat and uh

2097
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:16,400
to my knowledge i've seen very little or

2098
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:17,920
no study of any sort of

2099
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:22,400
these these restaurant systems and how

2100
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:22,400
they actually promote indigenous foods

2101
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:26,719
has anyone else got any um comments on

2102
01:17:26,239 --> 01:17:30,000
that

2103
01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:32,239
but raj yeah i was to say thank you

2104
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,560
roger that's a very good point i've

2105
01:17:32,239 --> 01:17:36,400
i think recipes and dishes and cookery

2106
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:38,840
is extremely important we've

2107
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:41,280
had students looking at the

2108
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:43,440
reintroduction of wild plants

2109
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:46,080
into these kinds of restaurant cuisines

2110
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:49,040
in malaysia for instance in singapore

2111
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:51,040
and because of covet 19 here in london

2112
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:54,640
in malaysian restaurants

2113
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:54,880
and looking also that that these places

2114
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:58,159
are

2115
01:17:54,880 --> 01:18:01,040
also venues to revitalize

2116
01:17:58,159 --> 01:18:02,080
traditional crops and traditional plants

2117
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:05,520
um

2118
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:06,960
plants in cooking as a as also

2119
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:10,159
a way to kind of present that

2120
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:10,159
traditional food tradition

2121
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:15,840
yeah and philip i also wanted to add on

2122
01:18:14,719 --> 01:18:18,159
that

2123
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:20,400
uh yeah i think it's extremely important

2124
01:18:18,159 --> 01:18:22,880
to uh to record a recipe and it's

2125
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:24,640
somehow a way to conserve the way in in

2126
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:26,000
the same way you can solve the recipe or

2127
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:28,480
conserving the traditional

2128
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:30,880
you are conserving the species as well

2129
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:33,040
and i wanted to mention that

2130
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:34,719
we have recently started a project on

2131
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:38,080
the mediterranean diet

2132
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:40,080
in lebanon and jordan and we identify

2133
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:41,520
some species that actually you can't

2134
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:45,120
find in the

2135
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:46,159
um in the lebanese restaurant in orlando

2136
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:49,920
you know they really

2137
01:18:46,159 --> 01:18:52,239
consider a delicacy at the country level

2138
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:54,560
and really really appreciate them

2139
01:18:52,239 --> 01:18:56,560
so the world we are doing is really

2140
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:57,360
trying to bring these other species some

2141
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:59,920
are harvested

2142
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:02,320
from the wild some are cultivating and

2143
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:05,320
we're also looking into the nutritional

2144
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:06,640
content of the species looking at the

2145
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:08,719
micronutrients

2146
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:09,679
in order to to look at the health

2147
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:11,440
benefits

2148
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:12,960
and at the same time by looking at the

2149
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:16,400
health benefit you can

2150
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:18,560
this information can help to promote

2151
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:20,400
these species that are minor in the

2152
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:22,320
cuisine somehow or

2153
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:26,159
what we know outside but they're still

2154
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:26,159
very important at the local level

2155
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:32,880
that's brilliant julian did you have

2156
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,880
your hand up before

2157
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:36,800
one of the things is that um yes i agree

2158
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:39,120
with

2159
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:39,920
roger blench and raj and the thing is

2160
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:42,159
that

2161
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:43,760
another dimension i just forgot to

2162
01:19:42,159 --> 01:19:45,920
mention is that

2163
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:47,520
you know we've been talking about plant

2164
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:48,320
and seed collections and all these types

2165
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:50,320
of things but also

2166
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:51,679
one of the things that i do in order to

2167
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:53,840
be able to inform

2168
01:19:51,679 --> 01:19:55,520
and like identify foods from the

2169
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:57,040
archaeological record is that i have a

2170
01:19:55,520 --> 01:20:00,159
food library

2171
01:19:57,040 --> 01:20:03,280
not just of the recipes but actually

2172
01:20:00,159 --> 01:20:05,520
pieces of the food because um

2173
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:07,040
you know you can have the recipes you

2174
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:08,639
can have all these things but if you

2175
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:11,120
don't know how does the product really

2176
01:20:08,639 --> 01:20:12,880
look um and that also helps you inform

2177
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:14,080
and understanding how these types of

2178
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:17,199
like um

2179
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:19,760
the the way that the method

2180
01:20:17,199 --> 01:20:21,199
conditions the type of behavior that the

2181
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:22,480
remain will have

2182
01:20:21,199 --> 01:20:24,320
so that's another thing that you can

2183
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:26,159
actually be doing you have been

2184
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:27,840
you know i i know that every time you go

2185
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:29,040
to the field work you are like oh here

2186
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:30,960
eat this eat that

2187
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:33,360
and then you can just try and build up

2188
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:35,440
also a food reference collection

2189
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:38,320
which would be it's it's one of the

2190
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:42,239
important aspects

2191
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:44,159
i think is oh i've got one quick

2192
01:20:42,239 --> 01:20:46,400
comment so like as archaeobotanists were

2193
01:20:44,159 --> 01:20:47,600
always interested in those stages of

2194
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:49,199
processing and

2195
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:51,280
i think one thing we're looking at

2196
01:20:49,199 --> 01:20:53,840
changes in the last 50 years

2197
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:54,719
that sort of research sandeep's been

2198
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:57,840
doing with

2199
01:20:54,719 --> 01:21:00,560
looking at grinding stones

2200
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:01,920
and moving to modern methods in the same

2201
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:04,000
in sudan is that

2202
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:05,520
sometimes the changing cooking practices

2203
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:08,320
or use of crops is

2204
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:09,440
is linked to these changing material

2205
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:11,920
cultures and

2206
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:13,040
so when when interest in our our project

2207
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:15,520
is looking from

2208
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:17,920
farm through to plate to try and capture

2209
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:21,760
all those interconnected processes

2210
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:25,840
so alex you had you had a question

2211
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:27,760
um yeah so i hi i'm alex i'm at the

2212
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:29,360
ucl institute of archaeology and rachel

2213
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:33,040
botanist i also intern

2214
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:34,480
for q um i grew up on

2215
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:36,400
coastal miwok land in northern

2216
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:38,000
california i'm in communication

2217
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:40,000
a lot with a lot of native tribes in

2218
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,480
california through different dialogue

2219
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,679
groups

2220
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:45,600
what chumash serrano washu miwok

2221
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:47,600
and um something that we talk a lot

2222
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:50,400
about is

2223
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:51,600
reconnecting with traditional recipes

2224
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:54,719
and how do we support

2225
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:57,280
indigenous groups who have been forced

2226
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:58,320
out of practicing traditional food

2227
01:21:57,280 --> 01:22:00,639
systems

2228
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:03,040
and the increased rise in this i don't i

2229
01:22:00,639 --> 01:22:06,000
don't really hear a lot of discussions

2230
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:07,280
with traditional native americans in

2231
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,600
north america

2232
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:11,199
a lot of people have are in urban

2233
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:13,600
settings or on reservations

2234
01:22:11,199 --> 01:22:15,520
but there is an increased interest with

2235
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:17,600
the rise of like indigenous people's day

2236
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:20,639
which was this past monday

2237
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:23,520
as a replacement for columbus day with a

2238
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:26,639
desire to reintegrate traditional

2239
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:27,280
food systems even though the the origins

2240
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:29,600
of a lot of

2241
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:32,000
american food systems are actually like

2242
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:34,320
in the narrative like thanksgiving

2243
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,280
how do we support communities of people

2244
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:38,000
who are

2245
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:39,840
have had broken indigenous condition

2246
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,040
traditions because a lot of my friends

2247
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:44,159
who are miwok or

2248
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:46,080
honey want to practice these recipes

2249
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:48,960
they want to reintegrate

2250
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:49,280
a corn flour into the dialogue they want

2251
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:52,320
to

2252
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:55,600
integrate traditional like you know

2253
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:57,440
um fishing practices but they don't have

2254
01:22:55,600 --> 01:23:00,400
any resources

2255
01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:02,480
to do that and so but there is an

2256
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:04,480
increased commercial interest in it like

2257
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:07,440
the sioux cookbook has picked up

2258
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:09,360
and has won a national award and so

2259
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:11,280
there is like an increasing fascination

2260
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:12,080
with native american cuisines but

2261
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:15,199
there's

2262
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:16,239
next to no support so i don't know i

2263
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:18,239
don't know i just wanted to bring this

2264
01:23:16,239 --> 01:23:20,080
into the dialogue and i wanted to um

2265
01:23:18,239 --> 01:23:22,639
kind of introduce a north american

2266
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:25,760
perspective just because they're often

2267
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:27,040
um not included in the dialogue does

2268
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:29,360
anyone have any

2269
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:30,960
comments on that um and there's actually

2270
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:33,280
some related comments now

2271
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:34,800
in the chat as well but and then we're

2272
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:37,360
going to have to move on to a

2273
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:38,719
break i think if you look at gary

2274
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:41,280
navain's work

2275
01:23:38,719 --> 01:23:41,760
uh on food networks and food sovereignty

2276
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:43,920
in the

2277
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:45,679
southwest and uh west of the united

2278
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:48,400
states

2279
01:23:45,679 --> 01:23:51,600
food heritage systems and trying to

2280
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:51,600
reclaim traditional food

2281
01:23:51,679 --> 01:23:54,320
food waste

2282
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:59,679
can i also mention that way back in the

2283
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:01,920
end of the 19th century

2284
01:23:59,679 --> 01:24:03,360
the good old smithsonian used to produce

2285
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:05,520
wonderful books

2286
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:06,800
about indigenous cookery systems in

2287
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:09,199
north america

2288
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:09,840
books which are long out of print but in

2289
01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:12,080
my view

2290
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:13,679
you know people should have a look at

2291
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:16,239
these because they

2292
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:18,080
documented food and cookery systems at a

2293
01:24:16,239 --> 01:24:21,360
time where they were pretty well

2294
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:23,760
intact i mean i collected a few of these

2295
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:26,400
in myself but but you know but how are

2296
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:28,880
these being distributed to communities

2297
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:30,480
because my my friends i talk to don't

2298
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:32,719
know these exist

2299
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:34,080
slash they're often really hesitant to

2300
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:36,480
engage with this literature because it

2301
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:38,639
was often written by colonists

2302
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:40,239
and so there's an apprehension to engage

2303
01:24:38,639 --> 01:24:41,840
is there access to resources that have

2304
01:24:40,239 --> 01:24:43,520
been written by indigenous scholars

2305
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:45,120
because that's the biggest comment i get

2306
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:47,840
from people i talk to

2307
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:49,840
is how do i access modern day resources

2308
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:51,440
written by indigenous ecologists or

2309
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:53,360
people who have a comprehensive

2310
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:55,520
understanding and it's not through a

2311
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:57,199
colonial narrative because i know people

2312
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:58,320
who know the smithsonian stuff but they

2313
01:24:57,199 --> 01:25:00,080
don't want to read it

2314
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:02,159
because it's automatically comes from a

2315
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:03,199
perspective that doesn't have a full

2316
01:25:02,159 --> 01:25:04,400
appreciation

2317
01:25:03,199 --> 01:25:06,639
that's this is just i'm just

2318
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:08,719
regurgitating news i've i've been told

2319
01:25:06,639 --> 01:25:11,600
to spread from my communities so

2320
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:14,000
yeah well i think that's really unfair

2321
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:15,840
i've read this stuff and and these were

2322
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:17,600
ex at least you could you need to look

2323
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:20,639
at them and read them and see

2324
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:21,199
are are they realistic and so on i mean

2325
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:23,840
you know

2326
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:25,199
of course maybe there is some colonial

2327
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:27,840
perspective

2328
01:25:25,199 --> 01:25:28,719
but give them a chance don't just throw

2329
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:31,760
them out of the

2330
01:25:28,719 --> 01:25:33,760
the pram all automatically

2331
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:35,520
it's it's something that we have to deal

2332
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:38,560
with with a lot of archival

2333
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:40,800
material from from these periods and the

2334
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:43,440
historical research methods take

2335
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:44,880
take those sorts of biases into

2336
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:47,280
consideration so you could try and

2337
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:48,239
abstract the information but in the

2338
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:51,199
context of those

2339
01:25:48,239 --> 01:25:52,320
materials but sandy could be able to to

2340
01:25:51,199 --> 01:25:54,560
better comment on

2341
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:56,560
whether i've got that sort of correctly

2342
01:25:54,560 --> 01:26:00,320
phrased

2343
01:25:56,560 --> 01:26:02,400
uh well yeah yes if uh

2344
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:05,440
if you're looking for kind of indigenous

2345
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:08,400
or supporting voices

2346
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:10,639
within within the within the archive

2347
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:14,639
especially the colonial archive

2348
01:26:10,639 --> 01:26:17,760
uh you're likely to to look in vain

2349
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:22,080
but nonetheless within that they

2350
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:25,199
are um even the colonial archive

2351
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:28,719
required um

2352
01:26:25,199 --> 01:26:30,159
reliance on native and indigenous

2353
01:26:28,719 --> 01:26:34,840
informants

2354
01:26:30,159 --> 01:26:36,239
so kind of a a way of reading the

2355
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:38,639
archives

2356
01:26:36,239 --> 01:26:41,679
as has been called against the grain

2357
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:44,320
will kind of give you some perspectives

2358
01:26:41,679 --> 01:26:45,920
from the people who provided the

2359
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:49,280
colonialists with

2360
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:51,520
the information so it's kind of a

2361
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:52,960
fine reading the archives and being

2362
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:56,000
alive to the kind of

2363
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:59,199
the silences the dissonances

2364
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:02,000
the information that is coming to

2365
01:26:59,199 --> 01:27:04,639
the colonial author and which is

2366
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:08,480
sometimes actually acknowledged so

2367
01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:11,840
yes you would not get kind of a

2368
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:15,199
clear a clear

2369
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:17,120
outline of views directly by indigenous

2370
01:27:15,199 --> 01:27:19,679
or subaltern groups but

2371
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:20,400
there is a way of making sense of of the

2372
01:27:19,679 --> 01:27:22,320
archives

2373
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:23,600
they're not completely i would say

2374
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:25,199
useless

2375
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:27,040
and maybe that's the role of modern day

2376
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:29,520
i'm afraid you're gonna have to stop now

2377
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:30,880
i'm really sorry but please do continue

2378
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:33,280
sorry i'm afraid we're gonna have to

2379
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:37,280
stop now because we've run out of time

2380
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:38,960
um we we scheduled a break from 12 30 to

2381
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:41,120
quarter to

2382
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:42,880
one which is only 15 minutes and i think

2383
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:43,440
people will need some lunch before the

2384
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:46,000
next

2385
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:47,679
session it's been really fascinating and

2386
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,520
i'm really glad roger brought up the

2387
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:50,960
issue of food because

2388
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:52,960
it's such a critical issue and i've

2389
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:54,320
really enjoyed all the presentations

2390
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:56,480
and all the discussion so thank you

2391
01:27:54,320 --> 01:28:00,080
really very much philippa and everybody

2392
01:27:56,480 --> 01:28:03,600
and uh please come back in in 15 minutes

2393
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:03,600
right welcome back everyone

2394
01:28:03,679 --> 01:28:11,679
um i hope you managed to get some some

2395
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:14,159
lunch so um

2396
01:28:11,679 --> 01:28:16,320
we're now gonna have a panel on

2397
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:17,600
decolonizing and indigenous research

2398
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:21,440
methods

2399
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:22,560
and i just um want to thank you all for

2400
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:25,440
your presentations

2401
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:25,840
earlier they were so interesting i think

2402
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:27,920
um

2403
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:29,920
just a brief comment while we wait for

2404
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:31,679
people to come back

2405
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:32,960
the issue of intellectual property

2406
01:28:31,679 --> 01:28:36,000
rights that came up

2407
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:38,560
um i think what harriet kuhnlein

2408
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:41,199
said in her video about collective free

2409
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:44,719
prior informed consent is really really

2410
01:28:41,199 --> 01:28:46,600
critical for ensuring that communities

2411
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:48,320
know fully the risks of

2412
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:51,280
commercialization

2413
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:53,199
um before they agree to publish or to

2414
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:55,120
disseminate

2415
01:28:53,199 --> 01:28:56,719
their knowledge and there's also the

2416
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:58,719
option of

2417
01:28:56,719 --> 01:29:00,560
them not publishing and then building a

2418
01:28:58,719 --> 01:29:02,639
knowledge base within communities

2419
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:04,239
and that's something we'll hear about in

2420
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:07,280
this session

2421
01:29:04,239 --> 01:29:08,880
um i also was really enjoyed listening

2422
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:11,120
about oral histories

2423
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:13,120
and i think they have huge potential at

2424
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:16,320
the moment because

2425
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:18,560
um you know the loss of um

2426
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:20,400
traditional knowledge that's going on is

2427
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:21,679
often just the elders who have the

2428
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:23,440
knowledge and so

2429
01:29:21,679 --> 01:29:25,040
oral histories are really important to

2430
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:27,840
bring back

2431
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:29,440
and revitalize by a cultural heritage in

2432
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:30,800
in the areas we're working

2433
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:33,920
you know to try and establish

2434
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:36,880
biocultural heritage territories

2435
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:38,000
uh i think archaeobotany um you know

2436
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:41,440
might also help on that

2437
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:42,960
if it can help with the recent past um

2438
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:44,880
which is kind of more relevant and

2439
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:45,360
immediate to communities and might still

2440
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:48,000
have

2441
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:50,159
um remnants in the memories of the

2442
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:54,480
elders

2443
01:29:50,159 --> 01:29:54,480
the session now is um

2444
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:59,199
is is a panel of indigenous people on a

2445
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:02,480
topic which i think is really

2446
01:29:59,199 --> 01:30:04,320
important and as a researcher i think

2447
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:06,480
that the best way

2448
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:09,120
um to help indigenous peoples is to

2449
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:11,040
ensure research is led by them

2450
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:13,040
that it empowers indigenous peoples and

2451
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:14,560
that address addresses their needs and

2452
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:16,800
priorities

2453
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:17,920
um and this type of research can have a

2454
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:19,520
lot more impact

2455
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:22,960
in terms of development and environment

2456
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:25,360
impact than externally led research

2457
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:26,400
and also there are ethical issues i

2458
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:29,440
think

2459
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:30,639
with externally led research um

2460
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:33,120
you know you're asking indigenous

2461
01:30:30,639 --> 01:30:35,440
peoples to contribute to a process

2462
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:38,159
which generally doesn't give them much

2463
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:41,679
benefit in return so in my view that's

2464
01:30:38,159 --> 01:30:43,199
unethical um so i think this issue of

2465
01:30:41,679 --> 01:30:44,719
decolonizing

2466
01:30:43,199 --> 01:30:47,600
research methods is really really

2467
01:30:44,719 --> 01:30:51,120
important and

2468
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:52,639
i would like to introduce um professor

2469
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:56,000
chi baguela chilisa

2470
01:30:52,639 --> 01:30:59,199
i hope you're here with us so

2471
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:00,639
um she is a professor at the university

2472
01:30:59,199 --> 01:31:02,719
of botswana

2473
01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:05,040
and her work has focused on on

2474
01:31:02,719 --> 01:31:06,159
culturally and contextually responsive

2475
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:07,760
research

2476
01:31:06,159 --> 01:31:09,840
and evaluation and she's written a

2477
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:11,199
brilliant book on indigenous research

2478
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:14,000
methodologies

2479
01:31:11,199 --> 01:31:15,520
so welcome and thank you so much baguela

2480
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:18,800
you have 10 minutes

2481
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:20,560
or ten okay thank you thank you so much

2482
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:24,080
thank you for having me

2483
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:26,639
um this has been a wonderful

2484
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:28,159
uh time for me i've had a lot of

2485
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:29,360
interesting things from all the

2486
01:31:28,159 --> 01:31:32,159
presenters

2487
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:33,440
and now is in this 10 minutes i'm going

2488
01:31:32,159 --> 01:31:36,480
to share with you

2489
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:39,600
uh uh what i have so

2490
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:41,760
my focus is going to be on uh indigenous

2491
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:45,280
research methodologies

2492
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:48,719
and what they are and their benefit

2493
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:52,320
to doing research on indigenous

2494
01:31:48,719 --> 01:31:55,360
uh indigenous food

2495
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:55,840
so indigenous research methodologies is

2496
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:58,560
about

2497
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:59,199
the right of those whose voices have

2498
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:02,880
been

2499
01:31:59,199 --> 01:32:06,320
silenced by western knowledge

2500
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:09,280
to know to talk

2501
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:09,280
and to be heard

2502
01:32:10,639 --> 01:32:17,440
while for example in academics may use

2503
01:32:14,159 --> 01:32:20,480
historical data as you have heard over

2504
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:24,320
over the last two days

2505
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:27,520
indigenous people can talk

2506
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:30,960
and be heard by

2507
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:34,159
using for example foreclose

2508
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:38,239
stories taboos about food

2509
01:32:34,159 --> 01:32:42,560
oral traditions about food names of food

2510
01:32:38,239 --> 01:32:42,560
songs about food

2511
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:48,960
that is a way to give the indigenous

2512
01:32:46,639 --> 01:32:52,239
people

2513
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:53,120
voice of course the scientists can

2514
01:32:52,239 --> 01:32:56,320
always

2515
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:59,440
do archival data

2516
01:32:56,320 --> 01:33:02,480
i mean archaeological data and do

2517
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:04,639
all the sciences but

2518
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:05,840
indigenous people also have the right to

2519
01:33:04,639 --> 01:33:08,400
know

2520
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:10,960
and they know and they know through

2521
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:15,040
those methods

2522
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:18,400
it is about indigenous people's right

2523
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:22,000
to know to produce knowledge

2524
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:25,280
and all knowledge

2525
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:28,639
in wasana when we fry potatoes

2526
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:30,639
we call them french fries and i think

2527
01:33:28,639 --> 01:33:32,320
the world over they are called french

2528
01:33:30,639 --> 01:33:36,320
fries even when they

2529
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:39,920
are fried in the u.s that

2530
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:43,040
talks about an indigenous

2531
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:43,040
french recipe

2532
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:46,400
indigenous research methodologies is

2533
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:48,480
about

2534
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:50,800
bringing indigenous knowledge to the

2535
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:54,000
global market

2536
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:56,880
bringing those indigenous recipes

2537
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:58,000
to the global market so that they can

2538
01:33:56,880 --> 01:34:04,159
compete

2539
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:07,600
with other recipes

2540
01:34:04,159 --> 01:34:07,600
it has it is about

2541
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:14,159
the right to place indigenous

2542
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:17,679
ways of knowing

2543
01:34:14,159 --> 01:34:21,040
and values at equal footing

2544
01:34:17,679 --> 01:34:23,679
with other knowledge systems when we

2545
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:26,400
talk indigenous research methodologies

2546
01:34:23,679 --> 01:34:27,520
we are therefore talking about mixed

2547
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:30,320
methods

2548
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:33,199
where mixed methods is not only about

2549
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:36,560
combining quantitative and qualitative

2550
01:34:33,199 --> 01:34:39,199
data but it is also about

2551
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:40,000
combining indigenous knowledge

2552
01:34:39,199 --> 01:34:43,280
indigenous

2553
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:48,239
methods with a

2554
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:48,239
other conventional methods

2555
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:55,520
so that when we talk of indigenous

2556
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:59,199
research methodologies

2557
01:34:55,520 --> 01:35:01,199
we're talking about collaborative

2558
01:34:59,199 --> 01:35:04,639
research

2559
01:35:01,199 --> 01:35:09,360
we are talking about multiple methods

2560
01:35:04,639 --> 01:35:09,360
that recognize indigenous

2561
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:16,239
methods indigenous knowledge is a

2562
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:17,360
indigenous recessional methodologies is

2563
01:35:16,239 --> 01:35:20,360
about

2564
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:22,159
the right of indigenous people to

2565
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:26,320
prioritize

2566
01:35:22,159 --> 01:35:29,920
the research agenda and participate

2567
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:29,920
in what is recess

2568
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:37,320
and to be recognized as core knowledge

2569
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:38,560
producers when you talk about

2570
01:35:37,320 --> 01:35:40,159
prioritizing

2571
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:42,639
we are talking we are talking about the

2572
01:35:40,159 --> 01:35:44,560
relevant research

2573
01:35:42,639 --> 01:35:45,840
of course western researchers have been

2574
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:50,080
luxury

2575
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:53,280
just to research for curiosity's sake

2576
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:55,040
we indigenous people don't have that we

2577
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:58,880
need a research that can benefit

2578
01:35:55,040 --> 01:36:04,320
us and it is uh it is us

2579
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:04,320
who can prioritize what is relevant

2580
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:11,760
indigenous research is about the

2581
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:16,719
resistance to stereotypes

2582
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:20,880
and deficit theorizing perpetuated

2583
01:36:16,719 --> 01:36:24,239
by western knowledge western research

2584
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:27,760
colonial research the archives

2585
01:36:24,239 --> 01:36:28,560
archived knowledge that continue to

2586
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:31,760
perpetuate

2587
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:34,639
stereotypes i can understand when

2588
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:36,000
indigenous people say but who wrote

2589
01:36:34,639 --> 01:36:38,239
those reports

2590
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:39,360
who wrote those recipes in those books

2591
01:36:38,239 --> 01:36:42,159
that talk about

2592
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:42,960
indigenous people from what perspective

2593
01:36:42,159 --> 01:36:46,400
did they write

2594
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:50,880
them did they write about those recipes

2595
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:53,920
as recipes and food

2596
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:54,800
that is not only for eating but it is

2597
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:57,280
also for

2598
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:58,239
for spirituality it's also for

2599
01:36:57,280 --> 01:37:01,600
well-being

2600
01:36:58,239 --> 01:37:04,560
it is also for connecting people with

2601
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:04,560
the environment

2602
01:37:04,639 --> 01:37:08,480
when they refuse to say no not those you

2603
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:12,239
have to understand that

2604
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:12,880
they're probably taken from a point of

2605
01:37:12,239 --> 01:37:15,600
the world

2606
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:15,600
views

2607
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:26,080
a point of their own world views

2608
01:37:23,199 --> 01:37:27,040
so indigenous research methodologies is

2609
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:30,080
not about

2610
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:33,600
replacing conventional methods

2611
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:37,119
with indigenous research methodologies

2612
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:38,480
it is about a coalition of knowledge

2613
01:37:37,119 --> 01:37:41,639
systems

2614
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:45,440
a coalition that

2615
01:37:41,639 --> 01:37:49,840
recognizes other knowledge systems on

2616
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:49,840
equal footing

2617
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:56,560
it is about

2618
01:37:59,080 --> 01:38:05,760
decolonizing the minds of them

2619
01:38:02,639 --> 01:38:07,040
indigenous people you know indigenous

2620
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:10,480
people

2621
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:17,840
they have been brainwashed

2622
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:17,840
to think that their foods are inferior

2623
01:38:18,239 --> 01:38:26,880
it is therefore about indigenous people

2624
01:38:22,199 --> 01:38:26,880
appreciating their own heritage

2625
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:33,360
where for example they recognize

2626
01:38:30,159 --> 01:38:36,400
indigenous recipes

2627
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:37,199
indigenous foods as food that can

2628
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:40,320
compete

2629
01:38:37,199 --> 01:38:40,320
in the global market

2630
01:38:43,119 --> 01:38:46,239
indigenous research methodologies is

2631
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:48,159
about

2632
01:38:46,239 --> 01:38:50,480
carrying out research informed by

2633
01:38:48,159 --> 01:38:53,600
indigenous world views

2634
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:56,560
ways of perceiving reality and

2635
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:56,560
value systems

2636
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:02,400
those marginalized by western knowledge

2637
01:39:00,159 --> 01:39:06,480
for example can begin by

2638
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:10,639
valuing the indigenous field conducting

2639
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:13,440
community research to remind people

2640
01:39:10,639 --> 01:39:15,520
about the nutritional value of their

2641
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:18,560
foods

2642
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:20,960
and that's the spiritual healing of the

2643
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:20,960
foods

2644
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:24,639
i i happen to

2645
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:28,880
listen to a presentation by one of the

2646
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:31,600
students who had

2647
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:33,600
who was talking about food security in

2648
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:35,920
part of the country

2649
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:36,800
and one of the things that came out was

2650
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:39,679
that

2651
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:40,560
there were some indigenous foods that

2652
01:39:39,679 --> 01:39:43,440
could

2653
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:44,719
help that could stand the vagaries of

2654
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:48,400
the climate

2655
01:39:44,719 --> 01:39:52,159
much much better than those

2656
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:56,400
uh of uh uh crops that have been

2657
01:39:52,159 --> 01:40:00,159
borrowed from the west however

2658
01:39:56,400 --> 01:40:03,600
the people were not willing to grow

2659
01:40:00,159 --> 01:40:04,560
indigenous crops because they've been

2660
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:07,199
brainwashed

2661
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:08,080
to think that eating rice is better than

2662
01:40:07,199 --> 01:40:10,320
eating local

2663
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:10,320
food

2664
01:40:13,119 --> 01:40:21,040
in research on indigenous foods that in

2665
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:23,840
that use an indigenous perspective

2666
01:40:21,040 --> 01:40:24,800
indigenous methodologies as i said

2667
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:28,080
before

2668
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:31,280
it appreciates

2669
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:34,480
the value of food not

2670
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:38,480
only for quenching hunger

2671
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:42,159
but also for spirituality purposes

2672
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:42,159
for connection with the land

2673
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:51,600
an indigenous research worldview

2674
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:52,719
recognizes spirituality that is not

2675
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:55,920
talked about

2676
01:40:52,719 --> 01:40:58,800
in western research

2677
01:40:55,920 --> 01:41:00,320
and for you therefore it will be

2678
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:04,239
appropriate

2679
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:07,760
to research on indigenous food

2680
01:41:04,239 --> 01:41:12,000
using an indigenous world view

2681
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:15,199
that goes beyond western

2682
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:19,239
ways of perceiving reality

2683
01:41:15,199 --> 01:41:24,159
to indigenous ways of seeing reality

2684
01:41:19,239 --> 01:41:24,159
spirituality also is reality

2685
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:36,000
to say that research has to respect

2686
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:39,119
indigenous values is to talk about

2687
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:43,520
eight hours

2688
01:41:39,119 --> 01:41:46,560
that is the art of relationality

2689
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:47,600
this is ethic ethics the ethics of

2690
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:51,520
research

2691
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:54,719
includes relationality which is

2692
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:58,080
doing research that is long-lasting

2693
01:41:54,719 --> 01:42:01,119
you build relationships with the people

2694
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:03,360
not helicopter research where you where

2695
01:42:01,119 --> 01:42:05,040
where you get in and get out as quickly

2696
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:08,159
as possible

2697
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:11,040
it's about respect that is respecting

2698
01:42:08,159 --> 01:42:13,920
the values of the people

2699
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:15,600
respecting their voices giving them a

2700
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:18,960
chance to participate

2701
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:20,080
is about responsity what is it what is

2702
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:23,280
this research

2703
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:26,080
giving back this documentation

2704
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:28,080
and databases what are they giving back

2705
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:31,040
to the communities

2706
01:42:28,080 --> 01:42:32,239
is it okay to archive those in the form

2707
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:34,800
of documents

2708
01:42:32,239 --> 01:42:35,600
knowledge that that has that that the

2709
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:38,400
researcher

2710
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:41,280
got from the the communities while the

2711
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:43,440
communities are hungry

2712
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:46,159
researchers can build their names with

2713
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:47,600
the research this and that

2714
01:42:46,159 --> 01:42:49,840
but what are you giving back to their

2715
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:52,560
communities it's about

2716
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:53,920
responsible research responsible

2717
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:57,280
research is to say

2718
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:59,520
whose research is it who am i for

2719
01:42:57,280 --> 01:43:00,800
as a researcher you always come up with

2720
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:02,960
a point of view

2721
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:04,320
you come into the search with a world

2722
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:06,480
view whose world

2723
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:07,440
view are you using are you looking at

2724
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:09,679
the researcher

2725
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:12,239
as somebody who doesn't know who you are

2726
01:43:09,679 --> 01:43:15,840
helping because you can get funding from

2727
01:43:12,239 --> 01:43:18,239
some sponsor elsewhere or are you only

2728
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:20,400
are you are you getting funds so that

2729
01:43:18,239 --> 01:43:22,840
you can work with the researchers

2730
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:24,239
not for curiosity not to do research for

2731
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:28,080
curiosity

2732
01:43:24,239 --> 01:43:30,960
but to do research that is relevant

2733
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:32,000
for us there is an urgent need for

2734
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:36,840
research that

2735
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:38,159
addresses our problems not research for

2736
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:40,639
curiosity

2737
01:43:38,159 --> 01:43:42,880
of the people to prioritize their

2738
01:43:40,639 --> 01:43:45,040
research agenda

2739
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:46,320
when you now say you are coming up with

2740
01:43:45,040 --> 01:43:49,040
this and that

2741
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:50,639
is that your priority as a researcher or

2742
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:54,159
is that the priority

2743
01:43:50,639 --> 01:43:56,639
of the people reverence people are

2744
01:43:54,159 --> 01:44:00,600
indigenous people are very spiritual

2745
01:43:56,639 --> 01:44:03,280
do you respect their spirituality

2746
01:44:00,600 --> 01:44:04,239
responsiveness as you do research are

2747
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:07,840
you able

2748
01:44:04,239 --> 01:44:10,960
to to respond to the immediate

2749
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:12,239
needs to the changes as you go along and

2750
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:15,199
you do the research

2751
01:44:12,239 --> 01:44:15,760
or do you use book research where you

2752
01:44:15,199 --> 01:44:19,600
say

2753
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:22,159
according to uh this author

2754
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:22,719
this is how it has to be done therefore

2755
01:44:22,159 --> 01:44:24,840
i can't

2756
01:44:22,719 --> 01:44:26,000
change i can't do that i can't do that

2757
01:44:24,840 --> 01:44:28,719
reflexivity

2758
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:29,440
as you do research do you reflect upon

2759
01:44:28,719 --> 01:44:33,119
yourself

2760
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:35,679
and say what uh what what are the kind

2761
01:44:33,119 --> 01:44:38,320
of stereotypes and prejudices

2762
01:44:35,679 --> 01:44:39,199
that i bring into this community do you

2763
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:42,880
reflect

2764
01:44:39,199 --> 01:44:45,920
and lastly decolonization

2765
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:48,719
the ethics is ethics when it

2766
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:50,159
also decolonizes research and to

2767
01:44:48,719 --> 01:44:53,040
decolonize research

2768
01:44:50,159 --> 01:44:53,440
is to allow other people to speak from

2769
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:57,679
their

2770
01:44:53,440 --> 01:45:03,360
own point of view their own

2771
01:44:57,679 --> 01:45:06,560
world views thank you very much

2772
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:08,320
oh thank you so much uh professor

2773
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:11,679
chilisa that was um

2774
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:14,000
brilliant um those eight r's i think are

2775
01:45:11,679 --> 01:45:17,119
really useful principles for all

2776
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:17,840
research um does anybody have any

2777
01:45:17,119 --> 01:45:20,239
questions

2778
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:21,119
because we have just a couple of minutes

2779
01:45:20,239 --> 01:45:24,320
and then we'll

2780
01:45:21,119 --> 01:45:24,320
move on to the next one

2781
01:45:27,199 --> 01:45:32,880
i can't see any questions um

2782
01:45:30,239 --> 01:45:33,760
i think we're all absorbing just a quick

2783
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:38,560
thing i think

2784
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:38,560
um you know she hit the nail

2785
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:44,480
on the there needs to be a reverence

2786
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:45,520
to the knowledge that it's being

2787
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:48,400
produced

2788
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:49,600
because at times um you know this is

2789
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:51,199
something that also i

2790
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:53,600
i kind of like talk about that there's

2791
01:45:51,199 --> 01:45:54,960
food that it's of nutrition or value

2792
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:56,320
that is good for you but there's like

2793
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:58,480
good for your well-being and that's

2794
01:45:56,320 --> 01:46:01,119
something important that at times

2795
01:45:58,480 --> 01:46:02,400
get get doesn't come through the

2796
01:46:01,119 --> 01:46:04,560
research

2797
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:06,000
um and especially with at least i work

2798
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:07,679
in the caribbean and

2799
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:09,199
the indigenous communities there are not

2800
01:46:07,679 --> 01:46:10,960
recognized so

2801
01:46:09,199 --> 01:46:12,239
and there's all these ideas of they were

2802
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:15,360
all exterminated

2803
01:46:12,239 --> 01:46:16,960
during the colonial times so their

2804
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:18,719
practices and spiritualities that are

2805
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:21,360
still active and

2806
01:46:18,719 --> 01:46:22,400
also by recognizing them from a research

2807
01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:26,320
point of view

2808
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:28,400
we are also giving them the agency

2809
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:29,360
and the recognition that they deserve

2810
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:32,800
outside

2811
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:32,800
of their own circles

2812
01:46:33,440 --> 01:46:38,480
um thank you so much i have one question

2813
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:41,679
i am missing one of the r's

2814
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:45,080
could we have a list

2815
01:46:41,679 --> 01:46:49,520
is relationality respect

2816
01:46:45,080 --> 01:46:54,280
responsibility responsibility

2817
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:59,840
rights reverence responsiveness

2818
01:46:54,280 --> 01:46:59,840
reflexivity and decolonization

2819
01:47:00,320 --> 01:47:06,159
thank you so much i think you know you

2820
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:08,880
remind us that we all have our own

2821
01:47:06,159 --> 01:47:09,760
worldview researchers they see what what

2822
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:11,679
they see

2823
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:13,600
through their own lens they don't

2824
01:47:11,679 --> 01:47:15,280
document the spirituality because it's

2825
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:17,600
not part of their own culture

2826
01:47:15,280 --> 01:47:19,119
so we need to leave our culture behind

2827
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:21,360
and step into

2828
01:47:19,119 --> 01:47:22,639
and see things and be guided by your

2829
01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:25,840
worldview

2830
01:47:22,639 --> 01:47:29,760
so that we can do the research properly

2831
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:31,440
but anyway thank you so much and um

2832
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:34,320
we'll have hopefully a bit more time for

2833
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:37,760
discussion later but that was wonderful

2834
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:41,199
i'd like now to pass on to um

2835
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:45,840
uh so florence um daggy tan

2836
01:47:41,199 --> 01:47:48,880
she's from the philippines and um

2837
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:50,360
to briefly introduce she is a

2838
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:56,380
um

2839
01:47:50,360 --> 01:47:56,380
[Music]

2840
01:47:58,320 --> 01:48:01,360
is one of the seven ethnic linguistic

2841
01:48:00,719 --> 01:48:03,760
groups

2842
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:06,239
known as the igarots in the cordillera

2843
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:09,440
of the northern philippines

2844
01:48:06,239 --> 01:48:11,040
and she's going to talk about indigenous

2845
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:12,400
methods for research on agri-food

2846
01:48:11,040 --> 01:48:15,840
systems in the philippines

2847
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:18,880
she's also working at teb tebber

2848
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:21,520
good evening everyone it's

2849
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:22,639
it's i think eight o'clock in our in our

2850
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:26,719
area so i say

2851
01:48:22,639 --> 01:48:29,760
good evening or good noon good afternoon

2852
01:48:26,719 --> 01:48:32,719
i'm happy to be here and

2853
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:33,840
i thank i thank also the opportunity for

2854
01:48:32,719 --> 01:48:37,679
me to speak

2855
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:39,040
on our experience i'm speaking as an

2856
01:48:37,679 --> 01:48:42,320
indigenous person

2857
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:45,600
who has also gone to the academic world

2858
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:46,320
but my res my involvement in the

2859
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:48,800
research

2860
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:50,639
in the search for appropriate research

2861
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:53,760
methodologies

2862
01:48:50,639 --> 01:48:55,440
comes from a being part of uh of a

2863
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:58,719
people's movement

2864
01:48:55,440 --> 01:49:00,960
first from the advocates of the organic

2865
01:48:58,719 --> 01:49:04,080
agriculture sustainable farming

2866
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:06,719
ecological agriculture agroecology

2867
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:09,360
things like that and then second as an

2868
01:49:06,719 --> 01:49:09,920
advocate for the promotion of indigenous

2869
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:13,040
people's

2870
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:14,239
rights for for its fulfillment and

2871
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:17,760
respect

2872
01:49:14,239 --> 01:49:20,400
so from the very start of my work

2873
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:22,719
just upon my college days because that

2874
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:25,199
was so much activism in the philippines

2875
01:49:22,719 --> 01:49:28,880
that was the time of march alone

2876
01:49:25,199 --> 01:49:32,080
we were fortunate enough to be given uh

2877
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:35,199
the correct orientation of working

2878
01:49:32,080 --> 01:49:38,320
for the people and with the people

2879
01:49:35,199 --> 01:49:40,639
so uh so we were taught

2880
01:49:38,320 --> 01:49:42,000
that our people indigenous peoples in

2881
01:49:40,639 --> 01:49:45,199
the era

2882
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:48,000
or indigenous peoples of the world

2883
01:49:45,199 --> 01:49:49,280
create and produce knowledge from their

2884
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:52,000
day-to-day life

2885
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:54,080
as they relate with their nature and the

2886
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:57,679
land

2887
01:49:54,080 --> 01:49:59,679
the monitor changes events places

2888
01:49:57,679 --> 01:50:01,520
they closely observe what is in their

2889
01:49:59,679 --> 01:50:05,199
surroundings

2890
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:07,679
and discover new ways of doing things

2891
01:50:05,199 --> 01:50:10,560
whatever they discover they share to

2892
01:50:07,679 --> 01:50:13,599
whoever is interested in the community

2893
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:15,760
like a better way of restoring the seeds

2894
01:50:13,599 --> 01:50:16,800
the part of the forest where such trees

2895
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:20,159
can be found

2896
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:23,280
and others this knowledge

2897
01:50:20,159 --> 01:50:27,280
are shared in various ways in different

2898
01:50:23,280 --> 01:50:30,400
venues and these are stored in stories

2899
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:32,960
epics songs chants

2900
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:33,920
in the memories of our people but they

2901
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:37,199
are shared

2902
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:41,679
very or orally and this

2903
01:50:37,199 --> 01:50:44,560
we have this in in at present today

2904
01:50:41,679 --> 01:50:45,599
so we see that people have been creating

2905
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:49,040
knowledge and

2906
01:50:45,599 --> 01:50:52,639
producing knowledge yet

2907
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:53,520
when we go to the communities and invite

2908
01:50:52,639 --> 01:50:56,880
some group

2909
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:59,920
to do a research or

2910
01:50:56,880 --> 01:51:01,599
because we were also told that to to

2911
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:04,719
work in the community

2912
01:51:01,599 --> 01:51:07,199
you have to start where the people are

2913
01:51:04,719 --> 01:51:07,760
so we have to do the research but if we

2914
01:51:07,199 --> 01:51:11,119
invite

2915
01:51:07,760 --> 01:51:15,280
some groups to do that research with us

2916
01:51:11,119 --> 01:51:17,679
then they will say oh if it's research

2917
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:18,639
it's not for us it's for the school

2918
01:51:17,679 --> 01:51:21,760
people

2919
01:51:18,639 --> 01:51:23,920
those who come from the academy or those

2920
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:26,960
who went to the universities

2921
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:30,800
so we see a manifestation of

2922
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:31,199
the colonized research in our lands also

2923
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:34,320
uh

2924
01:51:31,199 --> 01:51:36,400
uh even at this time

2925
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:38,320
so the first challenge that we need to

2926
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:41,679
transcend

2927
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:44,000
is to reiterate that people themselves

2928
01:51:41,679 --> 01:51:45,760
are doing their own research and

2929
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:49,840
creation of knowledge

2930
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:49,840
in their day-to-day life

2931
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:57,679
in this event i would like to share

2932
01:51:55,679 --> 01:51:59,760
some of the effective indigenous

2933
01:51:57,679 --> 01:52:03,280
research methods

2934
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:05,840
that we have that that we do to

2935
01:52:03,280 --> 01:52:07,599
especially in doing research in

2936
01:52:05,840 --> 01:52:10,560
agri-food systems

2937
01:52:07,599 --> 01:52:11,840
and when i'm when i was writing this it

2938
01:52:10,560 --> 01:52:14,320
seems they are very much

2939
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:16,480
uh i think all of you knows this it's

2940
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:19,679
just a matter of saying it

2941
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:22,639
so one is the mapping

2942
01:52:19,679 --> 01:52:23,599
or walking through our territory which

2943
01:52:22,639 --> 01:52:26,239
is the

2944
01:52:23,599 --> 01:52:27,280
essay which is the sense of place and

2945
01:52:26,239 --> 01:52:30,719
identity for

2946
01:52:27,280 --> 01:52:32,400
us so in the mapping some of the many

2947
01:52:30,719 --> 01:52:34,400
things that we can

2948
01:52:32,400 --> 01:52:36,080
draw or generate from the mapping

2949
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:37,599
exercise or walking through our

2950
01:52:36,080 --> 01:52:41,199
territories

2951
01:52:37,599 --> 01:52:43,599
is are the diversity of the food crops

2952
01:52:41,199 --> 01:52:45,760
the different kinds of food crops in the

2953
01:52:43,599 --> 01:52:49,599
cultivated area

2954
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:52,159
we we can list as many as 40 kinds

2955
01:52:49,599 --> 01:52:53,440
with each kinds of different varieties

2956
01:52:52,159 --> 01:52:56,080
so you see

2957
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:56,560
hundreds of varieties of food crops in

2958
01:52:56,080 --> 01:53:00,239
our

2959
01:52:56,560 --> 01:53:01,199
cultivated crops but we can also see the

2960
01:53:00,239 --> 01:53:03,920
location

2961
01:53:01,199 --> 01:53:05,520
of the naturally occurring wild plants

2962
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:10,639
and animals

2963
01:53:05,520 --> 01:53:10,639
that are part of of the people's diet

2964
01:53:11,119 --> 01:53:16,560
how the whole territory contributes to

2965
01:53:14,080 --> 01:53:18,800
the community's diet

2966
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:20,080
we can also locate the abode of the

2967
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:23,199
unseen

2968
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:25,920
because these are very important to us

2969
01:53:23,199 --> 01:53:28,560
they have to have a share of the food

2970
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:31,040
but when you look deeper into it

2971
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:32,880
it has so much a lot to do with the

2972
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:37,040
conservation of the

2973
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:40,320
species or the regeneration of species

2974
01:53:37,040 --> 01:53:43,440
like one one belief is that

2975
01:53:40,320 --> 01:53:44,560
if there is one bamboo shoot you should

2976
01:53:43,440 --> 01:53:46,639
not be taking it

2977
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:48,320
because it's for the spirits or it's for

2978
01:53:46,639 --> 01:53:50,800
the unseen

2979
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:53,599
and if you if you look at that in the

2980
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:55,760
scientific language then you will say

2981
01:53:53,599 --> 01:53:57,440
that's for the regeneration so that

2982
01:53:55,760 --> 01:53:59,760
something will come out again and

2983
01:53:57,440 --> 01:54:02,719
reproduce itself

2984
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:04,880
and in the sacred sites or are also the

2985
01:54:02,719 --> 01:54:08,239
abode of our spirits

2986
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:10,560
uh you cannot go and hunt there so it's

2987
01:54:08,239 --> 01:54:13,599
a sanctuary for the science also

2988
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:15,840
for us it's about of the unseen who are

2989
01:54:13,599 --> 01:54:18,639
our companions in our territory

2990
01:54:15,840 --> 01:54:20,960
but i think for scientists it's the

2991
01:54:18,639 --> 01:54:23,199
sanctuary of fauna and flora

2992
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:24,080
so they appreciate it very much but they

2993
01:54:23,199 --> 01:54:26,639
will say

2994
01:54:24,080 --> 01:54:28,560
we are superstitious if we say we do not

2995
01:54:26,639 --> 01:54:31,040
go there because it's the mode of the

2996
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:31,040
spirit

2997
01:54:31,280 --> 01:54:37,440
and in the mapping we did some upgrading

2998
01:54:34,560 --> 01:54:38,800
so we also build their capacity to use

2999
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:41,599
the gps

3000
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:43,360
and also to build the 3d map so that

3001
01:54:41,599 --> 01:54:44,000
then they can always come back to their

3002
01:54:43,360 --> 01:54:46,000
map

3003
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:47,760
and talk about the things that we'd like

3004
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:50,719
to talk

3005
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:52,880
the second methodology is the use of

3006
01:54:50,719 --> 01:54:55,599
traditional calendar

3007
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:58,080
it shows the availability of the food at

3008
01:54:55,599 --> 01:55:02,639
what time of the year

3009
01:54:58,080 --> 01:55:05,119
the time to plan and the time to harvest

3010
01:55:02,639 --> 01:55:06,000
the time not to disturb the wild animals

3011
01:55:05,119 --> 01:55:08,320
in the forest

3012
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:09,599
the fishes in their iceland the fishes

3013
01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:11,280
in the rivers

3014
01:55:09,599 --> 01:55:12,639
because this is the time for them to

3015
01:55:11,280 --> 01:55:16,320
mate and reproduce

3016
01:55:12,639 --> 01:55:19,040
again and the indicators of changes in

3017
01:55:16,320 --> 01:55:22,320
the weather

3018
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:25,199
the third methodology is storytelling

3019
01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:26,639
it can show certain food how certain

3020
01:55:25,199 --> 01:55:29,760
food are valued

3021
01:55:26,639 --> 01:55:31,360
and why it can show changes

3022
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:34,719
in the consumption and production

3023
01:55:31,360 --> 01:55:36,960
pattern of our people

3024
01:55:34,719 --> 01:55:38,639
how the wilds are protected and how

3025
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:42,159
seeds are conserved

3026
01:55:38,639 --> 01:55:42,159
and how seeds are exchanged

3027
01:55:42,239 --> 01:55:46,320
it can it can show also why we do

3028
01:55:44,719 --> 01:55:49,679
certain rituals

3029
01:55:46,320 --> 01:55:52,400
especially in our rice land every step

3030
01:55:49,679 --> 01:55:55,040
of our every stage of the production

3031
01:55:52,400 --> 01:55:58,239
cycle of the rice land we do retails

3032
01:55:55,040 --> 01:56:02,800
so then our elders will

3033
01:55:58,239 --> 01:56:06,239
explain why we have to do those rituals

3034
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:11,040
and then the compare and contrast

3035
01:56:06,239 --> 01:56:12,239
method how commu how community elders

3036
01:56:11,040 --> 01:56:14,880
and leaders

3037
01:56:12,239 --> 01:56:16,960
are more proactive in the past than in

3038
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:19,119
the present because of the assimilation

3039
01:56:16,960 --> 01:56:21,360
that is ongoing to us

3040
01:56:19,119 --> 01:56:24,800
and how they were able to cope with food

3041
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:24,800
scarcity and farming

3042
01:56:26,320 --> 01:56:30,719
the other is uh but now we rely on the

3043
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:33,920
government

3044
01:56:30,719 --> 01:56:34,719
sometimes we we forget that we have our

3045
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:39,280
own

3046
01:56:34,719 --> 01:56:42,080
uh ways of or our own self-reliance

3047
01:56:39,280 --> 01:56:43,520
the other is the other method is the

3048
01:56:42,080 --> 01:56:47,040
learning by doing

3049
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:48,239
when we do innovations in in our farming

3050
01:56:47,040 --> 01:56:51,199
system

3051
01:56:48,239 --> 01:56:52,800
like production of organic farm inputs

3052
01:56:51,199 --> 01:56:54,639
and if this is the

3053
01:56:52,800 --> 01:56:57,280
these are the times that we call

3054
01:56:54,639 --> 01:56:58,480
sometimes we call on scientists to help

3055
01:56:57,280 --> 01:57:02,800
us here

3056
01:56:58,480 --> 01:57:05,599
like uh soil testing of of soil tests

3057
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:07,840
if we do a production of we use our

3058
01:57:05,599 --> 01:57:11,599
resources to produce fertilizers

3059
01:57:07,840 --> 01:57:13,520
and we also use modern technology and

3060
01:57:11,599 --> 01:57:15,679
to face and decomposition things like

3061
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:17,840
that so we call on the scientists to

3062
01:57:15,679 --> 01:57:21,280
help us with the laboratory work

3063
01:57:17,840 --> 01:57:24,560
of if our soils are improving if the

3064
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:26,080
insects are more diverse insect

3065
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:28,080
population

3066
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:29,360
and then we also test the traditional

3067
01:57:28,080 --> 01:57:31,920
indicators

3068
01:57:29,360 --> 01:57:32,880
like for alkaline soil they say that

3069
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:35,119
sour

3070
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:36,400
and for acidic they say it's they taste

3071
01:57:35,119 --> 01:57:38,400
it as

3072
01:57:36,400 --> 01:57:39,920
bitter so we can test that in the

3073
01:57:38,400 --> 01:57:42,080
laboratory

3074
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:45,040
it's not validation but i think it's in

3075
01:57:42,080 --> 01:57:45,040
also enriching

3076
01:57:45,119 --> 01:57:48,880
and then that you one of the actual

3077
01:57:47,679 --> 01:57:53,119
things too is the

3078
01:57:48,880 --> 01:57:56,159
cooking of traditional crops

3079
01:57:53,119 --> 01:57:59,040
results and outcomes comes even

3080
01:57:56,159 --> 01:57:59,520
as early as uh it depends on what you

3081
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:02,560
are

3082
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:05,040
researching or studying

3083
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:07,119
but but the most the most essential part

3084
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:09,920
is the collective analysis

3085
01:58:07,119 --> 01:58:11,520
it's one of the most essential process

3086
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:14,719
which may lead to fall

3087
01:58:11,520 --> 01:58:16,400
policy formulation like comparing and

3088
01:58:14,719 --> 01:58:18,400
contrasting the food

3089
01:58:16,400 --> 01:58:20,239
of the past and the present and the

3090
01:58:18,400 --> 01:58:22,560
health of the children

3091
01:58:20,239 --> 01:58:24,080
and then they will say oh let's ban the

3092
01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:26,080
junk food

3093
01:58:24,080 --> 01:58:27,199
but it will also have to have a

3094
01:58:26,080 --> 01:58:30,320
commitment

3095
01:58:27,199 --> 01:58:32,239
from the women to retrieve the

3096
01:58:30,320 --> 01:58:36,080
traditional food that they used to have

3097
01:58:32,239 --> 01:58:38,880
as a snacks things like that uh

3098
01:58:36,080 --> 01:58:39,280
yeah and then it can also lead to action

3099
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:42,320
like

3100
01:58:39,280 --> 01:58:44,400
reviving the our backyard gardens things

3101
01:58:42,320 --> 01:58:47,520
like that

3102
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:48,000
for those are the things that we do and

3103
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:51,440
then

3104
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:53,920
for recommendation yeah of course

3105
01:58:51,440 --> 01:58:56,239
full and effect if if it's an outsider

3106
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:59,119
who is coming to our communities

3107
01:58:56,239 --> 01:59:01,119
the full and effective participation of

3108
01:58:59,119 --> 01:59:04,239
the community should be first

3109
01:59:01,119 --> 01:59:07,679
insured and then

3110
01:59:04,239 --> 01:59:08,000
yeah also indigenous peoples have also

3111
01:59:07,679 --> 01:59:10,080
come

3112
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:13,440
to do their community research and they

3113
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:16,800
should be supported

3114
01:59:13,440 --> 01:59:21,599
and to also build our capacities

3115
01:59:16,800 --> 01:59:24,639
and more important is to aya

3116
01:59:21,599 --> 01:59:27,440
i think more important is that research

3117
01:59:24,639 --> 01:59:28,400
should be an educational process for the

3118
01:59:27,440 --> 01:59:31,360
facilitator

3119
01:59:28,400 --> 01:59:33,920
and the communities and that the output

3120
01:59:31,360 --> 01:59:36,400
of research like the knowledge produced

3121
01:59:33,920 --> 01:59:37,920
should be first should first benefit the

3122
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:40,880
community

3123
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:42,840
for me also i still find it uh an

3124
01:59:40,880 --> 01:59:45,760
internal conflict

3125
01:59:42,840 --> 01:59:48,800
on publishing

3126
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:52,000
yeah because sometimes uh funders

3127
01:59:48,800 --> 01:59:54,480
would like publishing but for me it will

3128
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:56,320
not matter if you publish or not but it

3129
01:59:54,480 --> 01:59:59,199
matters very much

3130
01:59:56,320 --> 02:00:00,080
that what has the community learned and

3131
01:59:59,199 --> 02:00:02,719
what actual

3132
02:00:00,080 --> 02:00:04,239
what awareness has been created and what

3133
02:00:02,719 --> 02:00:07,119
actions have been

3134
02:00:04,239 --> 02:00:08,000
done because of that research process

3135
02:00:07,119 --> 02:00:11,199
and of course

3136
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:12,960
uh i know also that we indigenous while

3137
02:00:11,199 --> 02:00:15,199
we have this

3138
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:16,960
yeah profound wisdom things like that

3139
02:00:15,199 --> 02:00:20,000
but we also have to work

3140
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:22,239
with other collaborators thank you very

3141
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,239
much

3142
02:00:23,599 --> 02:00:27,280
oh thank you so much florence that was

3143
02:00:25,840 --> 02:00:29,760
really great

3144
02:00:27,280 --> 02:00:31,920
and um it was really interesting to

3145
02:00:29,760 --> 02:00:34,159
learn about your methods

3146
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:36,159
um about the mapping and so on

3147
02:00:34,159 --> 02:00:39,040
storytelling

3148
02:00:36,159 --> 02:00:40,000
um we have a little bit of time if

3149
02:00:39,040 --> 02:00:44,320
anybody would like to

3150
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:44,320
ask a question or make a comment

3151
02:00:44,719 --> 02:00:50,480
um this is sanjukta gosh from the soy

3152
02:00:47,920 --> 02:00:54,239
south asia institute i'm a historian

3153
02:00:50,480 --> 02:00:56,560
and researcher on agricultural knowledge

3154
02:00:54,239 --> 02:00:57,280
my question is really related to the

3155
02:00:56,560 --> 02:01:00,000
methods

3156
02:00:57,280 --> 02:01:00,880
in indigenous knowledge that we just

3157
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:03,040
heard

3158
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:05,760
and i was curious to know you know who

3159
02:01:03,040 --> 02:01:08,000
guards these agricultural calendars

3160
02:01:05,760 --> 02:01:09,199
that you were talking about is it still

3161
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:12,560
with the elders

3162
02:01:09,199 --> 02:01:16,080
or is it also something that the

3163
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:18,080
young and the women are involved in um

3164
02:01:16,080 --> 02:01:19,199
and and how is you know agricultural

3165
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:21,920
calendar is again

3166
02:01:19,199 --> 02:01:22,880
very based on a very long-term

3167
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:26,639
understanding

3168
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:28,320
of how seasons work and how crops and

3169
02:01:26,639 --> 02:01:31,760
animals behave

3170
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:32,239
so i'm just curious how you're building

3171
02:01:31,760 --> 02:01:35,040
in

3172
02:01:32,239 --> 02:01:36,159
this whole notion of climate change with

3173
02:01:35,040 --> 02:01:38,639
a more traditional

3174
02:01:36,159 --> 02:01:41,040
agricultural calendar that is in place

3175
02:01:38,639 --> 02:01:42,719
so are these things taken into account

3176
02:01:41,040 --> 02:01:43,440
when you're changing practices or

3177
02:01:42,719 --> 02:01:46,719
whether you're

3178
02:01:43,440 --> 02:01:50,080
creating new calendars uh that's just

3179
02:01:46,719 --> 02:01:53,040
something i had in mind yeah

3180
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:54,639
yeah thanks very thank you for the

3181
02:01:53,040 --> 02:01:57,599
question

3182
02:01:54,639 --> 02:01:59,199
uh at present actually in in the areas

3183
02:01:57,599 --> 02:02:03,199
that i have gone

3184
02:01:59,199 --> 02:02:06,719
climate change is actually uh

3185
02:02:03,199 --> 02:02:09,599
in it does not fit in their calendar so

3186
02:02:06,719 --> 02:02:10,639
it's uh for them also for the for our

3187
02:02:09,599 --> 02:02:14,239
elders

3188
02:02:10,639 --> 02:02:17,199
there's also uh because

3189
02:02:14,239 --> 02:02:18,639
when they follow the rice cycle they

3190
02:02:17,199 --> 02:02:21,280
have indicators

3191
02:02:18,639 --> 02:02:24,000
like the coming of certain birds the

3192
02:02:21,280 --> 02:02:27,119
flowering of certain crops

3193
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:29,119
and they cannot uh many times they

3194
02:02:27,119 --> 02:02:32,560
cannot see it anymore

3195
02:02:29,119 --> 02:02:35,119
and so and then also the coming of

3196
02:02:32,560 --> 02:02:38,080
varieties that those are all those are

3197
02:02:35,119 --> 02:02:41,520
also taken into consideration

3198
02:02:38,080 --> 02:02:43,840
but uh so

3199
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:46,159
so they say how how do we deal how do

3200
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:48,719
they deal with that but

3201
02:02:46,159 --> 02:02:50,239
from from the stories that i heard it

3202
02:02:48,719 --> 02:02:54,159
says they

3203
02:02:50,239 --> 02:02:57,199
more and more they do not rely on the

3204
02:02:54,159 --> 02:03:00,320
the indicators on the changing season

3205
02:02:57,199 --> 02:03:02,080
but more and more they rely on dreams so

3206
02:03:00,320 --> 02:03:05,360
uh

3207
02:03:02,080 --> 02:03:07,360
but but then also if uh because that

3208
02:03:05,360 --> 02:03:10,080
calendar also synchronizes

3209
02:03:07,360 --> 02:03:12,239
the activities right and it has a lot of

3210
02:03:10,080 --> 02:03:15,760
to do of labor allocation

3211
02:03:12,239 --> 02:03:17,280
pest control management so our elders

3212
02:03:15,760 --> 02:03:19,840
are actually grappling

3213
02:03:17,280 --> 02:03:21,199
with this change erratic changes in

3214
02:03:19,840 --> 02:03:24,320
weather and season

3215
02:03:21,199 --> 02:03:25,679
yeah so that's that's one of the

3216
02:03:24,320 --> 02:03:29,760
challenge that we need

3217
02:03:25,679 --> 02:03:32,880
also to have collaborative work

3218
02:03:29,760 --> 02:03:32,880
with scientists

3219
02:03:37,280 --> 02:03:41,119
great thank you so much is there any

3220
02:03:39,360 --> 02:03:45,199
other question

3221
02:03:41,119 --> 02:03:48,239
for florence or comment

3222
02:03:45,199 --> 02:03:51,760
or other sharing from others

3223
02:03:48,239 --> 02:03:55,040
yeah i mean i have to say florence

3224
02:03:51,760 --> 02:03:56,480
and both and baguel it so much of what

3225
02:03:55,040 --> 02:03:59,119
you said resonated with

3226
02:03:56,480 --> 02:03:59,920
what i know um from indigenous research

3227
02:03:59,119 --> 02:04:03,679
methods

3228
02:03:59,920 --> 02:04:04,960
in in the andes um in the potato park

3229
02:04:03,679 --> 02:04:07,280
and maize park

3230
02:04:04,960 --> 02:04:09,040
and there's there's a lot of similarity

3231
02:04:07,280 --> 02:04:09,280
um because i didn't know about you know

3232
02:04:09,040 --> 02:04:11,440
the

3233
02:04:09,280 --> 02:04:12,480
the ones florence and the philippines

3234
02:04:11,440 --> 02:04:14,960
and but the

3235
02:04:12,480 --> 02:04:16,000
the mapping by walking through the

3236
02:04:14,960 --> 02:04:19,280
landscape

3237
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:22,880
through the territory and um

3238
02:04:19,280 --> 02:04:25,280
and storytelling um

3239
02:04:22,880 --> 02:04:26,719
and and many of the principles that both

3240
02:04:25,280 --> 02:04:30,400
of you talked about

3241
02:04:26,719 --> 02:04:32,079
i seem to be quite universal in terms of

3242
02:04:30,400 --> 02:04:34,000
you know being important for indigenous

3243
02:04:32,079 --> 02:04:36,800
communities being useful

3244
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:37,280
something that's useful directly to you

3245
02:04:36,800 --> 02:04:40,480
um

3246
02:04:37,280 --> 02:04:43,599
was emphasized by both of you

3247
02:04:40,480 --> 02:04:46,480
um right

3248
02:04:43,599 --> 02:04:48,480
so um i don't know if anybody else wants

3249
02:04:46,480 --> 02:04:49,599
to make any comment feel free to jump in

3250
02:04:48,480 --> 02:04:53,840
and just share your

3251
02:04:49,599 --> 02:04:53,840
thoughts or reactions

3252
02:04:55,679 --> 02:04:59,040
but not also question when i was talking

3253
02:04:58,079 --> 02:05:00,599
and now

3254
02:04:59,040 --> 02:05:02,159
i think also the elders are

3255
02:05:00,599 --> 02:05:05,280
triangulating

3256
02:05:02,159 --> 02:05:08,560
like their dreams their the

3257
02:05:05,280 --> 02:05:11,119
the changes the indicators of seasons

3258
02:05:08,560 --> 02:05:13,520
and then where the sun strikes in the

3259
02:05:11,119 --> 02:05:15,360
morning

3260
02:05:13,520 --> 02:05:16,560
yeah because these are the the things

3261
02:05:15,360 --> 02:05:19,280
that lead them to

3262
02:05:16,560 --> 02:05:21,840
declare this is that we start the season

3263
02:05:19,280 --> 02:05:21,840
of planting

3264
02:05:21,920 --> 02:05:25,840
thank you so much florence it was really

3265
02:05:24,480 --> 02:05:28,560
brilliant

3266
02:05:25,840 --> 02:05:29,599
okay well in that case um we should

3267
02:05:28,560 --> 02:05:34,480
probably

3268
02:05:29,599 --> 02:05:37,599
jump to um alejandro's presentation

3269
02:05:34,480 --> 02:05:37,599

methodologies that the ngo andes has

3286
02:06:20,159 --> 02:06:25,280
developed with the potato park

3287
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:26,719
and the maize park communities uh please

3288
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:29,840
go ahead alejandra

3289
02:06:26,719 --> 02:06:30,639

um it's a pleasure and an honor to

3293
02:06:36,560 --> 02:06:42,000
participate in this

3294
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:45,280
panel um with

3295
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:48,639
so distinguished practitioners

3296
02:06:45,280 --> 02:06:51,599
and activists and intellectuals

3297
02:06:48,639 --> 02:06:51,599
all individuals

3298
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:59,920
so my greetings um

3299
02:06:55,440 --> 02:07:03,599
i wanted to share a few slides because

3300
02:06:59,920 --> 02:07:06,159
for us visuals

3301
02:07:03,599 --> 02:07:06,159
dreaming

3302
02:07:06,800 --> 02:07:14,800
imagining envisioning captures

3303
02:07:10,719 --> 02:07:17,280
this very intimate

3304
02:07:14,800 --> 02:07:18,960
relationship that we have with time with

3305
02:07:17,280 --> 02:07:23,119
a space

3306
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:28,079
and it encapsulates those dreams

3307
02:07:23,119 --> 02:07:28,079
that we continue to have and

3308
02:07:28,239 --> 02:07:35,800
the picture you see is well known as

3309
02:07:32,320 --> 02:07:40,079
machu picchu but it

3310
02:07:35,800 --> 02:07:44,639
epitomizes what in digital research

3311
02:07:40,079 --> 02:07:44,639
can do this is

3312
02:07:44,880 --> 02:07:50,960
the an expression of a

3313
02:07:47,920 --> 02:07:55,280
holistic approach

3314
02:07:50,960 --> 02:08:00,480
to how ontologies

3315
02:07:55,280 --> 02:08:04,560
and epistemologies can produce

3316
02:08:00,480 --> 02:08:08,159
uh what we call sumacaosa or wendy beer

3317
02:08:04,560 --> 02:08:11,360
holistic living machu picchu is a

3318
02:08:08,159 --> 02:08:14,560
very um

3319
02:08:11,360 --> 02:08:16,800
intricate all shows a very intricate

3320
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:20,840
relationship between

3321
02:08:16,800 --> 02:08:24,400
you know water management

3322
02:08:20,840 --> 02:08:27,679
so high knowledge of hydraulics

3323
02:08:24,400 --> 02:08:31,280
engineering architecture

3324
02:08:27,679 --> 02:08:34,880
mechanics physics

3325
02:08:31,280 --> 02:08:37,920
but above all it shows this

3326
02:08:34,880 --> 02:08:39,840
relationship with

3327
02:08:37,920 --> 02:08:42,639
deep respect with the environment and i

3328
02:08:39,840 --> 02:08:45,599
think in a current crisis

3329
02:08:42,639 --> 02:08:46,480
and all these pressing socioeconomical

3330
02:08:45,599 --> 02:08:50,239
political

3331
02:08:46,480 --> 02:08:55,119
and ecological challenges that we are

3332
02:08:50,239 --> 02:08:55,119
facing this type of knowledge

3333
02:08:56,079 --> 02:09:05,599
it has become very important in terms of

3334
02:09:00,639 --> 02:09:08,800
how we can weep new tomorrows

3335
02:09:05,599 --> 02:09:10,480
so in our part of the world we are a

3336
02:09:08,800 --> 02:09:12,560
product of

3337
02:09:10,480 --> 02:09:13,840
like you see much much richer as a

3338
02:09:12,560 --> 02:09:17,280
product of

3339
02:09:13,840 --> 02:09:17,280
indigenous scholars

3340
02:09:17,440 --> 02:09:24,639
looking for uh

3341
02:09:20,719 --> 02:09:28,360
reaching this goal of wendy beer

3342
02:09:24,639 --> 02:09:31,119
so this embodies uh

3343
02:09:28,360 --> 02:09:33,280
spirituality a relationship with the

3344
02:09:31,119 --> 02:09:35,599
natural world

3345
02:09:33,280 --> 02:09:36,400
which is the cornerstone of this

3346
02:09:35,599 --> 02:09:39,679
conception

3347
02:09:36,400 --> 02:09:40,719
of knowledge and therefore the purpose

3348
02:09:39,679 --> 02:09:44,880
of research

3349
02:09:40,719 --> 02:09:49,520
is established there and

3350
02:09:44,880 --> 02:09:52,560
expressing principles and values um

3351
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:56,480
we see in our

3352
02:09:52,560 --> 02:09:59,920
past how

3353
02:09:56,480 --> 02:10:01,280
this ontological and epistemic

3354
02:09:59,920 --> 02:10:04,560
principles

3355
02:10:01,280 --> 02:10:07,679
are embedded on

3356
02:10:04,560 --> 02:10:10,000
how our ancestors have passed all

3357
02:10:07,679 --> 02:10:13,679
knowledge to us

3358
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:16,880
and our responsibility to

3359
02:10:13,679 --> 02:10:17,440
keep evolving to keep using this

3360
02:10:16,880 --> 02:10:20,880
knowledge

3361
02:10:17,440 --> 02:10:21,679
and evolving to respond to challenges of

3362
02:10:20,880 --> 02:10:25,199
via

3363
02:10:21,679 --> 02:10:28,480
the future key principles here

3364
02:10:25,199 --> 02:10:31,679
are relationality

3365
02:10:28,480 --> 02:10:32,520
initial result research methodologies is

3366
02:10:31,679 --> 02:10:36,320
about

3367
02:10:32,520 --> 02:10:41,520
accountability with the rest of our

3368
02:10:36,320 --> 02:10:45,920
relations so it's not just about humans

3369
02:10:41,520 --> 02:10:49,040
it is reciprocity that reflects with the

3370
02:10:45,920 --> 02:10:52,079
relationship that we have among

3371
02:10:49,040 --> 02:10:52,719
all the living elements that um or

3372
02:10:52,079 --> 02:10:56,960
living

3373
02:10:52,719 --> 02:11:00,159
beings including rocks or air or

3374
02:10:56,960 --> 02:11:04,159
water and that

3375
02:11:00,159 --> 02:11:08,079
live within this

3376
02:11:04,159 --> 02:11:12,560
universe of us and

3377
02:11:08,079 --> 02:11:15,040
also reciprocity we call it ime

3378
02:11:12,560 --> 02:11:15,760
it's important in terms of research

3379
02:11:15,040 --> 02:11:18,480
because it

3380
02:11:15,760 --> 02:11:19,840
questions this positivistic colonial

3381
02:11:18,480 --> 02:11:23,280
worldview

3382
02:11:19,840 --> 02:11:26,480
that research is neutral

3383
02:11:23,280 --> 02:11:30,880
but we have to only provide

3384
02:11:26,480 --> 02:11:35,040
very informed consent as a manner of

3385
02:11:30,880 --> 02:11:38,480
establishing consensual relationship

3386
02:11:35,040 --> 02:11:42,079
when the relationship it's not

3387
02:11:38,480 --> 02:11:45,560
between humans only

3388
02:11:42,079 --> 02:11:47,440
and finally balance which is key to

3389
02:11:45,560 --> 02:11:50,880
sustainability

3390
02:11:47,440 --> 02:11:54,960
and how we seek to

3391
02:11:50,880 --> 02:11:58,800
create um a balanced world

3392
02:11:54,960 --> 02:12:01,840
within the natural and the human world

3393
02:11:58,800 --> 02:12:05,840
within this um as i said um

3394
02:12:01,840 --> 02:12:06,480
we have a a taxonomy that characterized

3395
02:12:05,840 --> 02:12:09,760
this

3396
02:12:06,480 --> 02:12:11,360
where we have three communities three

3397
02:12:09,760 --> 02:12:16,239
ideas

3398
02:12:11,360 --> 02:12:21,199
and our goal is when vivier

3399
02:12:16,239 --> 02:12:24,639
in terms of research methods

3400
02:12:21,199 --> 02:12:29,119
and learning approaches

3401
02:12:24,639 --> 02:12:32,000
i just want to highlight three of them

3402
02:12:29,119 --> 02:12:33,679
which are key to all the research

3403
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:38,159
activities we do

3404
02:12:33,679 --> 02:12:41,920
yachai which means learning with a mind

3405
02:12:38,159 --> 02:12:45,760
yankai which means doing and learning

3406
02:12:41,920 --> 02:12:48,960
with your hands and munai which means

3407
02:12:45,760 --> 02:12:49,599
learning and doing with the heart any

3408
02:12:48,960 --> 02:12:53,440
type of

3409
02:12:49,599 --> 02:12:56,159
action has to be

3410
02:12:53,440 --> 02:12:57,280
carried out or developed within those

3411
02:12:56,159 --> 02:13:01,360
three

3412
02:12:57,280 --> 02:13:05,920
tools of learning and action

3413
02:13:01,360 --> 02:13:10,159
now in terms of decolonizing methods

3414
02:13:05,920 --> 02:13:13,760
that we apply participation based

3415
02:13:10,159 --> 02:13:16,880
in this reciprocal relationship

3416
02:13:13,760 --> 02:13:19,599
between people and the environment

3417
02:13:16,880 --> 02:13:21,840
is key to it with the leadership of

3418
02:13:19,599 --> 02:13:24,840
elders

3419
02:13:21,840 --> 02:13:26,320
where the knowledge transmission and the

3420
02:13:24,840 --> 02:13:31,840
participation

3421
02:13:26,320 --> 02:13:31,840
of youth is key to it

3422
02:13:32,480 --> 02:13:37,760
within this

3423
02:13:35,520 --> 02:13:37,760
we

3424
02:13:38,880 --> 02:13:42,400
continue to

3425
02:13:40,860 --> 02:13:45,520
[Music]

3426
02:13:42,400 --> 02:13:49,040
create tools that go beyond or

3427
02:13:45,520 --> 02:13:52,400
challenges this colonial view

3428
02:13:49,040 --> 02:13:55,520
that boxes individual research methods

3429
02:13:52,400 --> 02:13:58,079
and tools within the hermetic borders

3430
02:13:55,520 --> 02:13:59,280
of convention conventional qualitative

3431
02:13:58,079 --> 02:14:03,280
research

3432
02:13:59,280 --> 02:14:07,199
we are supposed according to that view

3433
02:14:03,280 --> 02:14:07,199
only able to use

3434
02:14:07,679 --> 02:14:15,760
storytelling community mapping

3435
02:14:12,400 --> 02:14:19,520
legends oral tools

3436
02:14:15,760 --> 02:14:23,040
that are key to one part of the research

3437
02:14:19,520 --> 02:14:27,280
but in our case in our case

3438
02:14:23,040 --> 02:14:31,440
we also use

3439
02:14:27,280 --> 02:14:35,119
tools that provide the metrics

3440
02:14:31,440 --> 02:14:38,880
to create data

3441
02:14:35,119 --> 02:14:43,440
which after can be

3442
02:14:38,880 --> 02:14:47,679
used to measure and provide

3443
02:14:43,440 --> 02:14:51,440
numerical results that

3444
02:14:47,679 --> 02:14:55,679
creates a better approaches to solving

3445
02:14:51,440 --> 02:14:58,880
local problems uh here you have an old

3446
02:14:55,679 --> 02:15:01,920
drawing of an in command

3447
02:14:58,880 --> 02:15:04,560
using the kipu

3448
02:15:01,920 --> 02:15:05,760
which in this side of the picture we

3449
02:15:04,560 --> 02:15:09,280
have translated

3450
02:15:05,760 --> 02:15:13,840
into a molecular key which is the same

3451
02:15:09,280 --> 02:15:17,760
approach the same format but it reflects

3452
02:15:13,840 --> 02:15:21,679
what is um what is

3453
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:24,719
within each one of the i2 potatoes like

3454
02:15:21,679 --> 02:15:28,159
in in this case all

3455
02:15:24,719 --> 02:15:28,159
this type of uh

3456
02:15:28,560 --> 02:15:35,119
ranking different types of values

3457
02:15:32,079 --> 02:15:38,400
which we call hupana continues to be

3458
02:15:35,119 --> 02:15:41,840
used by women to rank

3459
02:15:38,400 --> 02:15:45,679
and create give numerical value

3460
02:15:41,840 --> 02:15:48,560
to different uses of medicinal plants or

3461
02:15:45,679 --> 02:15:48,560
other crops

3462
02:15:48,639 --> 02:15:55,040
this also supply in uh

3463
02:15:52,800 --> 02:15:56,400
assessing climate change for for

3464
02:15:55,040 --> 02:16:00,239
instance here

3465
02:15:56,400 --> 02:16:03,599
where we create um

3466
02:16:00,239 --> 02:16:05,040
hubs every 100 meters up in the mountain

3467
02:16:03,599 --> 02:16:08,480
to assess

3468
02:16:05,040 --> 02:16:11,760
population dynamics how

3469
02:16:08,480 --> 02:16:14,320
pests or crops are moving up

3470
02:16:11,760 --> 02:16:15,040
because of climate change this provides

3471
02:16:14,320 --> 02:16:18,960
again

3472
02:16:15,040 --> 02:16:22,960
using the same type of metals and tools

3473
02:16:18,960 --> 02:16:27,440
numerical results that then

3474
02:16:22,960 --> 02:16:31,040
we can use to create solutions

3475
02:16:27,440 --> 02:16:33,920
this has allowed us to

3476
02:16:31,040 --> 02:16:35,439
to harbor in the potato past in the case

3477
02:16:33,920 --> 02:16:38,080
of the potato park

3478
02:16:35,439 --> 02:16:38,800
a large number one of the largest in the

3479
02:16:38,080 --> 02:16:41,840
world of

3480
02:16:38,800 --> 02:16:45,519
uh potato collection

3481
02:16:41,840 --> 02:16:49,599
keep those potatoes continue to do

3482
02:16:45,519 --> 02:16:50,880
research in terms of participatory plant

3483
02:16:49,599 --> 02:16:54,080
breeding

3484
02:16:50,880 --> 02:16:58,719
or the

3485
02:16:54,080 --> 02:16:58,719
collection of these

3486
02:16:58,880 --> 02:17:02,319
varieties that are in dangers of

3487
02:17:01,120 --> 02:17:05,679
disappearing

3488
02:17:02,319 --> 02:17:07,359
and each multiplication and transfer to

3489
02:17:05,679 --> 02:17:11,200
other communities

3490
02:17:07,359 --> 02:17:12,240
so the focus of this as was the focus in

3491
02:17:11,200 --> 02:17:14,960
the inca time

3492
02:17:12,240 --> 02:17:16,080
continue to be how do we create

3493
02:17:14,960 --> 02:17:19,200
solutions

3494
02:17:16,080 --> 02:17:23,359
through food

3495
02:17:19,200 --> 02:17:23,359
also we apply to policy

3496
02:17:23,760 --> 02:17:26,559
no matter how

3497
02:17:26,880 --> 02:17:33,280
supposedly complicated um

3498
02:17:30,080 --> 02:17:36,480
this is an example of

3499
02:17:33,280 --> 02:17:37,599
how we um

3500
02:17:36,480 --> 02:17:40,840
[Music]

3501
02:17:37,599 --> 02:17:42,000
come into conclusions on an evaluation

3502
02:17:40,840 --> 02:17:45,519
on

3503
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:47,040
crispr this new technology that's

3504
02:17:45,519 --> 02:17:52,160
flooring

3505
02:17:47,040 --> 02:17:55,359
many research institutions of the world

3506
02:17:52,160 --> 02:17:57,359
and being again the you know the silver

3507
02:17:55,359 --> 02:18:00,800
bullet that's gonna

3508
02:17:57,359 --> 02:18:01,200
create all these changes when we believe

3509
02:18:00,800 --> 02:18:04,639
that

3510
02:18:01,200 --> 02:18:07,679
um what we have within us uh

3511
02:18:04,639 --> 02:18:11,040
can be the doors to the future so

3512
02:18:07,679 --> 02:18:16,080
to finish um i know

3513
02:18:11,040 --> 02:18:16,080
i have like i'm passing my time um

3514
02:18:16,559 --> 02:18:21,920
this type of research can be perhaps

3515
02:18:19,519 --> 02:18:21,920
better

3516
02:18:22,880 --> 02:18:32,080
beyond itself is the colonizing

3517
02:18:27,439 --> 02:18:34,399
focus also it can be

3518
02:18:32,080 --> 02:18:35,359
conceptualized as some type of

3519
02:18:34,399 --> 02:18:38,960
indigenous

3520
02:18:35,359 --> 02:18:40,880
mixed method strategy that combines

3521
02:18:38,960 --> 02:18:44,639
qualitative and quantitative

3522
02:18:40,880 --> 02:18:48,399
research practices and responds

3523
02:18:44,639 --> 02:18:50,840
to this main objective of summa causa

3524
02:18:48,399 --> 02:18:52,319
which is the aspiration of our

3525
02:18:50,840 --> 02:18:56,080
communities

3526
02:18:52,319 --> 02:18:56,719
and this um as we see in the case of the

3527
02:18:56,080 --> 02:19:00,479
kippu

3528
02:18:56,719 --> 02:19:03,200
or a hupana we use the approp

3529
02:19:00,479 --> 02:19:04,960
the appropriate theoretical frameworks

3530
02:19:03,200 --> 02:19:08,719
to transform those

3531
02:19:04,960 --> 02:19:11,200
old tools into new ways of

3532
02:19:08,719 --> 02:19:12,240
keep learning and keep creating new

3533
02:19:11,200 --> 02:19:15,280
knowledge

3534
02:19:12,240 --> 02:19:18,240
so while

3535
02:19:15,280 --> 02:19:19,760
our research strategy and methods are

3536
02:19:18,240 --> 02:19:23,599
framed within

3537
02:19:19,760 --> 02:19:26,240
a colonial biocultural history

3538
02:19:23,599 --> 02:19:27,120
i think that the principles and values

3539
02:19:26,240 --> 02:19:31,280
that

3540
02:19:27,120 --> 02:19:33,920
are inherent to this practice

3541
02:19:31,280 --> 02:19:34,960
creates also the possibility of new

3542
02:19:33,920 --> 02:19:38,559
tomorrows

3543
02:19:34,960 --> 02:19:41,840
and a decolonized research

3544
02:19:38,559 --> 02:19:41,840
practice thank you

3545
02:19:44,399 --> 02:19:48,240
thank you so much alejandro that was

3546
02:19:46,840 --> 02:19:52,319
fascinating

3547
02:19:48,240 --> 02:19:55,120
it's um it's wonderful to hear about the

3548
02:19:52,319 --> 02:19:57,120
how your research combines the

3549
02:19:55,120 --> 02:19:58,160
qualitative and quantitative but all

3550
02:19:57,120 --> 02:20:01,680
within

3551
02:19:58,160 --> 02:20:05,200
the use of indigenous principles and

3552
02:20:01,680 --> 02:20:06,640
world views and for the goal of sumat

3553
02:20:05,200 --> 02:20:12,000
kausai which is

3554
02:20:06,640 --> 02:20:13,920
holistic well-being or buenbeved

3555
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:16,000
i don't know if anybody would like to

3556
02:20:13,920 --> 02:20:18,000
ask a question i realize we have

3557
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:19,760
one for the previous for florence as

3558
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:21,840
well we can go back to in a minute

3559
02:20:19,760 --> 02:20:25,200
but for alejandro does anyone have any

3560
02:20:21,840 --> 02:20:25,200
questions or comments

3561
02:20:25,439 --> 02:20:32,000
um i i will then ask one if that's okay

3562
02:20:28,880 --> 02:20:32,800
um the the diagram you showed at the

3563
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:36,560
beginning

3564
02:20:32,800 --> 02:20:38,160
alejandro with the um the principles

3565
02:20:36,560 --> 02:20:39,760
that you were talking about

3566
02:20:38,160 --> 02:20:41,359
maybe you could explain a little bit

3567
02:20:39,760 --> 02:20:43,200
where that diagram

3568
02:20:41,359 --> 02:20:44,960
what it is and where it's from because i

3569
02:20:43,200 --> 02:20:47,680
think that's

3570
02:20:44,960 --> 02:20:50,160
fascinating to learn about it for others

3571
02:20:47,680 --> 02:20:55,359
who don't know

3572
02:20:50,160 --> 02:20:59,120
which one christina santa cruz pachakuti

3573
02:20:55,359 --> 02:21:02,399
oh this is the diagram

3574
02:20:59,120 --> 02:21:04,800
um that um

3575
02:21:02,399 --> 02:21:04,800
um

3576
02:21:06,479 --> 02:21:12,560
was that capture

3577
02:21:09,920 --> 02:21:12,560
what was

3578
02:21:14,080 --> 02:21:20,160
expressed as an art and

3579
02:21:17,439 --> 02:21:21,280
a holistic art expression in the most

3580
02:21:20,160 --> 02:21:23,200
sacred temple

3581
02:21:21,280 --> 02:21:24,319
of cusco the quarry country of the

3582
02:21:23,200 --> 02:21:27,920
golden

3583
02:21:24,319 --> 02:21:31,920
temple and this

3584
02:21:27,920 --> 02:21:35,040
conceptual graphic um

3585
02:21:31,920 --> 02:21:38,080
this drawing came from an

3586
02:21:35,040 --> 02:21:41,280
indian chronicler who

3587
02:21:38,080 --> 02:21:45,439
was able to translate it into this

3588
02:21:41,280 --> 02:21:49,200
conceptual graphic uh in the mid 1500s

3589
02:21:45,439 --> 02:21:52,560
after um you know um

3590
02:21:49,200 --> 02:21:56,240
eur i mean the

3591
02:21:52,560 --> 02:22:00,399
europeans arrive in cusco

3592
02:21:56,240 --> 02:22:03,520
and um it basically

3593
02:22:00,399 --> 02:22:06,640
captures our you know space our

3594
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:10,960
ontology our universe

3595
02:22:06,640 --> 02:22:14,640
where we conceptualize three communities

3596
02:22:10,960 --> 02:22:16,000
that interact reciprocate and try to

3597
02:22:14,640 --> 02:22:18,720
work together

3598
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:19,600
towards achieving smart cause and those

3599
02:22:18,720 --> 02:22:22,960
communities

3600
02:22:19,600 --> 02:22:27,520
are the human community or the runa

3601
02:22:22,960 --> 02:22:30,720
which includes everything that

3602
02:22:27,520 --> 02:22:33,920
is not just human and humans

3603
02:22:30,720 --> 02:22:37,280
nurture and reciprocity so

3604
02:22:33,920 --> 02:22:40,319
domesticated crops animals

3605
02:22:37,280 --> 02:22:43,760
water anything that lives

3606
02:22:40,319 --> 02:22:47,359
around humans is considered runa

3607
02:22:43,760 --> 02:22:51,760
the other realm is the salja

3608
02:22:47,359 --> 02:22:55,040
or the wild so anything that

3609
02:22:51,760 --> 02:22:57,760
has its own world

3610
02:22:55,040 --> 02:22:59,359
like a wild biodiversity wild water

3611
02:22:57,760 --> 02:23:02,399
while when

3612
02:22:59,359 --> 02:23:05,120
whatever humans don't have control

3613
02:23:02,399 --> 02:23:06,000
it has its own community and the third

3614
02:23:05,120 --> 02:23:09,520
one which is

3615
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:12,840
the critical one is the aoki

3616
02:23:09,520 --> 02:23:13,920
which reflects our

3617
02:23:12,840 --> 02:23:17,200
[Music]

3618
02:23:13,920 --> 02:23:19,200
connection with the sacred that's where

3619
02:23:17,200 --> 02:23:22,720
our ancestors

3620
02:23:19,200 --> 02:23:24,640
and the sacred principles that define

3621
02:23:22,720 --> 02:23:28,319
the epistemological

3622
02:23:24,640 --> 02:23:28,319
architecture of knowledge

3623
02:23:28,399 --> 02:23:33,280
are embedded so

3624
02:23:31,760 --> 02:23:36,479
these three communities have to work

3625
02:23:33,280 --> 02:23:39,760
together and the way of communicating

3626
02:23:36,479 --> 02:23:43,200
and seeking balances through the

3627
02:23:39,760 --> 02:23:43,840
sacred uh principle of reciprocity or i

3628
02:23:43,200 --> 02:23:46,960
need

3629
02:23:43,840 --> 02:23:50,160
and once that balance is achieved we

3630
02:23:46,960 --> 02:23:52,080
have reached suma causa so

3631
02:23:50,160 --> 02:23:53,760
could you show it to us briefly so

3632
02:23:52,080 --> 02:23:54,399
people know which one you're talking

3633
02:23:53,760 --> 02:23:56,720
about

3634
02:23:54,399 --> 02:23:56,720
please

3635
02:23:57,920 --> 02:24:02,880
i was referring to this to this

3636
02:24:03,040 --> 02:24:10,319
where um you had this

3637
02:24:06,640 --> 02:24:14,000
old drawing of santa cruz pachacuti

3638
02:24:10,319 --> 02:24:17,280
and uh you know if you see

3639
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:18,160
uh the middle star that's the southern

3640
02:24:17,280 --> 02:24:21,359
cross

3641
02:24:18,160 --> 02:24:24,399
which in most indigenous uh

3642
02:24:21,359 --> 02:24:27,680
traditions is a sacred symbol

3643
02:24:24,399 --> 02:24:31,280
because it connects the sacred with

3644
02:24:27,680 --> 02:24:33,840
the human world it connects the um

3645
02:24:31,280 --> 02:24:34,560
you know we call it chicana it's like a

3646
02:24:33,840 --> 02:24:38,000
bridge

3647
02:24:34,560 --> 02:24:38,880
we breach all types of epistemologies

3648
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:42,960
and

3649
02:24:38,880 --> 02:24:45,439
you know um generations and

3650
02:24:42,960 --> 02:24:47,520
and you know different types of

3651
02:24:45,439 --> 02:24:50,800
conceiving the world so is the key

3652
02:24:47,520 --> 02:24:54,319
of diversity and with that we have

3653
02:24:50,800 --> 02:24:57,359
the aoki iu this which is the sacred the

3654
02:24:54,319 --> 02:25:00,560
iu ayu which is the wild

3655
02:24:57,359 --> 02:25:03,600
and the runai you the human realm

3656
02:25:00,560 --> 02:25:07,680
and what is reciprocity as i said

3657
02:25:03,600 --> 02:25:11,200
um we achieved sumac outside so

3658
02:25:07,680 --> 02:25:12,560
you know this paradigm this concept of

3659
02:25:11,200 --> 02:25:16,439
sumatra

3660
02:25:12,560 --> 02:25:18,160
of course go beyond this idea of

3661
02:25:16,439 --> 02:25:22,240
sustainability

3662
02:25:18,160 --> 02:25:25,760
where um you know the economical

3663
02:25:22,240 --> 02:25:29,520
uh interests or it's viewed

3664
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:32,560
upon an architecture that's that keeps

3665
02:25:29,520 --> 02:25:35,600
um pushing this capitalist

3666
02:25:32,560 --> 02:25:38,960
uh uh world view

3667
02:25:35,600 --> 02:25:40,000
of western the western world to the

3668
02:25:38,960 --> 02:25:43,520
infinite

3669
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:44,560
how we keep destroying nature without

3670
02:25:43,520 --> 02:25:47,680
destroying

3671
02:25:44,560 --> 02:25:49,920
that's what sustainability means in

3672
02:25:47,680 --> 02:25:53,760
terms of

3673
02:25:49,920 --> 02:25:56,720
i think western mind so

3674
02:25:53,760 --> 02:25:58,080
we kind of challenge that with this

3675
02:25:56,720 --> 02:26:02,319
paradigm

3676
02:25:58,080 --> 02:26:04,080
uh and where the ethical aspects of

3677
02:26:02,319 --> 02:26:05,760
research

3678
02:26:04,080 --> 02:26:07,439
which are embedded in the spiritual

3679
02:26:05,760 --> 02:26:10,560
values of nature's peoples

3680
02:26:07,439 --> 02:26:15,040
are strongly reflected in the aokia

3681
02:26:10,560 --> 02:26:15,680
thank you oh thanks a lot for explaining

3682
02:26:15,040 --> 02:26:18,880
that

3683
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:22,319
so the the old diagram from this

3684
02:26:18,880 --> 02:26:25,920
incur chronicler in in the

3685
02:26:22,319 --> 02:26:28,880
1500s now guides their

3686
02:26:25,920 --> 02:26:29,920
their research which is led by community

3687
02:26:28,880 --> 02:26:32,720
researchers

3688
02:26:29,920 --> 02:26:33,280
from each community in the potato park

3689
02:26:32,720 --> 02:26:36,399
and

3690
02:26:33,280 --> 02:26:38,319
um it's very much um

3691
02:26:36,399 --> 02:26:40,160
about traditional knowledge indigenous

3692
02:26:38,319 --> 02:26:41,200
knowledge transmission transmitting the

3693
02:26:40,160 --> 02:26:42,960
values

3694
02:26:41,200 --> 02:26:44,319
and transmitting the knowledge between

3695
02:26:42,960 --> 02:26:46,560
elders and youth

3696
02:26:44,319 --> 02:26:48,080
through the research process as

3697
02:26:46,560 --> 02:26:50,920
alejandro mentioned at the beginning

3698
02:26:48,080 --> 02:26:53,600
so it's a way of you know really

3699
02:26:50,920 --> 02:26:57,359
revitalizing these cultural values and

3700
02:26:53,600 --> 02:27:00,560
biocultural heritage using these ancient

3701
02:26:57,359 --> 02:27:04,000
principles uh from the incas

3702
02:27:00,560 --> 02:27:05,920
which i think it is a really nice um

3703
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:07,439
example which i haven't seen others do

3704
02:27:05,920 --> 02:27:10,479
but um i would love to find

3705
02:27:07,439 --> 02:27:12,720
similar um you know graphics

3706
02:27:10,479 --> 02:27:14,080
and principles and concepts for other

3707
02:27:12,720 --> 02:27:15,040
indigenous peoples i think it would

3708
02:27:14,080 --> 02:27:18,080
really help

3709
02:27:15,040 --> 02:27:20,399
in revitalizing biocultural heritage

3710
02:27:18,080 --> 02:27:22,479
does anybody uh would anybody like to

3711
02:27:20,399 --> 02:27:26,720
share any reflections with alejandro

3712
02:27:22,479 --> 02:27:26,720
if not we can go back to florence's

3713
02:27:28,840 --> 02:27:34,560
question

3714
02:27:30,479 --> 02:27:34,560
okay so um

3715
02:27:35,200 --> 02:27:38,479
okay i mean if if people want to

3716
02:27:37,680 --> 02:27:40,560
continue

3717
02:27:38,479 --> 02:27:42,840
um you know want to comment on your

3718
02:27:40,560 --> 02:27:44,720
presentation anybody want to don't be

3719
02:27:42,840 --> 02:27:45,920
shy

3720
02:27:44,720 --> 02:27:47,680
okay we can always come back to

3721
02:27:45,920 --> 02:27:48,800
alejandro and to begin in the

3722
02:27:47,680 --> 02:27:51,600
conversation but

3723
02:27:48,800 --> 02:27:53,600
for now i'm gonna um look at this

3724
02:27:51,600 --> 02:27:56,160
question for florence

3725
02:27:53,600 --> 02:27:59,840
um uh panilla would you like to say your

3726
02:27:56,160 --> 02:27:59,840
question are you still with us

3727
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:06,479
okay i'll read it out uh thank you

3728
02:28:04,479 --> 02:28:09,439
florence for the rich presentation when

3729
02:28:06,479 --> 02:28:11,600
you refer to the elders triangulation

3730
02:28:09,439 --> 02:28:12,960
i also see we can add the very long

3731
02:28:11,600 --> 02:28:15,600
timeline

3732
02:28:12,960 --> 02:28:16,720
they have to build their experiences on

3733
02:28:15,600 --> 02:28:18,479
they have observed

3734
02:28:16,720 --> 02:28:21,200
and interacting with their landscape for

3735
02:28:18,479 --> 02:28:23,920
so long and with so many perspectives

3736
02:28:21,200 --> 02:28:26,399
so it can never be com compensated with

3737
02:28:23,920 --> 02:28:27,920
other methods from science which is in

3738
02:28:26,399 --> 02:28:31,520
the best case

3739
02:28:27,920 --> 02:28:35,200
study one one fact

3740
02:28:31,520 --> 02:28:38,399
facto in long time series but many times

3741
02:28:35,200 --> 02:28:41,040
represents a snapshot in one dimension

3742
02:28:38,399 --> 02:28:41,680
okay so it's a comment and panilla would

3743
02:28:41,040 --> 02:28:45,120
you please

3744
02:28:41,680 --> 02:28:48,399
um explain that if you're still with us

3745
02:28:45,120 --> 02:28:50,800
because i didn't fully understand it

3746
02:28:48,399 --> 02:28:51,600
but i think pernilla is trying to say

3747
02:28:50,800 --> 02:28:54,960
that

3748
02:28:51,600 --> 02:28:55,760
uh because i mentioned that uh in the

3749
02:28:54,960 --> 02:28:58,880
age of

3750
02:28:55,760 --> 02:29:00,319
uh yeah on the triangulation i will

3751
02:28:58,880 --> 02:29:04,160
start first with that

3752
02:29:00,319 --> 02:29:04,880
because in the in in our when we do our

3753
02:29:04,160 --> 02:29:08,960
research

3754
02:29:04,880 --> 02:29:11,920
we found out that the when they declare

3755
02:29:08,960 --> 02:29:13,280
the season to one season to start they

3756
02:29:11,920 --> 02:29:16,720
make use of uh

3757
02:29:13,280 --> 02:29:17,280
when does some would there are places

3758
02:29:16,720 --> 02:29:20,640
where

3759
02:29:17,280 --> 02:29:24,720
at the at the first break of the

3760
02:29:20,640 --> 02:29:28,160
of the sunrise the sun strikes somewhere

3761
02:29:24,720 --> 02:29:29,840
and another is the the the indicators in

3762
02:29:28,160 --> 02:29:31,120
the change in weather around the

3763
02:29:29,840 --> 02:29:34,560
surroundings

3764
02:29:31,120 --> 02:29:36,960
and another is their dream so that now

3765
02:29:34,560 --> 02:29:37,760
we only hear that they more rely on

3766
02:29:36,960 --> 02:29:41,040
dreams

3767
02:29:37,760 --> 02:29:43,040
because uh changes are happening

3768
02:29:41,040 --> 02:29:44,319
and some of the indicators have

3769
02:29:43,040 --> 02:29:47,840
disappeared

3770
02:29:44,319 --> 02:29:50,960
and and also that of course

3771
02:29:47,840 --> 02:29:52,960
yeah something like that but what i what

3772
02:29:50,960 --> 02:29:56,319
i understood from bernie

3773
02:29:52,960 --> 02:29:58,479
is that because i mentioned

3774
02:29:56,319 --> 02:29:59,680
that with the age of this change in

3775
02:29:58,479 --> 02:30:02,880
climate

3776
02:29:59,680 --> 02:30:05,840
and erratic weather condition we may

3777
02:30:02,880 --> 02:30:07,680
need also support to hasten the

3778
02:30:05,840 --> 02:30:10,960
knowledge development

3779
02:30:07,680 --> 02:30:14,800
on how we are going to appropriate

3780
02:30:10,960 --> 02:30:16,960
our our calendar in the changing times

3781
02:30:14,800 --> 02:30:19,120
and so i think bernie is saying that we

3782
02:30:16,960 --> 02:30:21,760
may not be needing

3783
02:30:19,120 --> 02:30:23,840
other knowledge system because our

3784
02:30:21,760 --> 02:30:24,560
elders are there that's what i got from

3785
02:30:23,840 --> 02:30:29,280
her

3786
02:30:24,560 --> 02:30:32,319
comment right okay thank you very much

3787
02:30:29,280 --> 02:30:33,920
um i wonder if um something i

3788
02:30:32,319 --> 02:30:36,720
i thought might be really relevant to

3789
02:30:33,920 --> 02:30:39,760
others is to understand a bit better

3790
02:30:36,720 --> 02:30:40,399
um more specifically your methods of

3791
02:30:39,760 --> 02:30:42,560
research

3792
02:30:40,399 --> 02:30:43,600
alejandro so the capacity building

3793
02:30:42,560 --> 02:30:47,600
workshop

3794
02:30:43,600 --> 02:30:49,200
workshops for the indigenous research

3795
02:30:47,600 --> 02:30:52,399
experts

3796
02:30:49,200 --> 02:30:54,080
and then the the app that you use for

3797
02:30:52,399 --> 02:30:56,640
them to collect the data

3798
02:30:54,080 --> 02:30:58,240
and that goes straight to a database and

3799
02:30:56,640 --> 02:31:00,080
you can explain all this much better but

3800
02:30:58,240 --> 02:31:02,399
we've been talking a little bit about

3801
02:31:00,080 --> 02:31:03,840
documenting knowledge and databases and

3802
02:31:02,399 --> 02:31:05,120
how to build a knowledge base in

3803
02:31:03,840 --> 02:31:06,319
communities

3804
02:31:05,120 --> 02:31:08,560
and maybe you could explain your

3805
02:31:06,319 --> 02:31:13,439
methodology on that aspect

3806
02:31:08,560 --> 02:31:13,439
please me

3807
02:31:13,520 --> 02:31:21,439
how to integrate metrics

3808
02:31:18,319 --> 02:31:24,640
and make measurements

3809
02:31:21,439 --> 02:31:28,479
that reflect

3810
02:31:24,640 --> 02:31:32,160
better or more accurate

3811
02:31:28,479 --> 02:31:35,840
how and you know

3812
02:31:32,160 --> 02:31:39,680
we conceptualize the our own universe

3813
02:31:35,840 --> 02:31:43,520
in terms of its relationality

3814
02:31:39,680 --> 02:31:46,560
uh everything is connected to everything

3815
02:31:43,520 --> 02:31:49,920
so you cannot do research

3816
02:31:46,560 --> 02:31:53,439
um which is um you know books and

3817
02:31:49,920 --> 02:31:57,680
some type of speciality

3818
02:31:53,439 --> 02:32:01,520
um and how

3819
02:31:57,680 --> 02:32:04,080
the results of um you know this type of

3820
02:32:01,520 --> 02:32:05,280
um holistic approach or integrative

3821
02:32:04,080 --> 02:32:08,160
approach

3822
02:32:05,280 --> 02:32:09,760
where you have mixed methods working all

3823
02:32:08,160 --> 02:32:13,680
the time

3824
02:32:09,760 --> 02:32:16,720
can be captured and stored

3825
02:32:13,680 --> 02:32:19,760
so um we had and

3826
02:32:16,720 --> 02:32:22,479
develop a process by which

3827
02:32:19,760 --> 02:32:23,680
we tried in the first instance to

3828
02:32:22,479 --> 02:32:26,960
combine

3829
02:32:23,680 --> 02:32:31,120
the collection methods in terms of the

3830
02:32:26,960 --> 02:32:34,560
qualitative and quantitative approaches

3831
02:32:31,120 --> 02:32:36,080
without making these type of

3832
02:32:34,560 --> 02:32:38,880
distinctions

3833
02:32:36,080 --> 02:32:40,640
but rather looking the needs of

3834
02:32:38,880 --> 02:32:44,720
particular phenomena that

3835
02:32:40,640 --> 02:32:48,240
we may be interested in learning or

3836
02:32:44,720 --> 02:32:52,800
solving once we have

3837
02:32:48,240 --> 02:32:56,640
the tools that are uh

3838
02:32:52,800 --> 02:33:01,040
decided to gather information

3839
02:32:56,640 --> 02:33:04,399
then um we have created

3840
02:33:01,040 --> 02:33:07,760
ways visual ways of

3841
02:33:04,399 --> 02:33:12,000
um and capturing that type of

3842
02:33:07,760 --> 02:33:14,960
information which includes the use

3843
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:15,680
now of an application that we have

3844
02:33:14,960 --> 02:33:19,439
developed

3845
02:33:15,680 --> 02:33:22,640
in-house that takes advantage

3846
02:33:19,439 --> 02:33:25,280
of the visuals that um

3847
02:33:22,640 --> 02:33:25,280
a um

3848
02:33:25,920 --> 02:33:28,160
you know

3849
02:33:29,439 --> 02:33:32,080
a phone

3850
02:33:32,560 --> 02:33:40,160
or a tablet these days may offer

3851
02:33:36,560 --> 02:33:43,280
like video uh photograph

3852
02:33:40,160 --> 02:33:46,479
uh gps for mapping

3853
02:33:43,280 --> 02:33:50,080
uh so a and

3854
02:33:46,479 --> 02:33:54,800
uh voice recording so those are

3855
02:33:50,080 --> 02:33:57,920
also um you know tools that um

3856
02:33:54,800 --> 02:34:00,479
you would use in traditional knowledge

3857
02:33:57,920 --> 02:34:01,520
uh transmission within within this

3858
02:34:00,479 --> 02:34:04,880
context

3859
02:34:01,520 --> 02:34:08,000
so when we use those

3860
02:34:04,880 --> 02:34:12,160
but frame within an

3861
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:15,760
app for a tablet by which we

3862
02:34:12,160 --> 02:34:20,560
start gathering information

3863
02:34:15,760 --> 02:34:24,800
and then selecting them in what we call

3864
02:34:20,560 --> 02:34:29,359
a bioculture database once database

3865
02:34:24,800 --> 02:34:34,000
it's when this is stored in the database

3866
02:34:29,359 --> 02:34:38,319
then as you've seen in the pictures

3867
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:41,280
the um the

3868
02:34:38,319 --> 02:34:43,439
our elders get together in knowledge

3869
02:34:41,280 --> 02:34:47,280
circles

3870
02:34:43,439 --> 02:34:50,800
and they start analyzing the data

3871
02:34:47,280 --> 02:34:54,720
by use of graphics

3872
02:34:50,800 --> 02:34:57,920
um this is them tabulated

3873
02:34:54,720 --> 02:34:59,680
into into boxes as you see in the u

3874
02:34:57,920 --> 02:35:04,319
panna which is kind of a

3875
02:34:59,680 --> 02:35:08,399
a chinese abacus the way we use

3876
02:35:04,319 --> 02:35:11,359
these boxes you know a matrix

3877
02:35:08,399 --> 02:35:12,240
and the ranking numerical ranking is

3878
02:35:11,359 --> 02:35:16,800
done

3879
02:35:12,240 --> 02:35:20,479
by using grains of mice

3880
02:35:16,800 --> 02:35:22,960
it provides you know

3881
02:35:20,479 --> 02:35:23,920
the numerical data that we are looking

3882
02:35:22,960 --> 02:35:28,479
and which is

3883
02:35:23,920 --> 02:35:32,720
them translate it into

3884
02:35:28,479 --> 02:35:36,479
into um you know back into the database

3885
02:35:32,720 --> 02:35:40,399
and then we mix it uh with the help of

3886
02:35:36,479 --> 02:35:44,560
uh you know already existing

3887
02:35:40,399 --> 02:35:47,760
programs for uh research

3888
02:35:44,560 --> 02:35:49,280
um like i survey or orders

3889
02:35:47,760 --> 02:35:52,160
from which we have borrowed the

3890
02:35:49,280 --> 02:35:56,960
methodology and we can do

3891
02:35:52,160 --> 02:36:00,240
uh the analytical measurements

3892
02:35:56,960 --> 02:36:01,840
uh and arrive to some conclusions those

3893
02:36:00,240 --> 02:36:04,880
conclusions

3894
02:36:01,840 --> 02:36:09,600
go into another meeting

3895
02:36:04,880 --> 02:36:12,479
of elders and youth who them

3896
02:36:09,600 --> 02:36:13,520
analyze the the resulting information to

3897
02:36:12,479 --> 02:36:16,720
take

3898
02:36:13,520 --> 02:36:17,359
the best decisions in terms of which of

3899
02:36:16,720 --> 02:36:20,560
those

3900
02:36:17,359 --> 02:36:23,760
um or how to apply that information

3901
02:36:20,560 --> 02:36:27,439
solving problems it could be a

3902
02:36:23,760 --> 02:36:31,040
pest or disease in a crop

3903
02:36:27,439 --> 02:36:35,200
it could be soil fertility it could be

3904
02:36:31,040 --> 02:36:39,200
water management it could be policy

3905
02:36:35,200 --> 02:36:41,920
so um the matrix idea that

3906
02:36:39,200 --> 02:36:42,800
our ancestors are incas use automatic

3907
02:36:41,920 --> 02:36:46,160
stool

3908
02:36:42,800 --> 02:36:49,359
that our ancestor incas used to use

3909
02:36:46,160 --> 02:36:53,040
you know they um of course they

3910
02:36:49,359 --> 02:36:56,880
um allow us to

3911
02:36:53,040 --> 02:37:00,880
um to um

3912
02:36:56,880 --> 02:37:04,080
create this this type of um

3913
02:37:00,880 --> 02:37:07,200
of approach of uh i mean

3914
02:37:04,080 --> 02:37:10,640
a process um and then once

3915
02:37:07,200 --> 02:37:14,399
it's um the decision is made

3916
02:37:10,640 --> 02:37:17,600
then the community assembly sanctions

3917
02:37:14,399 --> 02:37:20,800
and becomes part of

3918
02:37:17,600 --> 02:37:24,160
a life plan so it's included in

3919
02:37:20,800 --> 02:37:25,760
in a long-term plan which

3920
02:37:24,160 --> 02:37:27,840
the local authorities have the

3921
02:37:25,760 --> 02:37:30,880
obligation to implement

3922
02:37:27,840 --> 02:37:34,880
so that's more or less the how we

3923
02:37:30,880 --> 02:37:38,880
combine you know our old tools

3924
02:37:34,880 --> 02:37:43,040
um more often from

3925
02:37:38,880 --> 02:37:43,439
modern tools uh the mechanics of doing

3926
02:37:43,040 --> 02:37:47,200
that

3927
02:37:43,439 --> 02:37:50,319
and produce results that can be useful

3928
02:37:47,200 --> 02:37:52,399
to particular um situations

3929
02:37:50,319 --> 02:37:54,560
or problem solving that are more

3930
02:37:52,399 --> 02:37:58,080
localized

3931
02:37:54,560 --> 02:38:00,399
i don't know if that responds to

3932
02:37:58,080 --> 02:38:02,319
question christina

3933
02:38:00,399 --> 02:38:04,399
yes thank you very much i mean maybe

3934
02:38:02,319 --> 02:38:07,520
i'll just add to clarify

3935
02:38:04,399 --> 02:38:10,960
um because i i know about the transect

3936
02:38:07,520 --> 02:38:11,680
use and in the in the maze park they've

3937
02:38:10,960 --> 02:38:14,000
been doing

3938
02:38:11,680 --> 02:38:14,800
transects walking through the landscape

3939
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:17,600
using

3940
02:38:14,800 --> 02:38:19,200
um you know smartphones with this app

3941
02:38:17,600 --> 02:38:22,960
and the elder

3942
02:38:19,200 --> 02:38:26,640
um or community researcher

3943
02:38:22,960 --> 02:38:28,560
and the youth and maybe a staff from the

3944
02:38:26,640 --> 02:38:30,800
local ngo are scientists

3945
02:38:28,560 --> 02:38:31,600
they walk together and there's probably

3946
02:38:30,800 --> 02:38:33,600
more

3947
02:38:31,600 --> 02:38:35,439
people from the communities and in that

3948
02:38:33,600 --> 02:38:38,319
way they can do a transect

3949
02:38:35,439 --> 02:38:40,160
looking at the plants with the elders

3950
02:38:38,319 --> 02:38:41,760
talking about their uses

3951
02:38:40,160 --> 02:38:44,000
and the knowledge being transferred to

3952
02:38:41,760 --> 02:38:46,720
the youth and the

3953
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:48,240
the the plant being having a botanical

3954
02:38:46,720 --> 02:38:50,960
name and that goes in

3955
02:38:48,240 --> 02:38:51,760
as they walk to see each plant they have

3956
02:38:50,960 --> 02:38:53,520
a discussion

3957
02:38:51,760 --> 02:38:55,920
sharing knowledge and they take a

3958
02:38:53,520 --> 02:38:56,560
picture and they put the information in

3959
02:38:55,920 --> 02:38:58,960
and

3960
02:38:56,560 --> 02:39:00,560
they collect information about um

3961
02:38:58,960 --> 02:39:03,040
medicinal and nutritious

3962
02:39:00,560 --> 02:39:05,439
wild plants and that's all gone straight

3963
02:39:03,040 --> 02:39:08,560
into their community database

3964
02:39:05,439 --> 02:39:09,120
um so anyway i just thought um trying to

3965
02:39:08,560 --> 02:39:12,800
give it

3966
02:39:09,120 --> 02:39:14,640
uh some practical um example of how it's

3967
02:39:12,800 --> 02:39:16,960
used

3968
02:39:14,640 --> 02:39:17,840
right well we're coming close to the end

3969
02:39:16,960 --> 02:39:19,520
um

3970
02:39:17,840 --> 02:39:21,120
we we still have a few minutes of

3971
02:39:19,520 --> 02:39:24,240
discussion um

3972
02:39:21,120 --> 02:39:26,399
i put a question in the agenda um

3973
02:39:24,240 --> 02:39:28,000
how can interdisciplinary methods be

3974
02:39:26,399 --> 02:39:31,040
used in a decolonizing

3975
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:33,760
participatory action research framework

3976
02:39:31,040 --> 02:39:35,040
i don't know if anybody um wants to

3977
02:39:33,760 --> 02:39:39,640
comment on that

3978
02:39:35,040 --> 02:39:42,560
i guess we've heard about lots of um

3979
02:39:39,640 --> 02:39:45,920
interdisciplinary methods ethnobotany

3980
02:39:42,560 --> 02:39:49,600
we've heard about um archaea botany um

3981
02:39:45,920 --> 02:39:51,840
and we've heard about oral histories

3982
02:39:49,600 --> 02:39:54,160
and i i don't know if anyone wants to

3983
02:39:51,840 --> 02:39:57,520
reflect or comment on

3984
02:39:54,160 --> 02:40:00,800
their usefulness for um

3985
02:39:57,520 --> 02:40:00,800
indigenous lead research

3986
02:40:01,680 --> 02:40:07,040
could you see that if i may do you allow

3987
02:40:04,840 --> 02:40:11,120
me

3988
02:40:07,040 --> 02:40:14,399
yes go ahead please um i think that

3989
02:40:11,120 --> 02:40:14,960
what you have said is um very important

3990
02:40:14,399 --> 02:40:18,840
but it's

3991
02:40:14,960 --> 02:40:21,359
part of the whole picture you know

3992
02:40:18,840 --> 02:40:24,560
um we are

3993
02:40:21,359 --> 02:40:28,000
reducing this discussion to

3994
02:40:24,560 --> 02:40:30,319
uh the practice of research in the field

3995
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:31,120
where you have to be respectful you have

3996
02:40:30,319 --> 02:40:34,399
to

3997
02:40:31,120 --> 02:40:38,160
follow private informed consent

3998
02:40:34,399 --> 02:40:41,439
and try to support the local movement

3999
02:40:38,160 --> 02:40:44,800
in terms of decolonizing processes

4000
02:40:41,439 --> 02:40:45,680
but that decolonizing must also happen

4001
02:40:44,800 --> 02:40:49,040
in research

4002
02:40:45,680 --> 02:40:50,160
institutions if you see many of the

4003
02:40:49,040 --> 02:40:54,160
institutions

4004
02:40:50,160 --> 02:40:57,520
out there that do

4005
02:40:54,160 --> 02:41:01,600
this type of research you know

4006
02:40:57,520 --> 02:41:05,040
they don't have any indigenous academic

4007
02:41:01,600 --> 02:41:08,479
or researchers in their

4008
02:41:05,040 --> 02:41:11,920
staff all you know

4009
02:41:08,479 --> 02:41:15,279
research is done in a way that

4010
02:41:11,920 --> 02:41:18,319
is cheap to hire in digital researchers

4011
02:41:15,279 --> 02:41:21,439
in the country of origin

4012
02:41:18,319 --> 02:41:24,880
you know and do this

4013
02:41:21,439 --> 02:41:27,279
and present it as a participatory

4014
02:41:24,880 --> 02:41:29,680
i hope the participatory also can

4015
02:41:27,279 --> 02:41:32,640
include the salaries

4016
02:41:29,680 --> 02:41:34,399
so that this is the same type of

4017
02:41:32,640 --> 02:41:36,479
recognition

4018
02:41:34,399 --> 02:41:37,840
goes to researchers in digital

4019
02:41:36,479 --> 02:41:42,000
researchers

4020
02:41:37,840 --> 02:41:45,279
as um at the same you know balancing

4021
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:49,520
with uh those of academics

4022
02:41:45,279 --> 02:41:53,000
also the lack of individual researchers

4023
02:41:49,520 --> 02:41:55,439
to actually guide you know this

4024
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:58,560
transformative approach

4025
02:41:55,439 --> 02:42:02,399
decolonizing approach

4026
02:41:58,560 --> 02:42:06,800
in this institutions everywhere

4027
02:42:02,399 --> 02:42:10,399
in the world it needs to be complemented

4028
02:42:06,800 --> 02:42:13,439
you know with the devolution of

4029
02:42:10,399 --> 02:42:15,520
genetic material cultural material that

4030
02:42:13,439 --> 02:42:19,120
was misappropriated

4031
02:42:15,520 --> 02:42:22,560
that was pillaged you know from

4032
02:42:19,120 --> 02:42:25,680
indigenous lands in colonial times

4033
02:42:22,560 --> 02:42:28,880
and there's you know long overdue

4034
02:42:25,680 --> 02:42:32,080
that seeds

4035
02:42:28,880 --> 02:42:35,200
medicinal plants ornamentals

4036
02:42:32,080 --> 02:42:36,560
trees go back to the communities of

4037
02:42:35,200 --> 02:42:41,040
origin

4038
02:42:36,560 --> 02:42:44,160
uh and stop being you know

4039
02:42:41,040 --> 02:42:47,760
misused and utilized through patents and

4040
02:42:44,160 --> 02:42:50,120
all types of commodifying

4041
02:42:47,760 --> 02:42:52,479
methods and you know western

4042
02:42:50,120 --> 02:42:55,680
institutions

4043
02:42:52,479 --> 02:42:59,359
or what we feel

4044
02:42:55,680 --> 02:43:03,040
it's sacred uh and it's exhibit

4045
02:42:59,359 --> 02:43:05,120
as a trophies of war in museums and

4046
02:43:03,040 --> 02:43:09,279
other institutions

4047
02:43:05,120 --> 02:43:12,319
must be the ball doing indigenous

4048
02:43:09,279 --> 02:43:14,359
you know quarters so

4049
02:43:12,319 --> 02:43:16,800
i think that this discussion

4050
02:43:14,359 --> 02:43:20,640
decolonizing research

4051
02:43:16,800 --> 02:43:24,479
also takes into account this

4052
02:43:20,640 --> 02:43:27,760
other side of the coin

4053
02:43:24,479 --> 02:43:31,120
where colonial attitudes

4054
02:43:27,760 --> 02:43:34,240
racist white supremacy and

4055
02:43:31,120 --> 02:43:37,439
research continues to be very strong

4056
02:43:34,240 --> 02:43:37,760
and it's not changing so it's just like

4057
02:43:37,439 --> 02:43:41,359
a

4058
02:43:37,760 --> 02:43:45,040
a reflection uh on on

4059
02:43:41,359 --> 02:43:45,040
your previous comment thank you

4060
02:43:45,279 --> 02:43:50,399
uh thank you very much alejandro that's

4061
02:43:47,680 --> 02:43:52,720
i fully agree with what you're saying

4062
02:43:50,399 --> 02:43:55,840
um i have two questions uh i think

4063
02:43:52,720 --> 02:43:59,200
julian would you like to say something

4064
02:43:55,840 --> 02:44:01,200
yeah um so actually was a question on

4065
02:43:59,200 --> 02:44:05,120
this aspect of decolonizing for

4066
02:44:01,200 --> 02:44:08,319
alejandro because i see that the um

4067
02:44:05,120 --> 02:44:11,600
there's the use of historical text and

4068
02:44:08,319 --> 02:44:14,800
um of european colonial text

4069
02:44:11,600 --> 02:44:16,800
and in of the colonization and i i

4070
02:44:14,800 --> 02:44:18,080
wonder because we have also a lot for

4071
02:44:16,800 --> 02:44:20,960
the caribbean

4072
02:44:18,080 --> 02:44:21,840
um but the question is how do you make

4073
02:44:20,960 --> 02:44:24,000
the decision of

4074
02:44:21,840 --> 02:44:25,040
actually what you know decolonizing that

4075
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:28,160
narrative

4076
02:44:25,040 --> 02:44:29,680
from those texts how can how does how

4077
02:44:28,160 --> 02:44:30,960
what is the process that the community

4078
02:44:29,680 --> 02:44:34,800
makes to actually like oh

4079
02:44:30,960 --> 02:44:34,800
this is what we're gonna take from this

4080
02:44:36,479 --> 02:44:43,040
i think that's uh you know defined by

4081
02:44:39,920 --> 02:44:46,640
the specificity of

4082
02:44:43,040 --> 02:44:51,200
what the community considers to be

4083
02:44:46,640 --> 02:44:54,960
a priority in terms of solving problems

4084
02:44:51,200 --> 02:44:54,960
you know it could be

4085
02:44:55,120 --> 02:45:02,560
you know as in our case um

4086
02:45:00,720 --> 02:45:04,560
climate change and particularly in

4087
02:45:02,560 --> 02:45:09,040
mountain ecosystems

4088
02:45:04,560 --> 02:45:09,040
in the andes is one of the you know

4089
02:45:09,680 --> 02:45:14,560
existential pets that we have all the

4090
02:45:12,479 --> 02:45:18,000
crops are moving very fast

4091
02:45:14,560 --> 02:45:18,960
up in the mountain most of our crops are

4092
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:22,560
just

4093
02:45:18,960 --> 02:45:25,520
uh you know at the top and uh

4094
02:45:22,560 --> 02:45:27,680
we're very sure that we're going to lose

4095
02:45:25,520 --> 02:45:31,040
not just the crop but also

4096
02:45:27,680 --> 02:45:32,160
you know complete seed seed and food

4097
02:45:31,040 --> 02:45:35,520
systems

4098
02:45:32,160 --> 02:45:36,160
so in that case like uh everybody agrees

4099
02:45:35,520 --> 02:45:38,640
that

4100
02:45:36,160 --> 02:45:40,080
whatever effort we make into learning

4101
02:45:38,640 --> 02:45:43,200
creating knowledge

4102
02:45:40,080 --> 02:45:44,160
uh organizing information to solve those

4103
02:45:43,200 --> 02:45:47,920
problems

4104
02:45:44,160 --> 02:45:52,000
must be focused on that type of um

4105
02:45:47,920 --> 02:45:55,439
on that type of problem-solving

4106
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:57,600
um and then once we have uh

4107
02:45:55,439 --> 02:45:58,800
you know the the objective of what we

4108
02:45:57,600 --> 02:46:02,319
want to do

4109
02:45:58,800 --> 02:46:06,319
then we go into what we have

4110
02:46:02,319 --> 02:46:10,240
you know and i think in our case

4111
02:46:06,319 --> 02:46:13,359
because you know we have a long history

4112
02:46:10,240 --> 02:46:15,840
in terms of having created

4113
02:46:13,359 --> 02:46:16,720
a relationship with the environment and

4114
02:46:15,840 --> 02:46:20,640
thrive

4115
02:46:16,720 --> 02:46:23,040
on it in a very organic manner

4116
02:46:20,640 --> 02:46:24,960
that means that we have applied science

4117
02:46:23,040 --> 02:46:28,000
and technology

4118
02:46:24,960 --> 02:46:30,960
in the past you know for

4119
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:32,640
the benefit of all relations the benefit

4120
02:46:30,960 --> 02:46:36,560
no chance of humans

4121
02:46:32,640 --> 02:46:40,160
but by the benefit of all so

4122
02:46:36,560 --> 02:46:43,760
what type of tools do we use to keep

4123
02:46:40,160 --> 02:46:44,319
uh you know focusing on that focusing on

4124
02:46:43,760 --> 02:46:47,680
that

4125
02:46:44,319 --> 02:46:51,359
uh you know holism focusing on

4126
02:46:47,680 --> 02:46:55,120
on that type of balance and

4127
02:46:51,359 --> 02:46:58,720
interaction uh that would create

4128
02:46:55,120 --> 02:47:02,240
you know um a a new tomorrow

4129
02:46:58,720 --> 02:47:02,880
so then we p we we choose the different

4130
02:47:02,240 --> 02:47:06,960
tools

4131
02:47:02,880 --> 02:47:09,920
be it from the past or or combined

4132
02:47:06,960 --> 02:47:11,520
and that's why we we resolve the

4133
02:47:09,920 --> 02:47:14,080
question

4134
02:47:11,520 --> 02:47:16,960
so i guess in each context it's going to

4135
02:47:14,080 --> 02:47:16,960
be different

4136
02:47:17,040 --> 02:47:21,520
thank you alejandra i'm afraid we've got

4137
02:47:19,439 --> 02:47:23,279
well we're meant to be finishing in two

4138
02:47:21,520 --> 02:47:24,960
minutes but if it's okay we could stay

4139
02:47:23,279 --> 02:47:26,640
for another five minutes as

4140
02:47:24,960 --> 02:47:28,160
people want to ask questions uh you

4141
02:47:26,640 --> 02:47:31,600
ching song wants to say

4142
02:47:28,160 --> 02:47:34,399
something go ahead you hi

4143
02:47:31,600 --> 02:47:35,680
uh yes uh thank you for all the

4144
02:47:34,399 --> 02:47:38,880
contributors

4145
02:47:35,680 --> 02:47:40,800
uh i handle the presentation about the

4146
02:47:38,880 --> 02:47:43,600
biocultural uh

4147
02:47:40,800 --> 02:47:44,560
biocultural uh heritage framework really

4148
02:47:43,600 --> 02:47:48,000
remind me of

4149
02:47:44,560 --> 02:47:51,359
our spiritual leader leader g

4150
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:54,000
shienhu he attended uh uh

4151
02:47:51,359 --> 02:47:55,120
the day before yesterday that he

4152
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:58,800
presented about

4153
02:47:55,120 --> 02:48:02,080
the uh the community's

4154
02:47:58,800 --> 02:48:05,680
bicultural part like a form into

4155
02:48:02,080 --> 02:48:08,880
four-part culture physical

4156
02:48:05,680 --> 02:48:12,240
which is the eco eco-biodiversity part

4157
02:48:08,880 --> 02:48:13,040
and the community part and he described

4158
02:48:12,240 --> 02:48:17,279
that

4159
02:48:13,040 --> 02:48:20,640
exactly like alexander described it is a

4160
02:48:17,279 --> 02:48:23,520
culture spirit as a base as a core and

4161
02:48:20,640 --> 02:48:24,800
it is a live and organic process

4162
02:48:23,520 --> 02:48:27,120
interacted

4163
02:48:24,800 --> 02:48:28,000
within the community and among the

4164
02:48:27,120 --> 02:48:31,200
commun

4165
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:34,319
other communities end with outside world

4166
02:48:31,200 --> 02:48:35,920
and it's a live process evolution

4167
02:48:34,319 --> 02:48:39,920
process

4168
02:48:35,920 --> 02:48:41,600
so i think that if we're talking about

4169
02:48:39,920 --> 02:48:43,200
the decolonizing research

4170
02:48:41,600 --> 02:48:44,960
the first thing we need to do is that

4171
02:48:43,200 --> 02:48:48,160
they really need to

4172
02:48:44,960 --> 02:48:48,720
understand them learning from them in in

4173
02:48:48,160 --> 02:48:51,359
order to

4174
02:48:48,720 --> 02:48:52,880
realize that they really need to be

4175
02:48:51,359 --> 02:48:56,319
follow the community-based

4176
02:48:52,880 --> 02:48:59,279
action research and attach to the ground

4177
02:48:56,319 --> 02:49:00,080
working together with them and rather

4178
02:48:59,279 --> 02:49:03,680
otherwise

4179
02:49:00,080 --> 02:49:06,560
we cannot we cannot understand the whole

4180
02:49:03,680 --> 02:49:08,080
it's a whole world it's a whole complex

4181
02:49:06,560 --> 02:49:10,880
complexity

4182
02:49:08,080 --> 02:49:13,200
a live organical world it's not like a

4183
02:49:10,880 --> 02:49:15,840
science it's just a part and a piece

4184
02:49:13,200 --> 02:49:17,040
one special actually in one part we

4185
02:49:15,840 --> 02:49:20,080
really need to understand

4186
02:49:17,040 --> 02:49:23,120
the linkage in the whole systems if we

4187
02:49:20,080 --> 02:49:24,720
not with them we we have no idea so

4188
02:49:23,120 --> 02:49:29,040
that's what i want to add up

4189
02:49:24,720 --> 02:49:31,120
thank you great thank you very much

4190
02:49:29,040 --> 02:49:33,840
joshie you wanted to make a comment

4191
02:49:31,120 --> 02:49:33,840
please go ahead

4192
02:49:37,600 --> 02:49:43,680
yes there is a thread in the discussion

4193
02:49:40,720 --> 02:49:46,800
about what can be recovered for example

4194
02:49:43,680 --> 02:49:50,160
from colonial archives or

4195
02:49:46,800 --> 02:49:54,800
history and material written by

4196
02:49:50,160 --> 02:49:58,000
the outsider right now in the cordillera

4197
02:49:54,800 --> 02:50:00,640
we had to write our own history

4198
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:03,279
because uh the books that are located

4199
02:50:00,640 --> 02:50:06,560
that are used in the schools were all

4200
02:50:03,279 --> 02:50:07,760
colonial history right however we had a

4201
02:50:06,560 --> 02:50:11,200
very strong

4202
02:50:07,760 --> 02:50:14,000
supporter who was a historian and he's

4203
02:50:11,200 --> 02:50:15,439
uh he's an american scholar actually and

4204
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:18,560
he wrote

4205
02:50:15,439 --> 02:50:22,720
cracks through the parchment curtain

4206
02:50:18,560 --> 02:50:26,800
right and what he did was to actually

4207
02:50:22,720 --> 02:50:29,920
use all of the historical uh archives

4208
02:50:26,800 --> 02:50:33,760
but using historical research

4209
02:50:29,920 --> 02:50:34,880
to understand and interpret what was

4210
02:50:33,760 --> 02:50:38,960
actually happening

4211
02:50:34,880 --> 02:50:41,200
in the on the land at that time right

4212
02:50:38,960 --> 02:50:44,240
and that material that he has written

4213
02:50:41,200 --> 02:50:47,359
including his other historical writing

4214
02:50:44,240 --> 02:50:48,560
became the uh supplemented a lot of

4215
02:50:47,359 --> 02:50:50,880
material

4216
02:50:48,560 --> 02:50:52,800
that the students and the researchers

4217
02:50:50,880 --> 02:50:55,600
the indigenous researchers

4218
02:50:52,800 --> 02:50:56,960
used to write our own history of the

4219
02:50:55,600 --> 02:50:59,200
cordillera

4220
02:50:56,960 --> 02:51:01,040
so there really is a lot of material

4221
02:50:59,200 --> 02:51:06,319
that can be

4222
02:51:01,040 --> 02:51:06,319
interpreted in our own way that is uh

4223
02:51:06,800 --> 02:51:10,720
in the colonial archives for example

4224
02:51:09,760 --> 02:51:12,319
when

4225
02:51:10,720 --> 02:51:14,240
even in this is not just in the

4226
02:51:12,319 --> 02:51:15,840
philippines for example in moluccas when

4227
02:51:14,240 --> 02:51:19,840
they needed their maps

4228
02:51:15,840 --> 02:51:21,840
to uh record their customary systems

4229
02:51:19,840 --> 02:51:23,040
they had to go back to the dutch

4230
02:51:21,840 --> 02:51:26,319
libraries

4231
02:51:23,040 --> 02:51:29,040
to get that right so um

4232
02:51:26,319 --> 02:51:31,600
there is a way of there is another

4233
02:51:29,040 --> 02:51:34,720
aspect of the colonization

4234
02:51:31,600 --> 02:51:36,479
of those colonial institutions and i

4235
02:51:34,720 --> 02:51:37,520
think they are starting to take the

4236
02:51:36,479 --> 02:51:41,760
steps

4237
02:51:37,520 --> 02:51:46,319
wherein that history is

4238
02:51:41,760 --> 02:51:48,399
understood and owned and appropriated

4239
02:51:46,319 --> 02:51:51,600
for us to make our own

4240
02:51:48,399 --> 02:51:54,160
uh story and i think uh this is one of

4241
02:51:51,600 --> 02:51:57,760
the strands that has gone through the

4242
02:51:54,160 --> 02:51:57,760
the discussion thank you

4243
02:51:58,080 --> 02:52:02,240
great thank you shoji i'm afraid we're

4244
02:52:01,040 --> 02:52:04,640
out of time now

4245
02:52:02,240 --> 02:52:05,920
it's been great discussion thank you so

4246
02:52:04,640 --> 02:52:07,439
much everybody

4247
02:52:05,920 --> 02:52:09,760
i'm not going to summarize everything

4248
02:52:07,439 --> 02:52:12,319
but just to say um

4249
02:52:09,760 --> 02:52:14,800
yeah i i think this issue that alejandro

4250
02:52:12,319 --> 02:52:17,439
raised about the repatriation

4251
02:52:14,800 --> 02:52:19,680
is um you know really important one and

4252
02:52:17,439 --> 02:52:22,880
we've seen how in the potato park

4253
02:52:19,680 --> 02:52:25,359
repatriation of of native potatoes

4254
02:52:22,880 --> 02:52:26,960
has brought back revived indigenous

4255
02:52:25,359 --> 02:52:29,600
knowledge and culture

4256
02:52:26,960 --> 02:52:31,200
and um you know created a genetic

4257
02:52:29,600 --> 02:52:32,319
reserve that's important for that for

4258
02:52:31,200 --> 02:52:35,439
the whole world

4259
02:52:32,319 --> 02:52:35,840
and there's a lot of um seeds uh that

4260
02:52:35,439 --> 02:52:37,359
that

4261
02:52:35,840 --> 02:52:39,760
indigenous communities have lost and

4262
02:52:37,359 --> 02:52:42,080
that are sitting in in gene banks

4263
02:52:39,760 --> 02:52:43,279
um you know and they could be being used

4264
02:52:42,080 --> 02:52:45,040
and used for

4265
02:52:43,279 --> 02:52:46,880
for climate adaptation and being

4266
02:52:45,040 --> 02:52:49,920
protected in nature

4267
02:52:46,880 --> 02:52:52,560
um so that's a really important issue

4268
02:52:49,920 --> 02:52:53,439
um i wanted to say thank you so much to

4269
02:52:52,560 --> 02:52:56,560
alejandro

4270
02:52:53,439 --> 02:52:58,640
and to baguel chilisa and to florence

4271
02:52:56,560 --> 02:53:00,000
dagutan for your great presentations

4272
02:52:58,640 --> 02:53:02,720
i've learned so much from you

4273
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:04,720
thank you very much and uh thank you to

4274
02:53:02,720 --> 02:53:09,680
the presenters this morning

4275
02:53:04,720 --> 02:53:11,680
and just to close really a few a few

4276
02:53:09,680 --> 02:53:13,040
things that we've learned um in the last

4277
02:53:11,680 --> 02:53:14,560
four webinars

4278
02:53:13,040 --> 02:53:16,319
we've learned that indigenous food

4279
02:53:14,560 --> 02:53:17,200
systems play a critical role in

4280
02:53:16,319 --> 02:53:20,399
achieving

4281
02:53:17,200 --> 02:53:22,399
sdg2 um and in feeding humanity in a

4282
02:53:20,399 --> 02:53:23,040
sustainable way in future in the longer

4283
02:53:22,399 --> 02:53:25,520
term

4284
02:53:23,040 --> 02:53:28,240
and are resilient in a resilient way not

4285
02:53:25,520 --> 02:53:30,560
only to climate change but to covert 19

4286
02:53:28,240 --> 02:53:32,640
and also in a compassionate way because

4287
02:53:30,560 --> 02:53:34,720
of the solidarity values

4288
02:53:32,640 --> 02:53:36,319
and whereas under the current food

4289
02:53:34,720 --> 02:53:37,439
system we're seeing growing food

4290
02:53:36,319 --> 02:53:39,760
insecurity

4291
02:53:37,439 --> 02:53:41,680
and hunger and so indigenous food

4292
02:53:39,760 --> 02:53:43,439
systems provide critical lessons for

4293
02:53:41,680 --> 02:53:46,880
transitions to more sustainable

4294
02:53:43,439 --> 02:53:48,640
and equitable food systems um

4295
02:53:46,880 --> 02:53:50,000
we've heard very strongly today that

4296
02:53:48,640 --> 02:53:52,800
research must address

4297
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:54,640
indigenous people's priorities and the

4298
02:53:52,800 --> 02:53:57,040
many challenges facing

4299
02:53:54,640 --> 02:53:59,120
indigenous food systems and this is

4300
02:53:57,040 --> 02:54:00,640
urgent because we are losing traditional

4301
02:53:59,120 --> 02:54:02,720
knowledge we're losing crops we're

4302
02:54:00,640 --> 02:54:04,720
losing culture very fast

4303
02:54:02,720 --> 02:54:06,479
and research must also address the

4304
02:54:04,720 --> 02:54:08,240
unequal power relations

4305
02:54:06,479 --> 02:54:10,479
between researchers and indigenous

4306
02:54:08,240 --> 02:54:11,760
peoples and be empowering towards

4307
02:54:10,479 --> 02:54:13,760
indigenous peoples

4308
02:54:11,760 --> 02:54:15,040
and give them a voice and recognize them

4309
02:54:13,760 --> 02:54:17,840
as experts

4310
02:54:15,040 --> 02:54:20,080
who have ancestral wisdom that offers

4311
02:54:17,840 --> 02:54:23,760
valuable pathways towards

4312
02:54:20,080 --> 02:54:27,600
sustainable and equitable development

4313
02:54:23,760 --> 02:54:30,800
so finally on terms of the next steps

4314
02:54:27,600 --> 02:54:31,520
we're going to circulate the workshop

4315
02:54:30,800 --> 02:54:33,760
report

4316
02:54:31,520 --> 02:54:35,520
and use the outputs to inform various

4317
02:54:33,760 --> 02:54:38,479
policy meetings

4318
02:54:35,520 --> 02:54:40,960
um i know this hasn't been a perfect

4319
02:54:38,479 --> 02:54:42,720
forum for networking but i hope it's

4320
02:54:40,960 --> 02:54:44,399
you will follow up on contacts that

4321
02:54:42,720 --> 02:54:46,000
