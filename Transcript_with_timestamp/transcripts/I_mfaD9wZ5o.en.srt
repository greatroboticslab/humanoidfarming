people mhm come and help me plant this

486
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:28,480
yeah so guys I wonder why H people they

487
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:31,319
used that common language each and every

488
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:34,079
one why you all of you just using that

489
00:38:31,319 --> 00:38:36,880
common language yeah because it is our

490
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:38,839
language you know let me tell you I want

491
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:42,040
to be very very honest we were colonized

492
00:38:38,839 --> 00:38:45,480
by British people mhm and they taught us

493
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:49,119
English mhm but the really sense when

494
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:52,200
people learn by their own language like

495
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:54,440
I could have they understand better

496
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:56,200
because they learn by their own language

497
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:58,920
and that's why you see the Chinese and

498
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:02,119
many people they learn by their own

499
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:03,599
language so they lied to us they they

500
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:08,200
brought us

501
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:10,920
this name this English so English is not

502
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:13,160
it's just like any other language it's

503
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:16,880
not a mes of Education or what that's

504
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:18,720
why anybody can speak in English so we

505
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,200
speak in our own language do you mean

506
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,359
that the Chinese are not speaking

507
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:25,720
English yeah most of them they don't

508
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:28,079
they learn by their their their language

509
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:30,040
but they don't speak English they speak

510
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:32,960
I I am not saying they don't speak

511
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:35,640
English just get the point straight they

512
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:38,680
speak English but it is not their main

513
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:42,400
they learn by Chinese that's why you see

514
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:45,440
this my my phone my my camera is met

515
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:48,800
from China China that's why it has you

516
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:51,359
see so that's what I'm trying to say so

517
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:54,359
we speak a lot of our vernacular

518
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:56,480

519
00:39:54,359 --> 00:40:01,280
