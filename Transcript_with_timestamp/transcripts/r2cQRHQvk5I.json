  "text": "[Music] hey everybody well I haven't recorded a whole lot lately in the last few days and that's just because not a whole lot interesting has happened so uh kind of hard to find interesting things so anyways it's I don't even know what today is Tuesday it must be tues no oh it's Monday sorry today's Monday yikes that's what you get for being a farmer not knowing what day of the week it is anyways so we're just coming back from town I had a package at the post office and more importantly I have a tube for a sprinkler tire that I'm going to put back on well I done messed up I have I have put tubes in so many of these tires and I have never had this happen obviously I made a mistake but somehow I got the tube wedged between the tire and the rail and I can't get them I'm to the point now where it's like I cannot get that stuffed in so I decided okay well whatever I'll take the tire back apart so I did I got this side off which is the last side I put on uh but the wheel is it's wedged in there hard and I know there's a way to get it apart but um if I am not careful I will get stressed out and I'm going to end up just cutting this whole tire in half to get it off and I don't think I don't think we need that kind of violence today so we're going to let this project sit I'm going to cool off mentally and literally cuz it's hot in [Music] here and we'll see what I decide to do with that I won I beat the system technically I cheated um I I finally got the I put some blocks over I jumped on the tire got it popped off and I was able to get the uh I ended up I was going to try and just push the tube the rest of the way in once it was loose but then I found a spot where I had put a hole in the tube and decided you know what we're just going to take the tube off and see if it holds so I took the tube out the main reason we put tubes in these tires is because when the wheel is in the pivot track the sides of the when it's sunk down a little bit the sides of the track push in on the side of the tire and can squeeze on that sidewall and that's where a lot of our tires have come off um is because of that and if you put a tube in it helps support that and it doesn't really matter sometimes if that sidewall gets pushed in a little bit cuz there's a tube in there um but we've done it this way plenty of times this is how we used to always do it and this how we're going to do it today cuz I won a few days later not a whole lot happened that was interesting at least but we've got some rain coming for the next few days and we've got a couple crops that need cut the grass field and we actually have a field of millet that's getting pretty close so we need to get this machine ready to go um I got a hay buyer coming pretty quick so we're going to jump in this move it over to the shop where it can be worked on and we'll load this person with hay and we'll get going so that's that see you in a minute we sharpened all the blades got those ready to go put a put a nice shiny nice shiny Edge on those you know it's not perfect but we'll get a lot more life out of them assuming they don't get hit by a rock which most of the time that's what brings them to an end very very rarely do we uh there's not really a whole lot of rocks out there it's just I don't know it's hard to explain for some reason it seems to be pretty rare when we actually wear these down to the point of replacement they usually break so at least in this country anyways we got that done we went through and checked the oil checked all the all the oils and the filters blew out all the air filters there's the engine there's the cab filter check the oil the engine oil the I don't even know what you call it crank case oil I'm guessing is what it's called I don't I don't know I'm not a mechanic don't judge me I'm a YouTube Certified mechanic well that started shutting hard for some reason we still got to give it a bath but I'm we're not going to be using this wind rower for a few days cuz it's supposed to rain for about four or 5 days straight um so I have time I have time to give her a bath um where's this handle there we go and hydraulic oils good good there's not a whole lot to check on this side except remind myself when I did the filters um I actually need to look on my chart and see how many hours this machine has run since I did this oil change airbags don't leak yet on our old one they did horribly you had to air them up every single time you went out it was annoying and these do a really good job I love this machine so much it does such a good job the only thing the only thing I don't like about it is that the newer machines I don't know if you'll be able to tell let's get underneath here I don't know what you call that sometimes I call it a baffle but anyways that's what I adjust up and down to determine how wide the wind row is that doesn't actually make sense to me I don't get how adjusting that Up and Down Changes the width of the wind R but it absolutely does much more than these do um but my only issue is that it doesn't do it very evenly so the sides always have more there's always more hay on the edge and there's in the middle and on the newer machines the new New Holland and the new K the the plus series I think cuz this is the let's see this is the 419 just just the 419 momax 2 I guess or the durine durine 419 and on the 49 plus cuz we demoed one last year two years ago and the I'm calling it the bath hole um has on the bottom all these little adjustable um guides or veins that's what they are I guess these adjustable veins that you can adjust manually to get a more even wind row and I've heard they work extremely well I've seen some videos but I I've also heard that Massie Fergusons work really good too the newer ones at least um so I don't know that's my only disgruntle with this I would still prefer this over Massie Ferguson purely because in our circumstance this 19t head is absolutely amazing that is that is really nice it works really nice with our rake really nice with the Bor especially on Alfalfa you get done a lot quicker with all these fields and then of course I put the aftermarket Trimble in there um cuz I can't stand the pro 700 worst monitor ever created but case's new monitor I haven't gotten to try it but I've heard it works really nice and we're just putting the shield but it looks really nice looks much more user friendly than the pro 700 so we have we've had a few Pro 700s and they just I don't like them but I have there is still a pro 7 wealth I guess it's called The intell View because it's New Holland there is still an intell view monitor in there uh and that's just to run the machine cuz I need to be able to see all the machine data so all the machine data runs on this monitor all the GPS functions run on this Monitor and man it works so nice and with this we get a a the the RTX it's like 400 bucks a year super cheap as compared to I don't know maybe you can get RTX on these too I I don't know but for the same price but anyways this when we ran GPS here if you didn't have a subscription it's useless GPS on this is useless without a subscription unless you're going in straight lines um but the subscription for this monitor was like $2,000 some dollars a year and we quit doing that cuz we're not planting as much corn as we used to so it didn't become and just in our situation in general it's not as important to us as it used to be so we still need the accuracy I use that that monitor and the nav 900 they go on our other tractor in the spring but don't really need it during the summer so anyways we got this all done probably not today but maybe tomorrow I'll give this guy a bath and I think I think that'll about do it today um I was working on yesterday this is an air dryer off one of our trucks and I've recently learned that you're supposed to replace these filters this is just an air filter I guess and so Grandpa went and picked one up but it's the wrong this is the ad IP and this is for the adsp um and then of course this is the purge valve uh that's what this box is for this is the filter but wrong fil wrong wrong dryer is what this is for so I got to take this back probably tomorrow and then who knows I might do it today we'll see how I feel after lunch but it's just it's a really long drive so anyways I guess that's it that's probably going to be it for today and I'll get back to you tomorrow or whenever something interesting happens well we've got a ourselves a fun new project we are I got the loader I got the loader in the shop here um I already went through and relieved all the pressure off of the the boom and everything else that I could find and these lines although I think I'm going to do it on the other side there's this is one of the lift cylinders and these are the two lines going into it um we'll zoom out a little bit there we go and this is the other side and this is where I'm actually going to do this at so we are putting a scale on this loader we're going to try that out and see see how well that works sounds like a good idea so um kind of did a did a poll with some of our customers and they all said that it would be really nice if we had a scale so I have to take these two connections off because the way this scale works is they they plug in a pressure transducer into the lift cylinder and it needs the pressure off the lift cylinder to determine the weight after it's been calibrated but I have to take these off and figure out not only what type of connection they are but also um what size and I'm not an expert in hydraulic connections so uh I'm going to do some research I'm going to go eat breakfast and while I'm doing that I'm going to do some research on exactly how to figure out what type and what size it is we'll pop these off take some measurements and get it sent in and then the way it'll work is there will be some sort of a computer apparatus that I don't know where I'm going to mount it yet maybe somewhere like right here or somewhere it's got to be I want it somewhere where it's not going to get it's got to be on the front of the frame cuz I I want it ahead of the pivot point so I don't know where the best place to put it is maybe on the inside that might be a good spot actually we'll have to see make sure that's it's not going to get too close to anything but I don't think it will um so we'll do that and then that'll send a wireless signal to a tablet I'm still got to replace that window to a tablet that is mounted up there and um that's how we measure the weight so that'll be a from Project we won't actually get it for a few weeks they said it takes a little while to order in my SP and and to get them set up but once we do get it installed this will be a pretty fun little apparatus so I'm going to go eat breakfast and we'll come back to this so I forgot to video of the whole process but we popped one of these off they're both the same we popped one of these off and I took a bunch of measurements uh did some research online to figure out turns out this is a I've never heard heard of this again I'm not an expert but it's called a D connector is the style and I guess they're all in metric which would make sense anyways took the measurements and now we're going to go over to the house and send those in an email so the scale company can get the scale sent this way in today's Deep dive we dive deep I thought that was pretty good anyways um got a lot of stuff taken apart I know I was talking about putting the scale on here the other day and I mean got all that figured out actually there's a new place where that scale is going to go and let me get my flashlight here so we've actually decided oh boy boy are you going to focus there we go so we've actually decided that [Music] down oh you're not going to be able to see it from here but there's some line some hoses run across the bottom some line steel lines and it's a lot more protected under there than cuz I called the company and I was like hey I don't I don't know how much I actually want Electronics hanging out right here cuz I know how much junk builds up there in the winter and I asked him if it was okay if we put it inside inside of here with all the other stuff that's protected and he said that was fine so the reason this is tore AP apart and the steps are on the ground and everything which I only have about an hour to get this put back together cuz we got hay a hay chart coming is because the parking brake doesn't work and well I should say works period doesn't function the way it's supposed to and the the ride control which is the boom suspension uh also doesn't work now that I have never gotten that to even start to work so I don't know that's its own separate issue I haven't figured that one out yet but the parking brake these are the the nitrogen accumulators I guess you call it and they run the parking brake I believe they're also supposed to run the boom suspension the parking brake itself operates let's see if I can turn this light on here the parking brake itself is that little green lever sticking out and you can see I have the linkage unhooked for a very good reason because anytime the parking brake it it goes to it it um what do you call that it defaults to parking brake engaged on this machine so what that means is that any time if the parking brake doesn't work it's engaged and you can't move so I unhooked the linkage and that will not get hooked back up until I can solve the problem because what happens is you're driving along I got it to it started working um last year it started working suddenly and so I got it all hooked back up excited and it worked fine for about 2 weeks and then all of a sudden both when me and Grandpa were both at different times driving this machine it was both when we were backing up thankfully and I always wear my seat Bel but you know grandpa doesn't and we were backing up parking brake engages oh my gosh when I tell you it feels like you got in a car wreck goodness gracious immediately I unhooked it I was like I'm not playing that game that's dumb So the plan is I can I've determined it's it has to be electrical I don't get it cuz what'll happen is like you'll hit the parking brake button and test and various and this and that and all of a sudden just stops working so it's I'm pretty sure it's electrical I haven't figured out what about it I don't understand what I don't know I'm not an engineer guys so I know down behind here is the actual valve and the solenoid itself I was kind of thinking it might be the solenoid and I was going to take that off and then check it but then I started realizing that if this whole system is under pressure I don't know if I want to take this illinoid out I mean if it's safe to do so I might just have to call Volvo um and get advice from them but that's where we're at now kind of to the point where I just got to get this back together real quick at least good enough to go we'll see I can get in the cab without the steps on and if I load the truck that's okay we'll see we'll see what I do I got everything greased up yesterday as well I greased everything on this machine crawled underneath did all the drive shafts all that at some point I need to check these planetaries that hasn't been done in a really long time and really needs done so we're going to get to work I'm going to get this put back together and we'll get it out of here and ready to go",
