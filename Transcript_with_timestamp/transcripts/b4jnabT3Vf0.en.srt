multilingual webinar series where we are

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:19,830
trying to mobilize and spend awareness

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:23,070
about water management importance of

8
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:25,199
water conservation in half developed

9
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,960
techniques the water can be managed well

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,510
in agricultural my name is Krishna

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,420
Sharma and I am working as a coordinator

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,520
prosperity now I will just introduce you

14
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:41,340
to a project called web Peru which we

have been doing from last five years now

16
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,050
so underwater at this water productivity

17
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,200
project or web Pro we're essentially

18
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:51,870
trying to create a dream value chains

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,000
where the rice is produced using water

20
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:58,440
efficient farming techniques and the

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,149
protocol rice is exported to market

22
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:04,559
partners like cocoa

23
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:06,659
Mars and lt foods

24
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,909

keep the lead to mr. Sharma now and we

60
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,540
will discuss the first question which is

61
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:57,770
what is the importance of water in

62
00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:02,850
agriculture and how we can manage it

63
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:05,630
dr. Sharma over to you thank you good

64
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,630
afternoon everyone

65
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:12,209
answer to the question what is the

66
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:15,480
importance of water in agriculture I

67
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:18,720
would like to start from a little a

68
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:21,750
little with a little perspective at the

69
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:27,300
time of Independence our population was

70
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:31,709
only 33 rows 330 million now we have 1.3

71
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:33,810
billion and the agriculture issue was

72
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:36,360
such that at that time we were not

73
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:46,350
finding it possible to feed our own

74
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:48,930
people no we have done a lot of

75
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:53,790
management issues they have less they

76
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:56,269
have strictly because you see what was

77
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:59,790
correct at that time Green Revolution

78
00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:05,130
now things have changed now we have

79
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:08,600
become population but we were then and

80
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:12,000
there are some serious quality issues

81
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:13,650
quantity issues of water no to the

82
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,570
question what is the importance of water

83
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:18,030
in agriculture now it is the chicken

84
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:20,609
tree but whatever we have whatever

85
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:23,760
resources whatever inputs we have owned

86
00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:26,640
over at our disposal we must leverage

87
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:30,720
that we must erase them forever benefit

88
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:33,320
and what do we have here is water there

89
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,750
are some countries which are which are

90
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:39,900
quite water deficient for example in

91
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:46,100
Israel the per unit water fill ability

92
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:46,100
is less than and we are currently it is

93
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,539
approximately only

94
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:09,440
mr. Shah we can't show you I think

95
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:14,380
there's some technical issue hello yeah

96
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:20,060
yes yes so we can hear you not me okay

97
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:23,470
so what you see first coming back to the

98
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:26,240
question what is a big future

99
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:28,220
in agriculture water is very much

100
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,240
important because it is one of the few

101
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:34,490
resources which we have at our disposal

102
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:36,350
if we can leverage to feed of paper to

103
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:42,080
keep our country stable and prosperous

104
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:45,260
and and all the rest so we cannot

105
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,750
straightaway discount water and we

106
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:51,110
cannot also leave aside the issues of

107
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:55,030
environment about quality and all so

108
00:05:51,110 --> 00:06:00,710
when we will really need is to have a

109
00:05:55,030 --> 00:06:03,970
multi-faceted approach in my opinion my

110
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:08,990
personal opinion we cannot straightaway

111
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:12,110
neglect over supply supply side by side

112
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:16,100
results or splice side our answers and

113
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:25,160
either we can neglect our demand side

114
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:28,160
options we have to manage incident so I

115
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:30,230
think this is this is how I would like

116
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,290
to conclude is that we will have to

117
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:35,840
manage it by making a very fine a very

118
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:39,440
delicate balance between our demand side

119
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:42,650
solution and supply side solutions we

120
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:49,190
cannot straight away we remain dependent

121
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:50,870
upon one of them thank you thank you mr.

122
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:53,270
Sharma thank you so much for sharing

123
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:55,580
movies you will absolutely correct that

124
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:57,080
how there should be balanced well

125
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,760
maintained between how much with

126
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,950
demanding and how much reproduce in

127
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,840
against what resources are involved

128
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:06,140
because often what's the debate is that

129
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:10,010
I'll be really selling our crops of

130
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:12,800
- rice or really selling water so if you

131
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:14,620
manage a water well then of course I can

132
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,990
be looked after

133
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:21,710
thank you so much I could request you to

134
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:23,330
meet you video coming to the next

135
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:26,270
questions which is again one of the very

136
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:28,510
important question is understanding the

137
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:31,130
basics of what we're trying to do and

138
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:33,280
what is sustainable agriculture really

139
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:36,320
and right now to Delpy have with us

140
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,750
water and environment crew from

141
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:41,000
Uttarakhand who has done extensive work

142
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:43,820
in developing water management

143
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,740
techniques and you also have farmers in

144
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:49,430
Haryana we are trying to replicate this

145
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:51,410
model but before getting into them and

146
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:54,320
listening to definitions and views I

147
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:56,630
would request Lockett to present how he

148
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,040
was on this second question what is

149
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:03,560
technically go to sustainable

150
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:05,570
agriculture and why do we need it thank

151
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,450
you so much for the opportunity to share

152
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:10,310
more about what is sustainable

153
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:12,560
agriculture and and why do we need it

154
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:16,190
and maybe from the perspective of a

155
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:19,460
global big company and I would like to

156
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:20,750

162
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:58,400
yeah okay excellent

163
00:08:53,780 --> 00:09:01,520
okay so I work for Mars food to be part

164
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:03,680
of the big mass Inc company and we are

165
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,590
owners of the biggest global rice

166
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,440
friends and today I would like to share

167
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:10,610
a little bit background like why

168
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:13,040
sustainable rice becomes more and more

169
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:20,000
important in countries like Europe the

170
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:25,640
US but why it's also like Mars so first

171
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,770
of all as Marsh family and we find it

172
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:30,440
very important that we can make it

173
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:39,860
impacts so it's important we can drive

174
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:45,670
change we can also can so can everyone

175
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:45,670
go on mute please yeah I think yeah good

176
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:53,960
and driving impact is key and also we

177
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:56,630
identified within Mars our top products

178
00:09:53,960 --> 00:10:00,460
and we can see that rice which is using

179
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:03,950
40% of the world's irrigation available

180
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:07,120
as business we shoot X upon what's a

181
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:10,640
reduction so that's something we do yeah

182
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,650
also why sustain rice is important it's

183
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,870
also important that's we can source

184
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:17,000
basmati it's growing it's growing in

185
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:20,150
Europe it's growing in the stage people

186
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,460
want to eat this fragrant rice so it's

187
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:25,040
import we have we can source from India

188
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:27,770
so it's important we can source quality

189
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,260
and health safety rice it's always

190
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:33,110
number one but we also think in the

191
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:34,430
future so also we want to source our

192
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:38,270
vast matting right so we need a

193
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:39,050
long-term supply well if water aquifers

194
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,510
are dropping

195
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:43,250
we need to act upon this we need to

196
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:45,590
think in the future for that reason we

197
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:47,810
are now partnering in the voucher

198
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:50,930
program in we really want safer water

199
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:53,640
stewardship approach and we also have

200
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:55,940
basmati rice in ten years time

201
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,320
even though we're very small of course

202
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:00,900
but for that reason we've partnering

203
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,450
with our suppliers but we also very

204
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:08,220
active in platforms as well like the

205
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:09,930
sustainable rice platform yeah another

206
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,730
aspects like why is sustainability

207
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:14,070
important it's it's important for own

208
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:17,610
and so shit's our own employees in Mars

209
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:21,210
and of course we also need to change it

210
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:23,070
into into growth in the business so for

211
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:25,800
instance but now you see it's very

212
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:27,540
important consumers they want to know

213
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,910
where is their food coming from it's

214
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:32,010
called a trust chain they want to know

215
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:34,500
where it's grown where it's coming from

216
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:36,540
and we do this for instance by putting

217
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:39,150
stories on the back of the back and we

218
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:44,090
show how much water is saved and by

219
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:46,590
farmers that grow yet great basmati rice

220
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:49,740
so having this in mind this is more like

221
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:52,740
saying why why it's so important that we

222
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:55,460
work on sustainability thinking about

223
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:58,470
the future yeah

224
00:11:55,460 --> 00:12:01,350
then as a business we have set goals so

225
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:03,450
we said we can't do it on our own so we

226
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:05,910
member and take a leadership in the rice

227
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:07,530
platform and I think that's that's also

228
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:09,600
something we're now working on an India

229
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:13,980
we have plans maybe to set up a national

230
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:16,230
chapter about sustained rise platform we

231
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:18,120
also said we want to source rice from

232
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:20,850
the sustainer rice platform standard

233
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,890
that's one way how you can measure that

234
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:26,040
Farms are growing sustainable rice which

235
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:29,250
is key but we also say this is not

236
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:32,160
enough so we also say farmers they need

237
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:34,200
income otherwise it cannot join and

238
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,840
profit from any program so we need to

239
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:40,050
improve yields have meta access to

240
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:43,350
finance think also let's see how farmers

241
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:45,330
can sell their products like straw so we

242
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:48,780
need to work on income and today's topic

243
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:50,580
is about what I use so in high water

244
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:52,560
stress areas we need to reduce the water

245
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:54,870
use

246
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:59,029
and of course this is all linked to it

247
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:59,029
each other we can not only booze

248
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:19,720
[Music]

249
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:22,360
so we locate and there's some technical

250
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:29,170
issue I can't show you properly do it

251
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:31,900
also my partner switch in okay okay sure

252
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:37,000
did you hear my previous slides like the

253
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:43,630
goals properly yeah should I do it again

254
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:47,290
yes really nice okay yeah so as a

255
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:49,660
company we have set goals and first of

256
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:50,260
all we acknowledge we cannot do it on

257
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:53,140
our own

258
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:56,770
so for that reason we have joined the

259
00:13:53,140 --> 00:14:00,730
sustain will rise platform both the

260
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:04,780
platform as well as adopting the rice

261
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:07,240
standards and we also really supporting

262
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:11,110
deaths in India we set up a national

263
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:15,510
chapter so that actors can be united in

264
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:20,370
yeah it's locating for sustainable rice

265
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:23,500
we in our goals we don't only see it as

266
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:27,790
SRP is the only one solution we also

267
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:30,100
work on income and what our use so that

268
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:32,530
means we need to work on better work

269
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:36,730
capital for rice growers increasing

270
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:38,200
yields lowering input costs as well we

271
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:40,930
see it we need to work on water

272
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:43,000
stewardship and all the goals of course

273
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:45,580
are interlinked together and something

274
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,980
reshoots and bets in in a similar

275
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:51,620
framework

276
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:58,790
could you hear me now yeah we do we are

277
00:14:51,620 --> 00:15:00,769
with you okay okay good yeah we can't do

278
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:03,080
it on our own so we very active with a

279
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:06,800
lot of different partners we're having

280
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:09,110
who know this context very well and we

281
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,430
work closely with our suppliers we are

282
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:12,800
very advocating that we work through

283
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:16,850
Miller associations to really drive

284
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:20,209
sector change there may be the final

285
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:23,180
slides um what we always see that we

286
00:15:20,209 --> 00:15:24,980
need to to think about the future long

287
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:27,980
term view so we need to think how can we

288
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:30,079
change the system so I would dream our

289
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:33,019
vision is Haryana shoots be an

290
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:35,870
attractive area that we can source high

291
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:39,110
quality basmati you know it's efficient

292
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:41,990
water in the future but it only starts

293
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:43,519
with if rice farmers they are

294
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:45,980
entrepreneurs they think as

295
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:49,130
enterpreneurs so grow rice and wheat in

296
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:50,839
a system and as well also farmers they

297
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:53,980
become stewards themselves of the

298
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:56,870
environments yeah they need this

299
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:59,060
well-functioning egg reserve system so

300
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:00,529
good governance should be there there

301
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:03,529
should be a good private sector

302
00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:05,899
supporting them so what we do now we

303
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:08,690
work with our partners on having a goods

304
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:10,760
rice value chain we need to work on

305
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:13,339
adoption of climate smart practices and

306
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:17,000
we need to improve the enabling

307
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:21,890
environment so the policy parts yeah yep

308
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:24,529
I would stop here and then give it next

309
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:27,620
speaker yeah thank you okay in fact

310
00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:29,630
injury is very important points but says

311
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:33,260
that farmers have to start working is

312
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:35,209
what rusty was really however my

313
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:37,160
question really is as a farmer as

314
00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:41,380
someone who is directly working one team

315
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,380
when someone has to make a choice

316
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:45,890
they need to to understand the business

317
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:47,750
model so when you say the farmers have

318
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:51,350
to become entrepreneurs they also have

319
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:53,630
to find the utility of choosing what are

320
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:55,610
efficient techniques over the

321
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:58,600
conventional farming techniques will

322
00:16:55,610 --> 00:17:01,600
fear anything - anything to add on that

323
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,600
but

324
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:09,600
yeah ISO agreed the business case should

325
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:12,150
be very clear so we always see the

326
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,459
income going hands and hands with water

327
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:16,620
so for instance we work now on a pre

328
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:19,410
finance model to get away the rabble

329
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:21,630
bank so that farmers can do for instance

330
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:24,630
lace telephony as a technique which also

331
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:27,540
will increase yields as well it will

332
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:30,960
reduce water as well so that's just one

333
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:32,790
example and as well we look at for

334
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,490
instance how we can use the byproducts

335
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:36,770
of rice for instance they sell the straw

336
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:40,049
so we always need to think through

337
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:45,350
longer term you have this model as well

338
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:45,350
yeah yeah absolutely correct

339
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:51,000
now I would like to open our slow to

340
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:53,279
four questions to the farmers were

341
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,929
sitting directly in Haryana in fact it

342
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:57,210
is important that you raised the point

343
00:17:54,929 --> 00:18:00,750
of virgon at the facility six percent of

344
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:03,269
the exported rice is a load coming from

345
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:07,860
Indiana of the whole of the country so I

346
00:18:03,269 --> 00:18:10,950
would request my colleague in taking

347
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:13,440
hurry on up ability to kindly open his

348
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:56,159
video and maybe we can hear from what

349
00:18:13,440 --> 00:19:00,380
farmers have to say goodbye remove

350
00:18:56,159 --> 00:19:00,380
cakana cheerio what is the importance of

351
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:15,570
local give me a minute and drink

352
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:26,070
translate and understand what Angie a

353
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:28,470
British attorney I think there's some

354
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:30,690
confusion but because it may be I want

355
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:34,460
to use the chat section so that we can

356
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:34,460
read the question from there

357
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,930
[Music]

358
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:56,770
[Music]

359
00:19:47,290 --> 00:20:01,810
 a partner for general efficient

360
00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:04,760
lucky and it's fishermen who spoke a

361
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:06,740
while back I would request any one of

362
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:11,330
you would know who would like to take

363
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:15,230
this question I think should magic us

364
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:17,150
anymore so now people would like to

365
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:19,840
address this question that how rainwater

366
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,840
can be used

367
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,540
actually I think Sudhir might be the

368
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:26,429
best one to answer because he's more

369
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:28,830
than water specialist of Irie

370
00:20:26,429 --> 00:20:31,980
I can give my thoughts for collecting

371
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:34,650
rainwater I better leave it to the more

372
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:38,360
what a specialist yeah

373
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:38,360
not just a date if you would

374
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:47,090
we can't hear you

375
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:47,090
dr. Safir if you can maybe try to unmute

376
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:06,650
dr. Safir we continue I think there's

377
00:21:04,409 --> 00:21:06,650
something

378
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:11,290
you

379
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,420
you

380
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:42,320
can you hear me now yeah I'm so sorry

381
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:44,780
yes yeah it's all technology um so thank

382
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:47,120
you very much and I'm very glad to see

383
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:50,510
you know all farmers and just just

384
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:54,140
inform them I'm also from Haryana so

385
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:57,169
that's very kind of good moment to see

386
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:59,450
people from my state the question which

387
00:21:57,169 --> 00:22:01,690
has been asked and and performer I'm

388
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:04,760
sitting in Manila working for a

389
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:07,010
internationalisation for rice so the

390
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:10,309
question which has been asked I think

391
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:12,140
question is not how to you know usually

392
00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:14,870
in water I'm looking at the chat box for

393
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:18,620
how to help in raising the groundwater

394
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:21,799
table which is kind of related question

395
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:23,330
that so there is a two-part first we

396
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:26,750
need to understand why groundwater is

397
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:29,510
going down so that's the first part and

398
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:31,730
the second part is how we can help so

399
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:36,080
there has been a lot of research done by

400
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:39,710
by universities by I see our Center on

401
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:42,980
how you can capture rainwater and how

402
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:45,590
that can be kind of linked to the

403
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:48,799
aquifer so the basically there has been

404
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:51,740
work done by different centers where at

405
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:55,730
the corner of your their field they kind

406
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:58,280
of installed a a bore well if you want

407
00:22:55,730 --> 00:23:01,070
to call it and then that that act as a

408
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:03,740
water harvesting and the rainwater goes

409
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:06,110
directly to the keeper so the first part

410
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:08,780
is that by that whatever runoff is

411
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:11,030
happening that goes to your aquifer but

412
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:13,789
the more importantly thing is that the

413
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:16,789
the degree with which we can recharge

414
00:23:13,789 --> 00:23:19,400
the groundwater that is still less than

415
00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:21,919
the rate which we are extracting the

416
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:24,470
water so I think we need to also control

417
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:27,440
the extraction path that how we will

418
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:30,110
reduce our extraction so that the

419
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:36,020
depletion rate can be reduced so we feel

420
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:38,570
stop here thank you so much theater for

421
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:41,720
your sharing good news

422
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:44,270
with us and what you says it's it's very

423
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,980
important that house some techniques

424
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:50,450
which has to be introduced on ground

425
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:52,790
needs to be done and just move into the

426
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:56,990
next question which we have from

427
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:59,450
Rockland is the

428
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:01,039
what techniques can be adopted in Robbie

429
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:04,510
crop management will be independent

430
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,510
withdrawn water sources

431
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:11,970
so if any of us because would like to

432
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:14,400
answer this question of any doctors to

433
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:19,020
distance me you are this example or

434
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:21,450
something right and you know again yes

435
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:23,010
the question is not for rice that's for

436
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:25,590
OB season and it's very very interesting

437
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:28,950
that how we look from the system

438
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:31,529
perspective not only from from rice or

439
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:34,679
or abhi season there has been a lot of

440
00:24:31,529 --> 00:24:37,260
work done in eastern India ass face in

441
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:39,630
eastern occur for days specie they are

442
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:43,049
I'm sure some of the farmers are

443
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:45,510
friendlier about briceida dries and then

444
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:49,770
not for rice but then they go for only

445
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:53,309
seeing Oh beat to kept up the residual

446
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:55,260
soil moisture with this small and be

447
00:24:53,309 --> 00:24:58,110
serious about what we call window

448
00:24:55,260 --> 00:25:01,740
operation you can reduce one irrigation

449
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:04,380
so there is a lot of work going on how

450
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:06,899
in eastern purposes basically we talk

451
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:11,039
about you know two to three degrees and

452
00:25:06,899 --> 00:25:13,950
maximum to irrigation so if you can with

453
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:17,220
system thinking if you can capture the

454
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:19,799
residual moisture from rice starting

455
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:22,610
early with be dries with briceida dries

456
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:26,850
and then capturing residual moisture

457
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:29,880
going with that's not in efficient you

458
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:33,360
pee but in lot of work in punjab haryana

459
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:35,340
is going on using straw as a mulch so

460
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,130
with happy cereal lot of work is going

461
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:40,140
on in Haryana but that's not much input

462
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:43,049
for this in Uttar Pradesh I think there

463
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:45,390
is a lot of scope to go for early

464
00:25:43,049 --> 00:25:47,610
planting of weight and using the regular

465
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:51,210
moisture of rice rather than wasting it

466
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:52,830
yeah thank you so much dr. su th by

467
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:56,309
telling you sir that how the byproducts

468
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:58,919
capacity Q's we have couple of questions

469
00:25:56,309 --> 00:26:00,990
coming over and we would like us because

470
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:03,480
to ask them unfortunately we didn't

471
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:05,970
adopt ricotta with us in everything as

472
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:09,659
we would go forward and move in towards

473
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:12,510
the third question we would have these

474
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:14,970
answered questions answered in the next

475
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:17,290
session would close the question on

476
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:20,710
special for now

477
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:24,690
and then went to the third question of

478
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:24,690
today's presentation which is

479
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:34,350
how can technology be used in

480
00:26:28,999 --> 00:26:36,989
improvising agricultural practices so

481
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:40,649
dr. Spier if you can enlighten us with

482
00:26:36,989 --> 00:26:42,269
your views sure and I think this will

483
00:26:40,649 --> 00:26:44,100
also help to address some of the

484
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:46,769
questions which are coming which are

485
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:49,109
indeed very interesting so when we talk

486
00:26:46,769 --> 00:26:51,299
about how technology can be used in

487
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:53,279
provide aggregate share practices I

488
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:55,769
think we need to think about what we

489
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:57,929
mean by technologies people in you know

490
00:26:55,769 --> 00:27:01,529
see technology from different

491
00:26:57,929 --> 00:27:05,369
perspectives technology because we per

492
00:27:01,529 --> 00:27:09,739
se kind of practice you know the tools

493
00:27:05,369 --> 00:27:09,739
so the the recommendation

494
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:19,970
we kind of enabling tools to ease the

495
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:22,640
decision-making and technology can be

496
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:26,600
also in terms of catalyzing the adoption

497
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:29,240
of improved practices so it depends on

498
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:32,330
how we define that technology and I will

499
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:34,190
briefly talk about all three so when we

500
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:36,980
say about technology so people generally

501
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:39,860
say technology as something new a new

502
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:42,980
product motions are coming like drip

503
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:46,400
irrigation sand and documents and about

504
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:49,520
laser labeling so it depends on what is

505
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:52,400
our purpose is if our purpose is kind of

506
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:55,400
applying the less irrigation water then

507
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:57,230
we can go with the technology like laser

508
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,210
leveling so laser leveling will

509
00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:01,280
basically what will it will help that

510
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:05,300
the amount of water which you applied

511
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:06,950
whether you apply like five centimeter

512
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:09,830
standing water ten centimeter whatever

513
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:11,870
you apply it to reach to that AMA level

514
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:14,150
the water quality require will be less

515
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:17,750
and I think at least in India there has

516
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:19,610
been sufficient adoption of laser

517
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:21,260
leveling a load in punjab haryana but

518
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:24,290
now it's speaking in eastern Uttar

519
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:26,780
Pradesh and Bihar alone and there is a

520
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:29,720
clear visible benefit of laser leveling

521
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:33,500
in terms of reducing the water and and

522
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:35,810
increasing the yield but then also if

523
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:38,240
there are other technology like if you

524
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:39,950
don't know if you want to reduce or you

525
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,060
want to increase the interval between

526
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:43,340
two irrigations

527
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:45,230
so how frequently you are applying

528
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:47,630
irrigation and then the technology like

529
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:53,030
alternate wetting and drying which is

530
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:56,540
again quite quite famous now in South

531
00:28:53,030 --> 00:29:00,440
Asia that you you should have continuous

532
00:28:56,540 --> 00:29:02,720
flooding you can dry your field to

533
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:05,840
certain level and there is a simple tool

534
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:08,680
to do that but then we also talked about

535
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:11,570
technology where you can reduce the

536
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:13,790
amount of water but you cannot reduce

537
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:16,790
the frequency so it's a frequent a flash

538
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:19,670
application of water that is brief so in

539
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:21,770
brief we have a technology where the

540
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:23,810
amount of water can be significantly

541
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:25,040
reduced but you need to apply it like

542
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:27,080
more or less daily

543
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:29,900
because it meet the idea for translating

544
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:31,940
demand so the point here is it depends

545
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,750
on what is the what are the challenges

546
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:35,240
in the reason

547
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:37,750
similarly when it's come to water it's

548
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:41,300
not only water per se it's also energy

549
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:44,510
in punjab and haryana it's most of the

550
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:46,490
pumps are on on electricity as we go

551
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:48,920
down in the eastern side there is a lot

552
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:52,010
of diesel operated pump and then it

553
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:54,140
comes to lydic how we can reduce the

554
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:57,440
energy footprints also and there are

555
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:59,150
different solutions easily in the in the

556
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,760
coastal regions there has been lot of

557
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:03,710
adoption of axial flow pump compared to

558
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,330
centrifugal pump where your energy put

559
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:08,150
pins can be significantly reduced

560
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:10,790
or there has been lot of projects now

561
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:13,130
started by by Government of India on

562
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:18,080
solar power so it's kind of green energy

563
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:20,300
using the green energy this is one one

564
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:23,000
lens using irrigation or energy the

565
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:25,340
other lens in terms of improving the

566
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,890
adaptation you know tapestry of the

567
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:30,590
farmer and in that one some of the

568
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:33,470
farmer asked about water harvesting so

569
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:35,990
basically if you if you can harvest the

570
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:39,080
water that improve your you know

571
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:40,520
capacity to adapt you know like if you

572
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:42,380
are going through drought so you can

573
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:44,750
apply supplemental irrigation and there

574
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:46,870
is a lot of work done on on clove

575
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:51,890
estimation method like dry seeded rice

576
00:30:46,870 --> 00:31:02,470
but if if you can allow me to share the

577
00:30:51,890 --> 00:31:02,470
screen pista if I can you hear me

578
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:12,759
okay thank you

579
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:15,279
then can you see my my screen I I think

580
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:18,700
you are mute so I'm assuming that you

581
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:24,120
are able to see yes yes i'm able to seem

582
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:24,120
sorry african to the screen yeah

583
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:37,250
oh okay can you see now not really we

584
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:41,450
can't see you scream you need to kick

585
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:43,340
twice like air and then you need to do a

586
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:55,690
lot more permission step

587
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:55,690
I think twice and then yeah

588
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:13,909
yet now we can

589
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:18,690
okay you can you can see so basically

590
00:32:13,909 --> 00:32:22,380
what it went to different screen so not

591
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:25,590
sure this screen you are looking at all

592
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:28,110
right let's listen yeah okay let let

593
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:30,750
let's get it simple so what I mean here

594
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:32,549
that we generally as a as a researcher

595
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:35,580
we generally offer lot of technology to

596
00:32:32,549 --> 00:32:38,210
farmers and sometimes made them

597
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:42,299
contribute we sometimes we are very much

598
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:45,210
ecology driven and in real sense I think

599
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:48,570
what farmers need help on is making a

600
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:50,730
decision that what what are the best way

601
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:53,399
to make that decision what technology

602
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:56,100
can be picked and technology know is not

603
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:58,289
only about like following laser leveling

604
00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:01,350
or not the decision is whether laser

605
00:32:58,289 --> 00:33:03,450
leveling is required or not or after how

606
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:08,039
many years later learning is required

607
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:09,750
whether for your system I repeat is a

608
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:12,389
good option so maybe you are getting in

609
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:15,000
a frame you you target the system game

610
00:33:12,389 --> 00:33:18,360
so there is a lot of work which is

611
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,429
required in terms of helping farmer in

612
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:22,200
decision making and now he was talking

613
00:33:20,429 --> 00:33:24,570
about enabling environment and this is

614
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:28,500
similar to that one that where you

615
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:31,230
invest on building the capacity of the

616
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:34,080
system that is also with policy lens but

617
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:37,019
then now there are lot of ICT IOT based

618
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,669
tool which are very powerful in terms of

619
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:40,950
picking the right at newly which are

620
00:33:38,669 --> 00:33:42,570
suitable for a particular reason farmers

621
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:44,789
in haryana their questions are different

622
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:47,399
than farmers in purple bays and farmers

623
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:50,039
in bihar so we cannot fit one size to

624
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:54,840
all and it's very very important that we

625
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:56,789
we use now the tools in terms of leaving

626
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:59,010
it with farmers I have been telling that

627
00:33:56,789 --> 00:34:01,380
this is best for you leaving with them

628
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:04,649
to pick what is best for them because

629
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:06,289
they are the kind of best people to

630
00:34:04,649 --> 00:34:08,369
understand the regular environment

631
00:34:06,289 --> 00:34:12,060
understand their challenge and I think

632
00:34:08,369 --> 00:34:15,000
what we can do is helping them in terms

633
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:17,700
of exploring the cafeteria of

634
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,589
technologies and and telling them the

635
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:22,190
pros and cons of different technologies

636
00:34:19,589 --> 00:34:25,389
and and then these

637
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:29,919
can also help to catalyze the chains

638
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:32,690
which are required you can see that it's

639
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:35,030
there is one more slide which is

640
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:38,030
basically saying that we have

641
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:39,679
technologies but and we know the

642
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:41,149
stakeholder need but technology them

643
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:43,669
generally doesn't reach to the

644
00:34:41,149 --> 00:34:47,480
stakeholders and that's the gap which we

645
00:34:43,669 --> 00:34:50,540
need to fill that how how what kind of

646
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:53,899
now tools we can develop so that we can

647
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:58,339
reach add metal near to farmers I'll

648
00:34:53,899 --> 00:35:01,099
stop here for now all right thank you so

649
00:34:58,339 --> 00:35:04,369
much dr. Sudhir you're absolutely

650
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:06,260
correct in how we have been we do need

651
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:09,020
to enable these farmers to make it

652
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:11,329
informed choice and it and this enabling

653
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:13,460
factor who could have multiple values

654
00:35:11,329 --> 00:35:16,190
one could be to give them the

655
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:18,170
appropriate information of whatever kind

656
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:23,869
of facility is available the kind of

657
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:26,300
videos or just share the screen or even

658
00:35:23,869 --> 00:35:28,880
at the part of the government of what in

659
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:30,440
terms of what kind of initiatives in the

660
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,990
schemes are available for example

661
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:35,150
subsidies we have been involved in this

662
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:38,960
part of enabling farmers by training

663
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:41,540
them in various kinds of for a few water

664
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:44,780
efficient farming techniques and one of

665
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:47,119
which was water stewardship which was

666
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:50,720
being done under our water productivity

667
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:53,030
project so Joanna from our Auckland

668
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:56,030
office is connected to us and we have

669
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:58,520
three and four charities who were the

670
00:35:56,030 --> 00:36:03,260
community persons working directly with

671
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:06,140
the farmers on how they developed and

672
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:08,480
also made sure that the farmers know

673
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:10,690
what they're doing and also explaining

674
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,490
them that how they can implement these

675
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:16,700
shrim last many years so maybe we could

676
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:19,540
hear her views and also head directly

677
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:22,800
from some of our jockeys

678
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:22,800
if you would allow me

679
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:32,930
just like a New Year's yes yes I would

680
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:35,560
like to hear Lennon just before getting

681
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:38,810
into that we're really glad that we have

682
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:42,440
apples from Pakistan and joining us

683
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:44,960
Bonita Bernard who are implementing the

684
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:48,230
virtual productivity project in Pakistan

685
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:52,900
which we have been doing in India so to

686
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:52,900
hear their views as well something and

687
00:36:53,620 --> 00:37:02,830
yeah drugs man yes yep just life you

688
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:05,150
know can tell us about the experience of

689
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:07,010
working within the community and

690
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:24,460
nibbling the families and how Joseph

691
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:26,630
Lee's worked directly on what using

692
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:28,850
technologies and see all these

693
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:32,060
technologies have been demonstrated in

694
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:34,940
the field areas terrain is a ruby and

695
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:36,860
intercropping jilsuk he told was to

696
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:39,230
monitor the level of water and

697
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:44,020
irrigation during the past three years

698
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:46,850
and as the result we heard analyzed in

699
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:50,120
twenty five percent of water saving has

700
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:52,310
been twenty three to twenty five percent

701
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:57,790
water saving has been experienced to

702
00:37:52,310 --> 00:38:01,130
these practices so genifique is this

703
00:37:57,790 --> 00:38:02,990
water monitoring part they are created

704
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:06,110
water and environment groups in the

705
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:10,370
region of many tablets chips that our

706
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:14,560
project is pain is going on so the water

707
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:17,440
and environment meaning purpose is to

708
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:20,960
monitor and mean it mainly in the water

709
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:24,740
infrastructure and where community

710
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:26,630
members towards what reusable water

711
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:29,870
tunes yeah

712
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:32,600
in fact for everyone we have been

713
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:33,570
successfully able to mobilize country in

714
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:36,240
four thousand five

715
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:38,580
that farmers in a project and how this

716
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:41,370
word of mouth works among the farmers

717
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:43,050
community is that when someone village

718
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:45,480
or say a particular block is being

719
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:49,980
trained or being told about what is

720
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:52,230
happening it's it's slowly a rights

721
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:53,850
among the other farmers and again what

722
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:55,290
love who is talking about that if you

723
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:58,790
present them with a lucrative business

724
00:38:55,290 --> 00:39:01,200
model which is that if they're producing

725
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:03,600
water-efficient or maybe as artists and

726
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:07,140
there's rice that can be easily exported

727
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:19,160
and given at a good price if I'm correct

728
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:19,160
okay yes absolutely

729
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:25,620
well since we're done with the what the

730
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:28,640
speakers has to say will be still one

731
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:31,530
question left I would request a wrap low

732
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:34,440
fat burn and Pakistan if they would want

733
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:37,290
to then there's online questions as well

734
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:39,210
like what are the low-cost technology

735
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:45,600
that can be adopted by farmers without

736
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:47,250
even increasing costs yeah yeah if you

737
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:53,810
would like to go ahead and do answers

738
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:56,810
because here and then went right into

739
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:56,810
questions

740
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:06,999
so alia joined us from Pakistan I like a

741
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,999
new heroes

742
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:14,060
he's Amanda without proper dress I think

743
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:19,100
the sub Technicolor role in the country

744
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:19,100
anyway let's go ahead and

745
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:29,930
take answers one questions one-by-one

746
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:32,950
so can drip irrigation system they using

747
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:34,930
particle duration

748
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:36,970
and that's something a reoccurring

749
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:40,920
question and I think dr. Sudhir you

750
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:40,920
would like to give your opinion

751
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:49,730
um so yes definitely there has been lot

752
00:40:45,799 --> 00:40:53,390
of work done of using drip you know in

753
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:56,509
rice I'm familiar the work was done in

754
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:59,269
Haryana and canal work was done in Modi

755
00:40:56,509 --> 00:41:02,539
Purim also work was done however there

756
00:40:59,269 --> 00:41:05,529
is another question that can be it's

757
00:41:02,539 --> 00:41:08,569
kind of safe water without additional

758
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:11,089
investment you know so that's kind of

759
00:41:08,569 --> 00:41:14,569
the scenario that when it comes to the

760
00:41:11,089 --> 00:41:16,339
paddy cultivation the initial investment

761
00:41:14,569 --> 00:41:18,470
with the drip and the technology is

762
00:41:16,339 --> 00:41:22,279
still kind of settling among speaking

763
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:23,809
from my perspective that from its it's

764
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:27,170
definitely there is a research done but

765
00:41:23,809 --> 00:41:30,739
for adoption of farmer it's still bit

766
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:33,049
expensive so that now the many many

767
00:41:30,739 --> 00:41:36,980
private companies are working on low

768
00:41:33,049 --> 00:41:40,069
post drip irrigation system but the the

769
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:43,970
adoption for drip is still low in very

770
00:41:40,069 --> 00:41:48,079
low in in rice because they they don't

771
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:50,089
see kind of the output against the

772
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,569
investment so the marginal quote is very

773
00:41:50,089 --> 00:41:55,489
high

774
00:41:50,569 --> 00:41:57,170
while in lot of rain fed area in Uttar

775
00:41:55,489 --> 00:41:59,869
Pradesh we have followed from there and

776
00:41:57,170 --> 00:42:02,660
they have started to use this low post

777
00:41:59,869 --> 00:42:05,989
drip irrigation in the dry season for

778
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:09,829
growing vegetables and they like it's

779
00:42:05,989 --> 00:42:12,259
it's very high profitable system so it

780
00:42:09,829 --> 00:42:13,220
all depends on the technologies

781
00:42:12,259 --> 00:42:15,680
excellent

782
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:17,660
but when farmer PK technology it's not

783
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:20,869
only from technology perspective they

784
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:23,630
look it from different lens so and that

785
00:42:20,869 --> 00:42:26,630
this depends on the whole system that

786
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:28,970
what kind of system you have and then

787
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:32,630
whether drip is a potential choice for

788
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:35,569
you alone yeah yeah of course in fact

789
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:38,029
they have been we have in the project

790
00:42:35,569 --> 00:42:39,470
which will be working in Haryana have

791
00:42:38,029 --> 00:42:41,150
been discussions whether we put

792
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:44,690
implement drip irrigation in paddy

793
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:48,030
cultivation and see can work that but

794
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:50,100
we're also considering the factor that

795
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:55,050
it has been done before but in different

796
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:58,770
kinds of atmosphere and also the soil

797
00:42:55,050 --> 00:43:01,140
and I am skeptical about if the kind of

798
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:04,340
soil will make any difference because

799
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:07,740
the Illyria's will be different in in

800
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:10,500
comparison to mummy beef because like

801
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:12,150
Haryana so no they

802
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:14,270
so the it depends on there are two

803
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:16,890
different things one is when you

804
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:18,720
schedule irrigation and how you

805
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:21,390
scheduling is and whether you use drip

806
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:24,600
or you use flood that is how when is

807
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:27,390
interval and when will take care of soil

808
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:29,370
type so when in deep irrigation you

809
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:30,480
consider the evapotranspiration so you

810
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:32,760
have pressure is from the soil

811
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,710
transmission is on the plants so you

812
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:37,950
consider that one and you schedule by

813
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:40,350
irrigation but my my simple kind of

814
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:43,500
question or suggestion to farmers and

815
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:46,710
I'm thinking more like a farmers being

816
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:48,210
on up in Haryana like if farmers are at

817
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:52,260
least some progressive farmer are

818
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:54,030
started to think for for drip so which

819
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:58,110
means they are only thinking to dry

820
00:43:54,030 --> 00:44:00,180
their fatty fill if if they can dry they

821
00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:03,900
paddy field with surface irrigation they

822
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:06,720
can save a lot I'm not saying that you

823
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:09,720
know rape is good it can further

824
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:11,970
increase the saving but in terms of what

825
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:15,210
low-hanging opportunity which we have

826
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:17,130
with us is saving this water which we

827
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:20,280
are pumping from the ground water and

828
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:21,800
that is really really kind of alarming

829
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:25,770
the situation in punjab and haryana

830
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:27,600
first i think the big message is that if

831
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:30,360
they believed rupees good thats mean

832
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:32,640
rice can be grown and like other serious

833
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:34,830
like wheat so they can change it in

834
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,810
their surface irrigation system also and

835
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:39,540
then it's a step change then they can

836
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:43,680
adopt really big at later states yeah

837
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:47,550
yeah thank you dr. Sudhir of course what

838
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:49,320
you said definitely can be done so this

839
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:52,500
question which is a bit convoluted with

840
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:54,450
just you giving the gist is really that

841
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:57,440
what are the policy level initiatives

842
00:44:54,450 --> 00:45:00,470
that can guide water stewardship

843
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:03,020
at a multi-level so it can be implement

844
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:05,750
so really what the question is trying to

845
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:08,390
understand is what kind of policy change

846
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:12,200
is required when water stewardship can

847
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:14,030
be implemented very well in all like in

848
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:16,099
regional setting in a state level

849
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:19,310
setting or say a national and even

850
00:45:16,099 --> 00:45:21,470
international setting if lauki would

851
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:26,349
like to comment and maybe later doctor

852
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:26,349
City it would give his own opinion on it

853
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:33,790
yeah I'm I'm not Leslie the expert of

854
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,560
course in the in the policy parts

855
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:38,810
because this is I think maybe Sharma you

856
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:41,780
even might be yourself able to answer of

857
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:44,630
course like having improved policies

858
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:47,390
having incentives for rice growers is

859
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:49,970
essential so I spoke really about the

860
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:51,980
enabling environments what we see for

861
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:53,840
instance in other regions where the

862
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:56,270
government might have incentives for

863
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:59,650
collecting rainwater for providing

864
00:45:56,270 --> 00:46:02,960
subsidies for using drip irrigation

865
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:04,820
that's one rule then of course also

866
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,500
policies in place where maybe there

867
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:09,890
might be a restriction of farmers using

868
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:13,360
water in Pakistan there debates whether

869
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:16,340
actually water should be paid by farmers

870
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:19,490
so it just depends on the context of

871
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:21,770
course yeah yeah but says you're someone

872
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:23,300
who can speak for the market I would

873
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:25,370
like to know your views and what

874
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:27,860
capacity markets can influence the

875
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:29,120
policy what kind of kind of change can

876
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:31,310
be done from your end

877
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:34,090
for example the points raised before was

878
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:40,160
how they can increase price and we are

879
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:43,100
working with SRP or something yeah so if

880
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:45,620
we talk about premiums as March we need

881
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:49,610
high quality basmati so we always pay

882
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:52,340
for a quality premium in farmers so that

883
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:54,830
already helps farmers to increase their

884
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:57,020
income then we of course we work with

885
00:46:54,830 --> 00:47:00,200
our suppliers who have acronym is to

886
00:46:57,020 --> 00:47:02,600
provide coaching to farmers so every two

887
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:05,080
weeks they will receive guidance how to

888
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:09,800
better grow the rice which also

889
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:14,440
increased yields by 15% of course we

890
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:18,310
also work on improving let's say better

891
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:23,030
markets so market route to markets

892
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:26,300
transport lowering transport costs and

893
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:28,880
then of course if they grow SFP rice we

894
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:31,400
we won't expect we pay a premium I do in

895
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:34,070
organics which we would rather see by

896
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:36,050
all the interventions that farms can

897
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:40,660
benefits by growing rice in a more

898
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:44,100
sustainable way yeah Annie

899
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:48,250
I can add and to allow in terms of

900
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:51,460
incentivize farmers for kind of climate

901
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:56,860
smart practices one of the one of the

902
00:47:51,460 --> 00:48:00,250
debate which is going on is on providing

903
00:47:56,860 --> 00:48:02,260
incentives to farmers for carbon correct

904
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:05,290
which has been already started in

905
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:07,870
investing word but in a CIT is not

906
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:10,480
introduced and there has been and this

907
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:13,240
is a macro level at at country level and

908
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:16,240
country whole different kind of funds

909
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:19,990
the one is which we they can access his

910
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:23,470
Green Climate Fund which can be Kentucky

911
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:25,210
laid down for to provide a you know

912
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:27,370
additional incentive for reducing the

913
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:29,920
water footprint and and carbon footprint

914
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:32,380
so as you know that rice is one of the

915
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,600
major source of methane emission so it

916
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:37,630
can be sometime direct some time

917
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:39,850
indirect so if they they use the water

918
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:42,610
efficiently they not only save water but

919
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:45,850
they also reduce the global global

920
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:47,230
warming potential so people of Haryana

921
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:50,290
know that what is happening in the

922
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:52,090
hélène in inventory you know so there is

923
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:55,270
a lot of work need to be done in terms

924
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:58,840
of how we we do how we improve the egg

925
00:48:55,270 --> 00:49:00,580
practices but more importantly what what

926
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:03,130
is the pull mechanism and that I think

927
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:07,060
we need to think out of the box to

928
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:09,610
incentivize farmers through premium rice

929
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:13,050
coding price or through these new

930
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:17,470
incentive mechanism of carbon footprints

931
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:19,180
yeah yeah thank you so much dr. city for

932
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:21,340
adding your reviews and of course

933
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:24,340
methane emissions was a very important

934
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:28,240
side effects of brown rice and it we are

935
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:30,520
contributing towards not generating that

936
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:33,400
kind of emission into theaters we're

937
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:35,590
considering Delhi is the UM India's

938
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:37,210
pollution level that will be put into

939
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:39,780
one station in terms of the ecological

940
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:43,090
their contribution from the farmers end

941
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:45,040
but the Diskin solid always comes to me

942
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:47,110
as it moves from us from you know

943
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:49,300
putting my faith in a farmers show is

944
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:51,510
that why is there everything Bertrand oh

945
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:53,880
honey why do I have to need

946
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:56,310
to make all the difficult choices

947
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:58,710
because essentially what matters to me

948
00:49:56,310 --> 00:50:01,410
is growing and just getting the better

949
00:49:58,710 --> 00:50:06,770
price so if you would like to comment on

950
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:06,770
that I will now give you anything I

951
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:12,930
would not say it's always about the

952
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:16,230
price it's more what we say the more

953
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:19,230
crop per acre so productivity that

954
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:21,060
that's a clicky one also what we see a

955
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:23,640
lot in the system that a lot of rice

956
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:26,310
growers are dependent on a middleman to

957
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:29,430
have loans to need to pre finance their

958
00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:32,760
input costs and that actually is a huge

959
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:35,370
burden on the on the final net income

960
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:39,030
from rice so we now might be working

961
00:50:35,370 --> 00:50:40,980
more on pre finance which can reduce 20%

962
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:43,950
of their financial of their input costs

963
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:47,220
which are spent by paying fourteen to

964
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:50,070
twenty four percent of Texas so rather

965
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:51,870
just having the premium discussions I

966
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:55,590
would rather go in in these roots

967
00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:58,140
thinking about refinancing dependency or

968
00:50:55,590 --> 00:51:00,930
middlemen and whether we can also play a

969
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:02,820
role in this and I came to here because

970
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:05,430
I know it's very challenging as a full

971
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:07,650
of rice growers also needs middlemen as

972
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:09,840
their provide a bank not only for

973
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:14,000
agriculture but also for education and

974
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:16,740
other other let's say loans as well yeah

975
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,960
thank you okay adding to that I think

976
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:22,200
one of the participants with us as dr.

977
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:25,740
sedative saying was directed at I CIT

978
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:28,410
International Organization for

979
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:30,240
irrigation and drainage maybe he would

980
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:33,240
he would be an expert person to add

981
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:35,430
comments on how changes can be done at a

982
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:40,040
policy level doctor sedative if you

983
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:40,040
would like to add a special

984
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:47,030
if you would unmute yourself you can't

985
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,030
hear you

986
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:54,289
yes

987
00:51:57,210 --> 00:52:02,960
you

988
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:02,960
what does that I can't hear you

989
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:12,480
yeah maybe I don't want to spoil the

990
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:15,930
party but this morning I was reading the

991
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:19,910
newspaper and interestingly there is a

992
00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:23,100
study by a Policy Research Institute

993
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:28,620
which says that the crab burning in

994
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:31,850
Haryana Punjab alone costs us dollar 30

995
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:35,280
billions per year to the Indian economy

996
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:37,470
and I don't know I think that's a very

997
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:39,810
death that's a number which is very

998
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:45,000
close to the total agricultural exports

999
00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:48,270
of India basically the punjab haryana

1000
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:52,140
reason is not the agro-ecological jewel

1001
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:55,230
for rice farming and it was introduced

1002
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:59,010
because of the Bhakra Nangal then then

1003
00:52:55,230 --> 00:53:01,860
which provided sufficient water so

1004
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:04,260
people says to the cash crops like the

1005
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:09,000
basmati rice which is an export

1006
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:13,710
commodity so maybe I had been studying

1007
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:15,990
this problem for last 2-3 years and it

1008
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:19,500
seems that Punjab and Haryana received

1009
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:21,870
only 40 percent of the monsoon rain that

1010
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:23,640
the West Bengal and the northeastern

1011
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:28,320
part of India which are more suitable

1012
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:31,320
for rice farming we see and I don't see

1013
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:33,990
any research which gives a direction

1014
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:36,840
that how we can grow federal trials like

1015
00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:39,960
basmati in the northeast parts of India

1016
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:43,380
which state ships adequate once on the

1017
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:45,540
info and in the Punjab Haryana region

1018
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:49,740
but I am NOT against technology I mean

1019
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:52,710
I'm an engineer myself and drape and all

1020
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:56,340
these things can always make the water

1021
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:58,380
use efficiency much higher but should we

1022
00:53:56,340 --> 00:54:01,140
not be practicing something something

1023
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:05,610
which is ecologically or ecologically

1024
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:07,830
sustainable that's that's my question to

1025
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:10,530
the experts here of course there is a

1026
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:11,520
need for into improving the economy of

1027
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:15,180
farmers

1028
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:16,390
improving their income but are there

1029
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:19,000
other ways which we

1030
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:22,180
should we should think about or there

1031
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:25,930
are other options policy options which

1032
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:30,069
can incentivize the shift in farming

1033
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:35,680
practices making it more ecologically

1034
00:54:30,069 --> 00:54:39,250
sustainable in the longer yes thank you

1035
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:41,170
dr. Sade for sharing your views I know

1036
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:42,549
you're short of time but we have two

1037
00:54:41,170 --> 00:54:45,519
questions which are still left

1038
00:54:42,549 --> 00:54:46,119
unanswered if you could keep it on the

1039
00:54:45,519 --> 00:54:49,210
table now

1040
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:51,279
the first one is how can white water

1041
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:56,260
stewardship affect the quality and

1042
00:54:51,279 --> 00:54:59,430
quantity of daily culture to do so

1043
00:54:56,260 --> 00:55:05,160
essentially what is the benefit of what

1044
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:05,160
stewardship so if you would like to heal

1045
00:55:06,539 --> 00:55:09,539
electricity

1046
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:19,230
so basically when we are seeing about

1047
00:55:16,289 --> 00:55:22,779
whenever we talk about water saving

1048
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:25,539
people sometimes take it as like we are

1049
00:55:22,779 --> 00:55:28,660
cutting off significantly it's there is

1050
00:55:25,539 --> 00:55:31,059
a difference between water requirement

1051
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:33,670
of krob versus water applied to the crew

1052
00:55:31,059 --> 00:55:36,519
and they're basically it's all about the

1053
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:38,789
intelligence about like how much water

1054
00:55:36,519 --> 00:55:41,980
need to be applied I I want to quickly

1055
00:55:38,789 --> 00:55:44,589
also make the point about what Sade was

1056
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:47,019
saying that I also believe in terms of

1057
00:55:44,589 --> 00:55:50,349
the whole window operation thinking

1058
00:55:47,019 --> 00:55:52,779
about how you can make decision based on

1059
00:55:50,349 --> 00:55:56,170
your ideological condition and based on

1060
00:55:52,779 --> 00:55:58,420
your water ability so you are the some

1061
00:55:56,170 --> 00:56:00,369
of the like I know the verbage Mars food

1062
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:03,700
is doing the attach managing practices

1063
00:56:00,369 --> 00:56:07,839
that the climate smart practices which

1064
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:09,640
will not affect your quantity that may

1065
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:11,829
improve your quality but David that will

1066
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:13,869
definitely not affect your quality so

1067
00:56:11,829 --> 00:56:16,509
it's win-win situation which basically

1068
00:56:13,869 --> 00:56:19,660
we are talking here rather than reducing

1069
00:56:16,509 --> 00:56:22,569
quantity and quality yeah absolutely

1070
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:24,430
it makes also a lot of sense because it

1071
00:56:22,569 --> 00:56:26,289
we are conserving water and managing

1072
00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:29,490
water not only are we making an

1073
00:56:26,289 --> 00:56:32,790
ecologically better choice between

1074
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:35,880
so in terms of the market making you

1075
00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:38,070
know a better repository as raised by

1076
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:40,260
Lao K that how premium is also being

1077
00:56:38,070 --> 00:56:43,859
paid by companies and for that matter I

1078
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:45,900
know that Mars has been paying premiums

1079
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:49,020
LT Foods and other market features also

1080
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:53,250
paying premium for better maintained

1081
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:55,890
rice just this last question which is

1082
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:57,930
being left unanswered is the what is

1083
00:56:55,890 --> 00:57:00,570
what are the low cost technologies that

1084
00:56:57,930 --> 00:57:03,680
can be adopted by farmers without

1085
00:57:00,570 --> 00:57:03,680
increasing cost

1086
00:57:05,570 --> 00:57:11,190
um

1087
00:57:07,770 --> 00:57:13,080
again I think it depends on I always go

1088
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:16,260
back to that what are the what are the

1089
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:18,720
conditions rather than saying that this

1090
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:22,980
technology can be can fit very well to

1091
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:26,610
you we have seen a very very high impact

1092
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:28,560
and again today was talking about this

1093
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:32,700
HP study and another if we study in

1094
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:34,680
eastern refer this fear the the early

1095
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:37,290
planting of wheat followed by ugly

1096
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:39,510
planting of so early planting a price

1097
00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:41,880
followed by early planting of beef was

1098
00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:43,440
able to make significant change in water

1099
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:45,990
productivity because they were using

1100
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:48,630
rain efficiently so it's not always that

1101
00:57:45,990 --> 00:57:51,690
you need to try a new rotate it's

1102
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:53,910
sometime it's the decisions which you

1103
00:57:51,690 --> 00:57:56,160
make around the production system there

1104
00:57:53,910 --> 00:57:58,500
are series of technologies which which

1105
00:57:56,160 --> 00:58:01,320
can can be adopted but again I would

1106
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:04,830
