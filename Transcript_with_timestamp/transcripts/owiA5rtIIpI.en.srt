00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,799
hey everyone i'm rob greenfield

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,879
hey i'm eric joseph lewis from plant

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,840
path nursery and today we are going to

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:12,400
teach you how to plant a community fruit

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,120
or nut tree and

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,760
what i want to say first and foremost is

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,920
don't be intimidated planting trees can

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,520
sound like this big thing but it's

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,519
actually really simple and we're going

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,199
to show you how simple it is today but

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,760
also we're going to share some tips that

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:31,039
are you know a little bit more

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,440
of that mid-level or advanced as well to

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:36,719
really try to have your trees be as

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,480
successful as possible but bottom line

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,079
planting community fruit and nut trees

17
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,320
is easy and we're going to show you how

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,120
to do that today so the first step to

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,320
planting these bare root trees is to dig

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,520
your hole

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,960
i really love digging forks because they

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,000
help us to

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:57,399
create the hole without creating any

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,399
soil compaction

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,719
if you only have a shovel definitely

26
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,320
definitely use a shovel and that's one

27
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,880
of those examples of like a little bit

28
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,799
of a pro tip that'll help things just do

29
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,560
a little bit better

30
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,240
and if you don't have a digging fork i

31
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,880
highly recommend looking around your

32
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,799
local thrift store or yard sale i find

33
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,720
these things for five bucks all the time

34
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,280
she's got the solutions

35
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,479
the solutions are always there with this

36
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,439
very simple

37
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,200
okay

38
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,040
all right so as you can see we're not

39
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,240
digging a massive hole we got a little

40
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,119
tree here

41
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,119
pretty simple yeah 8 to 12 inches is

42
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,119
about all it takes with most bare root

43
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,000
trees

44
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:40,000
so we're going about a foot down um and

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,399
then how about width how far are we

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,600
going here

47
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:49,360
uh about 12 inches across so about 12

48
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,360
inches deep and 12 inches wide

49
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,719
and one thing about planting community

50
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,719
fruit trees is wherever you are you'll

51
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:01,520
be working with whatever soil there is

52
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,520
there so you know here in

53
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,520
asheville north carolina we're working

54
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,080
in this spot with some clay

55
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,959
but also some sandy soil and one of the

56
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,200
keys to success is making sure to adapt

57
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,440
to your environment and and working with

58
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,080
the soils that you have

59
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:21,040
so the next tip is when you're putting

60
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:24,080
your tree into the hole you want to make

61
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,480
sure that the roots don't hook upwards

62
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,200
because this upward pointing root is

63
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,920
more prone to rot and disease and those

64
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,599
diseases can then find their way through

65
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,760
the entire tree so make sure that all

66
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,400
your roots are pointing down you'll see

67
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,360
our trees here are soaking

68
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,440
in a half filled five gallon bucket of

69
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,519
water and why do we want to have the the

70
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,640
trees soaking and how long do we soak

71
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,239
them for

72
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,800
you never want to soak your trees for

73
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:54,000
more than six to eight hours so that's

74
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,319
really just to super hydrate the roots

75
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,959
prior to going into their holes

76
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:02,080
and ideally you'll be planting

77
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:04,720
on a rainy overcast day like today

78
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,599
shortly after a rain or just before a

79
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,760
rain

80
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,680
but if you're in an area without rain

81
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,360
you got a plant without rain simple as

82
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,280
that

83
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,519
and the next step so now i've got the

84
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,920
roots all carefully positioned and

85
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,560
they're all pointing downwards and now

86
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,959
we're just breaking up the native soil

87
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,480
and putting it right back into the hole

88
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,080
that it came from

89
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,360
making sure to keep the collar of the

90
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,879
tree

91
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,040
uh just at the level of the ground and

92
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,280
what you'll notice here eric said native

93
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,239
soil what native soil means is whatever

94
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,799
the soil is here so we're filling this

95
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,640
hole back in with just the soil that we

96
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:48,239
dug up we're not adding

97
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,480
anything to this hole except the tree

98
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,400
and the native soil

99
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,080
right from where we dug it out one

100
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,040
little tip is when you're digging your

101
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,840
holes

102
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,000
don't spread your soil all over because

103
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,159
then you won't be able to get it back

104
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,480
you'll see eric made this neat little

105
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,720
you know pile right next to the to the

106
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,959
hole so that way you can easily move the

107
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,560
soil back into the hole

108
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,640
another note is you'll see like with

109
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,400
this clay that we're breaking it up into

110
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:18,160
small pieces um we want to do that so

111
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,320
that you know you're not having these

112
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,520
big air gaps or anything like that in

113
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,520
there and as we go we're gently kind of

114
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:29,360
tamping the soil down

115
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,400
so that those air pockets that rob just

116
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,280
mentioned

117
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,520
are gonna get pressed out and

118
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,600
settled in you'll also notice that we're

119
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,160
leaving a little bit of space here near

120
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,840
the top because our next step is gonna

121
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,840
be weed suppression

122
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:52,000
the tree is now planted and it was very

123
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,440
simple but i just want to re-share a

124
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,240
couple of points

125
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,080
first we only filled the hole in with

126
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,680
the native soil so we didn't add

127
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,000
anything to the hole

128
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,400
um as we were doing that you know here

129
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,680
in clay soil we broke that up

130
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,320
uh and then we only buried the tree up

131
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,880
to the collar you don't want to bury the

132
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,639
tree deeper that can

133
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,840
ultimately result in your trees dying

134
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,919
and that's one of the most common

135
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,400
mistakes i would say new tree planters

136
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,080
make right yeah absolutely agree so

137
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,120
making sure that you're planting the

138
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,000
tree at the native soil level at the

139
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,560
tree collar and then on one last little

140
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,560
tip um what we did is we pulled the

141
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,560
grass back

142
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,000
around the tree some

143
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,240
just to uh

144
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,720
prevent this grass from being able to

145
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,120
overtake the tree so that'll help you

146
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,919
with reducing your weeding later on and

147
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,479
now the next step is what's

148
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,360
above the native soil and uh so what's

149
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,160
next

150
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,720
next is um the same reason that we

151
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,360
pulled the grass away uh we want to

152
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,199
suppress weeds and prevent other things

153
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,160
from growing immediately around this

154
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,960
chestnut because they will

155
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,440
compete for both water and nutrients and

156
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,080
that can lead to your tree drying out in

157
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:13,440
prolonged droughts now my favorite

158
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,960
material to use for weed suppression is

159
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,840
definitely

160
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:20,240
scrap boards from lumber mills but you

161
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,199
can also get burlap sacks from local

162
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:26,479
coffee roasters or the most common

163
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,720
resource for most folks is going to be

164
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,160
cardboard and so we'll just put this

165
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,080
cardboard down

166
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,600
so that it's right up

167
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,319
to the edge

168
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,319
of the tree

169
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,400
and make sure that it's as tight as

170
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,400
possible to the tree

171
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,240
and then next we want to give our tree a

172
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,520
little bit of fertility just to give it

173
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,199
that boost and that extra head start as

174
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,960
it's establishing

175
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,880
there you see that's about

176
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,160
uh two gallons

177
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,440
of

178
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:00,560
good nice rich compost

179
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:03,360
and this is uh

180
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,120
this is an excellent kind of soil and

181
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,280
the reason that we put this on top

182
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,759
rather than mixing it into the hole

183
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,639
is because we want these nutrients to

184
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:15,680
percolate in slowly and we want the

185
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,080
roots to be fully accustomed to the

186
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,680
native soils because the soil is only

187
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,039
going to get worse the further down this

188
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,919
tree goes more compaction more clay

189
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,080
and

190
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,639
so we want to keep all the nutrients on

191
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,840
top for more long-term weed suppression

192
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:34,639
i like to plant in support species and

193
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:37,440
one of my favorite plants to

194
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:40,240
help support establishing trees is

195
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,400
comfrey semphitim officinale so we'll

196
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,199
just take a few of these roots and we'll

197
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,720
tuck them right into this compost around

198
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,560
the top

199
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,919
and this way

200
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,039
instead of having

201
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:55,759
weeds that compete for nutrients

202
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:58,000
we'll have comfrey pulling up the

203
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,319
nutrients and then we can come back and

204
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,400
chop off those leaves and use them for

205
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,160
further weed suppression and one thing

206
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,039
to keep in mind is you don't need

207
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,720
comfrey um but it's really nice to have

208
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,560
so if you can get your hand some your

209
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,319
hands on some comfrey you can get it

210
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,599
really inexpensively and it's really

211
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,759
going to help with the success of the

212
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,759
trees if you can do it absolutely and

213
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:21,039
other great support species include

214
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:23,280
stinging nettle yarrow

215
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,680
and anything that establishes a dense

216
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,560
ground cover underneath the base of your

217
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,360
tree

218
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,240
so next up we're gonna go with mulch

219
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,880
after the compost is mulch and

220
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,959
there's a lot of free ways to get mulch

221
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,080
one of the easiest is leaves these are

222
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:42,880
just leaves that we raked up today

223
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,800
and then another one is wood chips wood

224
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,360
chips and you can find this as a free

225
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:51,240
product as well as well so

226
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,240
either one is good

227
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:03,839
so we've done about a five gallon bucket

228
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,760
of leaves and a five gallon bucket of uh

229
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,360
wood chips and there's a couple really

230
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,600
important reasons why you want to do

231
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,560
this it's weed suppression

232
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,399
it is moisture retention to reduce the

233
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,680
possibility of these being damaged by

234
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,240
drought

235
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,040
it's also creating fertility all of this

236
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,720
breaks down into fertility building soil

237
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,399
one thing just other thing to mention is

238
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,160
that you'll notice that it's almost more

239
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,320
about what's above the hole than what's

240
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,279
below the hole so

241
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,519
you can get by with less but doing this

242
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,760
is gonna really ensure the success of

243
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:40,080
these trees yeah so now that we've added

244
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:42,399
all this organic matter and compost and

245
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,399
wood chips we've brought the level up

246
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,279
well above the collar so we want to be

247
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,480
sure to push all of that away

248
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,360
to where

249
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,200
the

250
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:56,720
collar is not at all getting buried by

251
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,480
or by our organic matter and mulching

252
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,360
and a really simple way i like to

253
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,120
remember that is donut not volcano

254
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,880
that's what i learned as a beginner

255
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,680
planter so you'll see we've kind of

256
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:10,000
created a donut and some people they

257
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,839
plant up into a volcano and you don't

258
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,760
want to do the volcano you always want

259
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,680
to have a donut

260
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,240
so yeah now the next step is to make

261
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,240
sure that this beautiful baby tree

262
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,000
doesn't get munched to death by the deer

263
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,839
as soon as it starts putting out leaves

264
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,560
in the spring so we're gonna need some

265
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:29,279
kind of protection deer are

266
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,120
the animal that are most likely to eat

267
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,560
your plants that you're protecting them

268
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,800
against but

269
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,440
eric what what other animals are we

270
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,079
protecting against with these protectors

271
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,399
um well there's certainly groundhogs can

272
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,360
be formidable foes when the trees are

273
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,760
young

274
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,480
even up to head high they'll pull down a

275
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,760
flexible sapling and eat every leaf off

276
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,320
of it

277
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,440
there are a number of different rodents

278
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,680
that will

279
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:59,200
chew off the bark and

280
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:02,000
suck sap out of the tree until it dies

281
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,240
and so that's why i like to rely on

282
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,160
hardware cloth rather than chicken wire

283
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,360
if i'm going to be making my own tree

284
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,839
tubes and i because chicken wire the

285
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,920
holes are bigger and those rodents those

286
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,160
rodents can get right in and out it's

287
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,399
like an open door for them but this

288
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,160
hardware cloth is too small for most any

289
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,079
rodent to get through

290
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,560
and these are going to be on for about

291
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:26,480
at least two years yeah a minimum of two

292
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,560
years so they're going to be on there

293
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,160
for a while so you got to stake them in

294
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,560
eric's going to show us

295
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,480
uh using the hardware cloth first and

296
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,200
when he says planter this is actually a

297
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,200
specific brand that you can buy and it's

298
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,360
one that you recommend yeah it's one

299
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,920
that we've been using for a couple years

300
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,040
at plant path and it's working out well

301
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,800
so far

302
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,920
but there's other sources of purchasing

303
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,560
these as well

304
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:54,160
absolutely and some of them are just uh

305
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:57,120
smaller you know so they'll be only two

306
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,600
feet tall like this hardware cloth

307
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:03,279
and that's fine because

308
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,560
as the tree gets taller you can just put

309
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,600
a second

310
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:10,160
layer of hardware cloth on

311
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,519
to prevent deer from nibbling your

312
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,920
leaves

313
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,120
and so we've got the the hardware cloth

314
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,800
around and then we would just want to

315
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,920
secure this

316
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,200
to the

317
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:23,440
um to the stake yeah and to do that i

318
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,040
typically use some kind of heavy duty

319
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,920
twist tie

320
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:32,880
and like you can see this one

321
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:35,040
is pretty thick and double wired

322
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,600
but there's also fencing wire that you

323
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,160
can buy very inexpensively

324
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,680
simple as that so next up is the tree

325
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,399
tube

326
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:47,200
yep and so we just

327
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,200
very simply

328
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:53,680
take the twist ties off

329
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,079
and we

330
00:12:53,680 --> 00:13:00,680
carefully

331
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:00,680
tuck the tree into the tube

332
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:15,120
so now your tree is planted has weed

333
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:17,279
suppression fertility and protection

334
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,399
from the animals all that's left to keep

335
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:22,160
in mind is the watering

336
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,079
when these trees are bare root and

337
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,760
they're just getting established you're

338
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:28,959
going to want to make sure that they get

339
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:31,440
water at least twice a week by planting

340
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,600
in the spring or fall time

341
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,959
you kind of ensure that the weather is

342
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,800
going to take care of most of the

343
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,720
watering for you

344
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,079
but if you live in a drier climate

345
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,360
you're going to want to keep an eye on

346
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:45,760
that and in the middle of long hot

347
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,839
summers you want to check on your trees

348
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,639
regularly to see if the leaves are

349
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:54,240
starting to wilt or droop at all that

350
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:56,880
generally takes about 10 days at 75 plus

351
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,199
degrees and it's always good to go and

352
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,320
visit your trees as often as possible

353
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,399
because

354
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,959
as some of my great gardening friends

355
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,040
often say the best fertilizer is the

356
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,480
gardener's shadow so spend lots of time

357
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,120
with your trees

358
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,800
and love i mean that's the same thing

359
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,120
it's like being here loving them

360
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,040
spending time with them

361
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,399
it's the it's the reason we're planting

362
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,600
these trees so make sure that you're

363
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:24,240
visiting them um ideally you're adding

364
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,320
composted mulch at least once a year

365
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,399
yeah yeah at least once a year and you

366
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,560
can definitely do it twice a year and

367
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,880
weeding to keep this area

368
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,560
uh you know clean so that the trees

369
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,240
don't have competition

370
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,480
and spending time with them is

371
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,320
absolutely key so we're really excited

372
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,720
for you to plant your community fruit

373
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,360

congratulations to all of you on

391
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,079
receiving your community fruit and nut

392
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:35,040
trees this is a very exciting time

393
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:37,759
so much good food to come in your

394
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,240
community now if you can't plant your

395
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:43,360
trees right away which probably most of

396
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,759
you won't you have to heal them in to

397
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,279
store them temporarily so i'm going to

398
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,440
show you how to do that it's super

399
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:52,000
simple it's basically just burying them

400
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:56,880
in the soil for the short term until you

401
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,880
can plant them so you have your trees

402
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,480
here are

403
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:05,279
the bare root trees

404
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,120
and a couple of quick important things

405
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,560
you want to keep these roots protected

406
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,880
that's the purpose

407
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,560
and in between taking them out and

408
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,959
putting them in the ground you also want

409
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,519
to keep them protected avoid exposing

410
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:20,480
them to sunlight as much as possible and

411
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,480
then secondly keep them out in the air

412
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,120
for as little time as possible from when

413
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,199
you're transferring them to when you are

414
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,199
healing them in so it's really important

415
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:31,519
to protect the roots roots don't spend

416
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:34,480
time in the sunlight and air they like

417
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:36,320
to be underground so healing them in is

418
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,160
really simple and it comes down to just

419
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,560
digging a hole or a trench so i'm gonna

420
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,560
do that

421
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,320
so i've dug a hole very simple nothing

422
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,600
fancy whatsoever

423
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,680
i grab my trees and they can stay

424
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,199
in their bunch just like this

425
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,279
set them in there

426
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,320
leaning is totally fine

427
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:06,319
and then

428
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,319
just cover them up with that dirt

429
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,880
and then simply step on there gently

430
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,880
just to kind of

431
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,360
make them nice and snug in there just a

432
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,280
gentle step not all of your weight

433
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,679
and they are now

434
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,160
stored that's going to keep them safe

435
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,760
until you can go ahead and plant them

436
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,320
you could let them sit here

437
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,160
for you know days couple weeks but

438
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:35,200
definitely get them planted as soon as

439
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,360
you can to start the community fruit nut

440
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,520
tree journey we're excited to be on this

441
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,520
journey with all of you and uh excited

442
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,080
to see these grow these trees growing

443
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:47,840
and producing a bounty of food for your

444
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,840
community in the years to come
