ways of keeping improved kenyi chickens

76
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:04,799
one free and semi- free range free range

77
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:08,400
is where the chickens are left free to

78
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,959
eat worms insects grasses and leaves

79
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,280
around the farm they are then sheltered

80
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,359
at night semi-free range is where birds

81
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,880
are put in an enclosed place for some

82
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:21,759
time and given food they are then

83
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,800
allowed to roam outside to eat worms

84
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:28,199
insects grasses and leaves around the

85
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,039
farm this is my personal favorite so you

86
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:33,360
know

87
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:36,440
second fold unit system this is also

88
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,520
known as a chicken tractor birds are

89
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:42,440
kept in a small movable house made out

90
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,360
of wire mesh big enough for the chickens

91
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:48,680
to move around this house is moved from

92
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,199
one spot to another every day this

93
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:54,039
system is best suited to small scale

94
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:57,759
operations and chicken

95
00:04:54,039 --> 00:05:00,160
vendors third small scale confined

96
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,880
system this is also known

97
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,240
as the deep litter system the chicken

move freely food and water are provided

103
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:22,720
inside the house it is expensive but the

104
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,560
best for commercial chicken

105
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,479
farming chicken equipment both Drinkers

106
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,280
and feeders should always be kept clean

107
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,680
and wellmaintained

108
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:35,479
this will prevent cases of diseases in

00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:05,560
what are features of a good Drinker has

120
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:09,479
a Twist lock system and a hanger or

121
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:12,319

00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:15,960
drinkers come in different sizes 1 lit 6

123
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:20,000
L and 10 L choose as it

124
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:23,160
fits litter use wood shavings or rice

125
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,800
husks not sawdust as chicks can choke

126
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:30,440
spread evenly to a depth of 5 to 10 cm

127
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,199
the litter should be soft and dry

128
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,520
heat

129
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,639
Source ensure that you have a source of

130
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:39,520
heat like a brooda Joo and it is working

131
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,880
well maintain a good temperature for

132
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:45,199
your

133
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:48,240
birds light the idea is to provide 23

134
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:51,199
hours of light for the first seven days

135
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,759
as this dramatically improves chick

136
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:58,120
development brooder guards round plywood

00:06:54,759 --> 00:07:00,599
is used to make the brooding area 1.5 m

138

squ per 50 ch

139
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:07,400
the area is cleaned disinfected and with

140
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:11,000
well spread fresh litter cover this area

141
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:14,080

ways to get good and healthy chicks

149

chicks one hatching own chicks mother

150
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:40,560
hen sits on eggs for 21 days to keep

151
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,960
them warm until they hatch this is a

152
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:47,360
natural process she can sit and incubate

153
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:49,440
her own eggs or those of another hen

154
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,840
it's the simplest way of hatching a

155
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:56,159
small number of eggs I prefer giving one

156
00:07:52,840 --> 00:08:00,120
hen only eight eggs to hatch you have

157
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:03,639
almost 100% hatch rate

158
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:06,199
two artificial brooding incubating

159
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:09,319
machines are used to hatch eggs into

160
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:11,360
chicks it's mostly used by farmers who

161
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:14,960
are in the business of selling day old

162
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:17,360
chicks or keeping many birds it hatches

163
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:21,159
many eggs at

164
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,840
once three buying day old chicks from

165
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:25,919
hatcheries you can buy day old chicks

166
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,800
from hatcheries directly and start

167
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:31,560
brooding the chickens on your farm

168
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,800
identify registered hatcheries or chick

169
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:37,519
nurseries to buy day old chicks select

170
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,360
hatcheries that vaccinate chicks against

171
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,360
marik's

172
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,160
disease brooding is a period right after

173
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:47,240
the chicks have hatched and special care

174
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:51,120
and attention is needed to support their

175
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:53,200
health and survival because hatch chicks

176
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,920
can't control their own body temperature

177
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,440
in the first weeks you need to provide

178
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,959
extra heat otherwise chicks will be too

179
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,399
cold and May may not eat well drink

180
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:07,079
enough or may even

181
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:10,000
die one traditional brooding here

182
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:12,360
brooding is done by the mother chicken

183
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,920
she covers the young ones with her wings

184
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:18,040
to keep them

185
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:20,360
warm two artificial brooding when there

186
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:23,640
is no mother hen to look after her

187
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:26,920
chicks you need to set up an artificial

188
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:29,440
brooder during the first 2 to 3 weeks

189
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:31,600
chicks need to be kept in a brooder as

190
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,839
they cannot control their own body

191
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,720
temperature yet you need to give them

192
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:39,480
special care to support their health and

193
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,959
survival artificial heat helps keep

194
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:45,600
chicks stay warm until the feathers grow

195
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:48,839
heat can be provided by using a brooding

196
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,519
go gas or

197
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:54,279
electricity remember without the extra

198
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,440
warmth chicks can easily feel cold and

199
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:58,440
may not eat or drink enough and their

200
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,480
digestive organs may not develop

201
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:03,200
properly

202
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:06,920
improved kyi chickens need feed that

203
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:11,079
contains the following one energy second

204
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:12,760
protein third vitamins four minerals

205
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:15,640
five

206
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:18,600
water feed requirement is dependent on

207
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:21,640
the age and status of the birds chicks

208
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,640
Growers layers meat birds and broody

209
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,600
hens there are different types of

210
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:29,720
chicken feed for the different age

211
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:32,680
categories as I am about to discuss

212
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:35,360
chicks below the age of 8 weeks feed

213
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:37,920
them with chick Mash as it provides high

214
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,200
protein quantities chicks between the

215
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:44,240
age of 8 and 18 weeks feed them with

216
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:47,480
Growers Mash to provide a balanced diet

217
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,880
so that the chicks can gain weight fast

218
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,519
when the chicks start laying feed them

219
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:56,600
layers Mash this will provide needed

220
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:59,360
nutrients to improve egg

221
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:02,800
production good practices to protect

222
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:05,680
your chicken against disease and enemies

223
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,880
only allow essential staff to enter the

224
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:11,760
chicken house place a foot bath with a

225
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:14,600
disinfectant like kooper side outside

226
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:17,000
the chicken house each person working in

227
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,920
the house should have their own special

228
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,279
pair of gum boots that they wear when

229
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:24,959
entering the house remove old litter

230
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:28,360
dirty bags and rubbish away from the

231
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:32,079
house throw away old feed as they may

232
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:34,519
have molds or produce toxins keep birds

233
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:37,880
of the same age together to reduce

234
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:40,680
disease outbreaks ensure no rodents or

235
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:44,639
wild animals can enter the house

236
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:47,360
regularly clean and dry all

237
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:50,040
