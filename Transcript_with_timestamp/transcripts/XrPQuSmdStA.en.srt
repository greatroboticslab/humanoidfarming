1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,440
In the high middle ages, new farming

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,919
methods started boosting efficiency.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,559
Tools like the heavy plow helped turn

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:15,040
the soil better, allowing fewer people

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:18,960
to feed more. So from 90% farmers, the

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:21,199
number dropped to 80%. And suddenly 10%

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,920
of the population was free to do other

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,560
work. that freed up labor made it

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,039
possible for cities to grow, for grand

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:33,040
churches to rise, and for a clerical

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:35,120
class to form. Without a solid food base

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,040
like the grain supplies that once made

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,440
Egypt the bread basket of the Roman

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,440
Empire, there would have been no way to

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:46,480
support armies or complex governments.

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,559
The figure of 90% highlights just how

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,760
important the farming class was in the

18
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:54,000
Middle Ages. They fed the entire social

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:57,520
system and kept the wheels of progress

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,039
turning. But the farmers weren't all the

21
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:04,159
same. Among them were tenant farmers who

22
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,960
worked their own plots, surfs who were

23
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:10,159
mostly unfree and worked on a lord's

24
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,520
estate, day laborers without land of

25
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:16,240
their own, and cottages who had only a

26
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,720
small house and perhaps a garden but no

27
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,360
fields.

28
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,159
In the high middle ages, the idea of a

29
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,200
three-part society took shape. Those who

30
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:30,000
pray, the clergy, those who fight, the

31
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,280
nobles and knights, and those who work,

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,159
the farmers. Over time, this system

33
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,240
became more fixed. Though in the early

34
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,920
Middle Ages, it had been less clearly

35
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,000
defined.

36
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,920
The first written records of this social

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,439
division come from the early 11th

38
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,840
century.

39
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,079
They described three social groups and

40
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,159
placed farmers at the bottom since their

41
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,680
work fed and supported the rest of

42
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,920
society.

43
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,880
Roman traditions played a key role in

44
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,439
shaping the status of farmers. In the

45
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,799
Roman system, large estates in places

46
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:07,520
like Egypt or Italy ran mainly on slave

47
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,599
labor. But as Europe moved from late

48
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,239
antiquity into the early medieval

49
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:15,200
period, the big waves of migration

50
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:18,160
stopped. Germanic tribes settled down,

51
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,520
taking up farming and hering. With this

52
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,760
settled life came a bond to the land. A

53
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,840
farmer could no longer leave his plot

54
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,000
without violating his duties to the

55
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,800
landowner.

56
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,160
The farmer's role as a warrior began to

57
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:37,280
fade. Only in rare cases were free

58
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,920
farmers still called up as soldiers.

59
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,239
Interestingly, there were no permanent

60
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,120
villages in the early Middle Ages, at

61
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,760
least not as we know them today. People

62
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,519
often lived on designated estate farms

63
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,560
or in very small temporary settlements.

64
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,560
After about 40 years, these settlements

65
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,080
were usually abandoned because the

66
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,640
intensely worked soil became exhausted.

67
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,920
Although the three field system where

68
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:09,040
onethird of the land layow each year was

69
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,920
known as early as the 9th century, it

70
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,159
wasn't widely practiced for a long time

71
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,040
largely due to limited access to

72
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:20,159
fertilizer. When a field became worn

73
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,640
out, it was simply used as pasture. And

74
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:26,080
when even that no longer worked, the

75
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,000
settlement had to move. So the kind of

76
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,760
permanent village we are familiar with

77
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,080
today barely existed back then. One

78
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,680
remarkable constant however was the

79
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:40,959
burial ground. Cemeteries always lay

80
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,200
outside the living area but over time

81
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,280
they often became surrounded by new

82
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,360
houses.

83
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,239
Another reason why permanent villages

84
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,760
emerged only later was technological

85
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,920
limitation.

86
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,439
In the early Middle Ages, the most

87
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,599
common plow was the light scratch plow,

88
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:02,239
which only worked the soil surface and

89
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:04,239
was poorly suited to the wet, low-lying

90
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,920
soils found in regions like the

91
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:10,560
Rhineland or along the Ela. Adding to

92
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,959
the challenge, draft animals often

93
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,959
didn't wear horseshoes, making them

94
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:19,199
ineffective on soft or marshy ground. It

95
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,519
wasn't until the high middle ages that

96
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,840
people began draining many bogs and

97
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,479
wetlands through ditches and channels,

98
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,639
making them fit for farming. Gradually,

99
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:31,440
they reclaimed new land by draining

100
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:34,720
wetlands, cutting down forests, and

101
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,960
turning wild spaces into farmland.

102
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:41,040
Often, these were areas without any

103
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:45,199
Roman past. No old roads, no aqueducts,

104
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:48,000
no towns. Step by step, a new farming

105
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,880
world took shape.

106
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,320
In the early Middle Ages, land ownership

107
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,320
was split mainly between kings, counts,

108
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,400
who acted as representatives of the

109
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,520
ruling powers over a fragmented

110
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,759
landscape, and monasteries, which also

111
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,000
served as landlords.

112
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,560
A traveling king had no unified

113
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,800
territory. His royal estates were

114
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,039
scattered across the realm. He would

115
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,919
move from one estate to another with his

116
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:18,800
court and officials, collecting tithes

117
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:21,600
and military service along the way. At

118
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,919
this stage, the noble line wasn't firmly

119
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,600
established yet, and property often came

120
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,080
through inheritance or marriage

121
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,639
connections. The core of the economic

122
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:34,240
system back then was the so-called

123
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:36,400
Salhof, Terra Salica.

124
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:40,080
This referred to the lord's personal

125
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:43,600
land worked directly by unfree peasants.

126
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:46,560
Servy alongside these lands there were

127
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,320
semif-free farms where peasant families

128
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,800
sometimes under the supervision of an

129
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:54,400
appointed overseer worked their own

130
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:58,160
plots. They paid dues often in the form

131
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:00,240
of goods like grain, livestock or wine

132
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,960
and sometimes through services like

133
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,360
military duties.

134
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,919
This system was seen as an improvement

135
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,720
over the ancient Roman slave model

136
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:14,080
because these peasants, whether semifree

137
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,080
or unfree, had at least some level of

138
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,800
self-sufficiency.

139
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,440
The lord didn't need centralized slave

140
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,080
barracks. Instead, he benefited from

141
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,919
regular dues while investing as little

142
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,440
effort as possible in feeding his

143
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,240
workforce.

144
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:33,120
Once the lord had supplies, whether meat

145
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,199
from a butcher, bread from a bakery, or

146
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,280
wine from his seller, he could

147
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:41,120
redistribute them across his network of

148
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:44,720
estates. This created domini or holdings

149
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:47,759
that ran on minimal fixed costs.

150
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,960
At the center of it all was the hoof,

151
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:53,919
the basic unit of farmland. It wasn't a

152
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:57,280
fixed size. It was just about how much

153
00:06:53,919 --> 00:07:00,080
land two oxmen could plow in a day.

154
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:03,280
But this amount changed a lot depending

155
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:06,319
on the local soil and customs. In the

156
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:09,440
north, a hoof was usually smaller than

157
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:12,000
in the south. You can think of a hoof

158
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,560
kind of like the old Morgan, meaning the

159
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,880
land a team of oxen could plow in a

160
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,199
morning, but there was no exact

161
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,400
standard.

162
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:27,039
Over time, more and more resources were

163
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:30,240
attached to the Salhof. Mills, ins, bake

164
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:33,680
houses, and wine presses increasingly

165
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,680
came under direct noble control.

166
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,680
This arrangement lasted well into the

167
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,479
late Middle Ages because as some

168
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,240
lordships grew larger, entire local

169
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,840
economies became effectively

170
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,400
nationalized.

171
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:49,039
Legal authority also gradually shifted

172
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,520
to the landlords. In the early Middle

173
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,840
Ages, there were still counts appointed

174
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,479
specifically for judicial matters, but

175
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,520
little by little, landlords absorbed

176
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:02,080
these powers. This deepened the farmer's

177
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,479
dependency. Anyone seeking protection

178
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,520
from a powerful ruler had to become a

179
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:09,199
subject. For some unfree peasants,

180
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,599
however, this was actually an

181
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,240
opportunity. Under the protection of a

182
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,160
mighty noble or a wealthy monastery,

183
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,080
they could sometimes secure a better

184
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:22,919
position than if they were left exposed

185
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,919
in lawless, dangerous regions.

Middle Ages.

189
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:39,440
In the High Middle Ages, Europe saw what

190
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:42,640
can only be called a population boom.

191
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,640
New farming methods, technical progress,

192
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,040
and the rise of organized village

193
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,279
communities meant that the nobility

194
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,240
gradually stepped back from owning

195
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,640
individual farms. Instead of managing

196
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,560
the land themselves, they handed it over

197
00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:00,959
as mer or ding farms to largecale

198
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,600
farmers who worked the fields on their

199
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,360
behalf. The rest of the peasants were

200
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,560
mostly seen as independent

201
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:11,680
entrepreneurs, but they still owed taxes

202
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,440
and labor services, especially so-called

203
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,480
frondinster.

204
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,800
These included manual labor and span

205
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,680
services where a peasant had to provide

206
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,839
his horses or oxen for mandatory

207
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,399
transport duties.

208
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,720
In many regions, such obligations

209
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:32,560
continued all the way into the early

210
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:35,120
17th century. At the same time, villages

211
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,839
became more permanent with cooperative

212
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,560
self-governance emerging. In many

213
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:43,519
places, peasants jointly manage the use

214
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:48,000
of fields, farming schedules, and the

215
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:51,120
taxes owed to their lord. Froinster or

216
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,920
labor obligations often meant that a

217
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,120
peasant with his own team of horses or

218
00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:00,720
oxen had to help haul goods for the

219
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:04,240
lord. Meanwhile, a peasant without a

220
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:07,040
team owning only a small plot might be

221
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:10,959
required to give more manual labor

222
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:14,000
because he couldn't pay in kind.

223
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:17,600
Alongside these social shifts, the three

224
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,839
field system spread widely.

225
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,640
Onethird of a village's land was sewn

226
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,880
with summer grain like oats or barley.

227
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:28,160
Another third with winter grain like

228
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:31,279
wheat or rye and the final third was

229
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:34,399
left or used as pasture so the soil

230
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:37,839
could recover. This crop rotation led to

231
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:40,959
a huge increase in yields. Compared to

232
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:43,600
the early middle ages, farmers now often

233
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:47,200
harvested double or even triple the

234
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:50,000
previous amount per acre. Fertilization

235
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:53,040
became more effective, too. Stable

236
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:57,040
manure and ashes from slash and burn

237
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:59,440
clearing briefly enriched soils. But the

238
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,800
real driver behind this agricultural

239
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:05,519
revolution was technological progress.

240
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,320
The heavy plow known from ancient

241
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:11,440
sources spread through central Europe

242
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:14,640
starting in the 10th century. Its unique

243
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:17,279
feature was the mold board which didn't

244
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:20,720
just break the ground but fully turned

245
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:24,880
it over. This made it possible to farm

246
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:29,600
heavy wet lowland soils. Places like the

247
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:32,640
elber lowlands or the rin area. Horses

248
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:35,200
became the main draft animals supported

249
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,360
by a new type of harness, the horse

250
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,560
collar, which let them pull much more

251
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:43,680
efficiently. A single horse could now

252
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:47,600
pull the same as a pair of oxmen, but

253
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:50,000
faster and with greater endurance.

254
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:54,399
Iron tools also emerged, including

255
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,480
sidesthes, sickles, spades, and harrows,

256
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,920
stronger and more efficient than the old

257
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:03,440
wooden tools. With all these advances,

258
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:05,680
agricultural yields soared and Europe's

259
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:09,519
population roughly tripled between the

260
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:11,839
11th and 13th centuries. This led to

261
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,639
massive settlement movements. Some

262
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:17,200
villages expanded by dividing into upper

263
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,440
and lower parts while others

264
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:23,040
participated in the eastward migration

265
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:26,079
beyond the Elba. In these eastern areas,

266
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:28,720
once covered in Slavic forests, settlers

267
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:31,200
cleared the land. sometimes clashing

268
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:35,040
with local Slavic communities before

269
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:37,600
permanent colonization took hold.

270
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,639
During this period, countless new towns

271
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,440
sprang up. Between the 11th and 15th

272
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:46,320
centuries, medieval Europe transformed

273
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:49,040
dramatically. Long-d distanceance trade,

274
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,440
coinbased economies, and the rise of

275
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:55,360
marketplaces increasingly connected

276
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:57,760
rural regions to urban centers.

277
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,959
Farmers brought their surplus goods to

278
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:04,560
town markets where they could in turn

279
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:09,200
buy metal tools, ceramics, and other

280
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:12,320
items. The saying city air makes you

281
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,399
free emerged, meaning that anyone who

282
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,600
entered a town and lived there for a

283
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:20,160
year and a day could free themselves

284
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:23,200
from feudal obligations.

285
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:26,160
Similarly, clearing land makes you free

286
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:29,279
was common. Anyone who cleared and

287
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:34,600
farmed unused land could often claim

288
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:34,600
rights similar to those of free farmers.

289
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:41,200
Around the year 1300, Europe's landscape

290
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,519
was more densely populated than today.

291
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:46,959
There were more villages, although each

292
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:49,920
was typically smaller in size. Fields,

293
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:54,240
meadows, and riverlands were marked off

294
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:57,440
by walls, hedges, or fences. Forests

295
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:01,199
were no longer wild, untouched places,

296
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:04,240
but carefully managed woodlands. Pigs,

297
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:06,399
sheep, and cattle grazed there, and some

298
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,959
forest areas were used as communal

299
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,680
grazing grounds, like orchard pastures

300
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:14,959
or hut forests, where animals could

301
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:17,279
roam. Despite the huge gains in crop

302
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:19,519
yields during the high middle ages,

303
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:22,399
sometimes three to four times the output

304
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:25,199
of earlier centuries, serious problems

305
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:28,320
arose from soil exhaustion, manure

306
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:31,839
shortages, and erosion.

307
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:34,959
The Great Magdalene flood of 1342 was a

308
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:38,000
devastating disaster that reshaped much

309
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:41,040
of Europe's river systems. Torrential

310
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,399
rains raised river levels dramatically,

311
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:47,040
washing away soil, breaking dikes and

312
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:50,399
destroying farmland.

313
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:53,519
Major rivers like the Rine, Danube, and

314
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:56,560
Ela, as well as smaller waterways across

315
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:59,120
central and eastern Europe, saw villages

316
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,959
heavily damaged or completely swept

317
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,079
away.

318
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:07,040
At the time, some prime agricultural

319
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:11,360
lands still delivered two or three times

320
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:13,839
the seed sown. But many marginal plots,

321
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,360
areas that had been newly brought under

322
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:19,120
cultivation,

323
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:21,519
collapsed. They eroded so badly that

324
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,720
they had to be abandoned.

325
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:27,839
Livestock farming, once a vital pillar

326
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,720
of the rural economy, faded into the

327
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:34,079
background as crossd district grain

328
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:37,600
farming proved more profitable.

329
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:40,639
In many regions, even poor soils were

330
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:44,240
converted to farmland, but these lands

331
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:47,920
yielded little grain in return. As a

332
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:51,680
result, the overall crop yield per acre

333
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:54,880
stagnated or even declined.

334
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:57,600
As farming systems became more strained,

335
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,440
medieval Europe grew more vulnerable to

336
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,079
crop failures.

337
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,639
Already in the 14th century, famines

338
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:07,120
broke out sporadically, sometimes

339
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:10,720
limited to one region, sometimes

340
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:13,040
affecting wide areas. For example, in

341
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,440
the year 1345,

342
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,160
vast stretches of land from northern

343
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,800
Spain to northern Italy suffered from

344
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:25,199
severe food shortages.

345
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:28,320
Then came the Black Death. Between 1343

346
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:31,199
and 1346, the plague swept through

347
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,279
central Europe, wiping out up to a third

348
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:36,160
of the population.

349
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:40,160
As a result, grain prices dropped

350
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:43,040
sharply. Suddenly, supply far exceeded

351
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:46,000
the reduced demand. Fields were

352
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:49,759
abandoned, often starting with the least

353
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,720
productive plots. This process of rewing

354
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:55,839
farmland actually boosted yields on the

355
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:59,120
remaining land as more labor could now

356
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:01,279
be concentrated on fewer acres.

357
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,000
Peasants who had barely scraped by

358
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:07,039
before now found themselves in a

359
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,679
stronger bargaining position. With less

360
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:13,039
available land and fewer workers, they

361
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:15,199
became highly sought after. At first,

362
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:17,919
this shift brought clear advantages for

363
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:20,799
the peasantry. But as the famine and

364
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:24,079
plague years faded, new challenges

365
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:26,480
emerged. Population growth slowed or

366
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:29,600
barely recovered as many crops and

367
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,520
livestock had been wiped out. Yet taxes

368
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,559
and labor dues were still being

369
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:37,360
collected and in some cases landlords

370
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:39,840
began converting these to cash payments,

371
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:44,720
preferring money over grain which they

372
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:48,240
couldn't easily store. By around 1450, a

373
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:51,840
clear trend was emerging. Feudal labor

374
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:54,480
services, compulsory duties, and surfom

375
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:57,679
itself were gradually retreating across

376
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:00,480
many regions. Peasants gained new

377
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:02,720
privileges. They formed cooperatives to

378
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,520
collectively govern their villages and

379
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,919
began adding small trades or crafts to

380
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:11,360
their local economies. things like

381
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:14,880
blacksmithing, weaving or milling which

382
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:18,480
offered extra income sources. In some

383
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:22,480
places, these changes effectively ended

384
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:24,160
surfom. At the same time, agriculture

385
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,280
diversified

386
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:30,240
alongside high yield crop farming.

387
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:33,840
Livestock production, especially cattle

388
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:36,880
for milk, butter, and cheese regained

389
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:39,440
importance. Vegetable and garden farming

390
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:43,360
also became more prominent with crops

391
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:46,799
like cabbage, turnips, and legumes. In

392
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:49,600
some areas, the shift was so advanced

393
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:52,799
that the share of livestock and dairy in

394
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:56,320
the rural economy gradually rivaled that

395
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:59,919
of crop farming.

396
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:03,440
Chapter 3. Daily life and family

397
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:06,480
structures of medieval peasants.

398
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,960
Let's set aside the old stereotype that

399
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,559
peasant homes were little more than dirt

400
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:15,200
floor huts. In reality, during the high

401
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:18,000
and late middle ages, peasant buildings

402
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:21,679
came in many forms, showing impressive

403
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:26,080
regional diversity and craftsmanship.

404
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:28,480
Early on, postframe houses were common.

405
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:31,120
These were built by driving thick wooden

406
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,919
posts directly into the ground with

407
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,720
beams laid across the top, but they

408
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:40,559
didn't last long. The upright posts

409
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:43,120
rotted quickly in damp soil. By the 11th

410
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:45,840
century, in forested regions, people

411
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,799
began using frame construction similar

412
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:51,280
to half-timbering. Vertical posts were

413
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:53,360
placed on stone or brick foundations

414
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,360
carrying the weight of the roof while

415
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:59,520
the spaces between them were filled with

416
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:02,160
wle and dob or wooden planks. On many

417
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,240
manor lands or in peasant villages you

418
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:07,039
could find a mix of these building

419
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,440
styles. For example, a farmhouse might

420
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:12,880
have an old postframe section attached

421
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:15,760
to a newer blockbuilt parlor. In the

422
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,520
alpine foothills, such combinations were

423
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,160
fairly common.

424
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:23,440
By the late middle ages, the famous

425
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:26,720
lowger German hall house or hall and

426
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,960
barn house had emerged. A structure

427
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,280
where both the living quarters and the

428
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,640
animal stalls were housed under a single

429
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:36,799
roof. Contrary to popular belief, late

430
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,679
medieval peasants had wooden beam

431
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:43,120
ceilings, plastered walls, and even

432
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:46,159
window inserts. Some wealthier farming

433
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:49,679
families added wooden wall paneling made

434
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:52,320
from steamed pine or oak and they built

435
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:56,080
ceramic stoves to keep their rooms warm

436
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:59,679
in winter. In places like South Tier

437
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:02,799
near Clausen, medieval parlors still

438
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:05,840
survive today, showing whitewashed walls

439
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:09,120
and beautifully crafted wood paneling.

440
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:11,840
Peasant interiors ranged widely from

441
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:14,960
smoky dark spaces with little furniture

442
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:17,520
to cozy rooms with carved benches,

443
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,280
curtains, and candle chandeliers for

444
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,840
extra comfort.

445
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:24,799
Family life was usually patriarchal and

446
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:28,000
patrioal, meaning the father ruled as

447
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:30,159
the head of the household, the house v,

448
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,960
while the mother, often living with the

449
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:36,159
husband's family, managed the home, the

450
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,720
stable, and the kitchen. Until the

451
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:41,280
agricultural crisis, it was nearly

452
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,400
impossible to leave the farm without a

453
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:47,760
lord's permission or protection, meaning

454
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:50,159
families stayed rooted in one place.

455
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:53,679
daughters typically married into nearby

456
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:56,720
villages, often to farms under church or

457
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:59,600
noble patronage. A typical household

458
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:02,320
included the heirs, often just one son,

459
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:05,039
or in cases of shared inheritance, all

460
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,840
sons, along with the mother, father, and

461
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:09,679
grandparents if they were still alive.

462
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,799
Depending on the farm's size, there

463
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:15,760
might also be hired hands, male and

464
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:19,360
female servants, and even landless

465
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:23,600
relatives who had no inheritance rights.

466
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:26,640
Farm owners known as stam farmers often

467
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:29,760
maintained a small household staff who

468
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,240
worked unpaid within the family economy,

469
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:36,080
receiving only food and lodging in

470
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:38,159
exchange. This labor setup set medieval

471
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:41,360
peasants apart from modern wage

472
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:45,440
laborers. Cash payments like small

473
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:47,919
annual rents were rare. Instead, the

474
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:51,120
system functioned largely on direct

475
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:53,919
subsistence and barter. The medieval

476
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,320
farmer held extensive rights, often

477
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:59,440
summed up under the term house and farm

478
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:02,000
rights. Within his household, he could

479
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:05,200
impose punishments on family members or

480
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,440
servants, control who came and went, and

481
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:10,320
handled disputes that arose under his

482
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,640
roof. Passing the farm to the next

483
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:16,000
generation followed two main legal

484
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:19,200
traditions. Real division, common under

485
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,480
Frankish law, or indivisible inheritance

486
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,799
under Saxon law. Real division meant

487
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,679
that when there were several sons, the

488
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:30,080
farm was split into equal parts. As a

489
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:32,480
result, each heir worked a smaller

490
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:35,039
portion of land, and depending on the

491
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,520
farm's size, they often had to find

492
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:40,480
secondary sources of income. In

493
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:43,200
contrast, under old Saxon law, the

494
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:47,440
indivisible inheritance system was used.

495
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:50,159
Here only one son, usually the eldest,

496
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:53,200
inherited the entire farm, while the

497
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:57,200
brothers received smaller plots, partial

498
00:23:53,200 --> 00:24:00,320
shares or cash payments. This kept large

499
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:04,400
farms intact, boosting both economic

500
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:06,960
efficiency and social stability.

501
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,600
Below the full farmers, those owning

502
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:12,559
entire farmsteads, were many social

503
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:15,200
tiers. There were quarter, half or

504
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:18,080
eighth farmers who only controlled part

505
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:21,039
of a full farm. Then came the cottages

506
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:24,080
who had no farmland, just a small house

507
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:27,679
with a garden, and often rented fields

508
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:30,080
or worked as drivers and haulers.

509
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:32,880
Day laborers typically owned neither

510
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:36,240
land nor garden, and worked by the day

511
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:39,679
for wages and meals, either on farms or

512
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:42,799
for lords. Servants, both male and

513
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:45,600
female, were entirely landless and lived

514
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:49,200
on others farms without any claim to

515
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:53,039
farm status. Within the village, only

516
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:55,679
full farmers and sometimes half farmers

517
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:58,799
had political rights. They could be

518
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:02,400
elected to local offices such as village

519
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:04,480
judge or juror. All other groups were

520
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,120
effectively excluded from local

521
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:10,159
governance and had to rely on their lord

522
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:12,320
to represent their interests. Social

523
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:16,000
standing wasn't just defined by land

524
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:18,880
ownership, but also by livestock.

525
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,919
The number of oxmen or horse teams a

526
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:24,159
farmer owned determined how much labor

527
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:26,559
he was expected to provide for feudal

528
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:30,080
duties and how much he had to pay in

529
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:32,640
taxes. Small farmers with only a few

530
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:35,600
animals could use smaller tools and had

531
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:38,000
limited access to shared pastures.

532
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,799
Larger herds allowed participation in

533
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,440
slaughtering events, local markets, and

534
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:45,279
the use of communal meadows, all of

535
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,400
which brought higher standing in the

536
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:50,960
village community. A symbolic glimpse of

537
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:54,720
peasant status can be seen in an artwork

538
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:57,440
by Alrech Dura, showing two farmers

539
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:00,559
emphasizing their masculinity. One

540
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:04,159
places a sword before him, the other

541
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:06,720
wears a heavy knife at his belt. Even by

542
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:09,039
1600, this suggested that a member of

543
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,240
the rural upper class carried a sense of

544
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:14,799
dignity or gravitas.

545
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,880
The meer, the steward managing the farm

546
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:19,440
on behalf of the lord, held an

547
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:22,320
administrative position, usually secured

548
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:25,360
by inheritance. Jurors in the village

549
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:28,880
court were always full farmers, each

550
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:31,039
owning one or more full farms. Their

551
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,120
daughters could sometimes marry into the

552
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:36,320
nightly class if they were wealthy

553
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:40,159
enough. A literary example is the tale

554
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:43,200
of Hellreck, the son of a meer, who ends

555
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:46,080
up as a robber knight, a symbol that

556
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,559
social mobility from farming to nobility

557
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:52,159
was theoretically possible, though

558
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:55,919
rarely smooth. In contrast stood the

559
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:59,840
cottages and Katner who owned only a

560
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:01,600
tiny house or a small house plot. While

561
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:04,080
they were part of the village community,

562
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,799
they had no political rights or equal

563
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:09,520
access to shared lands.

564
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:12,400
Day laborers and farm hands occupied the

565
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:14,559
very bottom of the village hierarchy.

566
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,039
They lived on other farmers land and had

567
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:19,600
no claim to property.

568
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:22,320
Peasant clothing ranged widely in

569
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:25,520
quality. Generally, medieval clothing

570
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:29,200
was made at home. Women spun fibers from

571
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:31,760
flax or wool. Weavers created linen or

572
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:35,360
wool fabrics. And tanners prepared

573
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:38,400
leather for simple boots or shoes.

574
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:41,440
A widespread misconception suggests that

575
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:45,120
peasant clothing was poor, rough, and

576
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:48,480
shabby. In reality, weaving wool and

577
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:51,600
linen was a daily craft, and medieval

578
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,760
fabrics often had impressive quality.

579
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,600
Those who worked with fine wool could

580
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:58,559
produce garments that lasted for

581
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:01,600
decades. So, the idea that they

582
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:03,679
deliberately made lowquality clothing is

583
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:06,480
simply false.

584
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:09,200
At the same time, peasants were bound by

585
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:12,320
strict textile and clothing regulations

586
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:15,120
during the high and late middle ages.

587
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:17,039
As early as the mid12th century, church

588
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:20,159
chronicles stated that peasants should

589
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:23,360
wear gray or undyed fabrics to set them

590
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:26,080
apart from the urban and noble classes.

591
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:28,880
These dress codes were tied to local or

592
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:31,679
royal decrees. For instance, peasants

593
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:35,120
weren't allowed to use more than seven

594
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:38,799
L's, a medieval unit of length of cloth

595
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:42,080
for shirts, pants, and shoes. The

596
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:44,799
Bavarian peace of 1244 even banned

597
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:48,559
peasants from wearing luxurious colorful

598
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:51,760
fabrics or garments with silk trim.

599
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:54,640
Among the noble and urban classes, these

600
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:57,440
clothing rules were a point of pride, a

601
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:00,720
way to uphold their own moral and social

602
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,880
standing. But sometimes sharp criticism

603
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,919
flared up against peasants living above

604
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:09,120
their means who dared to buy fancy belts

605
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:11,200
or pearlstudded headpieces. In fact, the

606
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:14,080
upper peasant class had its own taste

607
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,240
for fashion. Satirical poems from

608
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,399
courtly literature poke fun at peasants

609
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,760
wearing shirts decorated with glittering

610
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:23,760
cords and silver buttons.

611
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:27,039
A famous image from the H Highleberg

612
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:29,919
song manuscript around 1600 shows a

613
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:32,880
peasant sporting a fine ruffled shirt,

614
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:35,279
the kind popular among the nobility. All

615
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:38,320
of this fed into a cultural anxiety

616
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:40,960
among nobles and towns people who feared

617
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:43,360
that peasants were no longer humble and

618
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,840
modest, but were pushing into urban

619
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:49,960
fashion trends, threatening to blur the

620
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,960
established social hierarchy.

621
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:58,000
Chapter 4. Gardens and agricultural

622
00:29:54,399 --> 00:30:00,720
tools in the Middle Ages.

623
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,200
Beyond farmland and meadows, one of the

624
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:06,559
most important parts of a medieval farm

625
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:10,480
was the household garden. The old German

626
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:13,360
word gate originally meant enclosed

627
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:15,679
area. Usually a plot surrounded by

628
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,880
hedges or fences where vegetables and

629
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:21,279
herbs were grown. Legally, the garden

630
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,360
was considered a protected space, much

631
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,440
like the house itself, and there were

632
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:28,640
clear rules about who was allowed to

633
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:31,200
plant there. Inside these gardens,

634
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:34,080
farmers grew vegetables like cabbage and

635
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,559
turnips. Millet was also part of the

636
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:40,240
garden culture as it was less important

637
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:42,720
on the open fields. Typical fiber plants

638
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:45,840
such as flax for linen or matter for

639
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:50,080
dying were raised in small garden plots,

640
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:52,799
too. Legumes, peas, beans, lentils were

641
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:56,559
vital because they enriched the soil and

642
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:59,840
provided protein. Herbs like parsley,

643
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:03,200
dill, margarm, and coriander were used

644
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:05,840
to enhance flavor in cooking. For every

645
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:08,880
farming family, the household garden was

646
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:12,240
the minimum source of daily nutrition.

647
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:15,039
vegetables, herbs, often a few wild

648
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:19,200
greens like spinach or even foraged

649
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:20,640
plants such as ground elder and nettles.

650
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,159
All of these complimented the

651
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:27,039
grain-based diet. A farmer without a

652
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:29,840
garden, villagers said, stood at the

653
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:32,480
very bottom of the social ladder.

654
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:35,760
Without garden space, there was no way

655
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:38,799
to grow fresh produce. In the early

656
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:43,279
medieval period, most farming tools were

657
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:46,159
made entirely of wood, plows, harrows,

658
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:49,840
wooden sled carts, and simple threshing

659
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:52,640
sledges. But by the 12th century, iron

660
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:56,080
tools became increasingly common.

661
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:59,760
Sickles, knives, harotines, and

662
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:03,919
plowshares were reinforced with iron,

663
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:06,320
making them sturdier and longerlasting.

664
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:08,480
Sythes which were initially used just

665
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:10,559
for cutting wood soon developed

666
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,559
tooththed edges for cleaner cuts when

667
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:14,399
harvesting.

668
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:16,880
The biggest breakthrough was the move

669
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:20,720
from the light scratch plow to the heavy

670
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:23,200
moldboard plow. The old scratch plow

671
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:26,080
common in the early middle ages just

672
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,640
scraped the surface of the soil. To

673
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:31,519
loosen the ground properly, farmers had

674
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:33,440
to plow across the same field again in

675
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:36,399
another direction.

676
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:38,559
Later came the wheeled plow, which sat

677
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:41,760
between the scratch plow and the

678
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:44,799
moldboard plow. Its wheels made it

679
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:47,279
easier to steer the animals pulling it.

680
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:50,559
But the real gamecher was the heavy

681
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:52,799
moldboard plow. It had been around since

682
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:55,840
ancient times, but only became widely

683
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:58,720
used in Europe around the 10th century.

684
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:01,039
Its special curved moldboard turned and

685
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,200
broke up the soil, making it much better

686
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:05,440
for heavy clay lands and helping keep

687
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,799
weeds down.

688
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:12,080
At first, oxen were still the main draft

689
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:14,640
animals. Their cloven hooves, protected

690
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:17,919
by primitive hoof coverings, made them

691
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:20,480
steadier on swampy terrain. But with the

692
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:24,399
introduction of the padded horse collar,

693
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:27,279
farmers increasingly turned to horses. A

694
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:31,440
single horse could pull roughly the same

695
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:33,760
load as a pair of oxen, but was faster

696
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,240
and more resilient.

697
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:39,120
It wasn't until the 15th century that

698
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:41,840
the reversible mold board, allowing

699
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:45,360
furrows to be plowed evenly in both

700
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:48,720
directions, fully caught on. Before

701
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:51,600
that, farmers usually plowed in only one

702
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:55,200
direction and had to reverse the plow at

703
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:57,200
the edge of each field.

704
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,000
In medieval times, there was a strict

705
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:02,080
distinction between household rights,

706
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,200
the private sacred rights within the

707
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:08,399
family home and village rights, which

708
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:12,639
governed the farmyard, the garden, and

709
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:16,240
all shared lands. Inside the house, the

710
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:20,000
family head near absolute authority over

711
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:22,639
the household, spouse, children, and

712
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,040
servants alike. But as soon as you

713
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:27,599
stepped out onto the farm or garden,

714
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:30,879
depending on your social rank, village

715
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:33,119
rights came into play. Even a garden,

716
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:36,480
though technically private, fell under

717
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:39,359
the communal order. In an ideal medieval

718
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:42,000
Halandorf, a clustered village typical

719
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:44,960
of the 16th century, the church with its

720
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,520
fenced cemetery stood at the center. As

721
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,440
villages settled permanently, cemeteries

722
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,359
moved into the heart of the village.

723
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,679
People were now buried within the

724
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:56,639
village. Surrounding the church were

725
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:59,839
individual farms, each enclosed by small

726
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:02,800
gardens with woven fences. You often saw

727
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:05,680
small ramps, ladders, or stepping stones

728
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:08,400
over the fences, keeping animals out,

729
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:11,200
but letting the family easily access the

730
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:14,400
garden. The village commons included

731
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:17,440
central grassy areas, wells, communal

732
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:21,200
bakehouses, village smithies, and if

733
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:24,000
present, large grain stores. Around the

734
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:27,520
village stretched the communal farmland

735
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,560
divided into units called zelen.

736
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:34,480
Each zelge operated on a three field

737
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:38,480
rotation system. One/3 for summer crops

738
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:44,240
like barley or oats, one/3 for winter

739
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:47,520
crops like wheat or rye and 1/3 left as

740
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:50,079
pasture or meadow to recover. Each

741
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:53,440
farmer worked narrow strips of land in

742
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:56,960
the big shared fields laid out in long,

743
00:35:53,440 --> 00:36:00,000
slim plots. This shape made it easier to

744
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:03,040
plow and sew in straight lines without

745
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,440
disturbing the soil too much. But to

746
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:07,680
keep everything running smoothly, the

747
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:11,520
whole village followed a strict farming

748
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:15,119
calendar. When to plow, when to plant,

749
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:18,160
when to let animals graze. This system

750
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:20,880
called field obligation was key to

751
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:23,599
making the three field rotation work.

752
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:27,280
Anyone who broke the rules could face

753
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:29,839
tough fines. In some regions, especially

754
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:33,040
in Eastern Germany, you didn't have

755
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:36,000
these clustered villages. Instead,

756
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:39,040
farmers lived in street villages where

757
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,760
homes lined a road, and each house had a

758
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:45,040
long, narrow strip of land stretching

759
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:47,280
out behind it. These farmers could work

760
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:49,040
their own land more freely without

761
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,839
having to follow the strict shared

762
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:54,640
calendar. Beyond the private fields and

763
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:58,480
homes were the communal lands, shared

764
00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:02,160
pastures, meadows, orchards, woods,

765
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:05,520
streams, and ponds. Access to these

766
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:08,640
depended on status. Full farmers who

767
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:11,359
owned large farms had rights to use the

768
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:14,320
best spots because they also provided

769
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:16,960
labor and equipment when needed. Small

770
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:19,440
holders and day laborers often had

771
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,200
little or no access to these shared

772
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,839
resources.

773
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:27,119
In every village, people shared simple

774
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:30,079
tools for transport, like big wagons,

775
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:32,240
especially important during hay harvest.

776
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:34,320
These wagons carried the hay from the

777
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:37,200
fields to the barns where it was stored

778
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,880
for winter feed. Without them, it would

779
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,920
have been nearly impossible to handle

780
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:44,720
large hay harvests. Villages also ran

781
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,720
communal mills. windmills or water

782
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:49,520
mills, though these usually belong to

783
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:51,599
the local lord or the church.

784
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:55,280
Villagers had to bring their grain there

785
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:57,599
to be ground and pay a fee. Other shared

786
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,680
spaces included bake houses and wine

787
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:02,400
sellers, which were built using village

788
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,640
funds, but managed together. Not every

789
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,960
farmhouse had its own oven or wine

790
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,640
press, so these communal places were

791
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,240
essential for daily needs and

792
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,960
celebrations.

793
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:15,280
A drawing from the 1600s shows how

794
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:18,720
villages set up their own bakeouses and

795
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:21,040
wine sellers to provide bread and wine.

796
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:23,680
Managing all this shared infrastructure

797
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:26,800
was the job of elected local officials

798
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:29,800
like debt collectors, village judges and

799
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,800
jurors.

Chapter 5. Commons village organization

801
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:40,160
and social stratification in the late

802
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:42,800
middle ages. As villages settled

803
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:45,839
permanently and became self-sufficient,

804
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:49,040
they shared access to common land, the

805
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:52,960
shared spaces beyond private farms. This

806
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:56,880
included roads, pastures, meadows,

807
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:59,680
forests, streams, and ponds, as well as

808
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:03,280
temporary or seasonal operations like

809
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:06,560
lime kils, quaries, or simple iron

810
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:10,160
works. In the high middle ages, as the

811
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:13,200
need for steel and iron grew, villagers

812
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:16,160
searched for local bog iron, set up

813
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:19,760
small furnaces and produced limited

814
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:22,880
amounts of iron. But these workshops

815
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:25,760
didn't run year round. If there was no

816
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,839
demand, they just stopped since there

817
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:31,359
were no steady markets or trade

818
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:35,040
networks. Sometimes any extra iron was

819
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:37,680
sold in the nearest towns or markets.

820
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:40,160
Access to shared village resources was

821
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:43,599
usually limited to farmers who owned

822
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:46,160
full-sized farms. Small holders and

823
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:48,960
landless villagers often had little or

824
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:52,400
no access and had to buy things like

825
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,240
iron or lime from the local steward or

826
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:57,200
the monastery.

827
00:39:54,240 --> 00:40:00,640
These limits led to tensions, especially

828
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:03,200
in the early 1400s and 1500s when

829
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:06,400
peasants protested what they saw as the

830
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:08,960
plundering of the commons. Nobles and

831
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,680
church leaders tried to take over shared

832
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:14,079
lands, turning them into private grazing

833
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:16,400
fields or expanding their hunting

834
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:19,839
grounds, which cut off peasants from

835
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:22,000
using them. Hunting bans were issued and

836
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:25,119
lands that had once been shared were

837
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:28,240
placed under the lord's control.

838
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:30,720
In response, village communities began

839
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:33,839
handling more administrative tasks that

840
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:36,880
had once been controlled by the lords.

841
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:38,800
They enforced local farming rules,

842
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,920
setting the calendar for planting,

843
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:44,320
harvesting, and grazing. stewards or tax

844
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:46,960
collectors gathered payments, usually a

845
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:50,320
tenth of the harvest, and delivered it

846
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:52,240
to the Lord's storehouse. Over time,

847
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:54,960
these village positions were no longer

848
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:57,280
held only by big land owners, but were

849
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:00,240
often filled by elected community

850
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:02,560
members. The village increasingly acted

851
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:05,599
as a collective representing the

852
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:08,079
interests of all its farmers.

853
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:12,000
Village courts also took on judicial

854
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:16,319
functions. These local courts made up of

855
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:19,680
a village judge, jurors, and headmen

856
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:22,480
settled disputes between farmers such as

857
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:25,280
border disagreements, conflicts over

858
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:28,079
labor obligations, or claims to the

859
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:31,920
commons. They didn't handle major

860
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:34,240
crimes, murder, robbery, or serious

861
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:37,200
breaches of peace remained under the

862
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:39,599
jurisdiction of higher courts. But for

863
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:42,319
civil matters like inheritance or

864
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:44,880
communal rights, the village court was

865
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:48,319
far more connected to daily life than

866
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:51,280
distant feudal or princely judges. At

867
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:54,000
the same time, princely and clerical

868
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:56,800
holdings maintain their own rights

869
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,800
within the village. preserved hunting

870
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:05,520
grounds, private meadows, fish ponds,

871
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:09,359
mills, bridges, tithe barns, parish

872
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:11,040
houses, and monastic farms. The church

873
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:13,680
received its share of the tithe

874
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:16,560
directly. A portion of the village

875
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:18,640
harvest went straight to the clergy.

876
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,400
Small shrines and chapels at the

877
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,839
village's edge reflected this

878
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:25,520
overlapping presence of village

879
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:28,400
self-ruule and ecclesiastical authority.

880
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:31,680
By the late Middle Ages, village society

881
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:34,720
had become sharply divided. At the top

882
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:37,920
were full farmers, families who owned at

883
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:40,640
least one full-sized farm. They had

884
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:43,440
voting rights in village matters, full

885
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:46,720
access to shared lands, could build up

886
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:50,000
reserves, keep herds of animals, and

887
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:52,560
handle their duties on their own terms.

888
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,760
Below them were the half-free peasants

889
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:58,720
who worked directly for the local lord.

890
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:01,119
While technically not free, some could

891
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:03,520
rise in status by becoming trusted

892
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:06,160
servants of the nobility.

893
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:08,560
Smallh holders who only had a tiny house

894
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:11,280
and maybe a small garden or a little bit

895
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:14,640
of farmland had no rights to the main

896
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:17,680
farmland or shared resources. They also

897
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:20,800
had no vote in village decisions. Day

898
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:23,520
laborers owned no land at all. They

899
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:26,319
survived by working for daily wages,

900
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:29,280
mostly during harvest, and often worked

901
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:31,520
on the farms of richer neighbors. At the

902
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:34,160
very bottom were servants who were

903
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:37,280
completely landless and not even counted

904
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:39,119
as part of the formal village community.

905
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,200
Their lives were controlled by the

906
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:43,280
households they worked for, and any

907
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:45,200
concerns they had were represented by

908
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:48,079
their masters.

909
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:50,240
Already in the 14th and 15th centuries,

910
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:52,880
as regional rulers expanded their

911
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:55,839
administrative systems, this village

912
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:58,000
state began to crumble.

913
00:43:55,839 --> 00:44:00,000
Local village judges and jurors were

914
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,800
gradually replaced by stateappointed

915
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,240
stewards and tax collectors. Many

916
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,400
village rights shifted to the

917
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:09,599
territorial lords who installed their

918
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:11,680
own forest officials or customs posts.

919
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:13,760
Peasants protested these changes during

920
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:17,680
the peasant uprisings, especially

921
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:19,760
between 1449 and 1455,

922
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:22,000
demanding the preservation of local

923
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:26,599
communal rights and the return of the

924
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,599
commons they had used for generations.

00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:37,359
peasant everyday culture.

927
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:40,480
A famous image by Alrechdura from around

928
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:43,440
1600 shows two farmers posed

929
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:45,599
confidently. One has placed a sword on

930
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:49,200
the table before him while the other

931
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:52,400
wears a sturdy knife at his belt. Both

932
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:55,359
signal we are not just primitive farmers

933
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:58,319
but members of a rural upper class,

934
00:44:55,359 --> 00:45:00,319
people with rights and dignity.

935
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:03,680
At the top of the village stood the

936
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:07,040
local leaders, sometimes hereditary,

937
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:08,960
sometimes elected by village assemblies.

938
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:11,599
They represented the community in

939
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:14,240
dealings with the landlord and made sure

940
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:15,760
farming rules and shared rights were

941
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:18,160
respected.

942
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:20,960
Working alongside them were stewards who

943
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:23,760
managed small farms for the lord and

944
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:25,599
local judges who handled civil or land

945
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:28,319
disputes.

946
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:30,880
Whether a farm stayed in the family over

947
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:35,119
generations depended a lot on local

948
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:38,480
laws. In areas with Frankish law, like

949
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:41,920
parts of Franconia or the Rine region,

950
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:45,359
the system of equal inheritance applied.

951
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:48,160
When a farmer died, all sons inherited

952
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:50,720
equally, dividing the land again and

953
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:53,680
again until none of the pieces were big

954
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:56,880
enough to support a family. These

955
00:45:53,680 --> 00:46:00,480
shrinking plots forced many heirs to

956
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:03,839
take on extra work like day labor or

957
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:07,440
small crafts just to get by.

958
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:10,640
In contrast, regions under Saxon law

959
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:13,280
such as Saxony or Meccllinburgg followed

960
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:17,520
a system where the entire farm went to

961
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:20,160
the main heir, usually the eldest son.

962
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:23,680
The siblings got compensation or small

963
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:26,640
goods, but the farm itself stayed whole.

964
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:29,040
In many areas, this system lasted into

965
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:31,920
the 18th century.

966
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:35,359
Even among full farmers, there were

967
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:37,920
layers. Below them were half farmers,

968
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:41,040
quarter farmers, and even smaller

969
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:43,760
holders, each with just part of a full

970
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:47,599
farm, often split among several

971
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:50,800
brothers. Below that came small holders

972
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:54,800
with only a house and garden, but no

973
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:58,400
stable or large fields. Lower still were

974
00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:01,680
the day laborers who owned nothing and

975
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:04,480
worked for others when needed. At the

976
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:07,920
very bottom were the servants who worked

977
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:10,640
on farms, often without pay and had no

978
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:12,880
political voice at all.

979
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:15,680
Livestock holdings were another key

980
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:18,640
marker of social status.

981
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:21,440
Farmers who owned more draft animals,

982
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:24,000
oxmen or horses, had greater

983
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:27,200
transportation capacity and were often

984
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:29,520
exempt from certain labor duties. The

985
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:32,880
number of oxmen or horses was both a

986
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:35,359
signal of wealth and a practical tool.

987
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:37,839
Someone with even a single team could

988
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:40,560
work a field independently, while those

989
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:43,839
without teams had to perform extra labor

990
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:46,800
just to get by. The village economy

991
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:49,839
extended well beyond simple farming.

992
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:52,720
Wagon makers built carts. Blacksmiths

993
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:55,520
shaped iron tools. Tanners produced

994
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:58,560
leather. Binders tied together grain

995
00:47:55,520 --> 00:48:02,000
sheav. Brick makers and potters crafted

996
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:04,400
clay vessels. and weavers and spinners

997
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,359
supplied families with linen and wool

998
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:09,839
fabrics. These trades were usually tied

999
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:12,319
to farming families, but by the late

1000
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:14,480
14th and 15th centuries, they

1001
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:16,880
increasingly evolved into specialized

1002
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:18,720
village groups that formed their own

1003
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:21,040
guilds.

1004
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:23,760
Clothing was often handmade in rural

1005
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:26,559
households. Wool and linen were the most

1006
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:29,680
common materials. Wool came from local

1007
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:32,480
sheep, while linen was spun from flax.

1008
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:36,400
The fibers were spun by hand spindles,

1009
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:38,400
woven into yarn, and then dyed. Colored

1010
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:41,440
fabrics were especially valued among

1011
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:44,079
peasants. Normally, farmers wore gray or

1012
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:46,079
natural colored linen or wool garments,

1013
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:49,280
but wealthier households could afford

1014
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:51,119
more colorful materials. Occasionally,

1015
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:53,520
well-off peasants decorated their

1016
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:55,760
clothing with pearlstudded accessories,

1017
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:58,079
wore stylish leather belts with metal

1018
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:01,359
ornaments, or embroidered their hats

1019
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:03,599
with colorful threads. Local nobles

1020
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:06,319
often complain that these farmers were

1021
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:08,880
living beyond their means, wearing silk

1022
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:11,200
trims or gold buttons on their shirts,

1023
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:13,200
blurring the social lines that the elite

1024
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:15,280
wanted to maintain.

1025
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:18,160
Peasant clothing was functional above

1026
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:20,400
all. Men typically wore tunics and

1027
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:23,359
trousers made from tightly woven wool

1028
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:26,720
fabric along with leather lace up shoes

1029
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:29,280
that were sturdy but not stylish. Women

1030
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:31,599
often wore long linen dresses with

1031
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:34,960
simple decorative borders as well as

1032
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:37,040
linen or wool caps or hairetss.

1033
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,760
Children's clothing followed the same

1034
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:43,200
patterns as the adults, though made in

1035
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:46,079
smaller sizes. A farmer who had no

1036
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:49,520
access to dye plants or colored threads

1037
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:51,520
usually stuck to undyed linen or wool.

1038
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:54,640
But wealthier farmers invested in

1039
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:57,040
materials like wool dyed with wde or

1040
00:49:54,640 --> 00:50:01,400
matter which gave their clothing more

1041
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:01,400
vibrant and intense colors.

1042
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:08,960
Chapter 7. Food and eating culture among

1043
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:11,760
medieval farmers.

1044
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:15,280
The diet of medieval farmers was far

1045
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:17,520
from boring or bland. People today often

1046
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:21,200
assume peasants just lived on thin oat

1047
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:23,040
porridge or plain gr. But in reality,

1048
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:26,240
the variety of their meals were

1049
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:29,359
surprisingly rich. Grains played a

1050
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:31,760
central role in their diet. In the early

1051
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:34,800
Middle Ages, millet was one of the most

1052
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:37,839
common crops grown in home gardens.

1053
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:40,319
Farmers cooked it into hearty porrges,

1054
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:43,680
sometimes with milk, sometimes with

1055
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:45,280
water, and even shaped it into small

1056
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:48,720
dumplings.

1057
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:51,839
In poorer regions, millet often replaced

1058
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:54,240
the more expensive wheat. Barley was

1059
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:57,200
another staple, sewn in the spring and

1060
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:59,599
harvested by late summer. It worked well

1061
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:02,319
in porridge, stews, or as feed for

1062
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:05,200
animals. Oats, meanwhile, were mostly

1063
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:08,000
grown to feed horses and were usually

1064
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:11,599
harvested in the fall, so you rarely saw

1065
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,680
oat fields in late spring. Rye was

1066
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:16,800
especially important in cooler

1067
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:19,680
mountainous regions. As a winter grain,

1068
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:21,760
it was resilient and could handle damp

1069
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:24,240
conditions, making it the main

1070
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:27,760
ingredient for bread, especially during

1071
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:29,440
tough times when food was scarce. Wheat

1072
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:32,480
on the other hand was considered a

1073
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:35,520
luxury. It had higher yields but was

1074
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:38,079
more vulnerable to mildew in wet areas.

1075
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:41,119
So only the best lands were used for it

1076
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:43,839
and it was highly priced. When it came

1077
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:46,160
to bread, it's worth knowing that in the

1078
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:48,960
early Middle Ages, bread wasn't

1079
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:52,240
something every household had daily.

1080
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:54,640
Home ovens were rare, and if a family

1081
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:57,359
didn't own one, they had to rely on the

1082
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:59,440
village bake house. Villages often had

1083
00:51:57,359 --> 00:52:01,680
communal bake houses where people could

1084
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:04,800
bake their bread for a fee or by

1085
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:07,040
offering labor in return. Making bread

1086
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:09,119
required sourdough starters that

1087
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,960
families carefully preserved across

1088
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:13,760
generations.

1089
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:16,559
Many poorer families rarely baked bread

1090
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:20,160
and instead relied on porridge as their

1091
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:22,480
staple food. When they did eat bread, it

1092
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:25,040
was often broken into pieces, not

1093
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:28,400
sliced, and typically dipped into soups

1094
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:30,960
or stews to soften it. Porridge, or what

1095
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:33,760
they called mush, was the backbone of

1096
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:36,880
the medieval peasants diet. But it

1097
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:39,760
wasn't just thin, watery, grl. These

1098
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:42,160
porr,

1099
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:45,520
sometimes so firm they were almost

1100
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:47,680
slicable, much like today's palenta.

1101
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:50,800
Dumplings back then resembled heavy

1102
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:54,240
bread dumplings or dense wheat porrges

1103
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:57,599
shaped into balls. Many recipes blurred

1104
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:59,760
the lines. A barley or rye porridge

1105
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:03,040
sweetened with honey and herbs could be

1106
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:06,720
a filling meal on its own. Vegetables

1107
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:09,359
and field crops also played a big role.

1108
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:12,000
Cabbage, both white and seavoy

1109
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:14,400
varieties, was one of the main summer

1110
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,640
and fall vegetables and could be

1111
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:19,520
preserved through fermentation or

1112
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:22,640
pickling, providing vital vitamins in

1113
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:24,640
the winter months. Root vegetables like

1114
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:27,200
carrots and yellow turnips were

1115
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:29,760
initially grown more for animal feed,

1116
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:33,359
but by the high middle ages had become

1117
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:36,720
common on the dinner table. Legumes like

1118
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:40,240
peas, beans, and lentils, known back

1119
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:43,839
then as salad, were a key source of

1120
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:46,480
protein and also improved soil health,

1121
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:49,040
making them valuable both in the kitchen

1122
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:51,599
and on the farm.

1123
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:56,000
Herbs rounded out the medieval flavor

1124
00:53:51,599 --> 00:54:00,720
pallet. Parsley, dill, coriander,

1125
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:05,040
margarm, juniper, fennel and carowway

1126
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:08,400
were widely used not just to season food

1127
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:10,319
but also for healing and as natural

1128
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:12,640
fragrances.

1129
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:15,760
Medieval records from as early as the

1130
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:18,880
Carolian Empire list pages of herbs

1131
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:24,079
cultivated for food, medicine, and

1132
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:27,200
scent. Even dye plants like w matter and

1133
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:29,599
turmeric were sometimes grown alongside

1134
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:32,480
herbs, especially by peasants who

1135
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:34,160
doubled as dyers, coloring fabrics for

1136
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:36,559
clothing.

1137
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:38,640
When it came to protein, medieval farm

1138
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:40,960
households had more variety than you

1139
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:43,040
might think. Pigs were the favorite

1140
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:44,960
animals for home slaughter because they

1141
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:47,839
could eat kitchen scraps and turn them

1142
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:49,839
into valuable meat. Cows were mostly

1143
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:52,400
kept for their milk, while sheep and

1144
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:55,280
goats provided not just meat, but also

1145
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:58,400
wool and hides for clothing and tools.

1146
00:54:55,280 --> 00:55:00,240
Poultry was everywhere. Chickens were

1147
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:03,119
especially popular because they grew

1148
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:05,119
quickly. In just about 40 days, you

1149
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:08,480
could raise a chick into a slaughter

1150
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:11,920
ready bird. Farmers also kept ducks,

1151
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:14,240
geese, and sometimes guinea foul. Eggs

1152
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:17,359
and chicken meat were key sources of

1153
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:21,280
protein in the spring and summer.

1154
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:23,760
Wild game added more variety. Small game

1155
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:28,319
like hairs or partridges were caught

1156
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:31,520
using traps, nets, or small crossbows.

1157
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:34,720
Only the local elite like wealthy full

1158
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:37,119
farmers or free men were allowed to hunt

1159
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:40,079
with larger crossbows.

1160
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:42,400
Specialized hunters such as falconers

1161
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:45,520
usually worked for noble estates or

1162
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:48,799
monasteries. Fish was another important

1163
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:51,280
part of the diet. People ate fresh or

1164
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:53,359
smoked river fish and pond fish,

1165
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:56,880
including herring, halibet, and

1166
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:59,599
sometimes saltwater fish brought inland.

1167
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:01,920
By the late Middle Ages, some regions

1168
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:04,240
had well-developed pond farming,

1169
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:07,280
especially using mill ponds, which

1170
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:09,520
boosted the local fish supply.

1171
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:12,480
Milk products and honey were essential

1172
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:14,799
household staples. Butter was a

1173
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:17,440
fantastic way to preserve milk for the

1174
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:21,040
winter, and it served as both a cooking

1175
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:24,079
fat and a flavor booster.

1176
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:27,040
Cheese came in many forms. Hard cheese,

1177
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:29,920
soft cheese, or fresh cheese, depending

1178
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:32,240
on the region and how long it was aged.

1179
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:35,040
Cheese was not just a vital food reserve

1180
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:38,640
for the cold months, but also a valuable

1181
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:41,119
product for trade. Buttermilk, left over

1182
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:43,119
from making butter, was either drunk or

1183
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:46,240
used as fertilizer in the vegetable

1184
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:48,880
garden. And then there was honey. Both

1185
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:52,000
wild forest honey and honey from village

1186
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:54,160
beekeepers were highly praised. Honey

1187
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,799
was one of the best and most expensive

1188
00:56:54,160 --> 00:57:00,240
sweeteners and was often used as a form

1189
00:56:56,799 --> 00:57:02,240
of payment, a real symbol of rural

1190
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:04,559
self-sufficiency.

1191
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:07,280
Fruit and foraged foods rounded out the

1192
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:09,680
medieval farm diet. Many farms had

1193
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:12,799
orchards or shared access to community

1194
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:16,079
fruit trees like apples, pears, and

1195
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:18,319
cherries. Wild plants like berries,

1196
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:20,640
mushrooms, and herbs were gathered from

1197
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:23,359
the surrounding countryside.

1198
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:27,440
People also collected wild greens like

1199
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:30,720
wild garlic, ground elder, nettles, and

1200
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:34,319
dandelion along with edible or medicinal

1201
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:37,920
roots and berries like mugwart, borage

1202
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:40,880
or juniper berries. Herbs and flavorings

1203
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:45,599
came mainly from local gardens. Farmers

1204
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:49,680
grew parsley, dill, coriander, margarm,

1205
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:53,520
sage, savory, and thyme to season their

1206
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:57,200
dishes. Vinegar made from sour wine or

1207
00:57:53,520 --> 00:58:00,720
cider added sharpness to meals. For

1208
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:04,400
cooking fats, they used lard from pigs,

1209
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:06,559
which packed both calories and taste.

1210
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:09,200
Salt was one of the most precious

1211
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:12,000
ingredients. It had to be mined from

1212
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:15,119
salt works or imported over long trade

1213
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:18,160
routes and was costly. Pepper was

1214
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:20,240
considered a luxury spice, rarely seen

1215
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:22,880
in peasant households, though from the

1216
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:25,040
high middle ages onward, small amounts

1217
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:26,640
sometimes made their way into rural

1218
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:28,799
kitchens.

1219
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:32,400
Preservation techniques were essential

1220
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:35,839
for surviving the winter. Drying was

1221
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:38,640
common. People hung meat, fish,

1222
00:58:35,839 --> 00:58:41,119
vegetables, and herbs in drying rooms or

1223
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:43,440
laid them out on racks.

1224
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:47,680
Smoking was another popular method.

1225
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:49,359
Bacon, fish, meat, and cheese were cured

1226
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:52,400
in the smokeouses attached to

1227
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:56,240
farmhouses. Sultting and pickling were

1228
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:59,359
also widespread. Fish and meat were

1229
00:58:56,240 --> 00:59:02,160
soaked in brine while vegetables,

1230
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:04,559
fruits, and herbs were preserved in

1231
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:06,960
vinegar or oil.

1232
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:09,680
The rhythm of medieval farm life was

1233
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:12,720
shaped by the seasons. In the summer,

1234
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:15,359
fresh herbs from the garden, berries,

1235
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:18,400
wild greens, and fresh caught fish

1236
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:20,720
filled the table. Autumn was the peak

1237
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:24,480
season for harvesting vegetables and

1238
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:27,200
fruits like apples and pears, but also

1239
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:30,160
for slaughtering animals, especially

1240
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:31,680
pigs, and for making cider and fruit

1241
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:34,799
wine.

1242
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:39,200
Winter was all about surviving on stored

1243
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:42,480
foods, hearty stews, thick porrges, root

1244
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:46,559
vegetables, pickled goods, honey,

1245
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:49,200
cheese, butter, and smoked meats.

1246
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:51,760
Spring, particularly during Lent and the

1247
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:53,760
fasting period, often meant facing the

1248
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:56,720
leanest weeks when there was little

1249
00:59:53,760 --> 01:00:00,160
fresh food. Instead of meat, people

1250
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:05,960
relied on fish like carp and proteinrich

1251
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:05,960
legumes such as beans and peas.

1252
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:14,079
Chapter 8. Leisure, folk culture, and

1253
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:16,559
the yearly work cycle.

1254
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:19,280
In the daily life of a medieval farmer,

1255
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:22,559
the idea of free time as we know it

1256
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:25,200
barely existed. Almost every moment was

1257
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:27,760
tied to work on the house, the farm, or

1258
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:30,240
within the village. But that didn't mean

1259
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:32,480
people never had fun. Quite the

1260
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:35,599
opposite, there were many ways for

1261
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:38,880
villagers to relax, celebrate, and enjoy

1262
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:40,880
culture together. Village taverns began

1263
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:44,640
popping up as early as the High Middle

1264
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:47,119
Ages. These inns were easy to spot. They

1265
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:49,839
often had wooden signs with symbols or

1266
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:52,480
crests hanging over their doors. The

1267
01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:54,480
windows were small, sometimes fitted

1268
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:57,359
with lattice patterns to help keep the

1269
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:59,680
warmth inside. At the entrance, you

1270
01:00:57,359 --> 01:01:01,680
might find small pass through doors

1271
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:03,760
designed so the inkeeper could hand out

1272
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:06,960
food and drinks without having to walk

1273
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:10,000
all the way across the tavern room. In

1274
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:13,280
spring, villagers built simple outdoor

1275
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:16,000
stages to host plays. Local actors

1276
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:19,200
performed biblical stories or legends,

1277
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:22,160
and the sword dance was a highlight. Men

1278
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:25,599
in leather trousers, waving swords and

1279
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:28,640
bright cloths, danced in formation, not

1280
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:32,160
to show fighting skill, but to display

1281
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:34,720
social rank since only free farmers

1282
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:37,760
could own swords.

1283
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:40,960
Shooting clubs were common, too. In the

1284
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:43,440
evenings, farmers practiced with bows or

1285
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:45,359
crossbows, aiming at targets near the

1286
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:47,599
village windmill.

1287
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:50,079
These practices evolved into lively

1288
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:52,559
shooting festivals where one person was

1289
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:54,960
crowned the village marksman.

1290
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:57,280
Big festivals like weddings, church

1291
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:59,680
feasts, or village fairs brought

1292
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:02,880
everyone together. Squares were

1293
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:05,599
decorated with flags. Villagers danced,

1294
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:08,319
played games, or competed in long jumps

1295
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:10,640
and stonethrowing contests. Religious

1296
01:02:08,319 --> 01:02:13,839
events like processions or local

1297
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:16,319
pilgrimages also played a big role,

1298
01:02:13,839 --> 01:02:19,839
blending spiritual life with community

1299
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:23,520
bonding. Groups walked to small chapels,

1300
01:02:19,839 --> 01:02:26,000
stopping to pray, sing, and rest, making

1301
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:29,359
these moments both devotional and

1302
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:32,160
social. And after long work days,

1303
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:35,119
villagers gathered to play dice or early

1304
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:38,880
card games like tarot. Not just to

1305
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:40,640
gamble, but to relax and enjoy time

1306
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:42,720
together.

1307
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:45,599
Now, let's walk through the typical

1308
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:48,799
farming year as it was shown in medieval

1309
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:54,000
illustrated calendars and books of ours.

1310
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:57,040
Month by month, the rhythm of farm life.

1311
01:02:54,000 --> 01:03:01,440
In January, farmers focused on indoor

1312
01:02:57,040 --> 01:03:03,839
chores. Women spun flax, men wo linen,

1313
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:06,720
and families did small repairs around

1314
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:08,799
the house. They also chopped firewood

1315
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:11,359
for the winter and cleaned out the

1316
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:14,079
animal stalls, making sure the cattle

1317
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:16,160
and pigs were wellfed and warm. Some

1318
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:18,480
even transported firewood to city

1319
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:20,960
markets to sell.

1320
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:22,960
February brought more of the same.

1321
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:25,440
indoor work like repairs and

1322
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:28,079
woodworking, crafting tools and

1323
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:30,079
maintaining the household. Beekeepers

1324
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:33,200
checked their hives and collected wax

1325
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:35,680
for making candles or other goods. More

1326
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:37,839
wood was brought into town for trade or

1327
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:39,920
sale.

1328
01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:42,880
March marked the start of outdoor

1329
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:45,599
repairs. Farmers mended fences and

1330
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:48,720
pasture enclosures, pulled weeds, and

1331
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:52,079
worked the soil. Plowing began in

1332
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:55,440
earnest. oxen or horses were harnessed

1333
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:58,559
to simple plows, readying the fields for

1334
01:03:55,440 --> 01:04:01,440
spring crops like oats.

1335
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:04,079
By April, attention shifted to garden

1336
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:07,280
work. Families turned over the garden

1337
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:10,720
beds, spread manure, and planted beans

1338
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:12,880
and peas. Field work picked up, too,

1339
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:15,599
with plowing and harrowing for the

1340
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:18,240
summer grains. The animals were driven

1341
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:21,599
out onto the pastures, marking the true

1342
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:23,920
start of the outdoor farming season.

1343
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:26,640
In May, there was less pressure from

1344
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:29,599
heavy farm work, and people finally had

1345
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:32,000
time for themselves. Villagers gathered

1346
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:35,200
by the riverside to dance, took

1347
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:38,240
refreshing swims in local ponds, or set

1348
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:41,039
out on small boat rides, even chilling

1349
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:44,559
drinks by lowering metal flasks into the

1350
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:47,520
cool current. May, often called the

1351
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:50,319
month of joy, was mostly given over to

1352
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:53,920
celebrating springtime with fewer

1353
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:57,599
demands from the fields. By June,

1354
01:04:53,920 --> 01:05:00,559
though, the real work picked up again.

1355
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:03,359
Farmers headed out to cut hay, swinging

1356
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:05,680
their sides through the tall grasses,

1357
01:05:03,359 --> 01:05:08,000
carefully laying the cutings on linen

1358
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:11,359
sheets before loading them onto big

1359
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:13,760
wooden wagons. Back at the barns, they

1360
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:15,920
heaved the hay up into the lofts,

1361
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:18,960
packing it tightly to build the winter

1362
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:21,760
supply of animal fodder. Without this

1363
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:24,480
hard work, there would be no way to keep

1364
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:26,559
the livestock fed during the cold

1365
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:30,720
months.

1366
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:33,359
July brought the grain harvest. Oats and

1367
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:35,760
barley were ready to cut, and farmers

1368
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:38,160
bent over the fields with sickles,

1369
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:41,760
working carefully to gather as much as

1370
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:44,240
possible. In some places, they used

1371
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:48,400
special tooththed sickles to speed up

1372
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:51,119
the cutting. At the same time, berries,

1373
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:53,680
early apples, and cherries were being

1374
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:56,640
picked, adding fresh fruit to the

1375
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:58,960
household stores. Once the grain was

1376
01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:02,160
cut, it was brought to the village

1377
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:05,920
threshing floors, broad packed earth

1378
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:08,480
spaces, or even public squares where it

1379
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:10,799
was tossed into the air, letting the

1380
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:14,720
wind help separate the chaff from the

1381
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:17,200
kernels. Sometimes they dragged rough

1382
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:19,680
wooden boards covered with flint across

1383
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:21,200
the grain to break it apart more

1384
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:24,000
efficiently.

1385
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:27,280
Once cleaned, the precious grain was

1386
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:30,960
moved into tall storage barns, stacked

1387
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:34,000
carefully away for the months ahead.

1388
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:36,960
As August rolled in, the harvest season

1389
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:39,680
wrapped up. Farmers dried the last of

1390
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:41,839
the sheav under the open sky, finished

1391
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:44,960
threshing, and then turned to clearing

1392
01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:47,440
the fields. Leftover straw was chopped

1393
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:50,319
down, and the land was made ready for

1394
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:52,640
the sewing of winter crops.

1395
01:06:50,319 --> 01:06:55,839
September brought the grape harvest in

1396
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:59,520
wine growing regions like Franconia, the

1397
01:06:55,839 --> 01:07:02,160
Mosul Valley, and the Rine. Wine farmers

1398
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:04,079
often enjoyed a higher status since

1399
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:07,599
wine-making was seen as a prestigious

1400
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:09,839
and skilled craft. Meanwhile, in other

1401
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:12,480
parts of the countryside, farmers were

1402
01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:15,280
already sewing rye and wheat for the

1403
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:17,839
winter season. It was also the start of

1404
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:19,920
the acorn feeding season when pigs were

1405
01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:22,480
driven into the forests to fatten up on

1406
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:24,319
fallen acorns and beach nuts, helping to

1407
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:27,280
build up their meat before the winter

1408
01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:29,760
slaughter. In the wine regions, fresh

1409
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:32,240
grapes were stored in cool underground

1410
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:36,480
cellers where they would slowly ferment

1411
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:39,599
into wine. October was a time to finish

1412
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:43,039
planting rye and wheat and to begin

1413
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:46,400
slaughtering cattle. Beef was especially

1414
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:49,200
prized for feasts or winter storage, and

1415
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:52,240
farmers also focused on drying fruits

1416
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:56,319
like apples and pears and gathering

1417
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:58,480
herbs for the long cold season ahead.

1418
01:07:56,319 --> 01:08:00,640
In November, pigs were still being

1419
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:03,839
fattened in the woods, getting them

1420
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:06,720
ready for slaughter. Farmers also worked

1421
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:08,880
on processing flax, breaking the tough

1422
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:11,359
stalks to extract fibers for linen

1423
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:13,599
making. With winter closing in, they

1424
01:08:11,359 --> 01:08:15,520
repaired tools, treated leather, and

1425
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:18,080
made sure they had everything ready for

1426
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:20,719
the next spring's planting.

1427
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:23,199
December brought the big pig slaughter,

1428
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:26,960
a major event that filled winter stores

1429
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:28,880
with bacon, sausages, and ham. This

1430
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:31,120
usually happened before Christmas when

1431
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:33,759
the cold helped preserve the meat.

1432
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:36,640
Families also baked big batches of bread

1433
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:39,679
and spent the dark days weaving, mending

1434
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:42,000
clothes, and repairing shoes.

1435
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:44,480
These monthly rhythms appear in many

1436
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:47,359
medieval manuscripts and calendars like

1437
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:50,560
the book of hours of the Duke Deer, the

1438
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:52,400
Celestat Psalms or the H Highleberg song

1439
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:54,960
manuscript.

1440
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:58,319
Even back in the Carolinian period

1441
01:08:54,960 --> 01:09:00,880
around 8:18, foldable calendars like the

1442
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:03,839
Capitular Devilis showed peasants at

1443
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:07,520
work capturing the farm cycle across the

1444
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:10,480
12 months. Life in the medieval world

1445
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:13,480
was deeply tied to this steady seasonal

1446
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:13,480
rhythm.

1447
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:20,640
Chapter nine. Village-based

1448
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:22,960
entertainment and festival culture.

1449
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:25,679
In the villages, there were all kinds of

1450
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:28,319
community entertainment. The idea that

1451
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:32,159
rural life was only about hard, boring

1452
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:34,719
farm labor is simply wrong and just as

1453
01:09:32,159 --> 01:09:37,920
false as the picture of a helpless,

1454
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:39,759
suffering peasant. Village taverns were

1455
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:43,279
often built at the far edge of the

1456
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:45,440
village near main roads or watermills. A

1457
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:49,520
tavern usually had a sign hanging

1458
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:52,319
outside, maybe a wooden cup, a knife, or

1459
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:54,480
a rooster, and its windows were fitted

1460
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:56,800
with lattises, protecting the guests

1461
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:59,440
inside while still allowing them to look

1462
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:01,920
out. Special little doors let the

1463
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:03,920
inkeeper pass food and drinks to hungry

1464
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:06,480
farm workers without them needing to

1465
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:09,120
come inside the main room.

1466
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:11,280
In early spring, villagers would set up

1467
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:14,880
makeshift wooden stages in the center of

1468
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:17,760
town for carnival plays. Local teenagers

1469
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:21,679
often took part performing comedies,

1470
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:25,360
ballads, or religious mystery plays. One

1471
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:27,920
special tradition was the sword dance

1472
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:31,040
where farmers dressed in costumes and

1473
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:34,400
sashes carrying swords moved in

1474
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:36,159
choreographed steps on the stage.

1475
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:38,880
These dances weren't just for

1476
01:10:36,159 --> 01:10:40,800
entertainment. They were a way for the

1477
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:43,679
village to show itself as a proud

1478
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:46,320
independent community. Near some

1479
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:48,640
windmills or watermills, you could find

1480
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:51,520
target boards where villagers practiced

1481
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:53,360
shooting with crossbows, long bows, or

1482
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:55,600
even slingshots.

1483
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:58,640
Over time, these shooting groups became

1484
01:10:55,600 --> 01:11:01,280
formal guilds. Being chosen as the

1485
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:03,360
vill's shooting king was a big honor,

1486
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:05,920
and neighbors from other villages were

1487
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:08,800
often invited for competitions. The

1488
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:11,040
mills were a practical location. They

1489
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:15,199
made enough noise to cover the sounds of

1490
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:18,560
practice and stood as clear landmarks.

1491
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:22,400
Dice and card games made their way north

1492
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:24,640
from southern Europe. By the 1300s,

1493
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:27,840
peasants were already gathering in

1494
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:31,920
taverns or at festivals to play dice

1495
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:34,320
games. Card games like Tarokino or

1496
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:36,640
Lorenzo Ilmaniko

1497
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:40,320
were more common among the wealthy or

1498
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:42,239
nobility. But by the 1400s, simpler

1499
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:44,640
cards began to spread into the

1500
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:48,080
countryside.

1501
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:50,960
Villagers also organized competitions.

1502
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:53,120
Long jumping, stone throwing, or

1503
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:56,239
wrestling matches were held in the

1504
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:59,679
village squares. These weren't really

1505
01:11:56,239 --> 01:12:03,120
about fame or prizes. They were about

1506
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:06,880
shared experience, fun, and testing each

1507
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:09,280
other's strength. Games with balls or

1508
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:12,239
bowlinglike contests were popular at

1509
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:14,719
harvest festivals or church fairs.

1510
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:17,440
People would roll balls toward targets

1511
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:20,640
set in grooves or ditches, similar to

1512
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:23,600
early versions of bowling.

1513
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:26,640
Village festivals, like harvest fairs or

1514
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:29,920
church feast days, were colorful and

1515
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:32,719
lively. Flags and banners, much like

1516
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:35,199
city guild flags, marked which village

1517
01:12:32,719 --> 01:12:37,600
group or association was organizing the

1518
01:12:35,199 --> 01:12:39,600
event. For example, during a

1519
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:42,560
Thanksgiving procession, the village

1520
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:45,280
leader might carry the Sebastian banner,

1521
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:47,360
a red penant with an image of St.

1522
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:49,679
Sebastian.

1523
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:52,320
During these festivals, villagers

1524
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:55,040
gathered in taverns or big barns to

1525
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:58,320
dance, eat, laugh, and sometimes argue

1526
01:12:55,040 --> 01:13:00,880
loudly. A 16th century illustration

1527
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:03,199
shows long wooden benches and tables,

1528
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:06,880
people drinking from clay mugs or brass

1529
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:09,679
cups, and beer drawn from large barrels.

1530
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:13,920
Outside, families would sit on benches

1531
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:16,080
sipping local wine, beer, or mead.

1532
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:19,520
In some villages, there were public

1533
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:22,159
bathous with wooden tubs or shared bath

1534
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:25,440
areas, especially in forested regions

1535
01:13:22,159 --> 01:13:28,000
where firewood was easy to find. Where

1536
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:30,640
wood was scarce, wealthier folks would

1537
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:34,159
just head to the local mill pond for a

1538
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:37,600
cooling dip. One old illustration even

1539
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:40,320
shows farmers splashing in a mill pond

1540
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:44,000
right beside the rushing water of the

1541
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:47,040
mill race. Athletic events were another

1542
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:50,159
favorite pastime. Farmers organized

1543
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:52,960
races down long field paths to test

1544
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:54,880
their stamina, or they'd gather on open

1545
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:58,239
land to see who could throw a heavy

1546
01:13:54,880 --> 01:14:01,520
stone the farthest. Archery was both a

1547
01:13:58,239 --> 01:14:04,159
hobby and a serious skill. Practicing

1548
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:08,719
with long bows was essential, whether

1549
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:11,120
for hunting or for village contests.

1550
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:13,440
Religion played a huge role in village

1551
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:16,640
life, and processions were a regular

1552
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:18,320
part of the year. On feast days,

1553
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:21,440
villagers would walk through the

1554
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:24,400
village, passing wayside shrines,

1555
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:26,880
chapels, and the rectory.

1556
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:29,760
Many villages had small pilgrimage sites

1557
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:31,840
with merry chapels or statues of saints,

1558
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:34,239
and these became yearly pilgrimage

1559
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:36,960
destinations. Even though these trips

1560
01:14:34,239 --> 01:14:40,800
took time, they were an important mix of

1561
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:43,840
spiritual devotion and social bonding. A

1562
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:45,920
famous painting by Peter Bugal the Elder

1563
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:48,320
around 1568

1564
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:50,800
shows a village festival packed with

1565
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:54,159
people. You can see villagers drinking

1566
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:57,600
wine, dancing, performing sword dances,

1567
01:14:54,159 --> 01:15:00,719
or shooting crossbows all in one lively

1568
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:03,199
scene. A night fights a dragon-shaped

1569
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:05,120
wagon while the local shooting club

1570
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:08,480
practices by the windmill in the

1571
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:10,960
background. Drums, bag pipes, and

1572
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:13,600
trumpets filled the air, reminding us

1573
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:16,080
that fun and folklore were not limited

1574
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:18,239
to city life.

1575
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:20,000
Sometimes villages even competed with

1576
01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:22,719
their neighbors to see who could throw

1577
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:24,480
the most impressive festival. Behind the

1578
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:26,480
big banner, you'd spot the village

1579
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:28,560
tavern with its carved bottle sign on

1580
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:31,440
the gable, marking the connection to

1581
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:33,520
local wine sellers. The lattis windows

1582
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:36,159
showed that both display and security

1583
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:38,400
mattered. Carnival plays were staged on

1584
01:15:36,159 --> 01:15:40,880
wooden platforms in the village square,

1585
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:43,520
draped in colorful cloth. You'd see

1586
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:45,679
actors dressed as penitants, poking fun

1587
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:48,640
at the clergy or farmers wearing

1588
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:51,679
oversized headbands, humorously mimming

1589
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:53,840
heavy tasks. These shows weren't just

1590
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:56,320
religious. They were also a way for

1591
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:58,480
villagers to express their own identity

1592
01:15:56,320 --> 01:16:01,920
and humor.

1593
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:04,080
Sword dances stood as a status symbol.

1594
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:06,080
Carrying a sword in the village signaled

1595
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:08,800
that you were free, not bound to

1596
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:11,040
servitude. And these dances where a

1597
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:13,760
farmer stroed through the village to the

1598
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:16,960
beat of drums and flutes were part of

1599
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:19,520
the village's ritual memory. Even if

1600
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:22,000
actual peasant warfare had mostly faded

1601
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:24,880
by the late middle ages, the symbolism

1602
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:27,760
remained strong. Shooting guilds

1603
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:29,760
required years of practice. While city

1604
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:32,320
guilds had their own shooting halls by

1605
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:35,360
the 14th century, village marksmen

1606
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:37,520
trained outdoors, often near the mill.

1607
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:40,320
The mill's noise covered the sound of

1608
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:42,400
arrows or crossbow bolts, and the tall

1609
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:45,040
structure made it easy to fix target

1610
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:47,520
boards where everyone could see. These

1611
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:49,360
traditions reveal a lively, self-aware

1612
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:52,719
village culture, one where

1613
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:55,440
entertainment, ritual, and social ties

1614
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:57,760
all blended together into a distinct

1615
01:16:55,440 --> 01:17:00,800
rural life.

1616
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:03,600
Even in the long, dark months of winter,

1617
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:06,480
villagers found ways to come together

1618
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:09,120
and celebrate. One of the oldest and

1619
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:12,560
most symbolic traditions was the sword

1620
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:14,960
dance. Well into the 16th century,

1621
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:17,360
farmers who owned their own swords would

1622
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:21,199
gather in the village square, especially

1623
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:24,239
on All Saints Day, St. Martin's Day, or

1624
01:17:21,199 --> 01:17:26,640
right before carnival. These dances

1625
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:30,000
weren't just performances. They were a

1626
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:33,199
proud display of rural dignity, a sign

1627
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:35,920
that these villagers were free men, not

1628
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:37,760
bound surfs.

1629
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:40,400
Another key gathering spot was the

1630
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:43,679
village windmill. This was where the

1631
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:46,320
local shooting societies would meet.

1632
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:49,360
Every Friday, farmers gathered with

1633
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:52,159
their crossbows, long bows, or even

1634
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:55,679
early firearms to practice shooting at

1635
01:17:52,159 --> 01:17:57,760
targets hung beside the mill. An old

1636
01:17:55,679 --> 01:17:59,920
illustration from the time shows a

1637
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:03,199
village shooter carefully aiming at a

1638
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:05,760
target nailed to the mill's wall, the

1639
01:18:03,199 --> 01:18:07,199
windmill blades turning lazily in the

1640
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:10,320
background.

1641
01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:12,800
These sessions weren't just about skill.

1642
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:14,320
They helped tie the community together,

1643
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:16,719
especially when they led up to the

1644
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:19,280
village shooting festivals.

1645
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:22,159
Those festivals lasted from sunrise to

1646
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:25,199
dusk. The best marksmen were crowned

1647
01:18:22,159 --> 01:18:27,520
with laurel wreaths honored with small

1648
01:18:25,199 --> 01:18:30,560
handcrafted musketss or beautifully

1649
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:33,360
carved arrows as trophies. There was

1650
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:35,840
dancing, wine, keg tossing, and plenty

1651
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:38,320
of local treats like fried bread spread

1652
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:40,880
thick with lard.

1653
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:43,920
In some regions, villages even formed

1654
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:46,080
what were known as tavern guilds. These

1655
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:50,080
groups held certain rights over local

1656
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:52,000
stalls, wells, or pastures. A banner

1657
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:54,480
with the town's emblem would hang

1658
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,400
proudly outside, showing that the

1659
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:58,719
community was self-organized and

1660
01:18:56,400 --> 01:19:01,280
responsible for its members, much like

1661
01:18:58,719 --> 01:19:03,520
the guilds in the cities. And of course,

1662
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:06,719
no village carnival was complete without

1663
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:09,280
masks and disguises. During carnival,

1664
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:12,000
farmers would hide behind simple linen

1665
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:14,719
masks or wear wooden ones that

1666
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:18,560
exaggerated the features of nobles or

1667
01:19:14,719 --> 01:19:22,080
clergy in comical mocking ways.

1668
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:24,480
These handcarved masks, often decorated

1669
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:26,560
with painted strips of fabric, were

1670
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:30,000
central to traditions like the carnival

1671
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:34,840
races or the ritual dragging of straw

1672
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:34,840
figures across the village square.

1673
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:42,719
Chapter 10. The peasant yearly rhythm.

1674
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:45,199
At the end of the farming year, medieval

1675
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:47,920
villagers had a very clear sense of how

1676
01:19:45,199 --> 01:19:50,400
life on the land and in the village had

1677
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:52,640
played out for centuries.

1678
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:54,400
The medieval calendars and illustrated

1679
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:57,199
manuscripts captured this rhythm

1680
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:59,440
beautifully month by month, showing a

1681
01:19:57,199 --> 01:20:03,120
world shaped by seasonal tasks and

1682
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:06,800
rituals. In January and February, people

1683
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:09,440
focused on indoor tasks. Weaving cloth,

1684
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:11,760
making repairs, chopping firewood,

1685
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:14,400
caring for the animals, and trading

1686
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:17,120
timber. March and April brought the

1687
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:19,840
first outdoor work of the year. Fixing

1688
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:22,560
fences, pulling weeds, plowing the

1689
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:25,760
fields for summer crops, reworking

1690
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:29,440
garden beds, sewing seeds, and pushing

1691
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:32,480
animals back out to the pastures.

1692
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:35,679
May was a lighter period with little

1693
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:39,520
fieldwork. Instead, people enjoyed

1694
01:20:35,679 --> 01:20:43,840
dancing, bathing, boating on rivers, and

1695
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:47,120
the first outdoor games of spring. June

1696
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:50,000
was the time for the hay harvest.

1697
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:52,560
Farmers swung their sides across the

1698
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:55,600
lush meadows, stacking the cutg grass

1699
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:58,159
onto wagons, hauling it to the barns and

1700
01:20:55,600 --> 01:21:00,560
tossing it up to the high lofts where it

1701
01:20:58,159 --> 01:21:04,480
would stay dry as winter feed for the

1702
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:07,440
animals. In July and August, the grain

1703
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:09,520
harvest took center stage. Summer crops

1704
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:13,040
like oats and barley were cut with

1705
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:16,080
sickles, threshed, winnowed, sorted, and

1706
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:19,760
carefully stored. It was also the season

1707
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:23,760
for gathering fruit, cherries, plums,

1708
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:26,000
berries, and drying it for winter.

1709
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:28,719
September meant grape harvests in the

1710
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:31,760
wine regions, careful sewing of winter

1711
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:34,400
wheat and rye, and driving pigs into the

1712
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:36,640
oak and beach forests to fatten on

1713
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:39,120
acorns and nuts.

1714
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:41,840
October and November were busy with more

1715
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:44,560
sewing, cattle slaughtering, preserving

1716
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:48,080
food stores, and processing flax into

1717
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:51,440
linen. December was marked by the major

1718
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:54,000
winter event, pig slaughtering. Families

1719
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:57,199
came together to butcher salt, smoke,

1720
01:21:54,000 --> 01:22:01,120
and dry meat into sausages, bacon, and

1721
01:21:57,199 --> 01:22:03,199
hams that would last the cold months.

1722
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:05,920
Villagers gathered at the communal oven

1723
01:22:03,199 --> 01:22:08,159
for bread baking days. While at home,

1724
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:10,800
women and children worked at weaving,

1725
01:22:08,159 --> 01:22:12,480
sewing, patching clothes, and spinning

1726
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:15,360
wool.

1727
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:17,679
This tightly ordered seasonal rhythm

1728
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:20,000
shows how medieval life was deeply

1729
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:23,840
shaped by the cycles of farming,

1730
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:26,800
livestock care, and village cooperation.

1731
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:29,520
From the outside, nobles and clergy saw

1732
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:31,760
peasants as the lowest social rank. But

1733
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:34,639
in truth, there was no such thing as a

1734
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:37,840
simple peasant. Within rural life

1735
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:41,679
existed clear social layers, fulling

1736
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:45,920
farmers, halfholders, cottages, day

1737
01:22:41,679 --> 01:22:50,320
laborers, servants, and maids, all with

1738
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:52,480
distinct roles, rights, and status.

1739
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:54,960
Across all the chapters of this rural

1740
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:58,800
world, it becomes clear that the Middle

1741
01:22:54,960 --> 01:23:01,840
Ages were not an era of dull simplicity.

1742
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:04,239
Farmers practiced complex crafts, worked

1743
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:06,400
in cooperatives, maintained

1744
01:23:04,239 --> 01:23:09,840
sophisticated legal and community

1745
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:12,880
systems, nurtured a rich cultural life,

1746
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:16,080
and sustained a diverse food economy.

1747
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:19,040
Even in times of severe hardship during

1748
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:21,760
famines, pestilence, or environmental

1749
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:24,960
disasters, they showed remarkable

1750
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:27,520
adaptability and resilience.

1751
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:30,080
Agriculture dominated medieval Europe

1752
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:33,040
with around 90% of the population

1753
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:35,440
working the land. Farm production

1754
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:39,600
supported the building of cathedrals,

1755
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:42,080
monasteries, schools, and noble estates,

1756
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:44,960
while technical innovations in the high

1757
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:47,920
middle ages from the heavy plow to the

1758
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:51,040
three field system dramatically

1759
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:53,040
increased yields. Rural settlement

1760
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:55,199
shifted from scattered farms to

1761
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:57,520
permanent villages shaped by the

1762
01:23:55,199 --> 01:23:59,760
memorial system where peasants worked

1763
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:03,040
under the Lord's authority but still

1764
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:05,920
held important communal rights.

1765
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:09,440
Over the centuries, farmers faced cycles

1766
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:11,920
of growth and crisis. The agricultural

1767
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:15,120
boom of the high middle ages gave way to

1768
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:19,040
the crises of the 14th century. soil

1769
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:22,400
exhaustion, flooding, famine, and the

1770
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:25,360
Black Death, which decimated populations

1771
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:27,760
and forced a reshuffleling of labor and

1772
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:30,639
landholding systems.

1773
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:33,679
Yet through it all, rural families

1774
01:24:30,639 --> 01:24:36,880
remained the backbone of European life.

1775
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:39,600
They raised vegetables, kept animals,

1776
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:42,320
crafted their own tools and clothing,

1777
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:46,320
prepared varied meals, celebrated

1778
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:48,159
festivals, and preserved songs, rituals,

1779
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:51,120
and stories.

1780
01:24:48,159 --> 01:24:53,679
Far from passive or primitive, these

1781
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:57,440
communities demonstrated a deep and

1782
01:24:53,679 --> 01:25:01,040
lasting ability to organize, innovate,

1783
01:24:57,440 --> 01:25:04,480
and survive. living every year by the

1784
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:08,360
seasons, the soil, and the strength of

1785
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:08,360
the village around them.
