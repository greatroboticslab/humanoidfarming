00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:39,240
distribution now fertilizer application

148
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,440
robots can apply fertilizer directly to

149
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,319
the plants or soil reducing waste and

150
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,479
ensuring that each plant receives the

151
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,960
right amount of

152
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:50,560
nutrients some robots use pneumatic

153
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,840
systems to shoot fertilizer pellets into

154
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,240
the soil While others use Liquid
