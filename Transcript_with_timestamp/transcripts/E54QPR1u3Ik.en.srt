00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:06,660
[Music]

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:08,700
all right well hello everyone

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,519
um I'm here with my colleague Dylan and

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,099
uh we're going to kind of discuss spring

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,320
cover crop forage options you know

6
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:18,900
spring times upon us we're at mid-march

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,640
here uh temperatures are warming up and

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,100
just wanted to kind of talk through some

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,359
options so Dylan Could you um maybe walk

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,619
us through some of the different cover

11
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:27,960
crop mixes that you're putting together

12
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:29,939
for guys right now

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,579
yeah absolutely Nathan I'd be happy to

14
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:33,660
do that so I'll walk you guys I'll walk

15
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,579
everybody through

16
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:39,180
um kind of what I like to put together

17
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:41,040
for a pretty General uh forage mix

18
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:44,640
spring Forge mix you know there's

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,620
certainly different Uh custom mixes we

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,079
can do depending on your situation but

21
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,399
this is a general mix and I like to put

22
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,980
together

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,180
um I would start uh if you want you can

24
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,719
get you can get on our smart mix

25
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,860
calculator at

26
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,379
smartmix.greencoverseat.com I actually

27
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:03,000
utilize this daily because it's a really

28
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:04,979
great quote tool for me to put put

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,740
together quotes just even as a sales rep

30
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:10,200
yeah I have an account already but it'll

31
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:13,140
ask you to start an account and then you

32
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,240
want to go into to start a mix and from

33
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:18,299
here we'll name our mix for this one

34
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:22,020
we'll we'll call it Grandpa's uh East 40

35
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:24,180
for kind of a fun day and uh we'll call

36
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,520
it 40 acres worth

37
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:29,220
we're gonna have no irrigation this is

38
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,960
my this is my hometown zip code you can

39
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,939
put whatever zip code is your hometown

40
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,640
and from there it'll kind of calculate

41
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:37,680
average rainfall for all states

42
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,860
and give you a better idea of what what

43
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,659
species may work better in your area and

44
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,939
we'll go to bagging option for this

45
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,979
we'll put in a tote bag we are not

46
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:49,259
certified organic but if you are you can

47
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:51,240
certainly click yes you have three

48
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:53,280
different options for seating drilled

49
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,040
broadcast and broadcast with

50
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,079
incorporation and incorporation could

51
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,020
mean tillage maybe you're you're

52
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,060
spreading it for cattle to trample in

53
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:06,420
but for this example we're going to do a

54
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,340
drilled cover and I think probably the

55
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,020
next cash crop would be wheat generally

56
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,700
that's what most guys are going to be

57
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,560
getting to after spring forage mix

58
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,140
there's just not enough time to get a

59
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,459
spring cash crop in generally behind one

60
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,080
of these mixes especially if you're

61
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:21,840
grazing it

62
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,300
so we'll leave it at seating today and

63
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,400
just be out there for about two months

64
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,440
there's three different goals you can

65
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,480
select you're only required to select

66
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,000
one and that's what we'll do for now and

67
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,180
we'll just call it supplemental crazy a

68
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,739
lot of these species will will take care

69
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,760
of a lot of goals

70
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:44,160
um just by even focusing on on one goal

71
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,840
um from there uh you'll there you have

72
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,459
the smart mix auto adjust button if this

73
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,220
is your first time I would leave that on

74
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:52,260
I leave it on until I get my species

75
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,720
selected and then I shut it off and and

76
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,760
kind of adjust my my pounds from there

77
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,560
from there you're going to want to add

78
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,980
your species you've got an excellent

79
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,180
good marginal and risky categories

80
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:05,160
uh most generally if you're probably

81
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,140
staying in the excellent to good that's

82
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,940
probably where you need to be as we're

83
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:11,580
looking at legumes my two favorite

84
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:14,420
legumes for a a grazing mix it's going

85
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:16,920
to be spring Forge peas because

86
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:18,780
they're a great protein highly

87
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,300
mycorrhizal very good for the soil

88
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:23,819
really brings those mycorrhizal colonies

89
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:26,400
together and then crimson clover nice

90
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:28,680
Crimson nice Clover that will put on

91
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,180
pretty big leaves and a lot of tons out

92
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,099
there for you

93
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,560
when I look at grasses I look at

94
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:36,300
probably your most common spring spring

95
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,239
grass and that's going to be spring oats

96
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:41,760
again highly hyporizable good tonnage

97
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:43,140
high quality feed and then to kind of

98
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,200
fill in

99
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:51,420
um I like to find some annual rye grass

100
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:54,239
small seed but very leafy very leafy uh

101
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:56,459
texture again high quality forage can

102
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,700
can really bring some tons into that mix

103
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:01,500
and then when I'm selecting brassicas my

104
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,019
go-to is going to be kale and collards

105
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,540
and that's just mainly for their for

106
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:09,180
their Leaf texture very palatable Leaf

107
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:12,360
big leaf a lot of a lot of forage there

108
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,220
for those cattle and probably the two

109
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,699
broad leaves that you could select would

110
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:20,340
be flax or facilia flax cattle aren't

111
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:22,620
really going to touch which is okay

112
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:24,780
um it leaves some it leaves some residue

113
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:28,020
out there for that next cash crop again

114
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:28,020
another product

115
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:34,500
nice puts on a nice blue flower that can

116
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,259
contract beneficial pollinators the

117
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,820
facilia will do that as well if this is

118
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:41,460
going to be a haying option I would not

119
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,620
select flax I would go with facilia flax

120
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,479
you may have some issues with with hay

121
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,740
in that product but with this being a

122
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:48,840
grazing product we're going to select

123
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:51,360
flax

124
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:54,120
so yeah with auto mix adjust button on

125
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,479
it it just Auto adjusts and divides

126
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:00,419
these out evenly to to get close to 125

127
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:02,160
of a full rate so you can see the full

128
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:05,820
rate percentage here if each one is at

129
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,220
18 and that's that number is that number

130
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:10,380
is taking this number here divided by

131
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:13,500
the full rate of if this was planted as

132
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:16,380
a mono so three pounds of crimson clover

133
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:19,500
is 18 and then you can look over here

134
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,500
this gives you the details of the mix

135
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,600
um Acres

136
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:27,660
Acres area what it's going to be bagged

137
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,880
in how you're going to be drilling it or

138
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,520
planting it next cash crop in your

139
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,919
growing period and down here to pounds

140
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,479
and pounds per acre I don't really when

141
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:39,180
I'm making mixes I don't look at this

142
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:42,000
too much I look at the seeds per acre in

143
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:44,699
the seeds per square foot it gives me a

144
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,160
better idea of it helps me visualize

145
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:48,900
better what we're doing and I try to

146
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,360
stick around a million million and a

147
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:54,300
half seeds per acre and I think that

148
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,720
puts you around oh somewhere around 20

149
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:59,699
25 seeds per square foot

150
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,620
and this would be your mix density of of

151
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:03,780
the of the mix

152
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,780
and it can walk you through the full

153
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:08,340
rate of legumes grasses brassicas the

154
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:10,680
weight and the percentage of the seeds

155
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:13,560
so if I'm going to really customize this

156
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,960
mix this is generally a mix that I I put

157
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,600
together two pounds of clover about

158
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:21,000
eight pounds of spring forged peas I'll

159
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:24,180
do two pounds of rye grass and probably

160
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,060
anywhere from 30 to 35 pounds of Hayden

161
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,740
oats you know just depending on on where

162
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,139
you're at and your rainfall environment

163
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:34,680
when it comes to Nebraska's I like a

164
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:36,479
pound and a half of total brassicas so I

165
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,240
do about a pound of collards and a half

166
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,340
pound of kale by flax since it's not

167
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,520
much of a grazer just more of a soil

168
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:45,900
soil beneficiary I I put it about three

169
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,000
pounds

170
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,919
and as you can see that puts us at about

171
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,500
a million and a half seats per acre so

172
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:55,740
probably in a more rain-fed environment

173
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:57,960
irrigated situation this is where I'd be

174
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,120
um I may I may knock some of these down

175
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,360
a little bit just to get that seating

176
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,639
rate down a little bit in a drier area

177
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,500
but that's Nathan that's generally the

178
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:09,600
mix I like to put together any thoughts

179
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,880
or comments yeah I think that's really

180
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,860
good like you said what guys need to

181
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:16,740
consider on those seeding rates you know

182
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:18,960
their fertility their soils the the

183
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,819
moisture situation

184
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,620
um I think that million to million and a

185
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:24,599
half's kind of that sweet spot you you

186
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,099
uh you know the more seeds you put out

187
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:28,740
there likely the more tonnage you're

188
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:30,240
gonna get so but also the more of the

189
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,400
seed mix is going to cost so there's

190
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,020
going to be a trade-off there

191
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,639
um you know a couple other species I

192
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,500
think a lot of guys could or should

193
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:40,039
consider this time of year you know

194
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:42,840
spring barley spring triticale

195
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:44,880
those other cereal options

196
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,460
but I think this is good this is an

197
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:49,800
opportunity to build some soil you know

198
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:51,120
improve organic matter you know provide

199
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,319
that protection

200
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,840
um but also like you said we're

201
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,759
providing forage guys should should

202
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,440
consider you know potential hay mixes

203
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:00,120
you know hay inventories are at some

204
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,500
record lows in a lot of States so we're

205
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,660
coming out of this drought of last year

206
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,919
we have some moisture now you know guys

207
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,599
should look at opportunities to take

208
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:08,639
advantage of some of

209
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:11,220
um some of that moisture and maybe beef

210
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,660
up some hay inventories so yeah I think

211
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:14,400
that's that's really good and hopefully

212
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,319
that's helpful to uh to our customers

213
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,000
out there so thanks for thanks for

214
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,919
walking us through that all right thanks

215
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,160
