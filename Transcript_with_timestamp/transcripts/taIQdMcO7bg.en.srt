00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,880
hi

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,240
this video is about how i set up the 750

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:10,639
grain drill

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:14,080
to drill kern's a perennial wheatgrass

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:16,000
kernsa is a pretty fluffy

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,160
and a tiny grain it's going to get

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
drilled a half inch deep on seven and a

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,160
half inch centers

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,160
and i've got 24 acres

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,800
and there's 411 pounds of

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,800
seed which is 288 pounds of pure live

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,840
seed so that comes out to 17 pounds an

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,239
acre

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,920
that's a pretty tiny amount to put down

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,399
and i and i need to be pretty accurate

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,239
about this because i don't have a lot of

17
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,160
way to get extra seeds so i want to be

18
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,559
as precise as possible this drill

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,000
doesn't do very well on low seed amounts

20
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,320
per acre

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,199
there's an adjustment here

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:57,199
it goes from 0 to 60 which moves the

23
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:58,640
seed cups and opens them and closes them

24
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,359
i ended up

25
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,840
the final setting on this side was at 14

26
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,080
and the other side was 16 in order to

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,760
balance both sides

28
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,600
without the half speed gears that would

29
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,680
have been down at

30
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,439
not even half it would have been six or

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,240
seven and it's really hard to meter it

32
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,600
out

33
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,479
so the first thing i did with the half

34
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,520
speed gears once i had that in i blocked

35
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,000
off

36
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,119
all of the seed cups except for

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,600
four

38
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,840
here is one of them and i put a bag over

39
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,200
each of the four there's one there one

40
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,400
there and then there's two more on the

41
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,400
other side

42
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,079
and then what i would do

43
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,920
at least to get a rough sense of it

44
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,119
first i used the wheat

45
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,799
settings in the book and that was

46
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,560
they suggested i should be down at four

47
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,240
or five but i ended up being at eight or

48
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,320
nine initially

49
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,520
and my initial

50
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,439
uh run on this i ended up with

51
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,680
eight seven eight point seven pounds per

52
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,920
acre so what i would do i would take the

53
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,759
weight of the four bags net

54
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,159
and would weigh them on the scale and i

55
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,200
would i would net them out in here

56
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,600
and

57
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,360
multiply by six there's six

58
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,520
there's 24 rows on this i'm only

59
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,759
monitoring four i'm collecting from four

60
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,160
so multiply that by six

61
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:15,440
and the way i covered the distance at

62
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,520
first was to jack up this rear wheel

63
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,520
underneath here you got to get on this

64
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,760
piece of tube

65
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,120
jack it up and then the book tells you

66
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,360
how many

67
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,760
revolutions equal one acre in this case

68
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,480
it's 363.

69
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,160
i ended up doing 36 and a third spinning

70
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,560
it by hand as fast as i could to

71
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,040
replicate the speed i'd be traveling

72
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,440
i did that two or three times and and

73
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,200
actually i did it once twice

74
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,040
and ended up

75
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,360
first with

76
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,800
i was getting closer and closer i can't

77
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,519
see what this one is here but i ended up

78
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,680
at 14.9 then i bumped it up a little bit

79
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,920
and then finally what i ended up doing

80
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,080
was going out in the field

81
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,879
with all four of these things bagged and

82
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,879
each time you have to reinitialize it

83
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,640
to to make sure there's enough seed in

84
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,239
the tube you know so you're getting a

85
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,239
full shot from the time you start at

86
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,319
zero till the time you end up

87
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,239
but i went out into the field and with

88
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,080
the gps i just

89
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,000
made a line and then i came back and i

90
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,159
monitored that distance

91
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,040
and at the real time speed that i was

92
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:21,480
going and i'm happy with where

93
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,000
that ends up i meant according to this

94
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,400
15.75 pounds per acre and i'd rather be

95
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,640
a little bit under than over

96
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,599
i've also got a loop monitor in here

97
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,599
that

98
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,840
supposedly will keep an eye on things

99
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,680
for me

100
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,720
it seems like a little bit of overkill

101
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,599
but

102
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:43,519
i wanted to

103
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:45,280
do a good job with the rate on this

104
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,210
because there's such a light amount

105
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,640
going down

106
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:52,000
[Music]

107
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:55,200
jacking it up and spinning is no fun

108
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,799
i ended up using a stubby bottle jack

109
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,560
and there's a um

110
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,560
this piece of tube right under here was

111
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,920
right under that tip ideally i would

112
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,879
like to been on the

113
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,640
on the

114
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,120
round tube housing but there was no way

115
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,560
to get under there and cup that

116
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,560
i found one video with a guy used a um

117
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,720
automotive jack with that little cup on

118
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,400
it and he went right under that

119
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,720
that spot right there

120
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,639
so well i'll do the bottle jack on that

121
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,639
it seemed to do okay a few times that i

122
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,000
had it up in the air

123
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,880
and the other thing too with these

124
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,919
drills of course you've got to have

125
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,560
the arm has got to be in the ground

126
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,560
in order for this mechanism to engage so

127
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,360
that these these rocker shafts have got

128
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,440
to be rotated down so i just ended up

129
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,600
opening up the the pressure valve and

130
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:45,919
letting the valves sink down that causes

131
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,479
the shaft back there that black shaft to

132
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,720
rotate 45 degrees and then when that

133
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,479
rotates there's an arm that's bolted to

134
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,560
it right there that comes up here to

135
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,800
this clutch i think it's a what i call

136
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,800
clutch with those two offset plates in

137
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,800
it and then that rotates those so they

138
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,960
line up and then

139
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,479
this outer shaft here driven by a chain

140
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,560
from that back wheel

141
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:09,120
will actually

142
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,479
connect with this shaft over here which

143
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,479
then goes back inside this outer shaft

144
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,400
over to this gearbox and it goes from

145
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:19,120
down here

146
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,960
i'll show you all the work i did i i

147
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,120
the solution i came up with for this

148
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,880
it's just ugly you see i had to cut that

149
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,720
corner out there

150
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,320
because

151
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,240
these are the half speed gears but in

152
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,080
order to get this gear off

153
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,160
that's on that shaft i mentioned that's

154
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,160
got two sides to it that

155
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,360
are you know the internal and external

156
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,520
sleeve so that's being driven over here

157
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,440
by that shaft when those clutch plates

158
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,320
engage and then that drives this bigger

159
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,320
gear which in turn that shaft right

160
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,800
there

161
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,280
i don't think point got too blurry

162
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,199
am i going too fast

163
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,840
well that's the shaft here

164
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,280
the upper shaft for the seat cups

165
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,880
i don't know what's going on with this

166
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,560
camera

167
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,080
i guess i got a time limit or a memory

168
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,880
limit or something

169
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,440
well you're going to get an

170
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,720
impressionistic view thanks for uh

171
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,560
paying attention hopefully this helps

172
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,240
somebody if they got to do kearns uh but

173
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,720
you're going to see i had to chop that

174
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,319
hole there because that spur gear want

175
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,360
me to get it off and just come straight

176
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,880
out

177
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,880
and i ended up using an air hammer to

178
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,720
drive that roll pin out that's in there

179
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,840
that's holding it on the shaft

180
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,600
with a roll pin uh

181
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,880
chisel rope in uh

182
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,199
air hammer

183
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,440
but all in all looking good and here it

184
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,600
is first of september should drill this

185
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,720
and it'll dry out in a day or so

186
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,720
bye for now
