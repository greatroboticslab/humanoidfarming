00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:09,960
revolutionized agriculture that's right

00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,080
around 3,000 BCE the Sumerians developed

00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,759
Advanced plows and irrigation systems

00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,880
that transformed farming the plow a

00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:18,920
crucial invention allowed them to till

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,000
the soil more efficiently increasing

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,920
irrigation systems including canals and

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,960

growth of their civilization and

16
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:40,360
influenced agricultural practices for
