1
00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:10,300
my name is areum young jr. but and I was

2
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:13,059
born here in Christian County in the

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:16,689
Herndon community on the seventh day of

4
00:00:13,059 --> 00:00:18,940
January 1919 when my dad first got the

5
00:00:16,689 --> 00:00:21,130
idea of no-tillage and as I said that

6
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:23,680
was in southern Illinois George McKibben

7
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:26,230
had had the test plot that he saw he

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:30,369
came home and said I think I can do that

9
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:31,869
so he found an old two row mule drawn

10
00:00:30,369 --> 00:00:35,050
planter that was sitting in the fence

11
00:00:31,869 --> 00:00:38,020
row rusting he got the idea of how he

12
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:41,110
could adapt that for no-tillage he took

13
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:43,480
it to a local shop because my

14
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:46,210
grandfather my uncle my dad at that time

15
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,379
didn't even have a welder on the farm so

16
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:49,329
he took it down to the place where

17
00:00:47,379 --> 00:00:52,930
everybody went to get their welding done

18
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:54,399
Rob's shop run by Rob Thomas and he

19
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:57,610
explained to him what he wanted to have

20
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:03,610
done he made it adapted to go underneath

21
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:05,439
a 140 Farmall tractor and Rob Thomas did

22
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:10,270
the welding put it together we mounted

23
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:15,009
it I say we my dad mounted it on the 140

24
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:18,819
and took the chance of his life to go

25
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:21,369
out and actually plant a crop that had

26
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:23,679
not been tilled in any way previous to

27
00:01:21,369 --> 00:01:26,349
that planting and that was the way it

28
00:01:23,679 --> 00:01:28,090
began what does Katherine think of no

29
00:01:26,349 --> 00:01:32,409
tillage on the farm do you have an

30
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:34,569
opinion on no tillage on the yeah no

31
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:36,939
tillage is the way we plant crops with

32
00:01:34,569 --> 00:01:39,159
the planter instead of plowing up the

33
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:41,590
ground we burn it back with chemical and

34
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:43,509
then we put the seed right in the ground

35
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:45,789
without doing anything so it's there is

36
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:49,689
no tillage involved that's why it's

37
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:54,340
called no tillage it is an honor to be

38
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:56,079
part of the lineage just the the

39
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,119
heritage I guess that's an overused word

40
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:01,239
I think when you talk about generational

41
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:03,700
farms but it really is a family

42
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:08,259
tradition one of experimentation and

43
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:10,830
innovation in 1962 their total corn crop

44
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:14,220
was 92 acres

45
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:17,130
he and my uncle and my grandfather at

46
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:19,860
that time farm together right now my son

47
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:24,180
Alexander and I and the other family

48
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:28,460
members and land owners plant about 2300

49
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:33,210
acres of corn 2300 acres of wheat and

50
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:36,900
2300 acres of soybeans so we have in the

51
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:39,570
neighborhood of 4600 acres of land from

52
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,850
which we get those double crop soybeans

53
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:44,790
planted behind tweet so I guess that

54
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:47,120
would be around 69 hundred acres so

55
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,890
that's quite a change quite a quite a

56
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,410
enlargement but you know that's kind of

57
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:54,450
the way things are the farmers have to

58
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:56,990
get bigger in order to support their

59
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:59,400
families it's a very tight economic

60
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:01,590
situation has been up and down for years

61
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,650
and that's some of the reason why we've

62
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:06,900
had expansion our spray program has

63
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:08,820
changed quite a bit over time believe it

64
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,700
or not though one of the standard

65
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:14,970
chemicals that my dad used in 1962

66
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:18,150
atrazine is still with us and it has

67
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:20,880
still been a remarkably good product and

68
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:23,580
very little resistance at least

69
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,380
effective resistance has developed other

70
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:28,080
things have come along that attack

71
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:31,440
different modes of action and I must say

72
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,410
that the the chemical companies have

73
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:38,040
done more to advance no tillage and

74
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:40,170
therefore the saving of topsoil than

75
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,450
just about any other part of the

76
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:45,390
agribusiness community without

77
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:48,570
herbicides without those chemicals no

78
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:51,060
tillage would not work and if no tillage

79
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:52,890
doesn't work then you have the topsoil

80
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,190
which is going to end up in Kentucky

81
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:57,840
going all the way to New Orleans and

82
00:03:55,190 --> 00:04:00,709
forming sediment that increases the

83
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,209
Delta there's always a trade-off in

84
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:05,580
anything that we do you can only be one

85
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:06,750
place at a time you can only go to one

86
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:09,420
church at a time

87
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:11,280
you can only be the member of one family

88
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:15,959
at a time and as far as agriculture goes

89
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:19,049
you can only do one method at a time on

90
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:21,539
any given location whether it's an acre

91
00:04:19,049 --> 00:04:22,670
or a field and that's why I say that

92
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:25,970
it's very

93
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:27,740
or that we understand that if we go back

94
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:30,080
to the time when we till the soil

95
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:33,830
whether you want to do it from organic

96
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,210
production or any other method if you're

97
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:38,210
going to tell the soil you're gonna lose

98
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:40,610
the soil it was proven to be the case

99
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:43,220
before there was no tillage and I think

100
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:45,860
it's still the case you cannot tell the

101
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:47,660
soil without losing the soil no tillage

102
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:50,090
it's the best thing I know of at the

103
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,560
moment it may not be perfect but it's

104
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:54,020
the best thing I know of at the moment

105
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,520
to keep the soil where it belongs and

106
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,310
that's right here on the family farm

107
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,200
well it's a great act of conservation

108
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:03,680
the conservation of the soil the

109
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:05,840
preservation of our ecosystem you know

110
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,440
the the breeding of wildlife that comes

111
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:13,250
from no-till farming it's really neat to

112
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:15,620
be part of that tradition no tillage was

113
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:18,740
started as a way to preserve the soil

114
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:20,930
and to conserve the soil to keep it

115
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:23,570
where it where it needs to be which is

116
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:25,730
on the home farm we've seen a lot of

117
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:28,340
improvements in that the sheet erosion

118
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:30,530
is pretty much controlled now even

119
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:33,220
though there is some problem with gully

120
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:35,240
erosion no matter no matter what kind of

121
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,400
practices you use you can have a

122
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:40,370
permanent pasture and you still have

123
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:43,100
some gully erosion but the land itself

124
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:46,370
is improved as the soil organic matter

125
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:48,860
is improved some people nowadays call it

126
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:50,450
carbon sequestration I call it soil

127
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:53,060
organic matter because that's what

128
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:56,090
really allows us to maintain fertility

129
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:59,450
and tilth and productivity in a soil

130
00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:01,850
when I was a child and my dad was first

131
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:04,490
starting this back in the early 1960s an

132
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:07,100
average soil test would be about one and

133
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:09,320
a half percent organic matter we

134
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,330
consistently have three percent or three

135
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,240
and a half percent organic matter now in

136
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:16,400
our soil tests simply because the land

137
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:20,360
has been allowed to accumulate the

138
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:23,420
carbon which is in effect organic matter

139
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:25,550
and that in turn keeps it from washing

140
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:27,350
away as easily it makes it more

141
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,100
productive it keeps the nutrients where

142
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:30,350
they belong

143
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,510
and it doesn't allow things to wash down

144
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:35,120
the river and and cause trouble and

145
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:37,710
pollution the old saying used to be

146
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,889
no-till no crop

147
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:44,560
and that was people who cast aspersions

148
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:45,939
at it to say well if you want to try

149
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,400
that you can but you're not going to get

150
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:50,379
anything out of it well he knew it would

151
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,569
work because he had tried it in fact

152
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:56,080
when dr. Shirley Phillips came down for

153
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:58,270
the very first time to talk to my dad by

154
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,590
his own statement dr. Phillips said he

155
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:02,919
came down to prove that it wouldn't work

156
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:04,629
and he got down here and he checked and

157
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:06,129
he found out that it did work and my

158
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:08,169
goodness we better get on board with

159
00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:10,840
that you know I'd like to sit guaranty

160
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:14,650
that I could see all this opportunity

161
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:17,949
developing and so forth but I was about

162
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:21,159
as reluctant about it no-tillage about

163
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:23,379
as much as anyone at the point in time

164
00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:26,529
in fact I guess I really started out to

165
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:29,409
prove that it wouldn't work and much to

166
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:31,750
my surprise it did so he and my dad

167
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:34,870
became fast friends there were still a

168
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:36,909
lot of skepticism and there still is

169
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:39,460
there still farmers who don't plant

170
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:41,919
their crops no tillage I can't explain

171
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:44,319
why you'd have to ask them but for us

172
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:47,349
it's been good it has proven itself to

173
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,810
be a highly productive highly efficient

174
00:07:47,349 --> 00:07:51,029
way of farming and I'm thankful that he

175
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:54,699
did what he did

176
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:56,770
Shirley and I early on we had worked

177
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:59,860
very closely together in developing no

178
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:03,490
tillage techniques and one day he was

179
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:06,759
coming down and I met him at a country

180
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:09,310
store to get a sandwich and we got to

181
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:11,349
talking and at that time we thought we

182
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:14,259
had amassed enough information that we

183
00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:16,899
could write a book and so we sought of

184
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:18,789
dared each other why don't we why don't

185
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:19,689
we put what we know and what we have

186
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:22,299
been able to learn

187
00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:24,069
research people in other states together

188
00:08:22,299 --> 00:08:28,029
and write a book on no-tillage farming

189
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:30,099
we decided to do it I spoke to a group a

190
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:32,259
few years ago the local Daughters of the

191
00:08:30,099 --> 00:08:34,509
American Revolution about no-till

192
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:36,969
farming and one of the articles I

193
00:08:34,509 --> 00:08:38,769
referenced was a conservation study

194
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:41,050
Wildlife numbers and things that you

195
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:47,709
wouldn't associate with row crop farming

196
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:49,540
they found that the numbers of not

197
00:08:47,709 --> 00:08:51,910
endangered species but species of

198
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:54,670
animals that were thinning were

199
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:58,839
bolstered in a no-till system you have

200
00:08:54,670 --> 00:09:02,410
greater greater life in the soil which

201
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:04,060
attracts birds and things that would be

202
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:06,459
attracted to the worms and the bugs that

203
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:08,949
come into a no-till system and then you

204
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:13,449
have predators that prey on the birds

205
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:16,930
and you just have an increase in that

206
00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:19,720
ecosystem it is really amazing how such

207
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:22,420
a small thing as not working your soil

208
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:25,029
and letting it wash away impacts the

209
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:28,209
whole environment and so to be part of

210
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:31,180
that not just to have a grandfather that

211
00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:33,939
helped pioneer it but to take part in it

212
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:36,639
to use it on the farm it's really an

213
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:39,430
awesome opportunity you know we've been

214
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:43,779
doing cover crops for 50 years our cover

215
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:46,420
crop is called wheat we plant wheat

216
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:48,699
immediately following corn and then we

217
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:51,370
plant beans immediately following the

218
00:09:48,699 --> 00:09:53,709
wheat so the only time that our ground

219
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:56,740
is not covered specifically with a cover

220
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:59,529
crop might be in between the November

221
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:02,350
harvest of the double crop soybeans and

222
00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:05,110
the April planting of the next year's

223
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:09,730
corn crop so we've done cover crops in

224
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:11,879
Western Kentucky Wow for decades I would

225
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:16,180
love to be able to plant cover crops

226
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:19,029
after the soybeans and have something

227
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:21,699
that I can actually harvest and sell

228
00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:24,699
before I plant corn the following spring

229
00:10:21,699 --> 00:10:27,819
I have yet to find that and I have asked

230
00:10:24,699 --> 00:10:30,699
a lot of people about what I can what I

231
00:10:27,819 --> 00:10:32,579
can find to sell they say well you're

232
00:10:30,699 --> 00:10:34,259
you're missing the point John you need

233
00:10:32,579 --> 00:10:36,749
to just plant it for the benefit of the

234
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:37,589
cover crop itself and to some extent

235
00:10:36,749 --> 00:10:39,749
that's true

236
00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:42,179
the land is always better when it has

237
00:10:39,749 --> 00:10:44,730
something green that's growing on it

238
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:47,129
it's just like every bit of Agriculture

239
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:48,929
there's always more to know we don't

240
00:10:47,129 --> 00:10:50,939
know a lot

241
00:10:48,929 --> 00:10:52,739
in fact I'll reference one of my

242
00:10:50,939 --> 00:10:56,189
favorite quotations from one of my

243
00:10:52,739 --> 00:10:57,660
favorite inventors Thomas Edison he said

244
00:10:56,189 --> 00:11:02,339
and I think it's still true we don't

245
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:05,759
know one millionth of 1% of anything

246
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:08,249
there's so much yet to discover and so

247
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:10,649
much yet to develop we just think we

248
00:11:08,249 --> 00:11:12,569
know it all but we really don't God

249
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:15,799
knows it all and we don't know one

250
00:11:12,569 --> 00:11:17,999
millionth of one percent of anything

251
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:20,069
unfortunately we've had a rainy weekend

252
00:11:17,999 --> 00:11:21,989
we cannot plant corn we would love to be

253
00:11:20,069 --> 00:11:24,299
in the corn fields here but instead

254
00:11:21,989 --> 00:11:26,040
we're hulling last season's corn we've

255
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:27,959
got our grain system here we're loading

256
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,199
out a truck it's going to go to our

257
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:34,949
local farmer owned cooperative and

258
00:11:30,199 --> 00:11:38,069
they'll sell it for ethanol for carbon

259
00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:40,129
dioxide and for animal feed and there

260
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:42,600
are other sub markets some of it goes to

261
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:45,929
distilleries some of it goes to hog

262
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,910
houses chicken houses dog food but they

263
00:11:45,929 --> 00:11:50,429
do an excellent job of marketing the

264
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:53,879
owners the farmers commodities that we

265
00:11:50,429 --> 00:11:55,230
deliver you know my dad graduated from

266
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,939
the University of Kentucky with a

267
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:58,829
master's degree and I did my

268
00:11:56,939 --> 00:12:00,989
undergraduate work at the University of

269
00:11:58,829 --> 00:12:02,970
Kentucky and we've had a lot of

270
00:12:00,989 --> 00:12:06,829
communication through the years with the

271
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:09,619
staff at Princeton Experiment Station

272
00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:12,419
dr. Lloyd Murdoch is a good example

273
00:12:09,619 --> 00:12:14,189
Lloyd Murdoch is a man who I would say

274
00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:16,889
if he says something you can take it to

275
00:12:14,189 --> 00:12:19,049
the bank and he has specifically done

276
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:21,449
work with cover crops and I think most

277
00:12:19,049 --> 00:12:24,059
recently on rye grass on a corn soybean

278
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:27,149
rotation and how it has helped alleviate

279
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:29,399
the pain the natural occurring pan in

280
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:33,509
some of our Western Kentucky poorly

281
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:37,019
drained soils I will I would go to them

282
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:40,819
in a heartbeat if I have a problem

283
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:44,220
either with an unknown disease or a soil

284
00:12:40,819 --> 00:12:46,019
fertility question and I'm looking

285
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,350
forward to the expanded Experiment

286
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:49,140
Station

287
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:51,480
at Princeton and I hope they'll prove to

288
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:54,970
be just as efficient and professional as

289
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:59,080
the ones that I've known in the past

290
00:12:54,970 --> 00:13:01,140
[Music]

291
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,140
