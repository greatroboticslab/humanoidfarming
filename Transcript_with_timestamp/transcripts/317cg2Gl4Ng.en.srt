thank you for joining me joh you're

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,519
welcome um first of all I guess do you

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,519
want to tell us a little bit about

12
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:32,120
yourself where you're originally from

13
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:35,600
and a bit about your life

14
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:39,600
story well I was originally a farmer at

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:42,160
chudley and then we eventually sold that

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:46,879
farm and I moved into

17
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:50,480
delone in 1983 I think it was you I was

18
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:53,199
probably there for 2 years and David

19
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:56,120
Cunningham came to see me about the

20
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:58,280
worlding were you qualified or ini

21
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:04,799
qualified I used to do welding on the

22
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:07,439
farm and yes I enjoyed it my ambition

23
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:11,040
was my next world will be better than my

24
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:13,200
last it's a good ambition to have yeah

25
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,080
and over your span of sort of that 20

26
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,000
years did you see a lot of change within

27
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,080
D

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,560
Mage yes and the Machinery was getting

29
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:24,040
bigger and better and was most of your

30
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,200
sort of your building work was it

31
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,840
building new Machinery most of the time

32
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,720
or new Machinery yes I don't think I

33
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,479
ever did a repair

34
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,560
first big roller we built was that big

35
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:38,920
and heavy that we had to put a the

36
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:41,360
friction brake okay under the bra to

37
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,159
stop it from pushing you down Hills

38
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,799
which I think it weighed when it was

39
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:48,200
filled with water it weighed about 9

40
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:50,560
tons and was there a particular piece of

41
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,159
Machinery that you particularly like to

42
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,479
work on something that you were extra

43
00:01:52,159 --> 00:02:00,280
proud of at all or I guess rollers if I

44
00:01:55,479 --> 00:02:01,840
made $200 off yeah 200 wow what is it do

45
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,719
you think that sets them apart within

46
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,320
the industry you know they've got a

47
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:07,399
pretty good reputation is there

48
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:10,599
something the quality of the Machinery

49
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:13,400
yeah yes it have to be speaks for itself

50
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:16,319
really doesn't it well it does

51
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,920
yeah I think nearly every phone R T's

52
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:22,760
got a

53
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:24,879
roller and as far as um you know working

54
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,519
as a bower maker welder do you have any

55
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,160
advice for anybody that is considering

56
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:33,280
it as a career choice or that's a very

57
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,640
good career choice and uh make sure when

58
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,879
they're doing all these things that they

59
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,800
have the the proper safety gear and

60
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:43,120
breathing apparatus and all that sort of

61
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:45,560
thing yeah yeah that's right definitely

62
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,519
rewarding when you can see implements

63
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,959
like this you know out in the padic many

64
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,120
many years after you've built them isn't

65
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:54,000
it and when you drive around the state

66
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,720
you see blue and yellow and when you

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,360
think about the fact that it's 50 years

68
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:03,159
this year for dmate it is yep how does

69
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,200
it sort of make you feel like is it do

70
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:09,220
you feel a sense of pride of being a

71
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:12,379
part of that or oh yes well definitely

72
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,379
