and my clients i also happen to grow a

11
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,000
lot of that medicine

12
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,680
right here in my own backyard so today

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,240
i'm going to take you around my garden

14
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,960
and show you how easy it is to grow your

15
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,720
own medicine

16
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:44,800
in your backyard and how that can

17
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:47,280
benefit you let's get started

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,840
so what are medicinal plants how do you

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,680
use them

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,440
and why would you want to grow them well

21
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,559
medicinal plants can be a lot of things

22
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,879
you would be surprised

23
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,480
at what is classified as medicinal and

24
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,039
this is because the plant's medicine

25
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,840
can be in its seeds it can be in flowers

26
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,879
the leaves

27
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,720
the roots the bark or even the fruit it

28
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,280
can be used for both acute

29
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,360
and chronic conditions for example this

30
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,159
rosemary right here you can use this in

31
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,040
a tea

32
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,880
in order to treat a headache right now

33
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,880
or you can also use other things to

34
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,520
treat migraines over the long term

35
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,560
plant medicine is holistic that means it

36
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,080
treats the whole

37
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,360
self so it does this by supporting major

38
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,520
organ function

39
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:33,119
it restores hormonal imbalances

40
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,119
it also counteracts stress and it takes

41
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,680
mental health into consideration for a

42
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,000
whole

43
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,759
package treatment but you can also use

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,799
it just to help somebody feel better if

45
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,040
they have a cold

46
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,880
or maybe they got bitten by an insect

47
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,880
and plant medicine is really great for

48
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,880
everyone all the way from children

49
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,880
up until the elderly and another great

50
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,720
thing about growing medicinal plants

51
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,000
is that you don't really need a lot of

52
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,079
space when i first

53
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,079
moved here three years ago this bed

54
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,680
right here was the only one i had

55
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,119
and it was all that i needed to provide

56
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,360
for my family's needs

57
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,880
i had some things in the sunny area and

58
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,960
some things in the shady area

59
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,319
and over the course of a few seasons i

60
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,039
was able to

61
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,640
get a well-stocked apothecary in my home

62
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,800
and you can do the same thing

63
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,800
the great thing about herbs is that once

64
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,520
you prepare them properly and store them

65
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,360
properly

66
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,959
they can last for several months up to

67
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,319
several years depending on what

68
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,640
preparation you use

69
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,319
and so you can go collecting little by

70
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,239
little if you have a small space

71
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,239
and medicinal plants are great to grow

72
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,840
because they're hardy survivors and they

73
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,000
often grow like weeds

74
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,360
in fact even if you aren't growing

75
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,360
anything in your garden yet

76
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,120
you might already be growing medicine if

77
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,680
your yard is full of weeds

78
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,720
in one of rob's recent videos he talks

79
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,879
about 11

80
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,640
edibles that you can find growing wild

81
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,239
around your garden or yard

82
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,080
and a lot of the edibles that he

83
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,360
mentions in that video are also wild

84
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,840
medicinals

85
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,640
so it's all about looking at your land

86
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,000
as he says

87
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,400
and looking at it from a different

88
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,319
perspective so right here for example i

89
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,200
have some spanish needle

90
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,120
so this is a wild edible that grows all

91
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,519
over the place here in florida

92
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,239
but also you can use the flowers in a

93
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,480
tea

94
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,080
for cough so this is a really great way

95
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,360
for you to look at your yarn from a

96
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,360
different perspective

97
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,200
and see what medicine you might already

98
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,640
be growing in your yard and then just

99
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,319
tend to those medicinals

100
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,319
and growing medicinal plants in your

101
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,000
yard is actually very easy

102
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,519
there are some of the least finicky

103
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,760
plants to grow

104
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,920
rob recently put out another video

105
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,680
that's a beginner tips

106
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,599
for gardeners to have a successful

107
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,879
garden and if you check that out that's

108
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,840
going to tell you pretty much everything

109
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,840
you need to know

110
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,599
if you apply those to your herbal garden

111
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,200
it should do really really well

112
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,840
but there are a few things that are

113
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,920
unique to growing herbal medicine

114
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,239
so first of all you want to make sure

115
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,640
that you're growing the right variety

116
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,640
so there's a lot of different varieties

117
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,720
of plants for example marigolds

118
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,760
there's a lot of different marigolds

119
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,200
that are just

120
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,040
ornamental and so you might not have the

121
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,439
one that is specifically the

122
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,159
medicinal calendula flower that you're

123
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,159
looking for

124
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,159
so you can have this a sweet basil or

125
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,319
you can also have holy basil or

126
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,400
tosi and so both of these are called

127
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,640
basil both of them have medicinal

128
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,000
properties but they're not the same so

129
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,000
you just have to make sure that you

130
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,759
don't let common names confuse you

131
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,519
and that you're looking at the latin

132
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,320
name to make sure that you're picking

133
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,840
the right species for you one other

134
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,040
thing about growing medicinal plants

135
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,680
that's really important

136
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,800
is knowing when to pick the medicine at

137
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,720
the right time

138
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,000
so for example you might have something

139
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,880
where you're going to pick the leaves in

140
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,919
the spring

141
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,840
and then you're going to pick the

142
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,320
flowers in the summer and then finally

143
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,479
you'll

144
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,560
pick the roots in the fall so you need

145
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,360
to know exactly when to pick what so

146
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,759
that you can

147
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,400
gather your medicine at the most optimal

148
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,040
time

149
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,560
so that it can be properly used so let's

150
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,040
talk prep and storage because that's one

151
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,800
of the

152
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,400
biggest parts of having your own

153
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,440
medicinal plants in your backyard is

154
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,479
using them

155
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,520
so you can use things fresh that's fine

156
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:03,440
fresh is great for anything that has for

157
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,199
example a soup or a tea

158
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,039
a poultice or a compress anything like

159
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,800
that would be great to use

160
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,360
fresh herbs with them you can also

161
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,280
freeze your herbs to use in teas or to

162
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,479
do medicinal soups i like to blend the

163
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,160
herbs with garlic

164
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,520
and use that in a medicinal soup that's

165
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,199
really great

166
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,199
but for the other things like oils and

167
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,080
tinctures and vinegars you're going to

168
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,240
want to have

169
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,520
your herbs dried and you can do this in

170
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,360
a few different ways

171
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,120
you can do little bundles uh you can

172
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,479
dry the flowers and just put them face

173
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,960
down and you can

174
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,320
just hang them up or you know i have

175
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,120
something like this

176
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,720
where i just lay the flowers inside and

177
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,840
have them dry and the main thing is you

178
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,039
just want to make sure to keep the

179
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,960
bundle small

180
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,400
and to keep a lot of space in between

181
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,600
the flowers to promote good air

182
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,759
circulation

183
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,720
and also make sure that it's in a warm

184
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,120
dry place

185
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,400
that doesn't have a lot of humidity and

186
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,600
after a few days

187
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,960
you want to check on your things

188
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,160
depending where you live how long it

189
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,880
takes to dry then

190
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,800
you want to take them down and put them

191
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,560
into containers like this and label them

192
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,400
and also preferably put a date on them

193
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,360
so you can use them within their optimal

194
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,199
time frame

195
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,720
and then once they're dried like this

196
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,520
you can put them together with

197
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,560
oil or even with say alcohol like i've

198
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,720
done here

199
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,680
and you can make medicinal oils you put

200
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,280
the herbs in

201
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,759
with the oil and you let them sit for

202
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,000
about a month shaking them once a day

203
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,360
and then you would strain out the herbs

204
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,080
and you'll be left with something like

205
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,639
this

206
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,120
that you can use you can use this as is

207
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,800
or

208
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,280
you can use this to create butters or

209
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,520
balms or salads or things like that

210
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,960
then you also for the tinctures this is

211
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,759
really good because this is made with

212
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,759
alcohol

213
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,840
and so these last a really really long

214
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,639
time so it's a really great way to build

215
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,919
your

216
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,800
home medicine cabinet it also packs a

217
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,599
lot of

218
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,960
medicine in a really small amount so if

219
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,360
you have somebody that

220
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,479
doesn't like the way it tastes then this

221
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,039
is really great to mix

222
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,639
into a glass of water or maybe even hide

223
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,560
it in a smoothie that's a really great

224
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,599
option too

225
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,800
and it's also long lasting like i said

226
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,000
so you can make these uh tinctures and

227
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,440
then they can last you for

228
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,599
many years so i hope that this has given

229
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,039
you some inspiration to get started on

230
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,120
growing medicinal plants

231
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,930
in your own backyard and i'm really

232
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:28,840
excited to hear if you'll give this a

233
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:31,840
