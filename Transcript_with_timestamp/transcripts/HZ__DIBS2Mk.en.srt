1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,130
all right thank you done and I

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,470
appreciate Doug really introducing this

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,960
because we went from someone who's

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,849
directly into production Doug who's got

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,620
the extension background but what I

6
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:17,039
really appreciate is that he introduced

7
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:19,500
the idea of looking at the digestible

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,080
matter how the animal itself functions

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,080
and using that to inform what we're

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,090
going to be seeing in the Muar the

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,740
reason I say that is in my position here

12
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,179
at Carleton state I'm actually at

13
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,730
Hamilton Trish missed even though I do

14
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:35,640
have background in crop science of soil

15
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:38,430
science my primary function is as an

16
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,309
animal nutritionist so my talk on manure

17
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:45,570
comes from my training and nutrition but

18
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:47,160
then also a look at what happens within

19
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,309
the animal and how's that going to

20
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:53,579
inform the rest of this so my experience

21
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:56,760
of service comes from research I did one

22
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:58,800
on cattle but to coming up with a book

23
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,680
chapter talking about small ruminants

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,899
and other room animals and their manure

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,060
production for a book that the crop

26
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:09,630
science aside is about to release on

27
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,490
animal manure first one really introduce

28
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,170
you to the extent of management when it

29
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,659
comes to these animals the best

30
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:18,330
information out there when it comes to

31
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:21,330
what is it like to raise deer or rain

32
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:23,670
servants as a life subspecies comes out

33
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,770
of Texas a meal when they put together

34
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,869
of that publication we were looking at

35
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,210
about seventy eight hundred deer farms

36
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:32,159
across the United States and they

37
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,020
certainly had several the big four that

38
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,060
they discussed though or the

39
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,460
white-tailed deer the L the fallow deer

40
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,320
and the red deer and there's some

41
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,320
different management considerations that

42
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,509
go along with that now before it just

43
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,460
sounds like you know I'm using Texas A&M

44
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:49,799
betta I'm living in Texas before that

45
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,360
sounds like a Texas talk yes

46
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,549
if we look at the map the largest

47
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,890
concentration of farms do exist in the

48
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:57,659
state of Texas but it's not an isolated

49
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,130
incident if we look at the second-most

50
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,320
we've got to go over to the East Coast

51
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,790
you look at Pennsylvania and then

52
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,009
third-most we end up going up the

53
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,469
Minnesota so it is really more of a

54
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:10,920
national consideration not just an

55
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:12,660
isolated incident now one thing I'll

56
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,670
tell you is to wrap your head around

57
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,290
this you've got to

58
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:19,910
imagine what this farm looks like I'm

59
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:21,650
very much like Aaron some of the others

60
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,750
most of my background is in your more

61
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:26,959
traditional livestock so I imagine a

62
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:29,060
beef cattle operation but you have to

63
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,860
kind of change that imagination a little

64
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,750
bit when it comes to looking at the

65
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:35,840
raising of beer and of the other

66
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:39,650
servants usually we're dealing with very

67
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,569
small concentrations of animals with the

68
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:43,280
exception of fallow deer of you're going

69
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:45,019
to be split in roughly thirds you're

70
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,600
going to have a third of your population

71
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:49,340
dedicated bumail a third to the female

72
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,739
and a third to the offspring

73
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,630
balladeer a little different and what I

74
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:56,540
tribute this to is just the size of the

75
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:59,630
animal it's easier to have a lot more

76
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:01,580
animals existing but if you compare this

77
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:03,920
to most of our other livestock species

78
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:05,660
that's not a really big operation that

79
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,600
we're looking at in terms of the male so

80
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:09,739
it is a much different scenario and a

81
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,080
lot of that's got to deal with

82
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:15,230
management versus our other livestock

83
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,510
species if we take that management

84
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:19,190
operation so we take that idea of

85
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:22,310
management and try to translate it

86
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:24,700
moving into the farming characteristics

87
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:27,140
and then even into the animal manure

88
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:29,209
there are certain costs that are just

89
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,859
going to exist and we can take it from

90
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:33,019
the economics all the way down to the

91
00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:34,130
manure if you look at this ikanai and

92
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:36,859
breakdown that came from that

93
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:39,350
publication about 40% of your costs are

94
00:03:36,859 --> 00:03:42,790
going to be sunk in the capital 40%

95
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:42,790
operational there's not

96
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,580
I'm really much you're going to

97
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:48,080
categories like I said my background is

98
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:51,950
in nutrition so the one that I tend to

99
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:54,350
pay attention to its feed feed cost in

100
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:57,680
my view are the one thing that you can

101
00:03:54,350 --> 00:04:00,170
look at that is a variable is something

102
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,470
that can be changed that you can look at

103
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:05,000
and it's going to more likely inform

104
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:09,800
what you're looking at on the manure

105
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,020
side again it would picture this

106
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:14,630
comparing it to other livestock we would

107
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:16,820
expect that farming of deer or farming

108
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:18,980
of servants would be more related to a

109
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:21,680
very extensive operation we will be

110
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:23,540
looking at wide open spaces this is

111
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,790
where I'm going to directly kind of be

112
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:27,440
your back cattle just like you have

113
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:29,450
cattle if you imagine the cow calf

114
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,180
scenario where you have more extensive

115
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:34,460
pastures where you got them roam more

116
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:37,070
freely freely and on time more of a

117
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:40,160
grazing type scenario that does exist

118
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:42,920
that's going to be more on the sporting

119
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,020
side of raising deer if you're looking

120
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,730
at the breeding side so just like our

121
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,980
other two presentations especially

122
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:51,200
alligators where you have the breeding

123
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:52,670
versus the raising the breeding

124
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,410
operations are going to look more like a

125
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:56,930
confined operation so we're going to be

126
00:04:54,410 --> 00:05:01,669
imagining more of our bullet test or our

127
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:02,990
feedlot scenario now what are the

128
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:05,300
particulars when it comes to the

129
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:08,000
individual species well it really

130
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:10,460
depends on the mindset if you look at

131
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,830
the mindset when it comes to raising red

132
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:15,169
deer or elk the primary reason that

133
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:17,720
these animals are raised has to do with

134
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:19,520
a consumer demand for healthy meat

135
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,040
alternatives and when I say healthy

136
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,220
understand that I'm saying a consumer

137
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:29,380
demand for a leaner meat source a leaner

138
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:32,419
meat source compared to beef let's say

139
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:34,310
when you're looking at these animals the

140
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:36,740
other thing to consider and it's with

141
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:39,460
all of these species these species are

142
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:42,350
suited to land that we can't necessarily

143
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:45,560
attribute to directly to crop production

144
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:47,990
or even to raising our other livestock

145
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:50,150
species and that's because these animals

146
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,740
are considered to be browsers if we

147
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:53,930
classify our eminent animals and

148
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,760
classify these of browsers that means

149
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:57,289
that they survive on marginal land

150
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,669
they're able to consume

151
00:05:57,289 --> 00:06:00,379
things that we would not feed their

152
00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:02,779
other livestock I'm not going to send

153
00:06:00,379 --> 00:06:04,789
cattle out expect them to browse all

154
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:07,969
leaves off of trees or bark off trees

155
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:10,430
where these animals would so their

156
00:06:07,969 --> 00:06:12,080
suitability for marginal land really

157
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:14,389
sets the most refer from some of those

158
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:18,349
key areas where we can't get a lot of

159
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:20,360
other agricultural production we shift

160
00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:22,099
our mindset a little bit when it comes

161
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,319
to the white-tailed deer and that's

162
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:27,199
because the whitetail is not so much a

163
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,990
focus on healthy meat offer news but

164
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,180
more a focus on the sporting aspect

165
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,919
we're looking at operation of hunting

166
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,959
rancher so we've got some ranches that

167
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,999
are going to focus solely on breeding

168
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:40,219
those animals selecting four of the

169
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:41,749
marketable characteristics and then

170
00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:44,449
we're going to have operations that are

171
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:46,939
just going to focus on trying to market

172
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:50,180
them to the consumer so marketing guided

173
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:51,889
hunts now I've spent a lot of time

174
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,779
talking about management

175
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:56,209
it sounds like I'm teaching a production

176
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:57,680
class of deer and that's really not

177
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:59,360
where I'm going I want to set you in

178
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,149
that mindset of what's happening on

179
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,830
these operations because as we look at

180
00:07:02,149 --> 00:07:06,139
raising the animal that's going to

181
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:08,419
inform what happens with the manure and

182
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:10,490
this is where I get them uh point that

183
00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:13,729
expression of the manure nutrients is

184
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:16,969
going to revolve around two things two

185
00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:19,249
identifiable things that we can look at

186
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:21,409
and that we can change what is going to

187
00:07:19,249 --> 00:07:24,199
be diet composition and the other is

188
00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:26,180
diet digestibility those are both things

189
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:28,759
that we can control when it comes to

190
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:31,699
raising these animals because as we

191
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:35,899
shift that composition so will we shift

192
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:38,240
that digestibility putting together data

193
00:07:35,899 --> 00:07:40,789
for this we start to look at what is

194
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,319
typical of these animals and I'm going

195
00:07:40,789 --> 00:07:44,749
to split them out just like I hit on the

196
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,939
management side and talk about the red

197
00:07:44,749 --> 00:07:49,369
deer and the elk versus the white-tailed

198
00:07:46,939 --> 00:07:51,680
deer if we look at the red deer and elk

199
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:53,269
we're looking at their intake and

200
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,649
they're going to be consuming somewhere

201
00:07:53,269 --> 00:07:57,110
around five percent of their body weight

202
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:59,839
a day although while they're consuming

203
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:01,819
of that five percent about half of it is

204
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:05,059
going to be digestible so we focus

205
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:07,519
really on these two numbers and then

206
00:08:05,059 --> 00:08:09,949
when it comes to what we're concerned

207
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:10,700
about with a manure either on how do we

208
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:12,680
handle that

209
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,480
Anouar or how is it distributed this

210
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,370
becomes our other big one we're looking

211
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:19,880
at what's the digestibility of crude

212
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:21,740
protein than that maneuver so instead of

213
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,210
just throwing some numbers at you I want

214
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:25,580
to give you an illustration let's go

215
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:27,650
through an example let's say that we're

216
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:30,350
working with Red Deer we're going to

217
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:33,350
assume that that deer weighs about 440

218
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:36,140
pounds all right I said the first thing

219
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:37,430
that we could effect was the diet so

220
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:40,010
we're gonna look at the forage they

221
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:43,100
consume while we're I told you about how

222
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:45,380
much they consume so of this we say that

223
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:48,800
that 440 pound animal is going to

224
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:50,330
consume 6.2 pounds of dry matter now if

225
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,860
we're looking at fresh forage that's

226
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,870
going to be about 13 pounds of fresh

227
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:55,340
forage but when we're looking at all

228
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:58,520
this we've got to stay on the dry matter

229
00:08:55,340 --> 00:09:00,760
number to keep things eat if we take

230
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:03,650
that then and look at the digestibility

231
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,780
our little poop emoji tells us that we

232
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:08,420
end up with two point nine pounds of dry

233
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:11,380
matter in the feces that's just giving

234
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:15,680
an expression of that 52% by disability

235
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:18,110
so this is per animal per day if we're

236
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,760
dealing with a confined operation that

237
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:22,040
could tend to build up over time if

238
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,050
we're looking at extensive operation so

239
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,420
more of a pasture based system that's

240
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:28,610
not as big of a concern but let's look

241
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:31,250
more into the characteristics of that

242
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,990
manure let's say that the forage that

243
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,670
they're consuming this is marginal land

244
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:36,920
so we're going to be low crude protein

245
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:40,190
we're going to be under 8% so by seven

246
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:43,010
and a half percent we then know with the

247
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:44,840
crude protein digestibility that manure

248
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:46,970
is going to come out we've got point

249
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:50,480
three one pounds of crude protein makes

250
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:52,310
it through the animal into the manure so

251
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,170
we can now characterize that manure that

252
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:56,510
maneuver is now going to be 1.6 percent

253
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:58,250
nitrogen and that's going to be a very

254
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:00,020
similar to a lot of our livestock

255
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:02,570
species where we already use their

256
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:03,830
manures it's fertilizer the difference

257
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:06,140
is going to be that we're dealing with a

258
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:07,820
much drier maneuver and with a being

259
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:09,910
much drier that gives us a lot of

260
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:11,900
opportunity if this maneuver is

261
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:13,430
collected so if we're in the breeding

262
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,990
operations where the examples are in

263
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:18,200
confinement that gives us a lot of

264
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:20,000
opportunity that can exist there the

265
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,790
reason I go through all of this I don't

266
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,010
want to give you some comparisons

267
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:26,080
it depends but it's not a servant

268
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:28,060
operation what you're doing if we look

269
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:30,490
at the white-tailed deer we've got a

270
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:32,350
completely different scenario their

271
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:34,630
intake is roughly the same we're within

272
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:36,940
a half percent of body weight or 0.8

273
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:38,680
percent of body weight digestibility

274
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:41,350
roughly the same so I wouldn't consider

275
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,600
these two numbers to be that unusual

276
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:44,980
those are nearly consistent across the

277
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,170
board when it comes to serving a

278
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,610
livestock what I want to point out

279
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:51,460
though is the crude protein

280
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:53,020
digestibility research that has been

281
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,820
done on these species on the feeding

282
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:56,680
side shows that white-tailed deer are

283
00:10:54,820 --> 00:11:01,600
much more efficient at nitrogen at

284
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:05,050
nitrogen utilization so let's go through

285
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:07,120
the same scenario let's take our

286
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:09,820
white-tailed deer at 125 pounds so

287
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,440
smaller animal with it being a smaller

288
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:13,750
animal we already know it's going to

289
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,300
consume less so we're going to cut our

290
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:20,470
consumption down from six pounds to two

291
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:23,080
pounds cut it in 1/3 with that

292
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:26,170
digestibility we end up with one pound

293
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:27,610
dry matter extrusion now this becomes a

294
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:30,280
manageable number whether we're

295
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:32,140
extensive or Ian tenses this is a number

296
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:34,090
that we can deal with and we're not

297
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:35,310
going to have a manure buildup as

298
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:38,080
quickly

299
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:40,540
the interesting thing comes though in

300
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,670
crude protein that same forage that we

301
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:44,890
would have fed the red deer and we would

302
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:47,170
have ended up with a manure that was 1.6

303
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:49,540
percent nitrogen now we've got a manure

304
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:52,840
that's 1 percent nitrogen we're able to

305
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:55,720
use this manure more extensively lower

306
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:57,310
nitrogen concentration yes it means that

307
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,900
you're not getting as much bang for the

308
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:01,330
buck when it comes to manure nutrients

309
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:04,570
but you're also not limited as much on

310
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:06,850
how much can be applied I take you

311
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:08,530
through these calculations because if we

312
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:11,590
look at what's publishing the literature

313
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:12,910
I'm going to echo Doug on this one

314
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:15,580
those'll saying that there's really not

315
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:19,330
much out there on manure characteristics

316
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:21,220
of alligators his was none my talk is

317
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:23,640
not necessarily nothing we did have some

318
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:26,440
but to say it's limited as an understate

319
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,460
there's one thing that Aaron brought up

320
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,630
the other day when she and I were

321
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,460
talking about this there's zero

322
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:32,550
information out there about deer urine

323
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:35,480
and we all know that when

324
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:37,890
comes to the total nutrient management

325
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,360
prospect that urine can have a big

326
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:41,910
impact especially when we talk about

327
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,800
nitrogen relations but if we're just

328
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:45,330
leaving manure characteristics I take

329
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,820
you through that because it illustrates

330
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:49,890
where we're getting these numbers we

331
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:52,290
were able to calculate that one to two

332
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:54,180
percent nitrogen that was going to

333
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:57,120
appear in the manure we were able to

334
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:58,800
account for that load or the high dry

335
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,530
matter percentage low moisture in the

336
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,510
feces so it's just a way to illustrate a

337
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:06,240
time together of that relationship

338
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:12,210
between feeding the animal and managing

339
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:13,980
the app and that concludes my talk on

340
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:17,000
servings I believe now I turn it back

341
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:17,000
over to Aaron
