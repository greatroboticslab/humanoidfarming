  "text": "good afternoon everybody I am very honored and pleased to introduce our seminar speaker for today he's Dr Bert CER that you see here he's our senior scientist in the division and he joined Erie in March uh 2011 but uh before that he was also at eie like many of us here and then returned back in 20111 or 20 yeah 2011 and uh joined our uh irrigated rice breeding now he's leading it and before that I would like to mention that uh he was at the University of Melbourne where he did his PhD and his bachelor's degree with honors and uh from Erie in 2005 to 2006 he went back to Australia and joined Jo the uh primary Industries in uh Department of primary Industries in uh Australia uh and uh became the national program leader of the durum wh uh reading program so uh here at Erie he is leading our irrigated rice reading program and I would like to introduce him as our speaker for today Dr Bert colard his talk uh will be on uh redesigning Eris irrigated breeding program Dr K thank you very much and good afternoon to everyone so I think many of you are aware that there's been an enormous amount of changes happening in the plant reading of genetics and biotechnology division it's probably an understatement because I dare say that there haven't been such dramatic changes in the last 50 years I will tell you this afternoon about just some of those changes particularly concerning the irrigated breeding program so it's too much one Thursday seminar is not enough to talk about all of them and I I will leave some content for my colleagues to uh inform you about in the future but I will specifically talk about the irrigated bre program first we might start with just a little bit of hisory uh I think most of us are aware of that irie has a very illustrious and Rich history it really started in 1966 when ir8 was was developed and released and I think sometimes sobering to remember that at the time Farmers used traditional varieties and typical you know yields were you know several tons per hectare but after this first semi dwarf variety uh yield the yield just shot through the roof it was we're talking 6 to8 tons per hectare and even in some really favorable environments it would you know nearly break 10 tons per hectare so this was truly a revolutionary change in in rice production I had to do some counting to see how many varieties had actually released uh from the irrigated program alone the were 45 or something like that it's sometimes hard to keep track of all of them because sometimes writ is release in different countries with different names but um it's really a credit to the Breeders and the breeding team that really developed all of those varieties so initially from Dr Kush Dr P and the team the the local staff that really spend so many long hard hours in the Sun but it's not the quantity it's really the quality and what I mean by that is uh the some would argue the true measure of how successful the variety is is certainly not you know one doesn't measure how good a breeder is on how many varieties are released it's really what is done with them and I've just selected two varieties which really almost led to the term a new term to be proposed called Mega varieties and I think Dave mckill was the first person to to describe this or you know this this term it it means a variety that's grown on millions of hectares so we're not saying it's just popular it's extremely popular and if you look closely here at this table just for ir36 that was arguably one of the first mega varieties of rice that you know in the Philippines alone it was pushing 4 million hectares but the real Superstar of rice varieties was undoubtedly ir64 and if you just look at the coverage of this single variety alone it is quite staggering just in Indonesia 47 million hectares it's quite remarkable and I'm not aware of any other crop that even comes close for our friends from SS this is probably the bottom line there was a uh an independent assessment done by ACR which is the Australian Center for international agricultural research and they estimated the impact of irrigated varieties in three Southeast Asian countries and that was the bottom line there 1.46 billion doar in terms of the economic benefits per year and they broke it down per country and you can see you can you can read this this report for yourself so it is it's a free uh it's actually downloadable from the ACR website so with that rich history and that quite Grand history in fact some have described ir's irrigated program as the most famous in the world if you and when you consider what the outputs have been that is probably a fair comment so the question you're probably asking is why have we changed things I shall explain but first I'll just keep you in suspense for a bit longer I'll just give you some background which I think is critical for the context of what I will say first point this is like plant reading 101 first point just so you're all on the same page rice breeding takes a long time it's generally accepted here at irie that a typical time to develop a new variety would be about 9 to 10 years so it's a lot of work actually literally is a lot of work the from seaing to harvest there just enormous amount of that operations that are required in the field uh in front of a computer storing seeds and what have you so there's an enormous logistical operation uh those in pbgb know this only too well another point I'd like to emphasize is that by the way this book it's a free irie book which you can Google and I used to basically give it to the particip of the rice breeding course that was the first thing I would encourage them to read it's really the Bible of rice breeding uh I still sometimes refer to it from time to time it's a beautiful textbook um but the thing I'd like to me point out because you may not be able to see it at the back is its publication date 1979 and if one was to look at it you would probably see that little here at irie and that really represents what Asia is on about has changed in in quite a long time so that's the background so why have we changed now I'll explain why the reasons the first one you have to pardon my language if I get a bit too you know uh uh rough but I suppose readers are a bit you know like this I call it the f word that was our main uh our main reason almost overnight because of for cost recovery we had to change our operations okay this just gives you a summary of the amount that was spent actually in 2010 and 2011 full cost recovery wasn't it wasn't implemented so I I basically got the samples that were in our records and did uh a back calculation in our current full cost recovery rates but you can see here that just this is just the trade screening for disease and SE quality alone this does not include our field costs and all of our other labor resource costs that are required and maybe it'll just shed some light that our main funding source in The Last 5 Years From 2009 to 2014 has been the Japan R breeding program and you can see that the the cost of screening alone exceed what we're allocated from that project so reason number one is from the point of view of resources alone I believe we have to change and you'll notice also in 2013 there was no screening done because I had a deficit to carry over for that year I had no money to do anything with for screening anyway that's the first reason I think it's also with acknowledging the funding support from the Japan government for for the Japan right project reason number two there have been tremendous changes within the division as I mentioned just before uh in the last decade and and a half I I think we were something like this uh there was a very big irrigated program and that included the golden rice uh component there was a hybrid rice which is still pretty much the same now and I think we were kind of baseding these tra based rainfed Focus breeding programs and really the stasa program has sort of has just uh has supported those pipelines and there was always some Japonica work that was done 2012 2013 we we were transformed into this I think many of you would be aware of the level of restructuring that's been done uh from our head eroa and what we look like now so I mean it's similar but it is it is certainly different we we've got uh a focus on you know irrigated and rainfed E systems and we've really been divided a lot more into regions as you can see from from this this diagram uh I will also highlight for those of you who may be not aware of it that we've we've also really uh decentralize a lot of our breeding activities as well so for example The Hub as we call it for South Asia and irrigated is located in Hydra but in India and the same is for the rainfed program which I in kumal in in Hy same location and there is also another Hub in Burundi so that's a huge change in terms of just the the way that the breeding uh pipelines as they're called are organized uh many of you are probably aware that uh for example you know there used to be a a drought breeding program there still is that that is certainly going on but uh the way we've been restructured has been focused on generally separating the tra development work or the research work or even some people might call it pre-breeding work from the actual breeding itself and so that's that's been done for most of the traits if not for all of the traits that e was working on so one representation might look something like this that there's still a lot of input they have into the breeding pipelines but they are separated and the way I like to sort of think about it is all of them still flow into the relevant breeding pipeline the variety development pipeline so and as you can imagine some tra teams actually flow into multiple pipelines um so that that's how the structure is but again I'm not going to talk so much about pbgb itself I'm going to talk a focus on the irrigated activities reason number three undoubtedly concerns with just a change of philosophy and I simply mean just new ideas about the best approaches using modern methods using alternative methods and as you saw from the first uh the introduction slide I mean my background is from other crops and I've seen things done completely differently with with cereals like wheat and barley which are very similar to rice but of course they they they're bred in a very different way reason number four is the high demand on e scientists and I I'll I'll actually mention breeders here I I don't think we discussed this much but compared to a typical Nas breeder we have a lot more on our plate we have seed requests we have and just this year alone I mean we're only August right I've had we have our team has had thousands of individual seed requests and it's been quite uh demanding to say the least to fulfill and we're obliged to do so and and we want to do so what e is about but it has been a challenge we have visitors nearly every every week every day of every week we have training courses uh we I've just come back from a mission in Vietnam and I'm still uh burning off the excess food that I ate during that time uh we have all sorts of research activities and I think it's fair to say that I think breeders need to be aware of that and my point is I think there's no harm to simplify methods whenever possible and one thing I always like to give I'm not sure if he's here but I'd like to acknowledge Alan and the inur team for really facilitating those hundreds and thousands of entries that we send to our Nas programs you know every year okay reason number five this is possibly the heart of the redesigning uh activities by this is a figure from I think one of the landmark papers it's a absolute beautiful paper from sheling ping and others here at er and it's quite simple it just basically uh describes what we we refer to as an era experiment so basically you take the varieties from the old the oldest varities that you've got and you include the you know the current and older ones and and you you put all all of those and Benchmark them with the the modern the latest varieties and that's what that was done so so it was published in [Music] 1999 and I think this one here turned out to it was an elite line at the time but it turned out to be PSV RC 52 so that was the that was the data set they had at the time and the bottom line was that they estimated that the rate of genetic gain or yield improvement over time was about 1% per year okay that's that's the first point and if you look at the uh if you read the paper more that translates to about 75 kilog per year per hectare per year just to give you a sort of a reference point based on irie's projections and a lot of other data it is this is believed to be insufficient to meet future demands for Rice so this is this is something a very important take- home message we've actually extended this this experiment as as you saw there are only about 12 varieties in that in the previous one and that was done you know 15 years ago or or even further than that and so what we did this was one of the first things in 2013 we started to basically reassess where we are at this or in 2013 and so we put all of the varieties that included in sheling P's paper including ir8 and we put the latest ones there and we found out that uh I should point out I should have mentioned previous slide that that study was done during the dry season when yields are higher of course but we wanted to test both season this is still ongoing but we've found that perhaps we feel that the estimated rate of genetic gain is actually lower than first projected predicted by Shing P paper and the rate of you can see there's a lot of noise in this in this graph but uh certainly the rate we we certainly believe C for the wet season at least it is lower than what was first uh uh reported by P okay so on the basis of that if you wanted one more reason reason number six is as I said the Japan breing program money was to end this year and we we had to look for an alternative source and the Gates Foundation was interested in uh in some discussions with irie about our new ideas to change that last point the rate improving the rate of genetic gain and so reason number six is really we got money to do to do things differently we did not get money to do things as they were done previously and I think we we've that previous slide shows about 50 nearly 50 years of of our best efforts and the the rate was quite linear it certainly was linear and uh that's as I said we we we at e feel that we need to do do more than that so I'll introduce this new project which we call transforming rice breeding or trb it's it's a Gates Foundation project like many others at the moment uh the total amount is 12 a half million over the 5 years and it's specifically focusing on irrigated uh e irrigated regions uh and it's not specifically our pipeline but it's it's it really supports a lot of transformation activities within the pbgb division itself and I'll I'll elaborate more during that but but certainly more will be said about that uh in the near future uh and just to complete the picture the the focus of this uh research project was was exclusively South Asia namely India and Bangladesh which are priorities for the Gates Foundation okay I'll start by talking about breeding methods and I'll also this is also the most controversial so I think it's a good place to start again plant breeding 101 this is a a simplified version of the pedigree breeding method which has been used for the last 45 50 50 years plus actually in the irrigated breeding program and probably the basis of this is that there is extensive trait selection during the segregating populations that of so the new breeding populations that are developed they green for many traits and combinations of traits at the same time as well Okay so we've got the blast and there there's several there's several variations possible but this is just one one scheme uh so that's that's why it was costly and and even time consuming and resource demanding because there was so much tra screening done and individual lines had to be kept intact in terms of their identity from a single F2 plant what we're trying to do is to use a new approach it's called rapid generation advance or RGA it actually isn't that new it was first reported in the I think it was the 1940s can you believe uh and but it really uh it was adopted by some programs particularly winter Cals made in the 60s and 70s so it's not that new but probably the the bottom line is that you grow plants in these Little Seedling trades at high density with low fertilizer and in fact I think Ricardo I think I'm going to get a prize for the first prop of the year I show R tra I hope you can all see that uh so the features are that yeah you just basically grow plants at a very high density and you stress them you actually impose a mild stress you can see that you know if this was in the field this would be tillering quite extensively but in these small trays where we can find the growth of the plant it tilling is not possible because the plant is stressed and when the plant is stressed we we manipulate the conditions in such a way that it will flour much more early than it would if it was grown in in optimal uh conditions the other point I'd like to emphasize is that in contrast the previous method there is no trait selection during what we call line fixation or line development stage okay so that's uh quite a quite a big difference although as I said this method is not actually that new it's been used in a lot of other breeding programs but it's probably had a limited use in rice but some use in r in okay this is just a before typhoon glender we had a really nice operation in vg9 and it looked something like this uh we had a a two- tiered shelving system so space was our main limitation and you can see probably the the thing I just wanted to highlight by showing you this this short uh video is we've got a lot of plants in this small area that's probably the the take-home message um and from that was in March April uh early this year during one of our first uh rounds it's Joseph bero who I'll say more about him in a moment uh we had about 40,000 lines in what you just saw and that that Greenhouse wasn't even full the equivalent area in the field would take several hectares okay so this is this is currently what we're at um uh we're still doing a lot of optimization because rice is actually not as easy to manipulate as say wheat or barley uh but we're we we've made excellent progress and uh we've got several experiments planned or even some that are ongoing uh and what the idea is is to make this basically a service a full cost recovery service so that other breeders other trait teams can actually use it and our Target is some some sometime in 2015 it really uh as I said spaces our limitation and so new facilities are being are being planned um so we've actually taken a few Guinea PE customers uh and we're seeing how that goes because the the real challenge is the wet season and it's let's hope there were no more typhoons uh this year but but the wet season brings its it's uh you know uh a load of of insects particularly which once they're in Greenhouse can really um wreck some damage and for those customers for for further information uh and if you have any complaints these are the people I'd like you to contact not me uh Joseph and RX will be leading the RGA team and they they've made an excellent uh start to to this this very critical stage of our new uh cross cutting team um and it's it's probably worth pointing out that probably only 18 months ago to two years we had just basically just a concrete area there was nothing we had no no no buckets or we we had nothing so we've come a long way in a short time some of you might have seen this sign um what that's about is well space really was limited and we just thought well would this work in the field and we s well you know why don't we just try it just just stick something in the field so we we literally did that and at first we were thinking well can we just you know basically grow them in the field but the problem as you can imagine is the tillering and the resources the nutrients that the rice plants would have so by keeping them in this tray we we still confine the growth uh and and really we still maintain that that low level of stress on these rice plants and so this started in May this is the first season that we've run it and if you just walk past it I think you would have seen it because it's next to the long-term continuous cropping experiment it really looks like a sort of a Seedling Nursery that's been left to run for too long okay so you can't you can barely notice but the trays are there all this this material has been planted direct seated into trays and just literally stuck in the soil and just yesterday this photo was taken just yesterday afternoon they've just started to harvest that material and because it's direct seated and there's that moderate stress needed for RGA uh I counted the calendar days between seeding to the start of harvest it was 91 days yesterday um and and I think we can tweak this system a lot more how far we go with it I I don't know but certainly in the meantime when we don't have enough space in the green houses especially after the typhoon um I think we'll we'll run with this um we certainly need to tweak the fertilizer and maybe some other you know man but but it's promising and uh again in half of the area which is it's about the total area is something like 400 uh Square met uh we had over 260 that's a predicted amount 260,000 lines in about 200 square meters so it's quite a a really densely packed area and I should have also mentioned that since we are neighbors to the long-term continuous cing experiment we're also are following their their season so they have the dry season the early wet season and the late wet season and just Frankly Speaking I think irie really should be exploiting its capacity for multiple Generations in the field a lot more that's just that's just my sort of two cents worth okay now I'll talk to you about field tries again this is a bit more uh introduction that uh a traditional textbook pedigree breeding method something like this you have the pedigree line stage of pedigree nurseries where you may have 10,000 lines uh tens of thousands of lines and then you have usually what's called an observational yield trial and then a replicated yield trial followed by that uh the oyt is is the stage where we first evaluate lines usually after the lines of what we call a fixed and then after that we go to a multilocation testing scheme can uh just following on what I spoke to about earlier it's implying that there were a lot of other alternative schemes I just thought I'd show you this one this is a a textbook early wheat breeding scheme it's probably a bit hard to read at the back but the take-home messages are the multilocation trials a lot earlier than what we would typically do in rice probably the take-home message and um I learned a lot of tricks from a lot of breeders back in Australia and this this guy in particular uh and he had a completely different philosophy altoe he he would push it up even earlier F3 or F4 actually but sadly he just passed away last month but but he was quite an innovator in Australian week breeding uh cycles and and again just to let you know this is not new information this was published a long time ago de ago I thought I'd show you this so you can see sort of what what's happened to me de since when I was back in Australia I've got a lot more gray hair now and I think I've aged terribly on the inside but I I just wanted to obviously this is not rice uh again in line with the previous philosophy",
