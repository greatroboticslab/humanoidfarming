1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,630
I joined the 1/6 one project just for

2
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:11,849
more information as far as in what else

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,710
there are other options to do and to try

4
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:15,509
something different from being doing the

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,119
same thing for 20 odd years with my

6
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:19,770
father has seen an opportunity to get

7
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:22,199
someone else's opinion and have a

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,519
different perspective on Gronk a quark

9
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,740
machine has been a really good

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,960
experience Shannon's been really open to

11
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,730
the recommendations and he's been keen

12
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,369
to understand why we're doing what we're

13
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:35,579
doing and he's grasp the concepts really

14
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:38,010
well the main specific change that we've

15
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,680
made by being in the project is dropping

16
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,870
nitrogen levels so far it's been really

17
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,030
good haven't had any problems that we've

18
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,280
conceived by dropping nitrogen rates

19
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,500
quite happy looking forward to what's

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,710
going on especially from a financial

21
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,570
point of view as well as anything else

22
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:56,100
we went through what soil samples he had

23
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,980
them and we put together a nutrient

24
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:02,160
programme based on just matching up with

25
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:04,199
the the soils and the nutrients the

26
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,689
nutrient management plane is what we

27
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:09,600
decide on what fertilizer goes on all

28
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:12,090
our crops there we 100% follow what's

29
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,729
been recommended it's very easy to

30
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,320
follow doesn't require us to look any

31
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:18,299
further into because they're all the

32
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,920
rates and everything John's already put

33
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,229
down for us say yeah there's no further

34
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,450
research needed it's all available for

35
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:27,960
us right there and then on the one sheet

36
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:30,570
of paper the success of our p16 one is

37
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,659
really around being our able to tailor

38
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:36,990
the recommendations and present them

39
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:38,130
back to the growers so that they any

40
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,630
doubts about what they're trying to do

41
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,600
is being removed so they can understand

42
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:45,259
the recommendations are suited best

43
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:48,630
practice for their particular farm and

44
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:51,420
then they're quite happy to move forward

45
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:53,159
and put them into place working with

46
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,520
John and using the nutrient management

47
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,560
plan it's just a reassurance from

48
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,570
someone else's opinion and it's he's

49
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,890
been very straightforward and easy to

50
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,020
understand what he's trying to

51
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:07,259
accomplish and the reasons for doing

52
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,819
what we plan on doing so far what I've

53
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:10,440
learned from being in the project that

54
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:12,420
you don't need as

55
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,790
amount of nitrogen as the sponsor

56
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:17,360
thought and after the first year we've

57
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:20,040
had the best crop we've had in 50 years

58
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,510
this project I would highly recommend to

59
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,210
other people that are willing to try and

60
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:28,070
get out there and just for patrol path

61
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:30,750
because yeah well I've seen no

62
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:34,440
repercussions of drawing it in in the

63
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:45,530
bottom line is it saved us money so far

64
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:45,530
