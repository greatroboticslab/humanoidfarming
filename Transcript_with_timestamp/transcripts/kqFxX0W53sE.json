  "text": "folks how we doing today we're going to give you a bit of a pallet fork guide so how to select the right set of pallet forks for your tractor you know little subcompacts a compact a large frame utility a skid steer whatever it is different options different quick attach types fork tine lengths weight capacities all that good stuff so stick around john deere quickitch just has two of these pins one on each side down in the corners sometimes they don't have much weight or when they're brand new they have a little bit of extra paint build up they might not seep the whole way through or only just a swift kick we'll seated on there and once you take a bucket or forks or a push or anything on and off you're gonna wear all the paint off around here those tolerances are pretty tight so um once you wear it in it's normally not an issue at all okay so now we're gonna put the tines on the frame itself and you'll notice along the bottom rail a small little cutout and that's to allow you to actually get the tine onto the frame and then you're going to slide it to the left or to the right okay i'm going to give this a shot see if i can actually use the tractor lower it down to the right angle and pick right up underneath here so i don't have to lift it up of course i could these are the ultralight forks so they're not all that heavy but if you do have a larger set like a standard duty or one of the 4 200 500 pound sets well those are really heavy tines so anyway let's see if this works [Music] all right so i just missed that center slot but you can see the top rails on here so right now it's not fully seated i'm going to give it a quick shift and now it's on we do have our pin that's in the unlocked position so that's going to allow it to slide all the way over we'll just go wherever we want right about here and you can kind of shift it around and you're going to have a little bit of wiggle room all right a little bit of wiggle room is going to be typical for all these this is steel on steel so you have to have some place so that you can freely slide it otherwise you would bind them up all the time you'd never move them you just hate using them so this is just fine to have a little play all right so it's as easy as that you're going to have a quick attach for the john deere or the skid steer depending on your tractor setup we'll get more on that later but we're going to line them up now let you see them all side by side and give you that comparison all right so we got them all lined up in no particular order i got the hydraulic forks these are 5 500 pound frames skid steer quick attach you know you need a hydraulic connection ultra light these are the really popular ones for the subcompacts these are john deere quick attach two thousand pound forks there on the big kubota and then we have our 4 200 pound with a full brick guard forks on the 20 25. now i got to point out those forks are too big for that 20 25 all right that normally goes on my 4720 that i have and previously the 4066r but i don't have that tractor out here right now so it's just holding fork so you can see what they are and you're going to notice these hydraulics aren't hooked up right now i'm having a heck of a 24 hour period right now i um well i'll show you the back of my enclosed trailer i smashed in the top of that that was fantastic i forgot to put a roll bar down so feeling pretty good about that then we have a drone that's about 50 foot up in the trees that we got stuck there earlier today and the heat has expanded the fluid inside of the hydraulics here and we can't get the quick couplers on the hydraulics to show you how these will go in and out hydraulically so this is the second time this has happened to me this spring there's just too much pressure in this side when these sit out in the sun it starts to warm up everything expands in here there's just too much pressure build up and you can bleed these off but that's just you know that's just annoying what i need to do is stop procrastinating and get my hec the hose end chambers hooked up on here that's exactly what they're for is to put on here when you're not using them when they're going to be sitting outside having the heat hit them have them warm up and swell that fluid can expand into the chamber and then go back right into it if it's going to cool down it can easily come off you need to hook it up it prevents these problems from happening because i really had to use these right now i would be up a creek basically so check out the hose end chamber they're relatively inexpensive you can save five percent using code gwt so anyway we're going to keep playing with this see if we can get that hooked up i do have a set of fork extensions that are super handy as well i'm going to show you what those are later on they can go on pretty much any forks that are out here but they'll extend out if you need something really lightweight but just a really long reach you get like a six foot extension on those they're pretty cool so let's start with weight classes on all these and identify what those are so we're gonna have 900 pound on these guys 2 000 pound on the kubota 4 200 way over there on the end and then 5500 now that pound rating is going to be at a load center or a load point that um the little guys here is 21 inches out from the frame so if you measured 21 inches out this way that's where that 900 pound capacity comes into play on all the bigger ones i believe it's going to be 24 inches a little bit further out because more often you're going to be at 48 or 60 inch tines on those and all these forks are are overbuilt all right i think it was like three years ago i put a set of these little guys on my 4066 that i had back in the day and lifted up a huge stack of weight well over 2 000 pounds of them these things i i used them for like a month on that tractor they held up just fine so you guys that ask questions like on your two series tractors like that 2025r or the 2032 2038 your kubota lx 3310 all that those kind of tractors that are really just one step above a subcompact they're gonna work really well on there so why i recommend these lightweight these little guys for those tractors like the subcompacts and the next size up is because of the physical weight of the entire assembly this is going to weigh about 190 200 pounds right in that ballpark the next step up is the standard duty forks those weigh 130 pounds more than what these guys lift so that's 130 pounds of just lifting up the forks that your loader has to do that's taking away from whatever you want to put on the forks whatever you want to put on a pallet or a log or something else that you want to lift so that's a lot of weight that's eaten up for a little loader like this so really weight is a concern on smaller tractors with limited capacity once you have a significant loader capacity weight's really not a concern with the forks you're more concerned about making sure the frame is built rugged and robust and not going to fail on you and so on that note you're going to see that all these forks are hla forks which is up in ontario i've been selling their equipment for a long time their snow pushers are super popular you guys watching if you own hla products i know a lot of you do leave a comment down below and let those other folks watching know just how high quality these products are one big decision you need to make is if you need a jdqa or an ssqa all right john deere quick attach for john deere's skid steer quick attach for kubota's for mahindra's for coyotes for ls for new holland pretty much everything else that's out there but that's not always standard sometimes you do have a pinned on bucket or a goofy type of quick attach and we can order forks to fit those kinds of setups but they are typically going to be an up charge because it's kind of a custom job for hla to do and typically going to be a longer lead time as well all right something else we should discuss before we go any further is safety all right so that's ballast weight so let's have chris back up just a touch tell you more about it so we spend a lot of time talking about safety on this channel and it's because we have a lot of new tractor owners joining the group all the time so it's worth mentioning again that you want to have a lot of counterweight on the backside of your tractor anytime you're using that front end loader here you see we have what's called our hitch hanger so if you have a quick hitch like the spiko you can put these weight brackets on the side still leave your three-point hitch open to hook up an attachment if you want to or if you need additional ballast weight besides say the versa bracket and suitcase weights or a ballast box or another attachment so between these six weights and the hitch hangers you can get up to another 450 pounds of ballast weight if you need it as always we're sponsored by borah wheel spacers they are made in america have a lifetime warranty if your tractor feels tippy side to side especially if you have a cab on it then adding a set of wheel spacers can make a big difference get more information on them at the link down below okay so you may think pallet forks are only good for picking up pallets but i wrote down all sorts of stuff here and if i missed something make sure you let us know but pallet forks are great for moving logs brush piles stacks of anything you have patio furniture used as a hanging mechanism for butchering deer or seeing under a mower deck moving hay bales supporting posts if you're trying to put posts on the ground or you know fence posts or a flagpole hauling posts if you need to move them around large boulders truck caps taking them off of the back of your truck moving heavy appliances the list just goes on and on there's all sorts of uses anytime you want to have a couple of long fingers out there to grab something you can use a set of pallet forks so another decision you have to make is going to be the right time length for you all right and so i think there's too many choices out there personally it's just a lot of inventory to carry you know these six inch increments don't make a whole lot of difference i i sometimes feel like i just need to carry one size for each frame and call it good but we have 42 inch forks on the little guys right now you can get 36 42's 48s i don't carry the 48s at all i probably just need to carry 36 or 42. you don't want the extra length the further out you go with any forks the less lift capacity you have so you do want to keep things closer to the tractor i wouldn't lose sleep over 36 or 42. now you had the same choices 36 42 48 on the 2000 pound frame i typically don't stock the 36s on here either the 42s or the 48s once you get up to the 4200 pound and the 5500 pound and so on it's pretty much 48 54 60 and you can even get into 72 inch tines okay so again typically you want to always keep your load as close to the frame and the in the base of the of the forks as possible the further out you go the less weight you can lift also if you have longer times those are going to of course way more than shorter times too so there's that consideration as well a bigger concern for smaller tractors and larger ones but if you're tight on storage space and of course a shorter fork may work to your advantage so you'll notice there's a different look to these forks probably more from your angle than from mine so the shortest back is going to be on the light guys here and so of course you're saving weight by not having a big tall back it doesn't mean there's no back right you can still see you have a good what 18 20 inches something like that right here to kind of back again so it'd be really challenging for something to fall back over this way i've never had that issue at all now once you get up to the 2000 pound forks you're going to see there's an even taller back so again those lighter duty ones come up to about right here you have an extra i don't know 10 12 inches something like that that's adding more weight but giving you a little bit more protection as well now these are the 4 200 pound forks i want to reiterate they are way too big for this tractor we're just showing them on here just so you can see what they're all about these are for a large compact or even a utility tractor as well these are shown with this optional full brick guard that's what this kind of squared checkered thing is called up here you can get it with or without it's an extra cost to get it with these are 60 inch tines that we have on here too so that's an option as well but a very strong very rugged beefy set of pallet forks that's never gonna fail you and here's a quick look at the 5500 pound set this is without that full brick guard on there so the 5500 and 4200 are pretty similar if you don't want to get that full brick guard a good look at it here now one thing you're not going to see in this video are clamp on forks for your bucket and i am just not a big fan of those we we can sell them but i just choose not to we get a lot of folks that have had a set of those forks and just are sick and tired of them and end up getting a regular set of forks like what you see here but clamp on forks yes they are a lot cheaper all right they're going to clamp onto your bucket to the bottom edge of your bucket and so they can oftentimes become loose and wiggly and wobbly some of them do have a cross brace section as well which can can help but it's also going to push your load point even further out because they're they're clamping on to the front edge that leading edge on your bucket so it's pushing that point way out there there's a likelihood of potentially damaging your bucket or bending the bottom rail of it as well pallet forks i'm telling you they're one of the handiest attachments that you can get for your tractor we sell them all the time and it's just amazing we talked about the uses for them but you're constantly finding ways to use pallet forks even putting your attachments on individual pallets then you can shuffle them around and organize as needed it's just such a handy attachment to have all right so these are the fork extensions i was talking about and we use these things all the time and so easy to put on they're pretty lightweight but they can give you a lot of extra length if you need it in a pinch and you can take them right back off store them pretty easy too but we got these from palletforks.com so i'll post a link to where you can get them through there but they're super easy to put on you can see that that steel loop that's there you just kind of tuck that underneath so it's kind of around the whole time slide it back and you might have a little play right you can use them with wider forks as well but these come in super handy they're pretty cheap i'm sure they've gone up in price because everything does since since we bought them but overall if you're kind of kicking yourself because you wish you would have got longer tines originally up front from wherever you got your forks this could be a cheaper way to get a longer set when you need them in a pinch all right so that's a lot of information to throw you there hopefully you found that helpful again for me i i wouldn't lose a whole lot of sleep about the the tine length and jdqa is for john deere quick attach ssqa for skid steer quick attach you know you can even use these two thousand pound rated forks on a kubota tractor like this one right here you could go up to the 4200 pound you're not gonna see you're not going to realize that benefit for the most part though but if you just really kind of if you're rough on things maybe you want to step it up one notch and go to the 4200 pounds otherwise this set right here is our standard duty set that we sell for anything like your your john deere 3e tractors the 3r the 4 series and then again to the 5 series as well on your kubota's it's going to be like the standard l series the grand l series and then the m series like what you see here and again the ultralights these are where it's at for you small tractor owners and we sell an absolute boatload of these forks ship them all across the country the one thing we get asked a decent amount is can you get them with a receiver that's that's built in you that's welded in here somewhere and hla does not offer that right now now i prefer to hook up trailers to the back side of my tractor so if you're looking at the ballast way we talked about the safety our versa bracket has a built-in two inch receiver okay so the versa bracket is versatile okay it holds suitcase weights for your ballast weight it's got chain grab hooks on there it's got a chainsaw holder it's got the two inch receiver it's quick hitch compatible or hook up right to your three-point hitch so make sure you're setting yourself up right out of the gate alrighty folks that's gonna wrap it for us today hopefully you found this guide helpful if you are looking for a set of forks maybe some ballast weight anything else for your tractor we're happy to help check out goodworkstractors.com we sell and ship all over the country if you enjoyed today's video we'd love to have you tag along hit that subscribe button right down below i want to thank you for taking time out of your day to stop by and until next time stay safe we'll see you soon [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
