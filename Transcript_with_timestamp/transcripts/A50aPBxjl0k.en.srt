1
00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:04,960
what do you think is the most essential

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:10,759
ingredient for plant survival think

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:12,960
about it yes it's water water is

4
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:15,199
essential without water plants wouldn't

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,080
be able to bloom protect fruits or grow

6
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:19,960
seeds they even need to absorb nutrients

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,480
and minerals through their Roots do you

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:27,519
know that 90% of plant's body is made of

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:30,000
water yes and water helps seeds sprout

10
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,599
dissolve nutrients to move them around

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,680
and it even protects the crop from

12
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,399
extreme

13
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:38,800
temperatures and how do we ensure plants

14
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,879
get all this water through irrigation

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,360
now you may ask what is

16
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,960
irrigation simply put irrigation is a

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,360
process of watering crops just watering

18
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,239
crops then why do we need such a fancy

19
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,480
name like irrigation for just watering

20
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,640
crops well it's not just watering crops

21
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,520
it's about watering them at the right

22
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,280
time and in the right amount to help

23
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,640
them grow and stay productive

24
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,400
naturally the next question is what

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,560
determines this right time and right

26
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,759
amount yes what determines the right

27
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,320
time and the right amount depends on few

28
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:16,040
important factors like the type of crop

29
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,840
different plants need different amounts

30
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,200
of water for example Patty needs way

31
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,360
more water than

32
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,560
wheat soil type or the type of soil

33
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,920
matters a lot sandy soil for instance

34
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,560
dries out quickly and needs more free

35
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:36,640
beon watering while clay soils hold

36
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:39,000
water for longer then season hot summer

37
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,040
days means plants lose more water due to

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,439
evaporation and transpiration so they

39
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,560
need extra Care on the other hand during

40
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,399
monsoon nature does most of the watering

41
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,000
for us so the need of irrigation is much

42
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,600
less during

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,159
monsoon so watering crops at the right

44
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,759
time in the right amount based on

45
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:00,320
factors like type of crop soil and

46
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,840
season is what we call irrigation

47
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,039
and without proper irrigation plant can

48
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:08,479
W and let's be honest none of us want

49
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:10,679
our fields and plants to look like this

50
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,080
the next big question is where does

51
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:16,319
irrigation water come from or in other

52
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,640
words what are the sources of water for

53
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,879
irrigation irrigation water can come

54
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,160
from a variety of sources it can be

55
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:27,680
extracted from groundw which is drawn

56
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:30,680
from Wells tube Wells or water spring or

57
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:34,080
it can come from surface water uh like

58
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:36,360
rivers lakes and canals there are also

59
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,159
some pretty Innovative sources such as

60
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,920
non-conventional sources which includes

61
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:45,040
rainwater harvested or treated drainage

62
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:48,040
water which is reused for watering

63
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,519
crops now how exactly is water extracted

64
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,440
from these different sources and

65
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:55,120
diverted to the Farmland well Farmers

66
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,200
usually rely on two main methods the

67
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,480
traditional method and the modern

68
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,400
technique back in the day irrigation

69
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,840
involved all some pretty basic yet

70
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,440
clever techniques these methods were

71
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,680
simple often relying on human or animal

72
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:12,640
effort let's take a quick look at some

73
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,879
of them the first and probably the most

74
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,640
common one is a police system you might

75
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:20,720
have seen this in action before it is

76
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:23,480
where water is lifted using a pulley and

77
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,120
now exactly what is a pulley a pulley is

78
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,680
a mechanical device as you can see here

79
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:31,000
which is designed to reduce the effort

80
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,920
needed to pull something heavy like a

81
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,040
bucket of water from a well as you see

82
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,959
here it's a very smart technique right

83
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,120
yes it

84
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:44,319
is next up we have a rotating chain pump

85
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:47,400
system this system uses a rotating chain

86
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:50,720
to bring water to the surface as you can

87
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:53,159
imagine or as you see in this diagram

88
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,280
the chain rotates and as it does it

89
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:58,280
Scoops up water perhaps from a well or

90
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,360
even a river and bring it to the top

91
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,920
where it's needed from there it is

92
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,760
diverted to the farmland and how is this

93
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:09,319
rotated usually this is again rotated by

94
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:12,000
using a human effort or maybe an animal

95
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:15,280
effort is being used in rotating These

96
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,639
Chains then there is liver system think

97
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,639
of it as like a long lver used to scoop

98
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,360
water it works just like a seesaw

99
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:26,080
balancing the weight of the water on one

100
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,080
side and the effort either Again by

101
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,160
human or animal on the other it is very

102
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:34,520
simple and effective

103
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,880
technique and finally we have Furrow

104
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,440
irrigation which you might have seen

105
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,520
many times where water flows through

106
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,560
these trenes dug in the field these

107
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,000
trenes guide the water directly to the

108
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,440
crops making sure they stay

109
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,680
hydrated while these traditional methods

110
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,600
were cheap and easy to set up they

111
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,199
weren't the most efficient at saving

112
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:58,000
water or covering large

113
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,600
areas but hey they got the job done for

114
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,759
centuries you got to admire

115
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:06,800
simple clever methods they laid the

116
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:09,440
foundation for modern irrigation system

117
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,800
we use today fast forward to today an

118
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,880
irrigation has gone high-tech modern

119
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,880
system focuses on saving water while

120
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:19,080
still getting the job done let explore

121
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,240
two of the methods here the first is a

122
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,400
sprinkler irrigation or a sprinkler

123
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:27,800
system in this method pipes with nozzles

124
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:30,240
spray water like rain over a large area

125
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:33,080
it works well with uneven surfaces

126
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,319
ensuring that every corner gets just the

127
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:38,080
right amount of

128
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:40,800
water now where does the water come from

129
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,960
for the sprinkler system water is pumped

130
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,280
from River well or other sources using a

131
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:49,080
motorized

132
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:52,319
pump next up is drip irrigation and in

133
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:56,360
this method water is directly delivered

134
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:59,280
to the root drop by drop there is no

135
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:02,680
wastage here it's super precise this

136
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:06,720
method is a lifesaver in water scarce

137
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:09,120
areas as it ensures that every drop

138
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,199
counts just like with the sprinkler

139
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,039
irrigation the water is pumped from a

140
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:17,360
river or a well using a motorized pump

141
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,759
so in modern irrigation techniques human

142
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,400
or animal effort has been replaced by

143
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,360
machines like motorized pump these

144
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,360
advancements not only save time and

145
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:30,039
energy but makes irrigation far more

146
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,199
efficient and sustainable

147
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:35,080
so let's quickly summarize so what is

148
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,080
irrigation it's just watering crops at

149
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,479
the right time and in the right amount

150
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:42,759
simple right factors like type of crop

151
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:45,360
soil and season decide how much water is

152
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:47,919
needed and what are the sources of water

153
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,800
in for irrigation irrigation water comes

154
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:53,560
from groundwater like Well Spring tube

155
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,840
Wells Etc surface water like rivers

156
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,560
lakes and canals and then you have some

157
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,960
non-conventional sources like rain water

158
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,000
or even tree heed drainage water now to

159
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,800
distribute this water farmers use

160
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,560
traditional and mod modern methods

161
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,120
traditional methods rely on human or

162
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,240
animal effort and the first one is the

163
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,720
most common type that is a pulley system

164
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,919
which lifts water using a pulley to

165
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,000
reduce

166
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:23,840
effort the second method is a chain pump

167
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,800
method where rotating chain scoop water

168
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,080
to the surface and the third one is a

169
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,199
liver system works like a sea sort of

170
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,879
scoop water

171
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:36,280
water fourth traditional method is fur

172
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:37,319
irrigation where trenches guide water to

173
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,039
the

174
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:42,199
crops traditional methods are cheap and

175
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:45,400
simple but they are not so

176
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:48,879
efficient now the mo modern methods are

177
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:51,800
machine driven and saves a lot of water

178
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:54,639
first one being sprinkler irrigation

179
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:57,680
where pipes spray water like rain

180
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:00,039
perfect for uneven land then you have

181
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,639
drip irrigation where

182
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:07,080
which delivers water drop by drop to the

183
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:09,360
plant roots ideal for water scarse areas

184
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:12,680
both the modern methods use motorized

185
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,479
pump replacing human or animal effort

186
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:19,960
with these techniques farming is faster

187
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:19,960
smarter and way more sustainable
