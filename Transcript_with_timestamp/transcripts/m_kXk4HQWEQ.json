  "text": "hey Geto guys it's Wayne Perkins here we're at the ataga Field Days uh in ataga funny that and it's it's a cloudy day but we're here with the Sol water pump the react pump and um it's pumping well it's done about 22,000 l so far for the day we got two panels set up behind it uh just want to give you a little bit of information about the react pump um it's capable of pumping up to about 10,000 l a day maybe a little bit more depending on what we do with it on and on the height so that's that's a pretty good quantity and it's capable of uh pumping to about 150 M head we can go higher than that but the standard model here will pump up to about 150 M head that's kind of based on the amount of water is based on how high we need to pump it uh few options with it we basically this is the two panel system we can put four panels on it or six panels which basically maximizes the amount of water you can get out of it uh so the the two panel system it'll pump um it'll pump that 150 M head but it's going to struggle on the cloudy days or days that aren't so good uh so with with the four Panel System what we're doing is we we're giving you more water on the good days but we're giving you a lot more water on the bad days we just got a lot more we can grab a lot more power from the sky so hey look if you're interested if you need to get water to your stock on your farm or whatever um you know Keen to have a chat to you just give me a call love to hear from you and we want we want to go through and we want to talk through the process with you we we're going to want to know how high you need to pump the water we're going to want to need know over what distance and on on average per day how much water you need and out of that there we'll start working with you on figuring out whether this pump or one of one of our other pumps uh we'll do the job for you so um if you're in the market for some clock water and you haven't got any electricity give me a call love to hear from you",
