1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:06,000
So, she's learning how to silky plow.

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,880
We're going to follow them around for

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,200
about seven minutes while we also learn

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:15,480
a few things about about the silky

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:18,760
plow. I'm at Tillers International

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:22,080
today, which is a training center for

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:25,080
historic farm skills like the Sulky

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,080
Plow.

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:33,200
Hi, my name is Chuck. The channel is

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:36,239
around Van Beern and today we're talking

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:40,520
about the Sulki plow. They're working a

12
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:43,160
twoacre plot along with other uh

13
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:46,160
volunteer draft horse teams.

14
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:48,960
Today I caught up with Cody in the

15
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,200
Tillers International woodworking shop

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,120
and this is what he told me. How tillers

17
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,120
international started. It was a forum

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,039
for training draft animals. And so that

19
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,719
two acres out there is sort of what ties

20
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,559
everything together. It's where we

21
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,039
practice those historic skills and make

22
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,640
them come alive. People are welcome to

23
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,080
come here and to learn these historic

24
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,360
skills for whatever reason that they

25
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,119
have. Maybe they want to use them on

26
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,720
their own market garden farm or maybe

27
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,040
they just want they're curious and they

28
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,439
want to have the joy of learning.

29
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,799
The sulky plow was invented by the John

30
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,960
Deere company in

31
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:25,080
1875 and since then it's been built by

32
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,080
many other companies.

33
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,079
She's leading the team. Although it

34
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:39,560
seems like the horse on the right is a

35
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,560
leader, too.

36
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,640
Thank you for coming out. I'm Cody. Hey,

37
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,640
Cody. I'm Darren. Darren, I think we met

38
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,200
just Yeah, we have met before, I think.

39
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,119
But yeah,

40
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,240
are you farm manager? Is that what what

41
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,400
is that what you're talking? What do you

42
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,759
do?

43
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,440
[Music]

44
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,879
Okay.

45
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,400
But I hoped uh we have uh a couple of

46
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,440
sections of Ry and then you can see this

47
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,440
hairy bench.

48
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:31,080
Today, one of the manufacturers of sulky

49
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,599
plows is Pioneer

50
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:37,160
Equipment. Another company that makes

51
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:39,760
sulky plows today is White Horse

52
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:44,400
Machine. Here's a picture of one of the

53
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:51,000
the White Horse machine uh sulky plows.

54
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:51,000
It can plow 10 to 12 acres a day.

55
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,080
I was looking online for instructions on

56
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,480
how to use the Sulky plow.

57
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,599
Uh, I've got a link that's uh about as

58
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:29,959
close as I can get, but I think your

59
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:31,920
best bet is to uh sign up with killers

60
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:35,400
international.org for one of their

61
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,400
training sessions.

62
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,640
If you visit um Killers International

63
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,319
outside, it's out of Kazoo,

64
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,959
Michigan, they've got camping and

65
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:58,280
rooming. I don't I don't understand

66
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,519
entirely, but contact them.

67
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,680
Also, in the

68
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:05,840
southeast corner of

69
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:09,400
Kazoo, there's plenty of hotels, and

70
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:13,920
that's a short drive away from

71
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,920
uh Children's International.

72
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:25,280
Other teams are out today practicing

73
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:29,000
their skills and demonstrating draft

74
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,000
animals as well.

75
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:56,720
Oh, blacksmith at Tillers International

76
00:04:52,560 --> 00:05:00,240
is very helpful and uh he explained more

77
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,639
about how things work.

78
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,800
From tiller's program's perspective, we

79
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,960
work with people from other countries

80
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,639
frequently where there's not a dealer

81
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,199
where you can get parts for repairing

82
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,960
your farm equipment. Yeah. So the pieces

83
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,800
sometimes are locally manufactured or

84
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,440
sometimes they're imported from

85
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,720
somewhere else. But if something breaks,

86
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,800
the only way you're getting it fixed is

87
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,320
to go to the village blacksmith just

88
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,199
like they did in this country in the old

89
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:28,080
days. Yeah. And get them to make a new

90
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,400
part or repair the piece you have. And

91
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,280
so sometimes it might be a modern repair

92
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,800
like an arc weld, but it could often be

93
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,160
just done with rivets or bolts or

94
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,080
something involve working in a forge

95
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,680
like this one. Mhm. You're heating the

96
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,320
parts up to bend them around, change the

97
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,240
shape.

98
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:49,639
Okay, good. Thank you. Okay, nice

99
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,639
talking to you.

100
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,240
for their farming program. Tillers

101
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,319
International trains

102
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,039
anyone. Small

103
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:16,520
farms, truck patch

104
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:20,800
farms, subsistence

105
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,800
farmers, homesteaders,

106
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,000
preppers,

107
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,720
self-sufficient

108
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,440
survivalist,

109
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:33,720
off-grid, international

110
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:37,360
farmers, organic

111
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,360
farmers. Who did I

112
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:44,880
miss? The Amish use horsedrawn farm

113
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:47,759
implements like this all the time, but

114
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,759
they grow up with

115
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:04,560
it. For horserawn equipment, teams can

116
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:07,960
consist of two, three, or four horses.

117
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:12,639
The number of horses used depends on the

118
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,639
equipment and the weight that's being

119
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:20,639
pulled. A common setup is two horses

120
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,639
hitched side by

121
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:33,080
side. In this case, we have four horses

122
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,080
hitched side by side.

123
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:41,840
And sometimes the four horse hitch would

124
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:45,000
consist of two teams, one in front of

125
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,000
the other.

126
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:09,440
Early sulky plows like the Oliver turned

127
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:12,360
uh 12, 14 or 16inch furrows and were

128
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:16,800
pulled by three horses or

129
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:20,000
mules. Axle grease reduced friction.

130
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:23,120
Modern silky plows might have a dozen or

131
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,120
more grease

132
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:47,600
fittings. Now we're going to see her in

133
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,600
the driver's seat.

134
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,760
Thanks for watching. Looking forward to

135
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,560
reading your comments about the Sulki

136
00:08:52,760 --> 00:09:00,360
Plow. Be sure to like and subscribe.

137
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,360
I'll see you next time.
