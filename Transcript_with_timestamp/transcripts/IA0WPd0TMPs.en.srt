00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,310
in this video JC talks to us about house

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:07,410
soil health and changing his crop

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:10,349
rotations and introducing animals has

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:12,330
actually made money for JC also talks

5
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:15,120
about infiltration rates which he

6
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:18,270
frequently measures on his pot the

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,029
procedure JC uses is to take a six inch

8
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,160
ring hammer it into the ground and then

9
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:26,609
measure the time it takes for one inch

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:29,039
of water to infiltrate and even if you

11
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:30,689
break even on your small grain when you

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,189
look at the the yield bump you get on

13
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:34,260
your core and your soybean crop after

14
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:35,940
that and and also if your grazing after

15
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,829
your small grain your profitability goes

16
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,329
up even though you broke even the one

17
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:42,020
year you still make more than you would

18
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:45,690
have in the two year rotation so

19
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:47,789
basically here we're in a corn soybean

20
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,260
oat rotation I used to do Rai but the

21
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:51,780
profits kind of come out of Rai in the

22
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,120
last few years now the reason that I

23
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,649
pick oats is we raise it as a seed crop

24
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,170
and then we we started a seed cleaning

25
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:59,940
operation now to where we actually have

26
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,440
an air screen and a gravity table and we

27
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:05,430
clean it and sell it as a clean product

28
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,049
and so oh it's works good for us we what

29
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,630
I really like about the three-year

30
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:11,369
rotation is that since we brought in

31
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,080
this third crop our corn yields have

32
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:16,380
gone corn soybean yields have gone up

33
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,630
significantly within a three-year span

34
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,640
my my soybean yields probably went up

35
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,890
three to five bushel an acre across the

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,250
fire may average and corn ten to twelve

37
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:28,409
I would have to say that's maybe be and

38
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,180
I mean that's right in there and that's

39
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:31,799
pretty they've been pretty consistent

40
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,799
our infiltration rates have increased

41
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,570
and when you raise that oats it also

42
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,670
gives you a chance to diversify your

43
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,500
modes of action your herbicides so the

44
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,619
idea is to try and kind of cut down

45
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:46,439
sand-like waterhemp particularly what I

46
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:48,750
really like about oats is now we have an

47
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,520
opportunity to cover crop in it you know

48
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,930
the Jim and I are putting up fences and

49
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,579
this way we can bring livestock back

50
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,229
into the system is just another factor

51
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:58,140
which is gonna drive that soil health

52
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:59,759
you know I know I had gone to some other

53
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,409
workshops the past they talked about

54
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,909
that our soil doesn't have enough

55
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:04,860
microbes in it and then the best way to

56
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:07,170
bring them back is to bring animals back

57
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,390
on back into the rotation but it adds a

58
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,580
level of profitability so here you're

59
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:14,220
you're raising a third crop that helps

60
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,170
increase all the yields on all three

61
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,850
then you turn around put a cover crop in

62
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,130
it drive soil health and you can graze

63
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:22,470
animals on it then you know build a

64
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:24,750
level of productivity back into that and

65
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:27,260
it kind of works at all in those

66
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:31,080
basically systems approach is what it is

67
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:34,080
cover crops that I like best I guess for

68
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,300
us is would be putting like a riot and a

69
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,370
rapeseed mix in after the oh it's no

70
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,260
tilling beans and a rye is just it's

71
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,400
just you can't believe the difference

72
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,590
between that and just going in this

73
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:48,900
straight for itself

74
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:50,959

75
