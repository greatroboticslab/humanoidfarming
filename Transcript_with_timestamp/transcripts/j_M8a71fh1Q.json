  "text": "[Music] all right so John and I are going to split ours uh up we're going to talk to you a little bit about uh biocurity like you heard um Dr Speer talk we have to step up our biocurity so we really got to think about the things we're going to do and how we're going to uh how we're going to move forward so I'm sure everybody has been doing some thinking on some of the things that you know what are we going to do what what's that Shield going to be that we're going to do on our Farms to really protect us from biocurity and you know when it comes down it comes down to all of you and me we're The Growers we're the ones that make the decision on who comes on our Farms if we don't stop it nobody else is so there might be some unpleasant um situations but we need to deal with those certainly very important so when we're talking about our plan we need to think about really the three things our production site what are the things that we can do in our production site the people coming in and then also um equipment and vehicles so let's talk about our production site what are the some of the things that we can do Dr spe talked about this line this dirty line and this clean line what are some of the things anybody got any ideas of some of the things we can do change your foot change your Footwear right Tina so we can think about from each house a lot of people have Annie rooms some of some people don't have Annie rooms we can put separate shoes from house to house we can put on the little slipon booties uh from house to house we've got the plastic ones uh also so another thing that um we have done on our farm is trying to think of some of the things that we carry in and out we're carrying in and out buckets we're carrying I have chicken picker uppers I call them the regets so we shouldn't be carrying those in and out so we bought I took two buckets per house cleaned them all up disinfected them we lose like a 10% um bleach solution clean them up cleaned up our chicken picker uppers we put up little hooks in our houses they those buckets and those chicken picker up or stay in those houses they're dedicated to that so we're picking up chickens and you know you're driving down with your golf cart or your Gator your tractor whatever you sit one bucket outside the door but when so when you're dumping your dead chickens out you can you're not taking that bucket outside don't let it touch anything outside but you're keeping that kind of that clean and dirty line so I think it's just those type of things that we really need to think about to to take it to that that certainly to that next uh level people my gosh my mother comes over you know she drives right down the bar I'm like Mom you cannot drive down to the barn she's bringing us lunch but you know call us you know we'll we'll come up but you know it's just this re-education of things that we just really don't don't think about the people that come on our farm I had a um grower call me last week and said Jenny I was home for the day and you know she works off the farm she say the electric person came up from the electric company to read the meter you know farmer next door has you know grows for amch one grows for mount air one grows for Allen one grows for Purdue so um they didn't have the smart meters yet so we worked uh don't you know most of you know that I sit on the DPI board also so we d a letter Bill worked on John and I worked on to send out to the Allied Industries to you know let them know there's you know there's this threat of Avan influenza we've got to do everything we can if you got to go to a farm don't drive down to the production area put on your booties you got to go read the meter go read the meter walk back to the truck throw the booties away there so I think those will just be the simple things and we have to be that first um line of defense I just put on our for you between the house and the production area I just turned up some orange um vegetable baskets trying to think now what could I do to stop people and lo and behold I got a phone call from my biocurity sign that had a phone number on it it was a trash man and I forgot because we had told him that we were going to move our trash dumpster up up to the house I really don't want it up to the house cuz it's ugly and I when I pull up my Lane I like the way that it looks so I said well can you he comes back next week I said not this week but next week we'll move it up to the house so that so just those little things that you you know you don't think about so think about those things and then um equipment uh Vehicles think about it John's going to talk a little bit about you know washing equipment um when we talk about equipment one of the most important uh pieces we have what's this how many germs do you think are on this thing where does it go it goes everywhere with us how many people Tak in the chicken house with them so you might want to think about while you're washing your hands before you go in the chicken house keep some disinfectant wipes clean your cell phone or leave it don't take it in and clean it when you get done there's just these little things that we really just really don't uh think about so these are really the absolute things that we just need to think about and the things that we do uh on our Farms no back yard poultry I think we all know that but we just need to say it and let everybody know if you have any neighbors that have backyard poultry the Maryland Department of a has sent out the poultry premise registration just make sure that everybody gets registered so if there is an outbreak that everybody will know uh so I mean we see backyard poultry everywhere you know on Route 213 there's somebody that has backyard poultry and they're on the road half of the time I have a heart attack when I drive past them I have to check to make sure they are registered um but no pet birds the same you know the same thing I think we all we all know a lot of this Dina talked about you know dedicated Footwear I don't care who comes on your farm they either put plastic boots on or they have dedicated Footwear you'll see my grandson a little while he has dedicated Footwear when he comes stays right in the we have call it the man cave that we put our boots on but it's it's a cheap thing that we can do for something that can devastate our industry and devastate each one of us most of us have mortgage payments and um things that we need to pay for so and if you're worried uh somebody's going to wear them off paint them pink paint them purple I don't care do something so someone's not going to take them um off the farm uh we talked about this um unauthorized visitors you know when we're not on our farm we really don't know who's coming up there we really don't if you anything you can do to keep unauthorized visitors and it's hard because we got feed trucks you know coming on our farm we've got people um delivering propane so but like I said it's our job you see that propane coming truck coming up and they haven't disinfected put a little pump up sprayer out there I think most of us now have probably mailboxes up John's going to talk about those you know put a little pump up sprayer out there can hurt so make sure that you do have all the personal uh protective equipment John and I have uh you know the coveralls anybody that's coming up you can put them in your mailbox uh there's all kinds of foot oops Footwear we've got the little cloth things we have little cloth footies we have the plastic ones we have a hair net or headnet also disinfectant wipes oh and then our just our hand hand sanitizer so a lot of things don't forget to get your sign tonight put your phone number on there it worked worked for me just just last week so just some things uh really to think about uh things are going to break down and we're going to have to call one of the poultry stores I call them you know to come fix things so and they're all all are certainly aware but that's our job to check on them you know where you going to make them Park make sure that they've got their protective equipment on make sure you have a place for them to dispose of it when they come on to your farm mortal oh mortality we've got to be doing a good job of composting that's certainly very important because if we don't do a good job of composting then we get all these little critters and we don't need that because that they just spread they just spread disease so some other things to think about educate your employees educate your families people that have um employees same thing you know they need dedicated Footwear dedicated coveralls or clothing something that they they leave on your farm they put it on when they get there between that dirty and clean line think about you know those kind of things washing your hands just very simple basic things we all talk about not the flu you know and colds more you wash your hands certainly the better off you'll be so again just back to those absolute things no backyard poultry we've got to have dedicated clothes dedicated Footwear no unauthorized visitors um personal protective clothing you can buy this I mean all this I'm sure you can get it on Amazon you can go to the you know I call G&M sales and they send it to me that works uh very well and then um also um do a good job with your composting so without these things you really don't have a biocurity plan and you need to talk to talk to your family about it talk to your partner about it you know just different things that we really don't think about oops okay all right so now we're going to go through this we're getting late so I'll try and go through this quickly how's that if you have questions just raise your hand I'll slow down okay some factors to consider you all know where your Farms are located there's things you need to be aware of are you located next to a big pond well if you build a new Farm you have a storm Runner storm water pond so we have that we're kind of making things a little harder for Farmers but we want to be aware we wear an area where there's a lot of water foul who lives next to our farm we need to know who our neighbors are do they have poultry do they have backyard poultry are we located next to a big road I mean there was a farm I saw put on a for Road the other day and I I drive by I can see all the feathers from the live Hall trucks already sucked up into the cool cells so we want to make sure we do it we can to keep our farm safe and if you have any of those things we have to do a little more but things we recommend visitor logs visitor logs are great because then we know if there's anything happens who was on your farm we can start tracing these diseases and find out who we need to really worry about or if somebody brought it on we can start looking and see where this disease went thing about visitor logs is we put them in a mailbox love mailboxes go buy one of the biggest ones you can because then there's lots of room for spiders just joking then you can take and stuff some uh personal protective wear in there you know we can put in some cover all some boots and all that that way if anybody's coming on your farm and you aren't there you can tell them the clothing is there for them and tell them where it's at and these are real easy way to put it on or if you have somebody show up you know where it is it's right there at the entrance to your farm so it makes it real simple to do the other thing is put up a sign do sign stop disease signs no but they stop people it's interesting we've actually had calls lately people ask asking why are we seeing these biocurity signs I think that's great because that means people are noticing that we're worried about our birds and what we're doing it gives us an opportunity to talk to them about why farmers are putting them up and what we need to do to protect our Birds okay at the same place if we're at the same place we're still where we put our mailbox up what about putting a chain or something across the road there to stop people from just driving on in Jenny put up their little cones or upside down uh vegetable baskets that's it go get some soccer cones you can get them at Walmart they're cheap put those across there anything that will stop people from driving on down that way they're thinking uh this again if you have all this I mean he's pulling across the chain but his mailbox is sitting right there so everything is right there for anybody that comes on the farm so he's got it all right there it's not oh well where am I going to look where am I going to find it this is a camera on another farm this way anybody pulls on their Farm they can't see it they live a little ways away around the corner but if I pull on their Farm it takes a picture of me in my vehicle and it sends it to them and they know I'm there great thing about it you know who's on your farm bad thing about it takes pictures of Doe's in the middle of the night I don't think they'd complain if it was a big buck but they were complaining it was a dough locks locks are very important keep things well keep things locked down we do have a lot of crime going on we need to keep people out has anybody paid attention to what happened down in South Carolina last spring and summer you heard about it didn't you 200,000 Birds killed somebody went in and started playing with controllers and everything else we want to make sure we're doing what we can to prevent that from happening here so lock doors lock things up let's see bird exclusion Dr Shiro's talked about this a lot I just want to add this when we Birds go out we often leave our end doors open for days on end and I see it all the time maybe we need to shut them if we're not working in there just shut the doors kick on your minimum ventilation to keep it aired out but we need to shut those doors cuz Birds after about the first 2 4 hours they're going to start going in there those birds are possibly going to bring some type of disease parasite or something I'm you know Northern fomites I've seen that happen before so we want to make sure we keep those birds out rodent control again you don't want to see this rat rats running down the rafters I had a really cool picture I can't find it's a rat drinking from a nipple Drinker and it's I mean these are things you see in chicken houses if things are not done right now I will say we do a good job job around here keeping our stuff out whether you use the homemade type of of bait stations or you buy the bait stations we're doing a good job this is what we want to see we want to keep our pads clean Dr Shapiro mentioned that um Beetle control another one we don't think a lot about beetles can Harbor disease and carry them from one flock to the next so we want to make sure we have a good Beetle control program to try and knock those bugs down foot baths I'm a fan of foot baths when they're done right that foot bath is not right you can smell it from where I'm taking the picture this person should have known better that's wor you'd have been worse off stepping in that than just going straight in the house if you do it right they work but remember we don't want to see this we want to see something like well like this see he's got a good clean foot bath if we can get Jenny's grandson to play in the water and clean his boots we can train our employees and us to do it how old four years old can understand a foot bath so we want to make sure we do this clean things up here's a brush remember when we clean our shoes to get it right we got to get that mud off or it's not going to do any good in disinfecting so we've got to get the debris off so we want to make sure we clean things up one thing we might want to do it's hard to see in this picture but flat shoes with no no big grooves by doing that you're not going to get a lot of debris stuck in the bottom of your shoe work great except for if you step outside on ice or brand new litter kind of get slippery so we got to be careful there I'm a fan of dedicated Footwear in each house when I had a farm that's what I did each house had its own Footwear slip in when you go in slip it off when you come out boots are cheap they're not that expensive Dr Shapiro showed one way where you sit down on a bench take your shoes off throw your legs over the other side of the bench put the other shoes on just a simple change like that granted we have a lot of houses without Andy rooms so we need to find other things out other ways to do it but yall are very creative and and I'm sure you can find ways to make these kind of systems work foot baths whatever works for you but you need to find a way to make it work on your farm and then you need to be the one that always does it so that if you have other people that work with you they see you doing it CU if people will watch you and if you're not doing it they're going to figure they don't have to uh hunting waterfoul again kind of risky right now I don't know if we have any big waterfoul hunters in here but uh if you're going to hunt water foul take extra precautions or maybe take a year off uh not my place to call that but be very careful you laugh at that all right be careful around convenience stores love it this was a picture that used to have a whole bunch of poop here but by the time we got there the rain washed it off so it's a picture of a nice curb but look at this truck here pull into their gas station he's sitting there with that do you think that spread manure as he drove down the road yeah do you think it's kind of a good way to be can you imagine what the front of that truck looks like these are the people you're dealing with so when you go to the store make sure you don't take those shoes back down this is where everybody stops to get their coffee and donuts in the morning you don't want to pick something up from somebody else that went there Again Farm dedicated Footwear water ponds geese we need to find ways to discourage them from coming in I'm a fan of a young retriever Labrador chesap doesn't matter just a young retriever let him go out there and Chase the heck out of them it's legal you're not harming them so there are some things we can do as well you can get permission to Addle eggs where you go out and shake their eggs up or break their eggs you have to get permission there are legal ways to do it there are some ways to get permits to do deprivation hunts but there are ways to help lower the number of water foul around your farm uh bird droppings we've covered that washing hands I know a lot of y'all don't have places to wash your hands on a farm I was on a farm the other day and I said well you know we came out of the house we're kind of dirty and they pick this bucket off off the back of their uh their four-wheeler and they carry this bucket every day they go out when they start going around fill it up with clean soapy water you're done had a little chlorine in there you washed up you were done real simple didn't cost them anything this is one of those hand sanitizers you've seen them in a lot of buildings you just walk by you hit them put it right where you go in and out of your chicken house door your hands go everywhere you pick up the birds with what your hands you pick everything up you do is with your hands let's worry about cleaning our hands a little bit more and that should help what do we tell all the kindergarten kids wash your hands so works for us as well wash equipment we want to make sure equipment's clean we know that washing equipment will help stop the spread of disease some good dat out there one we need to remember here's the PLT crew showing up to spread PLT look at all the manure on those wheels and everything hose them off for them you know have them stop Say Hey I want to watch that off for you because you don't want to bring all that manure from somebody else's Farm on your farm remember you just cleaned out and disinfected you want to keep it that way Jenny covered cell phones okay remember this you are the front line of the defense what happens on your farm I can't control you're the only one that can control your farm so you are the ones that need to stand up and say this is what the limits are and this is what we're going to do and don't be afraid to tell people hey look I know my motor's broke but you need to put on this equipment before you can go work on it or if you're coming down here I want you to do this it's your farm you set the rules again the absolutes no backyard Poultry Farm dedicated Footwear and clothes no unauthorized vehicle Vehicles visitors visitors wear protective clothing and make sure we take care of our dead birds properly what we would suggest even better let's get some signage we see a lot of that that's going good visitor logs limit access you know if someone doesn't need to come on your farm like you need to meet with a banker or something we've been telling the bankers meet at McDonald's or some other restaurant you know go down at the doughnut house go down to Dunkin' donut buy them a cup of coffee while you sign the papers there's no reason they have to come to the farm other than convenience for you so maybe it's meet somewhere else to do these kind of negotiations Beetle control rodent control clean up litter wash hands wash all your equipment if we do all this it's going to help prevent disease not only AI but it will help with all of our btry diseases so it's going to be a win-win for us if we do this if we never get AI which I hope we don't if we do these things it's going to help us with other disease as well and with that since we only have one or two visitors and I know them pretty well we can kind of skip through this but what I want to say if you're visiting Farms if you don't need to go down to the farm meet him at the gate if your truck doesn't need to go on the farm don't have the truck go on the farm keep your windows set we pick up a lot of unwanted visitors you know passengers in our car when we leave our windows down let's let's make sure we don't do that some simple things we can do to help farmers out if you need to go to a farm just go to the part you need to don't go to everywhere don't go wandering around and with that remember our goal is to stop the spread of disease so let's all work together on this and let's make sure we get it done [Music] m
