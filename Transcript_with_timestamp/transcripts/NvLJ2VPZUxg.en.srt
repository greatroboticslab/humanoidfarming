1
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:11,950
Drip systems are great for efficiency in dry
and arid climates.

2
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:16,680
One thing to consider though, is the type
of soil that you have in your garden or landscape

3
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,140
that you’re watering.

4
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:23,759
Depending on the soil type, you will want
to select an emitter that matches that texture.

5
00:00:23,759 --> 00:00:28,519
The different types of emitters will emit
different amounts of water over a given amount

6
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:29,519
of time.

7
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,440
Most of these range from 1/2 a gallon to 2
gallons in home and garden uses.

8
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,530
This is amount of water per emitter, per hour.

9
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,440
If you have a clay soil, you will want to
select an emitter closer to a 1/2 gallon per

10
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,480
hour rate.

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,490
These soils cannot accept as much water over
a given amount of time as compared to a sandy

12
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:51,500
soil, which can handle a greater volume over
time.

13
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,580
So, a 2 gallon emitter would be more appropriate
for a sandy soil.

14
00:00:55,580 --> 00:01:00,170
The University of Wyoming Extension can help
in determining the type of soil you have in

15
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,260
your garden or landscape.

16
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:06,050
Once you’ve determined your soil texture
and you’ve set up your irrigation system,

17
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:10,000
you’ll need to run it for an appropriate
amount of time to make sure that you do not

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,859
have any major leaks, you do not have any
pooling on top of the soil surface – meaning

19
00:01:14,859 --> 00:01:20,079
that you are over-applying water – and that
the water is actually going all the way through

20
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,930
the root zone of the plants that you are looking
to water.

00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,579
