1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
okay our next speaker and our SEO

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:06,420
agreeable agency was from the University

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,900
of Houston Madison

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:12,660
he's a system scientist he's from

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,269
Bolivia but came and we worked together

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:18,779
and he is the source of all modeling

7
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:20,789
information and has some great

8
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:23,670
information to share with us about a

9
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:27,390
recent modeling effort he put together

10
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:29,519
using I think this is Victor Brady okay

11
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:32,910
survey data and then transforming that

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:41,430
through some modeling things done here

13
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:46,079
is a spider dancer morning everyone can

14
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:49,289
hop in gear I'm going to cut one here

15
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:53,250
and we turn it up perfect

16
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:54,899
once the combines was some management

17
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,260
practices that we're going to hear

18
00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:02,149
throughout the lifecycle of their

19
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:04,479
collection and we want to see what these

20
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:08,390
management

21
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:11,960
so the end under sentence the results of

22
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:13,939
a study that we conducted to first cave

23
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,009
formation of the north dimension

24
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:20,000
practically nothing that you create

25
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:22,880
expressions so settlement election

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,280
voting they already we already know we

27
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,860
have a linearity a very important

28
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,479
component of egg harvesting soluble

29
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,259
nutrients but also at the same time

30
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:34,670
these are major contributors

31
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:37,069
readmissions for the area responsible

32
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:41,709
for around ten percent of the methane

33
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:45,140
and we cultural and main competition

34
00:01:41,709 --> 00:01:47,450
results of experiments source or greener

35
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:52,729
definition of the dairy farm level after

36
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:54,709
magnetic also so that up to seventy

37
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:57,860
percent of the nitrogen excreted

38
00:01:54,709 --> 00:02:01,340
continued monomer with management

39
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:03,590
practices during storage allocation and

40
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:08,119
then it has further implication because

41
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:10,489
they have why both issues for the

42
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:13,580
morning and ventilation importance which

43
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:17,620
will fund initiative in two dimensions

44
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:22,850
and so we emit politicians are very

45
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:25,010
susceptible to the management practices

46
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:32,880
inspired so it's very important to

47
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:37,500
identify which so here's a study words

48
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:41,430
person antidepressant practices then to

49
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:45,240
develop measures data and then compare

50
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:47,790
prices of farm sizes and farm site

51
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:50,040
groups and I know you relate both real

52
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:53,360
definition and way mission plan to come

53
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:57,990
above we have gotten its plasma today

54
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,100
experimental physical for deep south we

55
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:01,580
need two things

56
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:04,680
surgically but if it's data or surveys

57
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:09,240
enlightened more than 2000 higher from

58
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:11,460
contain we have pretty good response

59
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:15,900
rate for very different entities like

60
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:18,180
Morris understand but like I percent or

61
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:21,690
the rest Clarence Louis and ultimately

62
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:25,710
any and week first ain't that right

63
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:30,480
reasons for people on the response was

64
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:33,180
very worthwhile to all that problem and

65
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,209
also that weekend postcards moon

66
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:39,760
Saturday only one time we had Sarah

67
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:45,129
Tommy says that we have to follow

68
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:48,730
for time nor decade apart anyway of

69
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:52,299
eternity two main areas of higher

70
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:56,019
operations near Nunnally each that women

71
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:59,110
folk deepak provided that partisan for

72
00:03:56,019 --> 00:04:01,180
groups abrasive site once many nine

73
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:05,290
thermal units because by lessons both

74
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:09,849
are in Munich mark suite 102 189 will be

75
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:11,920
a large iron from to 999 and they very

76
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:17,979
disabilities much more than thousand

77
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:21,910
employees we have we have 143 responding

78
00:04:17,979 --> 00:04:24,220
responses on how to translate to the

79
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:26,139
constellation each group well pretty

80
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:29,380
good for vermin facility point one

81
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:31,900
percent or very facility population the

82
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:35,560
response that we got butter centralized

83
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:40,110
rice harvest essential medium our 2007

84
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:43,449
percent to two percent for small farms

85
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:46,479
so the results for eating Fireside Room

86
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:51,090
of the conserve the production small

87
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:54,190
transit on the graph that shows

88
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:55,210
different steps that we consider in

89
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:57,610
computer

90
00:04:55,210 --> 00:05:01,169
our survey and ultimate modeling

91
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:03,840
exercise well in money our family

92
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:06,639
partner gonna focus on the group

93
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:10,810
components here today during the

94
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:15,880
nutrition critics of manure different

95
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:19,900
now I moms how money reflected Spirit

96
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:23,310
River it transported to storage how to

97
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:28,060
imported there some time processing part

98
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:32,070
in Hotlanta life and decided like asking

99
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:35,349
the difference these management tracks

100
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:40,240
included questions related to energy

101
00:05:35,349 --> 00:05:44,349
function and the personal has been an

102
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:49,660
operation powder-keg missionary service

103
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:51,849
without reading in Russian so the people

104
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:55,030
part after getting on base management

105
00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:58,060
presidency is modeling tools to quantify

106
00:05:55,030 --> 00:06:02,020
procrastination person use life cycle

107
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:05,380
students need to get full picture of

108
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:09,300
what's happening in all this step also

109
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:14,050
we use equation for from the eyes demo

110
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:16,530
for methane nitrous oxide and we deserve

111
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,530
a half

112
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:29,020
finally we 109 Canaries need 3 or 7

113
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:31,990
times more iron a means of near a large

114
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:35,259
fire and the nuclear and versatility

115
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:38,610
handle a binary protein and the

116
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:42,460
reference scenario agent he was

117
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:45,699
representing the most common common

118
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:49,740
practice report inserted but also we

119
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:52,210
model a low rating that meeting and -

120
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:58,509
Ariana's very smart

121
00:06:52,210 --> 00:07:03,599
another Oh so some results for the

122
00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:08,080
survey management directive graphs shows

123
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:10,900
two types one year in handled by small

124
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:14,620
medium large facilities because here

125
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:17,259
majority small harvesting on our

126
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:20,949
internal volume here and our I'd

127
00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:25,240
appreciate that all solid decree near

128
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:31,169
talked for like thirty facilities

129
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:31,169
responding to 38% and always

130
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:42,090
so this graph shows select here see how

131
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:47,320
is collected or what technology produce

132
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:49,180
small harm gather fingers and five

133
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:52,090
fingers on what we use at the far side

134
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:55,030
increases and you can see have years on

135
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:57,070
a week straight retired car uses oil and

136
00:07:55,030 --> 00:08:01,630
the parasites completed there's a way to

137
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:04,240
write or IEP of collision endlessness we

138
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:06,850
in terms of transport after your

139
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,130
collection small farms mostly

140
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:12,550
transported to the lands of lyrically

141
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:16,500
multiplied long-term flourish is

142
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:19,150
starting to be more come for larger fire

143
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:22,530
and also various authorities transform

144
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:25,810
energy processing this indicates that

145
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:29,050
you know larger parks are new April

146
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:31,680
users in basically live storage

147
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,680
structures

148
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:39,110
okay for search we collected some

149
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:43,460
information on the type of searches that

150
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:46,250
want to use you can see that people

151
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:50,920
watching Network there's a wider variety

152
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:53,630
of sources density above the larger part

153
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:58,310
the old ran concrete and wasteland

154
00:08:53,630 --> 00:09:00,470
recommendations Ardmore someone with an

155
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:04,940
application here you can see that small

156
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:06,980
firms show you service application but

157
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:09,110
are slight increases and we have

158
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:11,570
objection coming late and the

159
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:13,520
affirmative Pacific mm actually both

160
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:18,080
types of one application service

161
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:20,990
presentation they also related to

162
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:25,280
ratification I could in graphics I think

163
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:31,340
are interesting we chose the Holly

164
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:33,920
distance from our guilt they versus the

165
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:37,700
number of minutes and after that there's

166
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:40,400
increase in holiness and far-sighted

167
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:42,920
risen to a point in terms of civility

168
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:48,440
group where it starts at three so this

169
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:51,340
is it for exalt arms have more land for

170
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,340
annual units

171
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:57,269
which have certifications for

172
00:09:55,110 --> 00:10:01,800
verification

173
00:09:57,269 --> 00:10:04,889
in case you're processing only firmly

174
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:07,470
facilities reports and pristine forests

175
00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:10,230
and aggression of those farms that you

176
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:11,750
can contain some of inspiration and in a

177
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:14,730
repetition

178
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:17,519
rizzoli expression what we through

179
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:22,050
presence reuse their of opportunities in

180
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:26,459
case prioritization was the x coating is

181
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:31,439
something what both well some are cease

182
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:35,449
completely jesters we can see that in

183
00:10:31,439 --> 00:10:40,069
our organization we always evolving

184
00:10:35,449 --> 00:10:41,649
technology and farther separating

185
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:45,800
digestate

186
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:49,279
we have a proposition apartment for

187
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:52,370
difference Navarrete 1.5 gb computer

188
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:55,880
supply gas per animal unit completed

189
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:58,399
won't be really trivia collection and

190
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:04,190
internet agree that invites a super fun

191
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:06,800
super flexy okay so now for ten part we

192
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:11,230
have these management practices up we

193
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:15,860
have be having an ink type theory so we

194
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:18,589
put it in nineteen areas table shows the

195
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:21,199
different monsters practices that we

196
00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:26,000
consider each of them in the reference

197
00:11:21,199 --> 00:11:28,910
monitor reveal the most common and then

198
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,130
we have this broken pipe we have as main

199
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:33,889
areas that we also models or for

200
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:37,040
pleasure for example here which is

201
00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:41,510
people deal with these little field

202
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:46,610
versus market and illustrator people

203
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:49,730
see how that affects the transport pops

204
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:53,329
won't mention larger parts no transport

205
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:56,510
were not very important fire-roasting

206
00:11:53,329 --> 00:12:00,320
only reported by printing facilities

207
00:11:56,510 --> 00:12:02,810
more family particle police are they the

208
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:06,620
only inspiration and additions of

209
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:08,990
inspiration 5210 sustain but also we

210
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:13,880
want to see how suddenly joyful

211
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:15,709
expression without interpretation report

212
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:18,889
green transmission

213
00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:24,079
porridge showing off the only large

214
00:12:18,889 --> 00:12:27,199
larger firms physically we change the

215
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:29,449
retention tank usually nurses words were

216
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:31,850
if one thought on button here between

217
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:34,519
important hunting where one see what

218
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:39,380
happened to be considered shorter period

219
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:42,110
and also we evaluated storage with a

220
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:44,240
natural transformational pop even

221
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:47,389
without this important because it has

222
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:51,199
implications of discrimination is

223
00:12:47,389 --> 00:12:55,010
natural at any party aerobic condition

224
00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:57,820
courage which reduce the emissions of

225
00:12:55,010 --> 00:13:01,230
enzymes in Crete and coalition

226
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:07,960
to that for ratification certification

227
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:10,480
injection of a pellet summarizes the

228
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:12,820
result for all these nine scenarios

229
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,640
small farms here the first three large

230
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:21,160
parts taken three and very different

231
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:22,600
results last a group of three wires you

232
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:25,900
can see that in snow tires

233
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:28,360
Raina definitions are donated mostly by

234
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:32,560
information is happening an application

235
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:35,320
ratification but as time flies increases

236
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,150
we saw that premier ice conditions the

237
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,370
more discrete form so there's a new

238
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:44,310
start and evolve or system

239
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:47,590
music where maintain happens and

240
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:50,380
forcibly communicate you know perfect

241
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:54,150
conditions for methane super so large

242
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:57,790
parts mostly definitions from storage

243
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:59,860
data economies of scale that I and the

244
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:03,970
bigger firms terms of ability to

245
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:06,100
teleport and processing where brief

246
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:09,790
estimation can be significantly reduced

247
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:12,850
the first group are mysterious and a

248
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:15,540
repetition and we can see a reduction in

249
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:19,579
booth here not always from the men

250
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:22,350
from search but also included area of

251
00:14:19,579 --> 00:14:27,079
void admissions from the total

252
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:31,459
productivity but now inside like I got

253
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:36,509
to see also total integration relief

254
00:14:31,459 --> 00:14:39,410
with compared to to drive iron net

255
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:42,810
emissions of search each actually

256
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:46,440
integration with volume us to Berlin and

257
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:50,160
repetition with but it could cost in

258
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:58,490
charge of repairs to consider in terms

259
00:14:50,160 --> 00:15:01,139
of collection here in orange so the

260
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:03,569
originated and so illustrators and

261
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:07,350
partners are will be more efficient and

262
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:11,040
tear so lower radio transmissions here

263
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:13,019
as we included forage in the second

264
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,420
Airport there's methane emissions in

265
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:19,709
storage but as we reduce the retention

266
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:22,230
time from six months three months we see

267
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:25,769
a reduction in emissions in storage

268
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:28,370
sizes in authority to the driver here of

269
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:33,210
many missions but am

270
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:36,330
while it might be subjective that a

271
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:40,280
community such pertinent people to just

272
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:47,190
a burrito special income can even scale

273
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:49,350
large hire family community research in

274
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:53,310
terms of certain publication of sorry

275
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:56,100
magnification I did include my you

276
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:59,550
should here but first projection which

277
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:03,210
is ammonia amusement week at the same

278
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:04,770
time reducing injury-related potential

279
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:07,590
national solution that you have a

280
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:09,660
policeman but also with other Delta

281
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:12,600
applied increasing with direct and

282
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:17,910
Commission permutation location and the

283
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:22,410
overall effect 452 was neutral here so

284
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:24,710
we can all change intensified clinician

285
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,710
here

286
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:34,600
so for conclusions we know that both

287
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:37,300
iron wolf lead emissions in all times

288
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,820
are mostly driven by application form of

289
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:45,430
nitrous oxide then times light increases

290
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:47,970
encourage related usual information the

291
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:51,490
data of the funding identify this

292
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:55,060
content protein and Amidon in order to

293
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:57,250
mitigate the emissions and the North

294
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:59,110
addition of the critic sense for some

295
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:02,230
time so there's another strategy that we

296
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:06,400
expect considering like discovers you

297
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:08,949
know to reduce methane and also mentions

298
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,530
so there's different strategies here to

299
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:18,610
Windows computer in order to reduce

300
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:22,930
irritation parts so finish egg to your

301
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:25,209
day and project you wanna see more

302
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:27,660
information on this idea more efficient

303
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:31,900
or the other management practices and

304
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:36,160
bring our universe contention break the

305
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:38,440
Tetra that all are including paper ocean

306
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:42,750
currents in a collection we can write me

307
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,750
an email support engineer to three

308
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:57,640
two questions the person was dying to be

309
00:17:54,190 --> 00:18:01,809
the same process and not the question

310
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:05,320
know the information on the ice of life

311
00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:07,780
night one differentiate they from smoke

312
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:11,950
of the responsible arm so smokers

313
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:15,610
believe I'm so old as you can type some

314
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:21,100
different nail collection different

315
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:23,740
energy efficient way and then for the

316
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:26,920
false entry balance the storage was the

317
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:30,960
greatest area and you mention shooting

318
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:34,240
by covers arrows storage decreasing

319
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:37,360
solid content in there can all affect

320
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,730
act you guys have plans to take your

321
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,620
model look at that people specifically

322
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:44,290
yeah that's a good question I think

323
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:47,700
that's something that we can start

324
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:52,750
exploring that subside to be player here

325
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:55,660
yet yet we were thinking about more

326
00:18:52,750 --> 00:19:02,050
independence it started to just focusing

327
00:18:55,660 --> 00:19:06,400
on search okay you know we're going to

328
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:09,300
make sure that it better model I don't

329
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,300
like the question here

330
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:13,129
I assume the water generational

331
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:19,159
percentage

332
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:28,700
I think we're creeping up to 50% of that

333
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:32,269
or or maybe 40% of the animal very much

334
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:35,369
okay your other data guess there you go

335
00:19:32,269 --> 00:19:38,729
so still not not a huge percentage of

336
00:19:35,369 --> 00:19:41,399
the cows are on large facilities

337
00:19:38,729 --> 00:19:46,200
permanent facilities so what did you say

338
00:19:41,399 --> 00:19:47,539
20% yeah so still a lot on smaller

339
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:52,609
facility

340
00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:52,609
yeah animal units are above so permanent

341
00:19:56,479 --> 00:20:05,309
they definitely usually have a higher

342
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:07,700
milk production for animal any other

343
00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:07,700
questions

344
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:21,780
Boston wasn't included you know that

345
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:28,050
it's depression and we get and you're

346
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:32,910
posting inner circle fertility and we do

347
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:35,100
see it we certainly see it but we didn't

348
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:42,230
have any responses so we didn't include

349
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:42,230
that part okay thanks very much
