  "text": "thank you everyone for attending today speakers presenters and sponsors this event is put together by the South Dakota no-till association's SDSU Extension and some help from the NRCS crop consultants you can receive your CCA credits for each session each speaker has a separate sheet if you want to receive credits you have to sign-in and sign-out before and after the speakers the sheets are in the back of the room over by Ruth Beck the first speaker today is Michael Thompson he's a farmer and rancher from Almina Kansas might go along with his family and brothers operated Thompson ranch and farm and ranch LLC the farming operation grows wheat corn oats barley and a diverse cover crop mixes the ranch consists of a cow-calf operation that grazes on native range and cover crops on farm grant farmland acres in 2009 Michael began a soil health regimen program which has boosted yields lowered costs and improved profits he has also built a network of no-till producers he has brainstormed with over the years today he's going to share his knowledge and successful strategies for a profitable no-till farm and ranching operation everybody hear me all right yeah I am from Almeida Kansas I live in Kansas bye-bye where my house is but everything that I farm is actually in Nebraska and I'm kind of an oddity and not a President of Colorado no-till associations so before we go too far I'd like to invite you all since I am president of the Colorado conservation tillage Association this was 32 years ago they named it it actually is now the high plains no-tell conference February 4th and 5th we'd love to have you there if any of these things that we're talking about today with grazing with cattle on cropland interest view we have a lot of speakers that are doing this and western Kansas eastern Colorado and some dry land climates about like here so our farm is basically myself my brother Brian and my father Richard basically my father Richard was the only full-time person up until three years ago I quit my elementary teaching job as a kindergarten teacher and came home to farm and helped him out my brother is a full-time accountant and he helps out all the time when he can so basically we're in a 18 to 22 inch rainfall zone depending on what you look look at whether it's fifty or a hundred years but we're in a pretty similar climate as you we're just a little further south so we do have rolling topography our flattest field is one percent slope but most of its 12 to 20 percent slope so we have a lot of rowing rolling topography I guess I want to start off by saying kind of I'm not here to step on anybody's toes I think that's how we grow is maybe hearing some new ideas so I'm not trying to insult you if you're still doing some of the practices I'm talking about that I think that that's how we grow if we hear how other people have got away from maybe like summer fallow or going going away from you know going to different processes so please keep that in mind today with that in mind I think that we've done a really good job as farmers of being very proficient in chemical farming of treating the soil like a chemistry set you know knowing how much nitrogen to put on how much phosphorus put on how much potassium how many micronutrients the soil needs to grow a crop but in doing so we've kind of discounted soil biology and the but and the benefits that soil biology can give to us so I'm going to talk a little bit more about the ecological functions and about what we're doing on the cropland to actually stimulate the cropland to kind of do a little bit more with a little bit less of the fertility and the inputs so first off we kind of become ecologically blind like I said we've really got good at treating it like a chemistry set but they always call this country next your country you know if we don't hit it this year there's always next year you know maybe it'll rain next year or maybe we'll get an extra snow or something to get a little bit better crop but a lot of times we discount what we do in this year makes or breaks us in the next year so I'm not cool it up there you know about it's not next year country but last year's country you know how we treat the ground this last year is going to determine how our successes in the next year you know in 2020 so you know a lot of times I think also we've always got the mindset to get just a little bit more maybe little more profit or get that extra grazing or get that extra hang out there and sometimes we've got to defer that and leave it for the next year to feed that soil life so that we can have a better soil so I believe in this quote that by Gandia says that there's enough for every man's need but not every man's agreed you know going back to when we first started farming we were conventional till we did wheat fallow on a lot of our acres and I can remember it would set up like a brick and even when we switched over to no-till when we're Kim Fallot it's set up like a brick we didn't have pore space our water would run off you know on we need to farm more like that sponge you know we need to keep a living root in the soil we need to have that pore space so that water and air and biological life can live you know I'm not here to criticize anybody this is in our area so I know that there's people that are still doing to this today you know how close are we to actual soil are we close to dirt on our farms you know I want you to think about introspectively on your own farm are there places on side hills where you still got ditches are there places you know where you know you could do better and so that's kind of how we got started into this but you can see that you know water erosion still a huge problem in our area wind erosion is a problem this is actually a soybean field that was no tilled and it still blows so if you don't have that cover the wind can be a pretty big problem this has been a huge problem since grain prices were high in the about 2008-2009 on a lot of our rangeland is getting converted into cropland this is about six years in so what have we done to our rangeland we've taken productive rangeland and turned into really poor cropland you can see that there's a lot of places on there that you know our water cycle isn't functioning our water cycle is causing a lot of erosion and we're losing a lot of topsoil there so I'm taking some productive ground and turning it into unproductive farm ground you know it's great to be ecologically aware but that doesn't pay our bills does it we also have to see where the profit is so protecting that soil resource I can tell you there are some profits and some helpful things you know that that are a profit profit wise that will help you and first off it's it's estimated that about half of the fertilizer we currently apply to farmland is actually applied just to make up for all of what we lose erosion whether it be wind or water erosion you know so that's a pretty huge amount and we really don't think about how much erosion actually happens when we see ditching across a field but if you think your thickness of a dime that's five tons of soil top top soil lost so you know it doesn't take much to blow or much to wash away before you have quite a bit of nutrients and quite a bit of topsoil leaving your field you know as we go through this talk and as we go through when you go home I hope you think about it are you a banker are you a miner of soil carbon soil carbon basically most of our farmland and even most of our rangeland has probably been mined since we first came out here and converted it to either grazing or or farmland we took a really carbon rich soil and you know we took grains off it we took a hay off it we took many pounds of beef off it we over grazed it person that's more like the banker would probably be somebody that's returning their manure to their soil trying to use some cover crops keep something growing as much the year as possible they're probably also trying to try to plant some diversity in their rotation somehow to get that Criswell carbon you never really think how much soil is capable of because what we currently call soil is much more like dirt than it is soil and I never even knew this I'm kind of a soil I guess you'd call junkie or obsessed with understanding how soil works so actually I was watching a it was a documentary on the 1930s what led up to the Dust Bowl and how we got there you might think that this is basically Ohio Indiana Illinois somewhere that had really rich topsoil this is actually Springfield Colorado which is down by liberal Kansas and in Southeast Colorado where if you go through today it's full of yucca and basically looks like a desert but when they first wrote that look at how much carbon they didn't use fertilizers in 1900 this was just freshly broke ground and that carbon grew that crop you know even mrs. guys short those oats that the heads are over a foot tall so you know that there was an abundance and they talked about the abundance that they first had when they came west and you know as they tilled they burned a lot of that soil carbon out so you know growing up I was no different than maybe a lot of you I'd like to say I come from 40 or 50 year no-till operation which is not so basically we're riding at years when I came back to farm with my dad we basically converted from conventional till my early recollections were on a forty three eighty six international tractor and my job was to follow the combine and disc as fast as I possibly could because our ground set up like a brick the other thing I remember is when I was doing fallow there were ditches all over on our side Hills and my job was to go out and work the ditches in so then I could work across it so that we could go ahead and plant that ground without the ditches we never thought about why the ground was hard or why there were ditches there is just the things that we did you know we just didn't think about soil that way same way on a grazing operation we'd feed all winter long in a dry lot setting we kicked the cows out probably at the first of April and we'd leave them till probably end of October 1st November and bring them back to the dry lot of our pastures were always out of grass by about August first they'd be tearing down fences getting into crops and I absolutely detested cattle so if you think that I loved cattle and I got into cattle you're wrong because I remember about 16 17 years of age I was like when I become a farmer I'm gonna get ever rid of every last cow in the place and we're gonna farm everything luckily through some college roommates and through my dad talking me out of it you know we still have cattle on the place today and I have found that they've been very beneficial which we'll talk about in a minute the thing that killed me though was by age of 18 I was set down from my mom and dad well technically my mom because my dad didn't really want to tell me this but break the news to me but they said dad's gonna be the last farmer in our you know family that the barns not big enough it's not making it financially you know go go to town get a good job you know with benefits and stay away from the farm so I was pretty hard-headed though so I went and got my elementary education degree and I returned home I started teaching kindergarten and you know farming nights weekends and I was able to rent and buy some ground that way so I I didn't give up on it but I knew that that conventional tillage way was not going to be the way so basically I started looking in how was the soil formed our Prairie soils were formed under you know animals livestock out on them they had a living cover or a cover on him year-round and they had a living Roode as much the year as possible you know so we needed to have more of that on our cropland to start restoring those water cycles and the nutrient cycling some might think that I'm open to change because I'm young actually it was the other way around I kind of liked that if it isn't broke don't fix it you know but I knew that that wasn't going to work for me because I had to fix our soils if I was to have a chance you know not farming so back when we were under conventional till we never thought as well as anything more than just something we'd planned it into you know it was either dry or it was wet or you know it was eroded whatever we didn't think about it we just put the fertilizer down the plant grew well now we look at soil as being the priority and the most important thing on our farm because whether it's on the range land side of things or whether it's on the crop land side of things that's where all your profit is derive from you know there's no tract or no plan or no combine that are gonna that's going to make your soil better you know you're gonna have to put the investment into it and and see how you can make that soil better I like to view the soil like I view my son or my children I wouldn't leave them out in the Sun you know on a hot day because they get a sunburn right well think about if you go out and you hay or you go out and your work your ground and leave it bare to the Sun it's gonna you know get a sunburn it's gonna hurt that soil life same thing you know with the tillage you wouldn't stick a sharp implement in your kid they'd probably bleed to death right well the soil doesn't like all that tillage in that disruption either so you know some of those things are things to think about here's been the hardest thing for me personally to shake I think most of us in this room have always grown up we only get so much rainfall so much snowfall there's only so much moisture right so we come from that let's banking you know that's that whole back back mindset with summer fallow we've got to Bank that soil moisture and I'm not gonna say it doesn't take moisture to grow covers and also grow crops but without that good cover over the soil you can't really regulate your you can't regulate any of your you can't regulate your moisture at all you know there's a lot more days with our winds and our sunny days to lose moisture than there is to gain moisture you know we have a lot more windy sunny days than we do rainy days also we when the first time when it gets dry what happens to our soils that don't have resiliency they start in the crops hurting and they look like they're starting to burn up so we pray for moisture right well if we pray for moisture and we only hold a third of that moisture have we really done us any service no not really we have to have a place for that moisture to be held down in the profile not just on the top of the soil you know if I can say one thing that changed my mind about moisture the most there's a PDF down here at the bottom called the new water paradigm water and recovery for a climate that is an absolutely free pdf you can get off the internet and it talks a lot about the water cycle and recovering that water cycle so if you're interested in that it's about 75 80 pages worth but it really goes into depth about how the water cycle works so i really suggest looking that up you know as a PDF it's really good you might have to read through it a couple of times but it's not really like a scientific paper it reads pretty easy so something really to look into you know in our area we're always told cover crops use too much moisture right well this was kind of the side-by-side comparison this was really apples to apples because the planters rolled on the same day the only difference was is my neighbor stopped me or my neighbor's hired me and stopped me and he's like what are you doing four down pressure on your planter you know we can't get it in the ground up here at the top of the hill and we're getting stuck down at the bottom of the hill and I was like we just a backed her down pressure off the cell it swells mellow and so that's the difference with the cover crops basically on their side that was just wheat stubble you can see how it's browning up and burning up on the other side where we took wheat stubble when we planted some millet some daikon radish some rapeseed things to help with the infiltration we did use moisture to grow that crop but then when the rains came we're able to keep the rain further on the side hill and not all down at the bottom so here's the After Effects you can tell pretty much probably which side had to cover if you look between those those rows it's not too hard to see that there's still some cover on the cover crop side and on the side that was just wheat stubble there's basically nothing left a lot of that that's that heat heeded the plan up and it burned it up basically it couldn't pull enough moisture out of the soil fast enough and over here so is about the difference between and ten bushel corn and the neighbor had an insurance check so you know what excites me about the whole thing about covers and about soil improvement we don't have to spend a lot of money on them yes you have to plant you have to spend money on the seeding and the seed but we can use a lot of the free elements number one the Sun we're using capturing all of the rain and snowfall that we possibly can we're also using the carbon we're capturing carbon from the air which is totally free and I think that in the next few years you they talked about it for twenty thirty years now but I think that we're really close to getting paid for carbon credits that you will see that as a big thing for your car if you're starting to sequester carbon in your soils we will start seeing a push for that we're also increasing organic matter by having that living root in the soil we are stimulating soil biology the earthworms the fungi the the bacteria they're all making nutrients that are plan available a lot of things that we put on as fertilizers have to be converted with it's biology and if you have the biology working for you there's a lot of amino acids and a lot of peptides and other things that feed the plant and you don't have to put it on it all starts through the Sun most of us don't think anything about the Sun at all you know the Sun has a huge amount of horsepower 500 horsepower tractors pretty big right well that's five with I think 24 25 zeros behind it four horsepower to put it in another way if there was a nice bridge that was two miles wide and one mile thick from the earth to the Sun it could be melted in less than a second the sunlight that falls on a square meter could power the desktop computer for over a day so there's a lot of energy and if that energy doesn't have a green growing plant it's basically like an oil spill it's a it's a wasted opportunity we're wasting that sunlight so we need that green growing plant to have photosynthesis and to pump sugars or exudates into our soil those sugars feed the soil life and then the soil life feeds our crops so if we don't have that like this field if we have bare soil like this you know even though it's planted to a wheat crop there's nothing up there it's basically the sun's working against us it's drying the soil out it's killing off our microbial life it's doing a lot of things that are that are working against us so I'd rather work with the Sun than against it you know how effective is your rainfall this is pretty common in our area on people that are still following you see that it seals off and it goes down and it sits in the terrorist channel well that terrorist channel you might grow a little bit of crop in the terrorist channel but that water should be across the whole you know across the whole field and stored down in the subsoil so that your moisture so that your moisture is there when you need it later in the summer you know how effective your snowfall we do rotationally graze my dad still likes to put up some hay so he does you know a few lands around the outside of the field and then maybe puts a few swaths through you know for our for our wire to go so you can see where he actually hate over here there's about an inch and a half to two inches of snowfall and that actually had about 8 to 12 inches of residual to hold the snow but it just didn't hold the snow where we had the stockpile basically there was almost the foot about 11 to 12 inches of snow out there you know so that's making the snowfall more effective because that's creating a little microclimate it's still staying warm under there when that snow still melts it can still do some infiltration so you're actually making more effective you're using water to improve the soil dad thought that I was crazy I went and got some of these moisture probes basically they're an irrigation probe and we're a hundred percent dry land so he laughed at me he said we can't turn the water on Sun so what are you gonna do with this I said well I just want to know that I'm doing right with these cover crops that they're actually doing what I think they're doing so the black line up here is basically the moisture level in the soil this green band is the optimum optimum growing conditions for your crop and anyway so this this black line as you can see we put them in it was in mud it was over a hundred and ten percent almost 120 percent of slow water holding capacity it was wet when we plan it when we put these soil probes in well we put our cover crop in and as everybody knows cover crop season oyster so we started using moisture and moisture and down here at the bottom of that green band is when it started turning brown and it started getting a little sickly so we decided we'd start grazing it and dad was pretty much laughing at me saying I wasted my money on these because he could what was happening you know I was using up all my moisture well I was feeling pretty low by the time this band got clear down there it was pretty much getting to be pretty Brown I mean it the top for that blue-white stage is burning up so one night in the evening we got two inches of moisture in 45 minutes so it was a horrible rain it just rained buckets and I was sick to death because the cows were out there I thought oh they tracked my field up probably the tears channels are completely full maybe even washed and terraces out as fast as it came but as you can see when I got to the field it really wasn't tracked up that much there was a few spots and the channels that had some water but they weren't full and we didn't have any terraces washed out I couldn't understand why well we'd use that moisture up up here but then when we got that rain look we recharged everything so it helped the infiltration enough that we did use moisture but then we regained that moisture because it had a place to go if we would have followed that in that same time period it probably would have had 90 to 80 to 90% moisture in that subsoil and then when we got that rain we would have had like a hundred and sixty or a hundred and eighty percent I guarantee it we would have had lots of ditching we would have terraces washed out so we are using moisture but we're creating an environment where we're increasing the infiltration and getting more water into our soils we do this by retaining residue I know this looks crazy too a lot of people probably because you're like oh my gosh grazing days you know most guys want to take it down to where they see some bare dirt that's not me I need that residue on top because that's what's gonna keep my evaporation at bay so I am giving up grazing days up front but it comes back to me the next year in little to no chemical use and then I also have a lot better crops that make it through the dry times because it's got that it's got that covering between the between the rows what does grazing look like this is 12 hours of grazing when they go out on the sorghum Sudan there's a hundred and twenty pear out there you can't hardly see them that's about two and a half acres and by the time they come back you can see them and for me that's time to move most people would have probably gone another day out there till they take it down even more but for me I want that standing I want some standing residue left they stripped all the leaves and all the good stuff off and it's time for them to move so that's what twelve hours are grazing looks like why is that residue key because that residue regulates your soil temperature you can't make it rain more but you can keep that evaporation at bay so 130 degrees that's basically like a lot of bare fallow work ground or Kym fallow they could get up to 130 degrees in the summer maybe not quite that much up here but it could in our area if you can keep it covered you can keep it down towards that 70 degrees and that 70 degrees a hundred percent of that moisture is used for plant growth so the cooler you can keep that soil you can't make it rain more but your your water can go further we are limiting evaporation this is the same soil probe that we had it also has temperature sensors every four inches this pink line up here at the top is the top four inches which is going to fluctuate most with the soil temperature because it's going to be closest to the top of the soil and on some of our hottest days when we're over a hundred degrees it got up to 87 degrees there so we're keeping it more than twenty degrees cooler we're keeping our swell microbiology happy in that soil and we're also keeping it from evaporating that way I will harp a lot on soil cover and carbon because that's what we're deficient in we're gonna have to give a little bit to get the system started so why is it important because all life we're all life forms we're all carbon-based life forms on this planet so you know it's pretty important this is what I want you to take if you don't take anything else from my talk please take this home and think about this carbon holds seven times its own weight in water so basically every little bit of carbon you're putting in your drought proofing your soil it will hold the water like nothing else will you know there's no tillage equipment or anything else that will do as good as carbon well and that's why I'm gonna harp a lot on soil covering carbon carbon is essential in the healthy soil because it's the food for the microbiology I think we've all found that out if you're no tilling for a long time and you have those fallow periods your organic matter doesn't grow does it it's because the microbiology starts eating it they don't like to eat on that organic matter because it's like eating cardboard to them they'd much rather eat exudates wheat those sugars coming from the root living roots but they will feed on that organic matter and that's why we don't see the organic matter if you're not growing plants to increase soil carbon basically they're just going to tear the house down well this is the difference that soil carbon makes looks like a totally different soil this is a Holdrege silt loam that's 2.1 percent organic matter that's a point seven percent organic matter this isn't perfect by any means but there is a lot more pore space down here this is a yulie clay that's like our side hills and you can see that's a lot darker got more water holding capacity a lot more carbon in there than the no-till neighbor so the difference that carbon does make we can change our soils and I would have never known this how do I not have a field day on my farm they wanted a slope at night never dug it so up and I suggest everybody go out and dig a pit and see what you're doing in your soils on the stuff that my dad had it was pretty good soil really raised good crops you know good corn good wheat crops so he really didn't push the covers when we first started out I got a lot of side hills and stuff next to the pasture that was pretty much you know not functioning like it should it was poorer ground so where we had the poorer ground where we did the cover cropping and we did like scat cover crops we did like a cool season spring one grazed it out followed by a warm season one grazed it out and then planted it back to wheat that's a pretty tight rotation we didn't have a lot of wheat but then after the wheat came off we put a warm season cover back on and grazed it you can see the carbon that we put in there that those exudates that's 36 inches of carbon this is about 11 to 18 inches of carbon there where the no-till so we're actually putting more carbon and that's holding more water so we can we can up our rotations more again this isn't as far into the system this is about this is on our fifth year in no-till this is only the second cover crop because we worked this was a on a crop share and our landlord didn't think that covers worked until she started seeing our other ground progressed more than hers so we started doing this on on her ground you'd see there's still a lot of problems but what are we doing we're starting to get those we're starting to get that carbon put down into the soil microbiology is money in the bank and that's why it's important to take care of it you know a soil that's rich in carbon is also rich in fungi and microbes and all these things are cycling nutrients and making plan available for free we don't have to go and we don't have to pay for it and they also when we do put fertilizer on they stretch that fertilizer dollar even further I'm not advocating that you severely cut your fertilizer especially right off the bat because that would be a train wreck but I am saying that you will if you follow these programs and you make targeted applied visions or versions of your your fertility they will go further soil life creates basically the enzymes and some amino acids that are beneficial to plants that don't have to be converted by the biology that are planned available this is fungi in our soil so the thing about fungi that's important is that fungi roots can only go so small and to get into fissures and cracks in your soil and then they can't go any further but the fungi is so much smaller and more microscopic it can go into small small cracks that are microscopic and it can go find moisture and find nutrients that the the roots can't and then it'll take it back to the it'll take it back to the plant because the plant's gonna feed it sugars to keep the fungi alive because the fungi feeding the plants so it does work together so that's important even in dry times don't be afraid to put something cheap out there this is primarily a military op but they did put some daikon radish and turnip in there I considered this a failure because I planted it with intentions we were gonna get some rain after harvest at some point it was dry bone-dry when we planted I didn't think it'd come up you know two weeks later three weeks later we had this you could see it coming up only got about you know ankle the boot top high you know it didn't get over a foot two foot tall so I determined it was a failure because I wanted it for grazing the cows actually the deer and knocked down an electric fence next to this and the cows got out on it they were just going wild and I couldn't figure out what were they're after and never even went back and looked at it but they they were going after these turnips and this this radish they're recycling those nutrients that were left over after that wheat crop so we can recover some of those nutrients this is what a cover crop looks like you don't see much bare soil you see a green growing plant you know this is millets this is forage sorghum sorghum Sedan some rapeseed sunflower so I've got a diversity of broadly sand grasses and this is kind of what it looks like and this was a wheat stubble this was probably planted or this was probably filmed what about the end of September so if you rain you can do some pretty great things you know grazing I'll say grazing so easy even a baby can do it you know most people don't want to hear that um you know grazing can be a lot of work is what most people think but it doesn't have to be work I highly suggest if you have never been around poly wire or a braided braided wire like poly wire that you experience that because it's really easy to subdivide and to get better use of your cropland you know these this poly wire I like this I like the step in post with a very smallest spike that you can find because when you get into frozen ground or dry ground it goes in the ground if you get too big a spike like you go to some of these places that are like the local tractor supply they have cheaper post if they have a really big spike on the end and they won't go into frozen or dry ground so try to find a one of those portable posts that's got a small spike on it basically that's that's all you need really really I suggest if you do this spend the money on a fence charger I mean 500 to 800 dollars on a fence charger which sounds like a lot but it'll have enough joules that'll keep the keep the cattle back you know they'll respect it whereas if you go get a cheap fence or they'll be out all the time and it doesn't take much crop damage to have a lot of problems with the neighbor so I'm not so I'm not a I'm totally into electric fence as being a good thing but you have to have a good fencer integration of livestock on the farm like we talked about they're basically incorporating the residue down to the ground where that microbe the microbes can start breaking it down their trampling it basically something that most people don't talk about is the benefit but they're stressing the plant they go out when they wrap their tongue around there and pull it off you know they're pulling on that root and that roots getting a little stressed so with putting more sugars into the ground they're also putting some saliva and some bacteria on there their act and the room and a lot of the things that are in the room and coming out of the back end of the cow start to stimulate a lot of these you know the soil biology I will show you in a little bit what that looks like on our farm why hot high stock density I like running a decently high stock density so I get the trampling so I get the ground cover I get even residue distribution instead of bare spots you know I think that it's important that you have what you can manage you know if it doesn't have to be daily moved as if every second or third day that's fine too but I think that you need to have them moving across your cropland because if you just leave them out on one piece of ground like a quarter for you know 30 days you're gonna have some serious some pretty serious compaction in places you know who wants to move fence it sounds like a daunting tax doesn't it to go out and move this fence you know and change the fence around well for me on foot I timed it one day and to cross fence a quarter it took what about 35 minutes for me on foot holding the posts and stringing the wire out if you have a four-wheeler or you know a side-by-side or something it's way faster than that but um you know it doesn't have to take a lot of time couple that versus the way we used to look at cows and we used to subdivide them into groups and put them all over the country or take us four and a half hours just to check cows and a lot of times it's a whole day endeavor if they tore the fence down and they're in our crops or the neighbor's crops so you know it's actually a lot less time it's a little bit more time to get your idea of where your watering points and stuff we're going to be but it's a lot less time than the way we used to run cattle and most of all why I like being out there every few days with my cattle cattle are tame and they're easy to work with these are my two year old twins that just they just turn 2 in December and they can come out with me and be around these cattle they don't act like cattle they act like oversized puppy dogs it'll kind of freak you out a little bit because they'll follow you around you know looking to move Vince and I'm gonna show you real quick what a fencing what a move looks like on our farm you know people think moving cattle you have to get behind him and hoop and holler and everything else all you have to do is drop the wire once they see the first couple go by they're smart they know they're gonna get there next rotation and you know big herds are not hard to move it one person can do this this happens to be where we had all three of us there one morning and we just moved him in but you could see how fast they are the cattle are in really good shape they've they might be a little bit bigger than you we're trying to shrink our cattle down but they are really full they're got a good-good code on them that's something that you can't you know I was talking with some other people you know the sale barn when they go through the sale barn they've got a lot better coat there a lot fuller and that's something that you you know you can revenue add revenue to if you're doing this watch forage levels if anything moved with forage on top don't be like when we first started this dad and I decided that we'd leave him one more day I thought we should move him dad thought we shouldn't so we did it dad's way on this first piece the rest of it we left more forage and the difference on that following was about there almost 30 bushels of wheat the top only yielded about 22 bushel of wheat because it was so dry and we had compaction and everything else so why leave residue residue holds it up it works kind of like a snowshoe does you know you don't break through the snow when you got residue cover over the top those cattle don't really break through down into the soil and pug it up very much they just kind of lightly incorporate that on the top something else to think about is this isn't wasted forage this forage feeds the soil so your soil can feed your livestock in the future so it's an investment your future you know what about compaction this is on my own farm compaction is not a problem if you keep them moving basically this is soil bulk density this is done in a joint Colorado State and Kansas State study on cover crops in the western region and you can see it's statistically insignificant the differences between fallow grazed and ungrazed so basically that's the same you know long as you keep them moving this is a penetrometer this shows this was grazed right before we planted corn so we'll see how much compaction we actually put in the ground if it stays in that Green Zone basically you know you're able to have your roots move through so I can do it with one hand so I'd really didn't have a lot of resistance so that's working pretty good so anyway so that's something to think about I prefer strip grazing everybody has a different way to set up fence the longer or narrower the paddocks you're going to get a lot more of that back and forth movement which you thought I think would be compaction but it does a lot more with laying that mat down if you do more in a square pattern you're more likely to probably have better you forage utilization but you're probably not gonna have that good residue Matt lay down so we'd like to strip graze and that works good for me because I could put my tank next to a road or I can put my net tank at the end of the field where I've got a well across the road and just run a hose across the road so it helps me with water on some of these things this is the nutrient spread with strip grazing we'll talk about cycling nutrients the free fertility that we're getting if you put one fence around your corn stock say it's a corn stock field you put one fence around there and you leave them continuous out there it would take you 27 years to get one cowpie per square yard I think yep per square yard if you subdivide and you move them say every 14 days it takes you eight years to get one manure pack per square yard if you move them 24 different times you don't have to have 24 fences set up you just have to have it divided up so you can move them 24 times it would take you 2 years and you can tell down here where we did it daily you can see the manure paths that are gonna feed that grass so it does cycle nutrients it's your free fertility you know remember to leave that soil Armour so many times guys are probably thinking that they can probably get it you know the extra 10 or 15 head on that ground you know and take it a little bit further down but you really need to leave that soil Armour so that you've let those earthworms have a good environment lift up biology eat the best leave the rest don't be afraid to stop the bottom of the stalk you can see that there is a pretty significant amount you know that we did waste on this but the next year you know you can raise some really good crops when you put them into this so you know you're just using the that you're capturing some value with the cattle out there but you're also capturing the value of the next year with that and increased soil function again I tell you know I've told you several times but remember to leave cover you know you that cover is essential to make the whole thing work why I like grazing a lot of people say oh I've got a cover crop I'm gonna hay it well just know if you hate it you're gonna take off a lot of the good that you did with that cover crop so so let's say you run 500 pounds of beef per acre that's 18 pounds of nitrogen 9 pounds of phosphorous and 1.0 pounds of potassium removing so four tons per acre I figure is probably a dryland yield might be a little bit low but 200 pounds of in 40 pounds of potassium potassium you take that to an irrigated yield that's over 400 pounds in so you're losing a lot of nutrients when you hay that so you're gonna have to make it up with a lot of added nutrients so something else that we get on our farm is we get a really nice regrowth on our pasture when they're out on cover crops so that helps hurt let's grow more range this is in August the neighbor has buffalo grass and weeds and basically bare soil this out here you can see some clovers and some grass so you know we know that we're making a difference on our on our ground I'd be a miss to tell you that this all happens in one year you know also many people I get frustrated when I first started this because you'd hear these guys talking and made out these beautiful wonderful looking crops well I think 2012 might have been a little drier up here for you guys for you us 13 was the year that really dry in our area so we did everything right with this corn crop we had really good soil cover we planted the corn crop in there is so dry the corn didn't really even come up we didn't get hardly a stand so we did strip graze the corn off but we did everything right this is the same fertility package as here and look at the difference we've got this is last year's corn we even have the ground starting to cycle nutrients you see some bare soil there you know as soon as the corn comes off it needs that residue to keep it going but you can just see a lusher and a stronger plant and that's the soil biology that's making that you know and I like to have fun I planned it a little bit of open pollinated corn it was a Jimmy red corn so just for fun you know just to see what it do remember to leave that soil cover and this is what it looks like where we have cover crop between the rows and this was a harvested this was this Paul's harvested so you need to have that soil cover leave that soil cover even if you're grazing and this is the different soil cover makes you see the cover crop on one side this guy hate all of his corn stalks off so you've got no residue and look what's happening to his soil so it makes a big difference we chose the way you know to change the way we farmed the way we viewed soil you know we disc we ploughed we ripped we did you know so you know I think that it's important that we think about the soil and put a priority on soil this is the difference that the high input no-till this is guy that uses a lot of chemical and fertilizer in there basically you know it is gonna work so all these little dots that's bacteria you see a lot of other life and there it's pretty much all bacteria right soil bacteria is what's pretty prevalent in a lot of soils so I'm going to show you on our side this was the grazing the little worm-like things a nematode that little fast things of protozoa there's bacteria you've got a lot more cycling of nutrients when you've got all those little guys working for you they're they're dying they're they're killing each other they're giving off nutrients and this all plan available so that's the difference we're getting and for me this is what's important I'm leaving a legacy of good soil management I hope to heck but I don't have to tell my three kids someday that you know you can't come back to the farm I'd like to think that we'd find a revenue stream or a way to bring them back you know and that our soils will be in a good enough shape you know that that we can do that so like I said I taught kindergarten in the spring when the kids would get restless and antsy we'd go out and we'd have a soils unit and as part of our soils unit and conservation theme we'd read the Lorax and in in the Lorax it says unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot nothing is going to get better it's not it starts with you know you your neighbors you know just just trying something and making it work you know being committed to it if you are into this I'd suggest reading there's a lot of good books out there then that's how I got my start I didn't have the neighbors that were good at doing this I just had to read and figure this out the hard way but grass fed cattle it's not really about grass feeding as much as it is it talks a lot about mobile structures like watering fencing that kind of stuff it actually gave me my my start in to this whole grazing thing holistic management kind of tells you some of the things about you know range and stuff nature and properties of soils that's my Bible that tells you so much about soils it is a college textbook but it doesn't really read like a textbook a lot of good info about water cycling nutrient cycling things like that stumble over soil that's about a South American farmer who took some really poor and poorly degraded ground and bro high productivity good no tell book cal save the planet water in plain sight those are both books that kind of talk about the water cycle and how the how cattle can actually help restore our soils building soils we're better crops that's a free PDF file that you can get from sare teeming with microbes teeming with fungi and teeming with excuse me teeming with nutrients by Jeff blow in Fell's those are really good books that talk about a lot of the biology happening in our soils you know and how the nutrients get into our plants so if you're interested in that and I think the most important thing for me that helped me grow as a person with farming the Dust Bowl that book is a first-hand account from a Southwest farmer that he was doing everything right for his day conservation wise trying to grow crops but he kept having crop failure after crop failure so it kind of tells you the what if we don't take care of our soil I know that what I said might be a lot to you know chew you know or write a lot to think about but I heard the same thing you know years ago from other speakers and I thought what do I have to lose you know and it's really been kind to me and so that's why I'm here today to to kind of pay it forward and help other people hopefully you have success on your own farms and ranches like I have but a lot of its mindset whether you think you can or think that you can't you're right and Henry Ford said that and 90% of its mindset if you want to make it work you're gonna find a way to make it work so if I can help interview in any way here's my contact information if you're on facebook kansas-nebraska soil stewardship group was me and a few neighbors that did it cuz we're in Kansas in Nebraska and it's all across the region now so if you'd like to be on that or on Twitter there's a lot of good people doing stuff on there so please reach out and if I can answer any questions great I thank you for your time thank you you [Applause]",
