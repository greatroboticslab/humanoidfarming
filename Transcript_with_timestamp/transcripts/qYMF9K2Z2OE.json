  "text": "hey everybody welcome back to the channel in today's video we're going to be talking about purchasing land for your homestead and I got three things that you need to look out for if you're a beginner just starting out trying to find your dream property so let's get to it all right first thing I hey well first of all I'm back here in the back 40 as I call it um back here where I do my hunting at got my redneck blind back there um this was something that was important to me but we'll get to that in just a second first let's talk about location all right location location location for me location meant you know I was in uh Washington State when I finished my military career and um I that's growing Zone 8 well was 88 at the time and um I felt like I love that growing zone so I wanted to have my forever property in growing zone 8 as well so that was something that I looked for I like growing zone 8 because I can grow all year round and it's it's probably the the zone that I think is most most universal for being able to grow all year round um the Summers get hot but they don't get as hot as N9 and 10 and 11 you know um but the winters are mild so they don't get as cold as seven you know six and five and four um so I have a really long growing season I can definitely grow 365 days a year um and that's something that was important to me so that's why location location location is so important so for me uh as far as location is concerned that was really that was really it that was all that I was really concerned about um but you know some people may want to be close to family some people may not want to be close to family you know what I mean so you know I wanted to be I guess you could say uh close enough that if I had to get home on an emergency I can do it but I'm far enough away where I ain't got to worry about somebody coming knocking on the door if you know what I mean so so location is super super super important all right so something that I um also had in mind was your local resources or your community um I feel that for a homesteader especially first starting off you really need to um look at what's in your area that you can use so um stuff like like resources like feed for your animals so important right um I know most every place you know you got ATT track the supply or you got this or you got you know feed store or whatever but um you know look at those places and make sure that you have the type of place that you are going to make a long-term commitment to as far as uh where you're going to be purchasing from because a lot of places just don't have the things that you may have had in your last location so definitely um what you know look at what is in your community as far as resources you know can you get compost bulk you know or do you have to buy bag compost um you know bag compost gets expensive you know uh but some people you know that's all they need and so you know way your weigh your your needs and your wants and determine whether or not you're going to need stuff like you know bulk things that can be delivered to you because some places hey I'm going tell you it's nice to live off grid it's not it's nice to to not um have neighbors or whatever sometimes you know but sometimes it's nice to have a neighbor or two you know sometimes it's nice to be able to head out to the feed store and only have to drive you know 15 20 minutes versus 2 hours to get feed for your animals you know what I mean so that's something that's very very very important and often overlooked is what you can what you can locally just reach out and get in a in a in a pinch um some things yeah you can plan it out and where you can get it delivered to you or whatever but that's extra cost as well so definitely your local resources is something that I highly recommend that you look into especially if you're buying a property that you want a homestead on also when you're looking at uh your local resources you know you you want to make sure that you have access to agricultural resources as far as like nrcs or um your your a extensions and stuff like that um make sure that you know cuz like let's take for instance me right and um I'm not bad mouthing anybody or whatever this is something that they told me you know so my County's um a extension is not doesn't have a lot of uh of resources I would say and they have even pointed me to you know a sister County that has better resources because they have uh a ug extension over there so University of Georgia extension so um it's a little further drive you know but it's not too too bad but that's something that I didn't know prior to buying this property versus you know my extension office is you know six 6 to 10 minutes away you know so um definitely um you know having to go and drive 30 minutes to the other extension office is not ideal um it's probably not something that I would have uh like not bought the property over but you know you have to look into those kinds of things as well and last but not least um the property condition and so what I mean by that there's a lot that goes into that um like me I knew I was going to be having Gardens and whatnot and I wanted to grow on this property so I asked the the seller if I could do a soil test they had no issue with me doing a soil test cuz they knew that they had you know premium soil here I mean this soil they had horses here at one point and this soil is just it's Immaculate I did a soil test and um it told me that I don't need to add anything to the soil just grow in it you know so um you don't run into that too often not that I would have uh said hey I'm not going to buy the property because of the soil test um but I would like to know what I'm getting into you know from the soil test the other thing that was really important to me was you know I want to be on well water I don't want to be on City water so um I made sure and I I saw that before I even came to the property that it was on well water so well water was important to me um it may not be important to you so but that is something cuz you know I don't have a water bill and I use a lot of water here on my property so um that's something to definitely take into consideration when you're uh starting off homesteading everything needs water your animal your plants everything you everything needs water so definitely don't overlook that and if you can shave off a little bit of your monthly bill by having a well or if you have the ability to dig a well uh because they dug a well here on the backside of the property and I have a well for the houses as well so um you know that kind of thing is super super important when you're talking about infrastructure for your animals you know if if you want you know know a readymade place that already has Barns and and uh fencing and all that kind of stuff that's something you need to be looking for don't overlook it don't think oh I could just build that later because you'll be four five six years later and you still don't have a fence you know I may be talking about myself but hey but no for uh but something that I did not look at though I would say this is a mistake that I made Okay so when I pulled up onto the property uh the house is kind of higher than the road right so you know and that's typical cuz you want your grade to go away from the house um and then when I came back here to the back I noticed that everything slopes down back here and there's a there's a a river not a river but a creek a stream that runs through back there um so so I figured okay yeah everything goes down downhill toward you know water typically and so I looked at it and I was like okay that's cool that's that's what I wanted that's what I want but something you know I looked at the soil I looked at the slope I looked at everything you know I I like the slope too cuz I was like man so I don't have to worry about having one of those mud Farms you know what I'm saying cuz you know everybody everybody talks about those mud Farms man I didn't want one of those so I was like you know being on a slope like this the water going to run off and I'm not going to have standing water and I don't you know but I didn't think about why why the Topography of my land was or is the way it is I didn't think about that and so you know you get to working and you get to doing stuff and next thing you know it's like dang everywhere I dig there's rocks and I got my yard my front yard done I got it leveled when I first moved here and um you know I I I had a a company come in and kind of grade it because I couldn't cut it because there were so many rocks that were like um you know I had to mow around rocks and stuff you know so I was like a man I like to mow you know I like to mow my yard so I was like hey I need y'all to come in here and get these rocks out of here and hey they got the rocks out so you know I was like all right cool so y'all got the rocks out but he couldn't get it as level as I wanted it to be you know and so uh he was like man man you got some huge rocks in this ground and I was like what he was like yeah man you got rocks so big that like you probably need Dynamite to like to like dislodge him you know he said you probably your house is probably sitting on a big rock you know and I was like ah so right around the street the um the uh the next little town over or whatever it's not really a town it's just it don't really have nothing over there but um it's called The Rock The Rock Georgia you know so so it makes sense you know and as as you're driving by and you see other people's houses and stuff you see a lot of rocks like big rocks in their yards you know whatnot so that's something that I did not take into consideration so when I'm making my Gardens and whatnot I tend to hit rocks and I don't mean just little rocks I mean big boulders that I hit that I have to either grow around try to dig up some of them I've been able to dig up but I mean I got rocks that are like you know big big as people you know what I mean so like you can't just dig those things up especially with me I don't have any um equipment like that I just have my hands my shovel and whatnot to to get that kind of stuff up so I'm able to get some of them up but for the most part they I have to work around them you know so um that is definitely something that I was like okay yeah I I messed up when it came to that now if I had known that would I have still purchased the property yes yes I would I I love this property I mean I absolutely love it it has a a healing feeling to it and I don't know if you understand what I mean by that but it it's the type of place that when you come to it you just get uh amazing energy from it and man it seems like everything that I do here like succeeds you know so um yeah I wouldn't I wouldn't trade this property for anything what I am going to do um eventually is my my uh stand is going to be moved to a different property um probably in the next three or four years uh where I will have a hunting property and then I can change everything back here to Growing I'm already growing my um Orchard back there I can also grow you know corn or you know wheat or something back there as well so that's my three things that I think that um you know every beginner Homesteader that's looking to purchase property really needs to be looking at um the location the amenities or the resources around that location and the condition of the property um you may even be looking at those things and like me I was looking at the soil you know I was checking the soil out I was checking out the conditions the the Topography of the of the land but I didn't take into consideration the big old rocks that they have here and I mean when you're doing anything you putting up posts you doing anything anything you have to dig into the ground um it's tough when you got big boulders that you have to deal with uh but the good thing about rocks is if you get one that's deep enough it's a good support you know so you can you can put a post on on top of it you know that post is never going to sink so you you can use it for for good you know um or uh find the good in it I guess you could say but hey that's my three tips that's the three things that I think that you really need to focus on um hey if I missed anything definitely get down in the comments let me know uh you know if you're a season Homestead or and you maybe you've bought a couple Properties or whatnot definitely let me know if there were some things that you would have added into this list um obviously it's a short list just three items but within those three items I think there's a lot there's a lot to uh unpack in those three uh categories that that I um those three categories that I feel are very very very important to the uh beginning Homesteader all right well that's it I really appreciate you guys uh hanging in there with me and um hey make sure you do all the YouTube stuff make sure you uh like share subscribe and uh hey I'll see you in the next video",
