00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:04,259
hey guys it's Anne welcome to the

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,420
channel if you're new here and you are

3
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:08,880
looking for a very active worm Community

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,200
that's always willing to answer your

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,240
questions then you are in the right

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,440
place today we're looking at my red

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,400
wigglers in the DIY three stack system

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,220
and one of the things I want to talk

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,820
about today is should you go to the

10
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:25,980
trouble of making your own DIY system or

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,539
should you just spend the money and get

12
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,820
a professional setup

13
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,679
so as I'm going to go through and

14
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,079
evaluate what the bin needs today I'm

15
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:37,739
just going to talk about my journey and

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,960
the fifth year of having my DIY system

17
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:42,540
that I made myself

18
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:46,800
so last time we did a really big Harvest

19
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:48,960
to get some castings and so we also fed

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,940
them some decent amount of food so let's

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,980
see what they've got left and see what

22
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,020
they need for today so looking at the

23
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,000
top layer here this is where I returned

24
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,539
the worms to the system you can see they

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,280
made some nice castings right there

26
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:04,920
and kind of just gonna go through here

27
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,780
and fluff everything up and see what

28
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,760
we've got

29
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,340
I'm seeing quite a bit of bedding here

30
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,880
but I'm not seeing anything in the way

31
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:17,700
of food on this layer

32
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,180
so in the nice warm weather you can

33
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,400
expect for your worms to

34
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,320
do really well

35
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,000
I mean not really hot I mean I think if

36
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,100
you have the worms outside and it's 100

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,600
degrees Fahrenheit the worms will

38
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,060
probably go dormant

39
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,540
but in a basement that is you know 80

40
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:40,380
degrees Fahrenheit then the worms just

41
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:42,000
keep plugging along and continue to do a

42
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,560
really good job

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,439
so you can see the moisture is a little

44
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:50,340
bit low in here

45
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:52,619
but I tend to run my bins a little drier

46
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,420
just so that I have an easier time

47
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:56,460
harvesting

48
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,320
because the last time if you watched the

49
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,939
last video I did a light Harvest and

50
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,759
that is a lot of work and it really kind

51
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:04,740
of annoys the worms so I do try to avoid

52
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,380
doing that and I try and at least get

53
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,340
one layer to be kind of dryish so I can

54
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,860
sift

55
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,300
so there's really nothing to see here on

56
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,840
this layer it looks like there's some

57
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,620
old corn cobs here a little bit of

58
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,379
um

59
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,900
avocado shell but other than that

60
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:23,700
there's no food on this layer just looks

61
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,819
like casting's embedding

62
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:30,959
let's look at the next layer down

63
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:33,599
okay so this layer down here has a lot

64
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,160
more moisture and that is always the

65
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,920
case with this bin

66
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,660
so the top layer stays dry because I

67
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,060
don't put a lid on it

68
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:44,340
I find that the worms actually crawl

69
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,739
more if you put a lid on because that

70
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,239
keeps the sides of the bin wet and then

71
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:49,500
they just want to go exploring and see

72
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,120
what's going on

73
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,480
if you keep the top of the bin a little

74
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,180
bit dry then they are less nosy and they

75
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,200
tend to stay inside of their

76
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,660
um

77
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:03,780
inside the bedding and inside the bin I

78
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:06,300
did have a question about that and

79
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,280
another thing that worms tend to crawl

80
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,680
is if you have a very new bin and let's

81
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,720
just call new bin younger than six

82
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,599
months old

83
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:19,019
um under six months old the environment

84
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:21,420
of the bin is just not established and

85
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:23,159
so it might not be as comfortable and

86
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,200
home like

87
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:27,420
for the worms and they might still want

88
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,560
to go seek other places but once you get

89
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:34,379
your bin to a nice equilibrium where the

90
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,640
microbes and the moisture and everything

91
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:37,860
in here

92
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,720
feels good to them they don't really

93
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,459
tend to crawl too much

94
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,140
now that's red wigglers I'm talking

95
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:45,260
about in particular

96
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:49,200
other worms have different personalities

97
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:51,180
or traits like African night crawlers it

98
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,580
doesn't seem to matter what you do in my

99
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:56,280
area they crawl

100
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:58,739
but not seeing anything in this and it's

101
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,920
been about three and a half four weeks

102
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:04,920
since we looked in on this bin before

103
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,200
so all of these castings are you know

104
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,840
still doing good that mango last time

105
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,120
wasn't wanting to open and it's still

106
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,760
not wanting to open yet but this is

107
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,979
probably a really happy moisture for

108
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,100
them you can make kind of a ball but it

109
00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:22,199
falls apart very easily

110
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:24,720
if you're into wanting to grow your herd

111
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:26,520
of worms herd is that the right word I

112
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,979
don't know if you want to grill more

113
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,380
worms then actually more wet than this

114
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:33,660
is the preferred you know moisture you

115
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:36,900
want like 80 percent moisture if you

116
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:39,900
want to encourage them to breed

117
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:42,720
I don't need more worms so this is just

118
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:45,840
fine for me it's not unhealthy it's just

119
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,880
not uh perfect breeding moisture

120
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,460
let's look at the next layer down

121
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,600
so this layer and these are risers this

122
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,060
just keeps everything from getting

123
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,220
compacted

124
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,660
um

125
00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:00,300
that was a suggestion by one of the

126
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,940
viewers to uh keep this part from

127
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,979
becoming completely compacted

128
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,960
and make it better for the worms so I

129
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:08,160
started doing that and it absolutely has

130
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,800
worked

131
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,940
now this bottom layer here is very very

132
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,180
wet

133
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:17,400
this is probably an ideal breeding

134
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,500
condition for the worms

135
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:22,440
probably about 80 percent moisture in

136
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:25,380
here you could make mud balls with this

137
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,780
the springtails are a springing in here

138
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:29,039
they definitely like this moisture level

139
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,620
as well

140
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:36,240
and although they're annoying to me they

141
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:38,340
are a part of the worm bin community and

142
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,340
they do help break down things that are

143
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:43,020
too hard for the worms to eat

144
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:45,000
by themselves

145
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:48,479
so one of the things I wanted to talk

146
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,919
about as far as the the DIY bin

147
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:55,199
is that I made it five years ago and the

148
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:57,479
plastic is starting to give way I'll put

149
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,400
an inside a picture there

150
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:02,460
any place where I've drilled a

151
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,380
significant hole in it like the sides or

152
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:06,900
the the bottom

153
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:10,080
I am finding that that particular

154
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:12,660
plastic is failing and uh this

155
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,580
particular bottom layer does not have

156
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,440
any holes on it at all no holes in the

157
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:18,120
bottom no holes in the side This was

158
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,259
meant to be a sump where all the liquid

159
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,919
would drain

160
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:22,020
um

161
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,699
but if you watch the

162
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:27,060
the playlist of this you'll discover

163
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:28,740
that at some point I decided that since

164
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,240
so many worms were coming down there and

165
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,400
drowning I might as well just put

166
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,979
bedding down there for them to live if

167
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:38,160
they were going to do that

168
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:42,300
so this bottom part rarely gets anything

169
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:46,139
other than refresh of bedding time over

170
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:47,759
time it the worms I don't know the hole

171
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,199
that goes down into this layer is a

172
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,120
sixteenth of an inch which is only a

173
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,620
couple of millimeters and so most of

174
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,840
these worms probably came down here when

175
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,340
they were much smaller and they're

176
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,080
probably just stuck down here now

177
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:00,000
because

178
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,759
they probably can't get back up through

179
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,360
you know a two or three millimeter hole

180
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:08,639
at you know adult size

181
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,979
so I'm going to leave these guys here

182
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,740
and we'll put the second layer

183
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:15,960
on so looking at this second layer here

184
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,400
I'll show you what I'm talking about

185
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,560
foreign

186
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,000
and sure enough just as I said I don't

187
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,800
think adult worms can make it through

188
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,840
that three millimeter hole

189
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,199
there's a reasonably adult-sized worm

190
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,400
going through the two millimeter hole

191
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:31,380
well

192
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,360
I guess like I always say worms do what

193
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:36,240
they want

194
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,220
so this layer down here is

195
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,960
in a good condition

196
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:47,400
but we're going to give them some food

197
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:50,099
the side of this bin is broken and kind

198
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,199
of jagged so it seems like if you do a

199
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:53,880
DIY system

200
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:55,319
depending on the quality of the plastic

201
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,639
and these were you know name brand

202
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:58,680
Rubbermaid

203
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,479
containers so in theory I would have

204
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,759
thought the plastic would have been high

205
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:05,639
enough quality to withstand being a worm

206
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:07,340
bin for many many years but I think five

207
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:10,740
years might be the limit on these guys

208
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:13,139
cost me about thirty dollars for the

209
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,120
three bins and then when we take a

210
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:17,039
closer look at the top I also drilled

211
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,240
some large holes and then put screen on

212
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,160
there

213
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,660
that's not even necessary but that's

214
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,919
what I thought I needed to do in the

215
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,240
beginning

216
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:26,039
so

217
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,660
um but I'm starting to see where any

218
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:29,340
place that there was good sized holes

219
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,419
I'm seeing that the plastic is starting

220
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,399
to break

221
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:35,880
and I do have to wonder after looking

222
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:38,459
online at the different plastic

223
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:41,099
stackable systems they're warrantying

224
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:42,479
the plastic for 20 years so I'm starting

225
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:45,839
to think it's not the same kind of

226
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,660
plastic from a Rubbermaid tote to a

227
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:51,000
professional stacked worm system

228
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:52,860
so let me get them some food

229
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
let's see so they're going to get a

230
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:59,640
tomato and some zucchini

231
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,640
another tomato

232
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,779
and an avocado peel so onions tomatoes

233
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,240
so they've got their own guacamole

234
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:07,980
makings if that's what they want to do

235
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:12,140
and I'm just going to cover that back up

236
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:12,140
with the the regular castings here

237
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,160
and let me put the top on and I'll show

238
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:20,220
you what I mean about the larger holes

239
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:24,180
and things are starting to break

240
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:26,100
so I have the half inch holes that I

241
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,839
um hot glued screens on to to keep

242
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:31,560
larger Critters out

243
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:33,120
most of them have fallen off and the

244
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,740
ones that are still there just the

245
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,839
slightest little bump and they come off

246
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,120
I found out later these are really not

247
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:41,580
necessary I mean it was it was a nice

248
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,380
DIY project but

249
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,640
um you know now what I know about worms

250
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,920
is that

251
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,019
a worm would have gone through that if

252
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,120
they needed to if they wanted to escape

253
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:54,060
they could have gone through regular

254
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,100
window screen which is all that is

255
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:58,080
and looking at the bottom of the bin

256
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,720
here

257
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,760
looking at the larger holes

258
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,060
these are starting to break out a little

259
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:08,459
bit in a few places and although you

260
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:11,580
know it still works the bin is starting

261
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:15,180
to deteriorate so even though I spent

262
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:18,600
thirty dollars on this bin it seems that

263
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:21,839
maybe five years is as far as the

264
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,940
quality of plastic is going to let me go

265
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,519
so put in the comments below you know if

266
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:30,240
you have a DIY system that's stacked

267
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:32,519
like this how long did yours last and

268
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,040
was it worth it I started looking into

269
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:37,620
professional stacked systems and they're

270
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,899
running about a hundred dollars ninety

271
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:42,540
to a hundred dollars U.S

272
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:44,700
for a five stack system I think you can

273
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:47,640
get three stack systems for about eighty

274
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:49,800
dollars but they're also warrantying the

275
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:53,160
plastic for 20 years so I am really

276
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,959
starting to Second get guess myself was

277
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:58,200
this good for a starter until you can

278
00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:00,779
save up money or you know would you do

279
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,820
this again if you already had

280
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:04,320
the hundred dollars let's just make it a

281
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,120
flat one hundred dollars

282
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,320
if you could afford to spend that you

283
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,660
know should I have done that to begin

284
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:12,660
with okay let's get these guys some food

285
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:15,360
up here now all the frozen food will

286
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:17,640
thaw out and the drippings will go to

287
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,980
the lower level

288
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:23,760
and for any tomato lovers out there yes

289
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:26,399
having this large tomato rot on me get

290
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:29,040
bought Blossom and draw it when the uh

291
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:31,320
the floods started coming that really

292
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,880
does hurt for me to feed it to the worms

293
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,760
although I know that they will make good

294
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,740
use of it and help my plants later it is

295
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,899
very painful to throw away that large of

296
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:42,779
a tomato

297
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:45,240
okay so we're gonna cover that up and

298
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:47,160
straighten these guys out

299
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,800
so just reflecting on the last five

300
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:52,260
years of this DIY bin

301
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,120
so after five years the plastic is

302
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:56,459
coming apart in any of the hot glue

303
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:59,100
stuff is is falling off

304
00:11:56,459 --> 00:12:01,800
when these trays are completely full

305
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:04,500
each one of these trays weighs about 25

306
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:08,519
pounds maybe even 30 pounds with wet

307
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:11,519
castings and depending upon your level

308
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:12,779
of activity that might be okay but I'm

309
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,399
getting to the point where I can't pick

310
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:17,040
this whole thing up if it is close to

311
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:20,700
being finished because it weighs you

312
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:22,620
know 50 or 60 pounds depending and

313
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,600
um that's just a backache looking to

314
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:26,279
happen so I'm not

315
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,260
I try not to fill it all the way up

316
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:30,240
anymore because it gets so heavy that

317
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:32,519
you know it hurts my back

318
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,459
not to mention that the quality of the

319
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:36,120
plastic it is starting to bow in the

320
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:38,040
middle

321
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,200
I did start putting those risers in

322
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:43,019
there which I forgot in case anybody

323
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:45,000
notices if I didn't notice I I did just

324
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:46,260
now notice the pile of risers that I'm

325
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,339
going to have to disassemble and put

326
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,899
them back in

327
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:50,700
but yeah so

328
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:53,399
it bows in the middle

329
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:56,639
and it's starting to break down and it

330
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:59,519
is super heavy so I am starting to you

331
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,959
know seriously consider swapping these

332
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,000
worms out and putting them into a

333
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:05,760
professional stacked system

334
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,560
uh just basically for ease of use of me

335
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,440
because each one of those anybody who's

336
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:12,540
got a stacked professional system

337
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,339
um please chime in and let me know how

338
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:16,440
each one of those how much each one of

339
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:19,079
those waves when it's full

340
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,060
and that kind of might make me make my

341
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:23,040
decision because if each one of those is

342
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:25,260
only 10 pounds then that's not going to

343
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,740
be a problem so that is where I'm going

344
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:31,320
right now is yes it's cheaper yes it

345
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,820
saves space going vertical

346
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,800
um you know which does make more

347
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:37,380
castings which is why instead of using

348
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,200
just bus trays I used this

349
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:41,760
uh in the beginning but now I'm just

350
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,459
seeing that this plastic is breaking

351
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,980
down so what do you guys think should I

352
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:49,920
get a professional system when this this

353
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:52,620
thing is slowly dying on me or should I

354
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,120
go and get another DIY system

355
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:56,160
all right guys well if you like this

356
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,079
series I have an entire playlist that I

357
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,519
will link right over there and if you've

358
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,860
already seen that YouTube thinks you're

359
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,180
going to like that video over there okay

360
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:07,100
guys thanks for hanging out with me and

361
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:07,100
my worms and everybody have a good day
