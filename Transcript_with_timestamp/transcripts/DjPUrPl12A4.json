  "text": "welcome to the UVM extension new farmer project webinar Farm scale permaculture techniques practices and philosophies for permanent agriculture systems I'm Jesse Schmidt and I work for the UVM extension new farmer project I'll be moderating this session our presenter today is Keith Morris since 2000 he has worked professionally as a designer Builder and grower of ecologically regenerative socially just and culturally appropriate whole systems in cities and sides around the world he teaches at the University of Vermont the yes tomorrow design build School Sterling College Paul Smith's college Burlington permaculture and has worked for us Aid farmer to farmer in Nigeria and Ghana welcome Keith ah thanks Jesse it's a pleasure to be here um just uh as far as sound goes is that sounding okay to folks if you could maybe thumb up or let me know that that sounds good I think it sounds pretty good if you might be able to pull your mic a little bit away um it's just a little muffled yeah okay I can pull it away um great yeah it's a pleasure to be here and I'm really excited to be a part of the webinar series it's such a great collection of resources already there in terms of webinars um yeah so um This was um uh some stuff that we already did here as far as the map so I think I'm just going to skip through that and as Jesse said um you know I work as a designer um really my work as a designer began um working for a variety of farms um I started my own farm and I was 23 in an interesting rent to own process it's whe Crossing Farm um in Johnson Vermont where we grow um fruit trees nut trees bushes Vines medicinal herbs and we're increasingly doing added value in terms of um Farm oh um I'm hearing that I'm not I can turn my mic up how's that Ida does that sound a little better um just let me know if there sound issues again so um increasingly we're doing kind of added value production in terms of farm dinners and educational events um my other business is um Prospect Rock permaculture which is really more of a design and education aspect where I work with farmers and other institutions and Community groups to um help figure out how to make Landscapes more productive and connected um just a brief little history with that if anyone's familiar with these two areas geographically um we wheel Crossing is an area that is overlooked by Prospect Rock and um long before there was such great aerial photography that we have today I would go up to prospect Rock a bluff on the Long Trail and going to look down over my farm in order to help me uh figure things out and do some design work so um we're going to be talking about peric culture design as applied to Farms um but this isn't intended as a basic introduction to permaculture so um it's a very very big field there's a lot of things to explore um but for those of you that aren't familiar the the word comes not only from permanent agriculture but also permanent culture and kind of looking at how ecology can better inform the ways that we meet needs so everything from food really as a centerpiece you know um agriculture has always been a centerpiece of permaculture but also shelter also energy also Waste Management um how these things can be better connected and modeled after what we see working in natural systems so I have two definitions here of per culture there are hundreds um but meeting human needs while increasing e ological health and um the postmodern synthesis of all wise human behavior a big part of permaculture of course is studying traditional techniques and recombining them in in novel ways in in response to some of the things that we're facing in the 20th century so um most mostly um prob culture is a vision and a design system and it's a network of people that's really where um it's an exciting thing to be a part of there's folks all over the world using this design technique in order to actualize this this vision of a permanent culture um it's basis is in ethics which is something that's kind of unique in Land Management Systems um and in slogan form these are Earth care people care and fair share um which are kind of self-evident but obviously we want to look take responsibility for the resources that we depend on natural systems that we depend on but we're also caring for people um and and it's really um about how as I've said we're meeting human needs while while improving ecological health and recognizing that that isn't necessarily a contradiction of terms although there's certainly plenty of evidence to to lead us to believe that that may be the case um when we look at long-term human needs obviously we need to have good soil in which we grow our food we need to have clean air we need to have clean water um and then lastly and not least importantly um be share meaning limits to consumption limits to population but most importantly redistribution of our resources towards better care of the earth and better care of people um so um that's the per culture ethics in a nutshell if you aren't familiar with per culture or even if you are um I just point out here at the bottom the per culture principles. comom website which is really a great uh Resource as a as a basic introduction to protoculture ethics and principles um the design principles are varied and they're the things that we learning from our study of traditional culture and our study of ecology and what's working in any context and while we'll look at some techniques that may be Place specific or specific to a culture or E ecological context really at its core these ethics and principles will work wherever we find ourselves in the world um so I won't be getting too into depth with these principles but we'll address them a little bit um folks seeing my pointer as I move it around the screen um yeah so we'll be looking at how we can integrate pieces of our systems to be more mutually beneficial um just to kind of give a sense of the spectrum of protoculture design I'll share with you the protoculture flower and receive there's these kind of seven points of action um permaculture really encompasses how we build the tools and Technologies we use the education and our cultural aspects um health and well-being finances and economy land tenure and Community governments and land in nature stewardship so it's it's a very big uh system and you know today we're really going to be looking at just some of these um maybe specifically how we read Landscapes and um you know how agriculture fits in in terms of our land and nature stewardship um but all of these different pieces are kind of part of our herbiculture toolkit um all right so at any time if there's questions feel free to type them into the box there um I'm going to share a little bit more about my own Farm just briefly we're actually going to uh do some time travel this is an aerial photograph that was taken in 1942 of the area where I farm and in 1942 they started taking aerial photographs um as a part of uh defense strategies for World War II and they've turned out to be some really great resources for our understanding of Land Management and um I'm not going to get into too much detail but I just kind of point out the curve of the river here as it was in 1942 and also introduced these photographs not only to share my own Farm but to let you know that if you're farming um You probably it's probably going to be well worth your while to dig into the archives of the map rooms of the USDA or your local uh state land grate University or wherever these files may be archived because they will share incredible insight to the Past of our Landscapes so um as we travel through time here we're going to see a couple of things um one is that even in just a few decades um we see tremendous changes happening in our Landscapes and I'm sure we're all well aware of that but to really be able to quantify that in a place specific way can be an incredibly helpful tool in helping contextualize our own decision making process and our designs so in terms of this particular site we see that obviously there's some pretty severe erosion happening along my Riverbank um also here as we move um into 1995 we see the original farm and Homestead and barn raised and put into the ground where there's the beginnings of a of a of a church um constructed and we can see as I've started to set up my farm some of the changes happening in terms of ecological secession both allowing some areas of old pasture to to start to regrow and you know here we are with one of the more recent photograph Series where you can kind of get a sense of um what's happening on my farm which I'll talk a little bit more about um I share that because it's really critical that we make an effort to to comprehend our place in our Landscapes with long-term perspective and and do that in order to have long-term cooperation with the ecosystems that we're coopera that we're you know depending on and interacting with and most importantly use that long-term understanding as a as a point of foresight so we can do some long-term planning because that's um that's where we're going to be heading here now is um getting into some details of of how we'll do um the actual work of design um so the per culture design process it can be done in a endless variety of ways but in its simplest you know we want to be very clear about what it is that we're trying to achieve in terms of goals articulation um let's see okay and um we'll be working on maps in terms of having an actual physical record that we can refer to as we make observations about our Landscapes um the focus of today's talk is really going to be How We Do site analysis and from that analysis we're going to come up with Design Concepts which are really very kind of loose ideas and I know it's hard for many of us especially if we're Market Growers and I I actually I'll I'll take a minute just to ask um who is Farm and if folks wouldn't mind just typing into the chat box there um if you're farming if you're coming here with a specific uh site in mind in terms of where you want to apply this design process um I'd be curious to see that um okay great yeah um so we as Growers are often really good at thinking about specific props or varieties and we may have some great skills in terms of rotations and soil prep um and these are all critical you know foundational but um per culture is kind of going to flip this around a little bit and that we're not going to be starting necessarily from an individual crop or technique but really contextualizing that in the whole of our farm and this is why having a design concept comes before detailed design in our uh in our design process here in that it's really easy to determine exactly what variety you want to grow and how far apart it should be planted but what we're trying to focus on is having more importantly that these pieces are taking place within the whole um uh and and in better relationship to all the other pieces of our farm so for instance if we realize that we need uh hedro or Windbreak on a farm maybe before we even get into what species we might be using in a hedro or Windbreak is exactly how it's placed and how it relates to some of our vegetable production or grazing paddocks or Vineyards or whatever other aspects we may have so um this is great thanks everyone for for chiming in with your um this is great so hi Kevin okay so and then last of all of course you know it's not just um you know the designing but uh one of the most important pieces is is actually doing this right putting it in the ground and then of course continuing to accept feedback and recognizing that that these systems are much more akin to sailing ships and that we're constantly adjusting the sales and our rigging we're always accepting feedback and responding to change we're responding to Market we're responding to what's working we're responding to what we're enjoying um and it's it's a very Dynamic process and unfortunately we're we're never done um okay so um goals articulation in and of itself is something that honestly we could do a full hour's webinar on because it is so critical and and I won't um spend a whole hour talking about goals articulation but um I will encourage enage any of you who are planning to bring a design process to your farm to do some very very thorough goals articulating um which is a little bit different than goal setting right it's it's about figuring out really what it is that you're um that's really res making your heart resonate right it's not about kind of setting external objectives and um on my website prospect rock.org there is some educational resources and in there is a document that gives you some detailed exercises to help you um articulate goals and honestly even if you aren't yet farming or even don't have a piece of land where you're farming you may be even in the best position to do some goals articulation and as I work with clients you know honestly a lot of times the place I prefer to work with place at least I have the highest Leverage is is if folks have um some ideas but they don't necessarily have a space yet um meaning to say you know that you can do a lot with any given piece of land but if you know that you want to do vegetable production or if you know you want to do an apple orchard if you know you want to be grazing animals having those goals really clearly articulated beforehand is really going to determine the criteria that you use to choose where you farm and um I can't I can't understate that it's it's so important that um that we you know actually build these practices um if possible you know I I recommend folks start Market farming before they buy land before they you know bite off a big chunk of debt um really one of the biggest pieces of course for Market growing is is being strategic about where you are relative to markets and thinking about what you want to grow and who's going to buy it and are you in a position where Farm Stand makes a lot of sense or whether there's a tourism industry and there's a lot of restaurants serving really good food so um doing that goals articulation as soon in the process as possible and continuing to do it um is critical um holistic management also offers a really great toolkit for us in in doing some goals articulation and um after the session you may want to check in with Jesse I'm not sure if they're still doing a whole Farm planning course but um for those of you who are in Vermont there has been and I believe will be again a uh a whole Farm planning course which really helps Farmers through um some of the business planning processes and you know making sure that those business plans really resonate with our ourselves and our lives um here we go thanks Jesse for the link um one one piece of the goals articulation process in holistic management that I want to share here is just this idea of uh a house and thinking of our goals really as as a house the foundation being our core values and our ethics those things that we refuse to compromise on and really being doing a lot of introspection and thinking about um you know why it is that you want to farm and making sure that your daily activities and all the work that you do in terms of chores and and and your work is kind of based on those ethics and values rather than compromising them and then one of the pieces that I think is is really unique um is of course the Legacy and thinking about in a permaculture perspective intergenerational decision- making like how we are leaving our farms and landscapes for future generations of people whether they're our own ancestors or not um in the in the holistic management process one way of doing this is actually writing your obituary which may seem morbid to folks but um it's actually can be very fun and to do this I find just really offers such an incredible Insight on um you know writing down what we want to have said after about us after we're gone and and then having that as a as a written document to refer to in our decision-making process and um be able to make decisions based on that idea of Legacy like is is are this decisions going to support that um that Legacy that we're trying to create so um excuse me in that vein of long-term planning or or intergenerational thinking um there's a couple other things that I think you know are a part of where permaculture design came about in response to that are really critical for us as our Growers and Farmers to be considering in our farming plans um most of you have probably heard about peak oil and are somewhat familiar with it I'm not going to go too in depth with it but of course the reality at present is that we're at a point in history where we probably have the most resources available to human beings at any time before or after and for the whole Arc of history of course you know we've we've had more resources available than previous generations have but we're extremely novel in the new situation of recognizing that we have more resources available to us than previous generations had excuse me then future Generations will so um that's definitely something to take into consideration when we're thinking about our farm plans um not only on the annual basis but on the five or 10e basis and really recognizing that this provides an opportunity at present for us to in invest energetic resources to invest fossil fuels to build some of the infrastructure that we may need that may be more difficult to build in the future so um and this is really kind of where my business is positioned to a degree in that we work with folks to establish green houses and food processing facilities and root sellers which quite frankly are energetically intensive and um can be expensive but when we look at the return on those Investments over years um they're not going to get any cheaper to build and they'll start paying back the minute you build them so um we'll look at some other examples of how we might invest fossil fuels into our systems but um here's just uh another graph of the same kind of information that also includes Consumer Debt load which I think is really important piece because um when we're thinking long term we also want to recognize that a lot of our Farms are present are very dependent on global economic systems that are frankly outside of our control and the the challenge that we face as we move into the 21st century is how we make our farms and our communities um locally viable and really food food producers and land managers are at the centerpiece of this potential for um for resilient EOS economies for economies that are not dependent on the whims of the stock market or foreign exchange um currency rates so um that just sets some context as well and then of course dealing with the reality of climate change here we have a graph of our 1990 USDA hardness map and you know again anybody who's who wants to just play with some of the interactive technology feel free to just you know throw your little dot on the map and we'll look at how this changes from 1990 to 2006 um sorry I just wiped away everyone's dots but um I'll go back and do it again we're seeing a pretty clear trend of moving hardiness zones and in some areas of the country that can mean actually cool cooler um here in Vermont there's very very clear evidence that we're seeing um warmer weather and especially warmer Winters um as far as the act the objective records go um that has major implications for our food systems you know when we look to the forecasts of climate we see you know this is New Hampshire but um with aggressive reduced emissions scenarios where you know we Implement carbon sequestration and and reduce emissions we're still looking at New Hampshire behaving as the virginas by the end of the century although more likely we're looking at New Hampshire behaving as the Carolinas um so these are all factors that that we want to take into play as we think about what techniques we use what crops we use what strategies we employ and you know I'm not trying to be the uh the harbinger of do here but the more closely we pay attention to climate scientists really the scarier this stuff gets right um we're seeing here this kind of Arc of temperature and um just notice how close we are to temperatures that human beings have not lived on the planet in and then of course the forecast for our present emissions um clim climactic response to our present emissions so I'm not trying to scare any one here um but I am trying to maybe do some goals articulation for all of us collectively in terms of the importance of making our Farms carbon negative of making our Farms climate resilient because unfortunately with all of the forecasts and models out there honestly um no predictions are going to be that accurate everything's unfolding more rapidly than was imagined and the only things that we can really be certain of are increased incidents of severe weather we're going to see late Frost we're going to see early Frost we're going to see drought we're going to see you know torrential downpour here in Vermont most of you arew that we've seen um secessions of record-breaking floods just in the past few years and that's of course a major factor for me for those of you who are just looking at the um aerial photograph farm you may have noticed that we're right in the river valley um also now is that chance to invest fossil fuels to set up systems that don't need them as constant daily inputs in the future and um whether that's investing in Alternative Energy Systems or um irrigation systems that um and and and fertility cycling systems so that we we are not stuck with um our systems being completely dependent on things that are outside of our control if if your agricultural model involves for instance buying in a lot of grain um you know that's fine to to to make sure that you're you're meeting your your bills but you may want to be making a five or 10 year plan to start producing more of your own feed or build relationships with other local producers that may help you in that because um obviously not only the trucking but um having brain come from very far away just puts it in an increasingly fragile situation um okay and and then you know not least important is really thinking about how our economies are vibrant in local systems and really starting to weave these connections among local producers um because honestly Global e global economy um are outside of our control the forecasts don't look good but that said I'm I'm not trying to look into a crystal ball here um but what I am saying is that we see healthy economies happening all over and we can make an intention to be a part of them more directly and to create these relationships among local producers and our local communities that really bring real economic health economic health that's based on appropriate student ship of of of resources and regeneration of resources as as good Farms are capable of doing um okay and as you know we're seeing things like the food safety modernization act and all these other um you know uh Staples Commodities debt speculation all these things that are somewhat outside of our control are um we're we able to insulate ourselves to them as we build real relationships with real people on a face-to-face basis um you know it's very concerning I'm sure many of you who are Growers are paying a lot of close attent especially smaller Growers are paying a lot of attention to the food safety modernization act and all of these certification processes even organic become less relevant when we know our customers our customers know who we are um and we're directly engaged um so when when when people know who they can trust they they all become necessary of course and that's the reason we're seeing the demand for these types of laws is because when food production is totally out of sight with zero relationship um there's a lot of risk um in terms of health so let's take an opportunity now to build these relationships preemptively so that we're well positioned despite the frankly potentially you know corporate controlled regulation that that's unveiled um okay so getting back to our kind of landscape design process um we'll I'll just go back to our um design process as a whole for a brief second if I can find the right slide yeah sorry I I drew all over it but um so we're doing some articulation um and let's presume we've done some base mapping for for most of you you know unfurling a big piece of paper and drawing a map of your farm by hand is going to suffice honestly to do this at detail with scale for the Big Ideas is less important certainly as you get into some of the more detailed aspects like how many of a certain plant or how wide certain rows are you're going to need to work at scale but for the big picture ideas rough and out of scale is is better than doing it too scaled because I find you know if we try to make these Maps too carefully we don't have as much fun just kind of throwing our ideas out on paper but really the center piece of the process is um better understanding our Landscapes and that site analysis and assessment and um we can do that through What's called the scale of permanence and the scale permanence is something that actually is predates permaculture but um it's a really great tool that we have to understand our leverage essentially so starting from climate which is sure globally and Society wide we're impacting climate but on our own individual Farms there's not much that our decisions affect how much rain we get in a year how cold it gets during the winter um you know where we are relative to the equator or poles and we're primarily responding to that that's not something we're designing for whereas as we get down to the other end of the spectrum things like how our farm feels to people when they walk on or what it looks like is entirely under our control and so this spectrum is basically from the most permanent aspects of our landscape um down to the least permanent or I should say the ones that are most easily influenced by Design so that doesn't mean so we're designing in response to these aspects and then increasingly we're able to design these um along our own goals so starting with climate um obviously things like average precipitation um and rainfall are great but we want to look not just to averages but also to extremes and especially recently you know averages are great Baseline information to pay attention to but we also want to know what is the most rain that we've ever had what is the longest drought that we've ever had um what is the hottest that it's ever gotten what is the coldest that it's ever gotten and make our Farms as resilient as possible not just to averages but also to extremes um and then of course as as I think I've already um made clear we really need to pay attention to how climate's changing and anticipate that and as a part of our climate analysis so here we see a more detailed um hardiness zone map is an updated one for Vermont and we also see the Vermont State climate Trends um looking over the past 50 years um which is showing um pretty clear warming trend based on the numbers as well as um much more extreme warming during winter months um which might have some advantages for us as Growers frankly but also has some disadvantages and as I mentioned earlier the reality of these forecasts is that the the the climate change is kind of a um it's it's almost a misleading phrase because it it seems to indicate gradual unify uniform benign predictable whereas I think this phenomenon is better understood as as climate chaos or climate collapse and I I don't mean to say that things are hopeless but I mean to say we really want to buffer ourselves from floods we want to buffer ourselves from winds we want to have as much diversity as possible in our crops and and techniques so that something's always winning um regardless of what's Happening you know I'm here um in Northern Vermont in what's classically considered a Zone 3 and we had bumper crops crops of peaches um and as far as I know they were the first peaches ever grown in theor valley of Vermont and we just happen to have the right conditions during pollination that um we had great fruit set and I'm not banking on having a peach CR every year but it's pretty exciting and um I think you know we all have a little room to do some experimentation in regards to um variables okay um all right so landform then is kind of our next most permanent after climate and let's see if I can get my little drawing thing here yes perfect so great um so obviously you know things like a basic sorry folks things like a basic toppo map of course can be really really helpful information here but really um it might be that you just sit down and kind of draw everything that has anything to do with the land form of your farm steep Ledges where you see Boulders or Bedrock expressed um what's flat what's Steep and kind of we're making these maps on I make them on tracing paper so that I can um I can overlay them one after another um this particular topo map is from Libra maps.org um it's the USGS topography but it's um huge Contour intervals and honestly doesn't tell us very much about our Farms if you've ever had a survey done or if there's any surveys on record with um uh having done a septic system or anything like that these are going to be way more detailed and in some cases it's totally worth paying a surveyor or working with your you know your USDA and or CS you might be able to support these things depending on what practices you're trying to do so we recently actually I'm sorry I wasn't able to upload it into the slideshow but we recently had an actual you know micro topography made of our farm um and just kind of looking at these patterns of erosion and deposition and how that influences the big big overlays of the way our Farms work um water of course is an is another one um and in the case of my particular Farm what we're looking at overlaid here is essentially the flood plane and you can kind of see in the layout of crops um as as if you can see in the land of crops we're kind of on these islands in the flood plane which is which is fortunately positioned that way because we've had opportunity to observe multiple hundred-year floods and in the past few years we've seen two or three 500e floods um and one of the main efforts of our farm is to be reforesting um buffers so that our more sensitive production some of the more valuable crops are um protected so when we put water and land form together we end up with a wide variety of techniques but um what we're looking at here is an image of what's called keyline design specifically we're looking at Mark Shepard's Farm in Wisconsin um who's this was farm this was a cornfield this was Bare black dirt when he started and um the entire layout is arranged over very nuanced expressions of topography and keyline design is is again another topic that's kind of a a whole webinar in and of itself um but long story short what we're looking at is managing water as it moves off our landscape so instead of our kind of conventional management which is shunting shunting water to a drainage ditch where it close off the farm as quickly as possible we're spreading it out along so basically you know the flow of the hills in this direction and as rainwater rolls over the farm instead of gaining speed and momentum and carrying soil off it is spread across the farm and these ditches are actually not they're not really ditches but they're um these um they are like kind of plow lines that are not actually on Contour they are slight off Contour so that water is being better distributed towards the dry ridges and and and making it more even um also of course tremendously preventing erosion also of course instead of having all that water fly off of our Farms when we get tons of rain and then it's dry it's storing that water in our systems and basically working like a battery so that we're between heavy rain and periods of dry were way balanced in the middle so here's here's Mark Shepard here um and in these rows of trees he's growing Oaks uh sweet Acorn Oaks he's growing chestnuts he's growing hazelnuts he's grazing animals he's um on rotation doing annual vegetables um it's it's a really great example of kind of farm scale permaculture design so here's just a little bit more of what key line can look like this is in Australia where um you know water scarcity is a major issue especially on pasture land and this is key line where the key line management is specifically diverting water into these ponds which are then able to be released as passive irrigation so no pumps just entirely Gravity by holding water as high as it's possible in the landscape um um for for many of us um this may not necessarily mean ponds but it could mean something like a water tank um in fact we just recently were citing a livestock shelter at a farm for some friends and decided to put the livestock shelter on the highest possible part of the landscape we put it basically on the top of the hill and we did that because we put a huge roof on the livestock shelter which a made for nice Shady space for the animals in the summer it's open walled with the open walls facing south so that it creates this warm microclimate for the animals during the winter months and that whole roof area is used to fill a giant it's a 2,000-gallon water tank um which fills almost instantly I think most of us aren't aware of how a drain really comes in an event you're you're going to get um6 gallon approximately 6 gallons per inch of rain per square foot of roof area so you do the math on that 100 square feet which is an incredibly small building you're going to get about 60 gallons of water just of 100 square feet so you put a thousand or a few th000 gallon water tank there and in the case of this instance we had all the water needs for the livestock there from the rainwater catchment without having to run plumbing up there and then we had because it was at the top of the hill the ability to run a hose out of it to any other parts of the Garden or pasture completely passively without any pumps so um there's another example of key Line Design and then another aspect of key line is the key line plow and this is how these ditches can be made to manage the water as I said and they're also used of course to deepen top soil and bring the organic and biologic components of soil a little bit deeper which is being used which with Incredible success by a organization known as carbon farmers and carbon farmers are essentially quantifying to what degree they're sequestering atmospheric carbon in their soil simply by deepening their top soil and of course it makes plants more productive um it makes pastures healthier um and is is it holds incredible promise for um for sequestration of atmospheric carbon okay so vegetation in Wildlife is another we're we're not necessarily going through every layer of the scale of permanence but um I encourage you to um you know if you come back and view this slideshow you know you can you can go to slides like this and also I'll Direct toward some resources where these things can be found online but essentially every single one of these needs to be thought about very very carefully and then put together and it's a lot of fun to do um it it does take time but it's time that's infinitely worthwhile and as we overlay these different things as different Maps we find that no matter how intimately familiar we are with our farms and Landscapes you'll come to new discoveries you're going to learn um and one of the reasons I like to do it with tracing paper is of course as I overlay different layers on top of each other for instance microclimate on top of vegetation and Wildlife I may find why there's different ecological communities on different parts of the farm um more obviously I me come to understand why we're seeing some of these differences um especially water and access you know as we overlay those we may learn the catchment area that's really coming through a CT or something like that and better understand why we're seeing roads blow out um and uh have some different opportunities for management okay so vegetational Wildlife is is one of the bigger ones and one of the more complex ones it's one you know you can spend a lot of time just you know identifying the vegetation on your farm um you you can um look things up in field guides which is really great one um process that I really like is using field Guides of natural communities which are a little bit different than the field guides that you might use for say identifying an individual tree or shrub or wildf flower um field guides to Natural communities are field guides to the groups of plants and animals and how they interact which is very very help ful for us when we're doing um broadscale Farm design to understand exactly what ecological community that a farm once was or could be in the case of my farm here um as we look at Islands like this and we look at the the the semblance of vegetation that was left on this hay field um this uh would key out as What's called the sugar maple ostrich Fern flood plane Forest um so that's um an incredibly valuable tool for us to use as a point of inspiration um on the one hand it shows me okay that you know we already have very valuable vegetation in the over story and the under story both sugar Maples and fiddleheads or ostrich F but um more importantly it allows me to do what we call ecological analoges so as we determine which plants we are looking in as crops um we can look for instance to the butternut which is juggling CA one of the Native nut trees to this community however the butternut is subject to a blight and they're diseased so we're working at hybridizing the butternut with the Japanese Walnut the heartnut to create something that's a little bit more valuable to us a little bit more resilient that said we're still planting butternuts we have a lot of hope for them and as we go on with this hybridization we're finding some of the ones most suitable to our specific place um another kind of halfstep analog of course is the black walnut and as we're looking at climate change um we're also of course anticipating uh warmer weather and experimenting even with the Carpathian Walnut which um I wouldn't necessarily recommend spending a lot of money investing in if you're if you're in Northern Vermont but by all means potentially experimenting with it's a it's a the carping Walnut being uh typically not Hardy but the one of the more valuable in terms of Walnut production it's you know the walnuts that you buy in the supermarket are almost entirely jugin regia the Carpathian Walnut um and the shag bark Hickory Kio ovada and even karia ilanis which is our peacon and quote unquote you can't grow peons in Vermont but um my peon trees haven't read the books so they are doing fine and we'll see you know whether we're going to be getting uh nuts ripening in our short season um we're not banking on them we're not planting them entirely but um I think I really just want to drive around in a nut Shaker which is one of the reasons why uh I'm planting so many nut trees but also of course because of where my farm is um in terms of floods so let's let's actually go to the kind of overall concept of the farm a little bit um which is you know we're you we're still doing some annual production we're still doing some tillage but all of that tillage is contextualized in the establishment of what we're calling productive buffers now any buffers is good and there's some great um programs out there to subsidize and support folks reforesting along the River's Edge but they're pretty strictly um purely native plants that are not productive and um that's good but when you look at the the the the finances a lot of farmers of course are somewhat reluctant to enter these relationships because their crops may be much more valuable than their buffers but when we're looking at high value Lumber when we're looking at nuts fruits medicinal herbs Vines berries um it it may take a few more years but we're looking at things that are actually yielding more value in the long run than any crop they'd be growing in The River's Edge but which with with permanent Roots so um I'm very excited about the potential for reforesting agriculture but by no means do I mean to say that you know all of our Farms totally be reforested um it's always going to take shape completely differently based on every different farm and every different farmer goals um for our farm it is high value fruits nuts medicins and um and Vines and berries especially concentrated in the areas that are prone to erosion um we're working with the Anglers Association who recognize the um the ability to shade the stream and prevent nutrients from washing into the river and most importantly for us as floods come through our farm having these buffers established prevents immediate physical damage from flopam or Woody debris or icebergs um which we see pretty regularly and also makes for incredible habitat so this was an earlier draft of our design and um we see here kind of a more recent one and this one was a map done specifically for our irrigation plan but um if you look in the upper portion um I'm not sure if that's too small to be read but um you can see kind of our layout and how what I'm getting at when I'm stressing this idea of a design concept which is to say that of course it's important to plan your rotations and have things spaced at the right distance but more importantly is thinking about the big picture of the parts of our farm and how they fit together as an organism as a whole um so and how are animals able to integrate with some of our other production systems for instance here we see one of our production rows of hazelnuts um in the fall as the hazelnuts are ripening we fence our chickens in which completely weed the plants fertilize the plants and prevent squirrel pation as well as um being kind of isolated in the areas of high activity um which really limits how much squirrels are willing to risk getting across the farm um which kind of leads me to introduce another one of our um design principles which is zones of use um which is essentially a tool looking at like our daily patterns of activity on a farm um starting out you know in your bedroom when you wake up and thinking about how our chores unfold based on our normal daily activity and if you find yourself you know needing to cross the entire Farm to get to the dairy barn or the greenhouse or some of these High um maintenance tasks you're spending a lot of time and energy that's not that productive and maybe you're not able to move your barn or Greenhouse but you can make the path from your door to there um where your main garden rows are so that as you're walking through them you're able to at least keep an eye on things if not even pull some weed or do some harvesting and really as much as possible lay our Farms out along the um the putting things which need the most attention in the places where they're going to get it um one of the reasons undoubted that we had such success with our peaches is I put my peach in a place where I walk by it every single day and I have a few trees and the ones that I don't see they don't get watered when it's dry they don't get thinned whereas the one that I was walking by day in and day out if a bug was biting a peach I noticed it I picked that one off um if there was a bow starting to eat the bark um which did happen to one of the ones kind of out of the way um I was able to respond to that immediately so put things that need care and attention in the places where they're naturally going to get it as much as possible um I I I think um we can kind of start to summarize and I might like to um uh provide an opportunity for any other comments or questions before we end but most importantly I just want to encourage you to make maps have a lot of fun kind of draw out your dreams and really think things through you know does design can be intimidating but it's also an incredible amount of fun and you know it's it's iterative we're always learning and we're always making mistakes but when we can make those mistakes on paper um it saves us a lot of time energy and resources um and get out in the landscape and you know use some stakes and flagging and if you're thinking about you know where you might site your barn or Greenhouse or or one of your next rows maybe flag it or stake it first and walk by it for a few weeks and really feel it out I'm planning on building a barn at my farm right now and I staked the four corners and had it there to the point that I saw the barn and people would be you know walking across this open area of grass and I was like oh you're standing in my barn and what happened one day I pulled in with a trailer behind my truck and I couldn't make the turn without clipping the corner of the barn however fortunately the corner of the barn was simply a wooden stake that hadn't been constructed yet and I was able to kind of accept that feedback and learn that the this position of the bar needed to move if I wanted to continue to access that one route with truck and trailer um so as we we close on these images here I just want to share the aogi farm which is in Putney Vermont um really absolutely inspiring Pioneers in growing rice um in Vermont and the uh Mr rogi's you know a Japanese born American who reads Japanese and has been reading all the research that has happened in the past few years to bring uh rice to the northern islands of Japan and these are areas of their farm that would have otherwise been considered unproductive kind of spongy Fields this is you know what they look like in the early season turned into some of the most beautiful productive and profitable areas of their farm so the more we can kind of think through how problems might be made into Solutions and how all these pieces integrate and reciprocate to to feed off of each other um the the more resilient our Farms become so anyway um we're nearly closing if there are any last comments or questions feel free to um throw them in the box there I'm sorry we only had an hour obviously it's kind of a teaser there's a lot of information um to try to fit but I hope you found it worthwhile and um stay tuned to the UVM extension webinars next week is going to be uh uh one on Shake mushrooms which I'm excited about and um here Jesse shares our our link for feedback so um yeah great everyone um thank you so much for join hey everyone um thanks for joining us and thank you so much Keith for being with us um and and uh we really appreciate all the information you shared um Tina Barney had a question hi Tina uh she said do current use reviewers recognize permaculture principles as valid and supported and for those of you outside of Vermont current use is a regulation that uh values property at an agriculture um for agriculture use and has tax implications keth do you have any experience with that um yeah thanks so current use definitely values having uh design on paper um um so they you know they've definitely it it depends which is really kind of the answer to all regulatory questions right but um if you have a working plan um you definitely need to be producing something whether it's you know whether it's pasture hay apples berries um even Timber but um the better recorded you have that and and the better documented you have any planning or planting or implementation um the easier it's going to be to to get current use great um and uh Mike Gibson asks um about young nut trees and looking for a good place to purchase them um and also do you grow yours from cuting or do you purchase your trees yeah great so we have a nursery mic that's become one of the biggest growing parts of our farm is selling young trees um particularly the Hazels where um we are now at the point of nut production with our hazelnuts that we're you know we're planting our seed out um from our own trees that we've collected in terms of some of the walnuts and chestnuts um and and pine nuts and other nuts like that we both collect seed we do Buy in some nuts um but um my website is Prospect rock.org which um you might want to check out we're going to be doing some of our Nursery sales and depending on where you are you know feel free to send me an email because if if you're not in Vermont I may know of some other um reputable nurseries um it's um it's a really exciting crop for for for me and for us um it does take a little bit time to get established but but we've started you know really carefully running the numbers and the return on investment after a few years is is um is better than than most things great Keith thanks and I know that some work has been done on uh permaculture and looking doing Financial um projection for permaculture based Farms um can you let people know about that that resource um uh because I I know that for Farmers a lot of them want to be able to uh look at Financial projections and better understand how these things are going to contribute to their bottom line yeah it's pretty nent but um there is you know some growing documentation and it's at this point somewhat crop-based there's some records that I'm aware there's there's a a real body of Records growing with um with Saskatoon in Canada and you know so all your Amal launcher your juneberries and your you know shadbush or whatever you want to call them um Elderberry um there is I'm sorry that I don't have it off the top of my head but there is a database um which again maybe if you want to just try to send me an email I could see if I could um share the link for what is uh what they basically got some like accounting spreadsheets for a couple different Enterprises great well thank you very much I see that some people might be having a trouble with our Survey Monkey link uh requiring a sign in um I'll have to double check on that it shouldn't um so try the link again when you get a chance um but I'm going to wrap up now and say thanks to everybody for joining us Keith thank you so much for taking the time to put this together and uh we look forward to seeing everyone on future webinars uh have a great afternoon thanks Jesse and thanks everyone",
