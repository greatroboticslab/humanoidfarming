00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,950
All over the world, rice is a staple

food of the people.

Over the last 20 years, rice production

6
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,520
in Africa has increased by 4%

10
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:52,830
faster. So Africa is forced to import

11
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,310
large quantities of rice.

[Music]

13
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,359
imported rice can be rice that's been

14
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,280
produced 5 years ago. So the time

15
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,200
imported rice is produced and the moment

16
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,280
we eat it in Benin will take at least 5

17
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,760
years. So this rice is old compared to

18
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,760
the local

19
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:21,759
rice. Therefore my choice is made. I

20
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:24,080
prefer living rice. Rice is produced in

21
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,320
Benin. We can be sure this rice has all

22
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:30,270
the qualities we're looking for in rice.

23
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:33,330
That is all the nutritional values.

25
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,000
Even though the rice produced in Africa

26
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,280
often has superior cooking

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,799
characteristics to the imported

28
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:46,640
rice, several practices reduce the

29
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:49,520
quality. To convince African consumers

30
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:53,759
to eat local rice, it's imperative to

31
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,759
prevent deterioration in quality.

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,040
Among the factors affecting rice quality

34
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,680
are varietal

35
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,640
mixture, harvest

36
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:12,759
date, impurities such as stones and

37
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,759
drying and storage conditions.

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,120
Here we'll learn how to avoid devaluing

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,120
the local rights.

41
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,959
To ensure good quality rice, you must

42
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,319
start right from sewing by avoiding the

43
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,519
use of a mixture of

44
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:36,000
varieties. The chairman of Central

45
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,400
Bernin's rice farmers union stresses why

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,400
this is important.

47
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,879
When one wants to grow rice, they go to

48
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,599
the market or they buy rice from the

49
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,440
neighbor or from any source. So there's

50
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,400
already a mixture of varieties in the

51
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,959
field. When this mixture is mil,

52
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,560
depending on the calibration of the

53
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:58,760
grader, if this is large, the finest

54
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,200
grains pass through without being

55
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:04,159
dehusted and the biggest grains will be

56
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,959
broken before coming out of the machine

57
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,400
because you take a mixture to the

58
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:11,599
miller. You can be sure you'll get a

59
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,959
heterogeneous rice. That's obvious. So

60
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:18,000
the seed problem must be solved and

61
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:21,680
producers have to learn that rice is not

62
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,879
like maze where yellow, red, white

63
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,120
grains can all be mixed but rice it

64
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:30,080
needs to be selected. The rice field

65
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,879
needs to be divided into plots according

66
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:36,239
to varieties so that it makes milling

67
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:39,239
easy and effective. This is very

68
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,239
important.

69
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:45,440
This seed is from a single

70
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:48,599
variety. It's only from this type of

71
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:51,040
seed that a homogeneous harvest can be

72
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:54,040
obtained and therefore there's a

73
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,799
standard product after

74
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,760
milling. The picture on the right shows

75
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,680
a mixture of

76
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:04,319
varieties. With such seed, we obtain a

77
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,480
harvest that turns out a poor product

78
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,640
after milling.

79
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,840
So, it's very important to avoid mixing

80
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,840
varieties right from

81
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,959
sewing. It's also recommended to

82
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,639
separate the various varieties

83
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,600
immediately after harvest to thresh them

84
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,440
and store them

85
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:30,080
separately because during milling a

86
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,080
mixture produces a non-standard

87
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:36,080
product. Apart from high amounts of

88
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:39,120
unmilled and broken grains, mixtures are

89
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,680
also hard to cook. Because each variety

90
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,199
has its own cooking time. So to satisfy

91
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,720
the consumer, avoid mixing the varieties

92
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,720
at all

93
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,880
stages. Harvesting at the right time

94
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,960
also helps maintain the quality of the

95
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,520
final product.

96
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,000
When we harvest too early, the patty

97
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,360
contains a lot of green grains and

98
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,800
during milling they turn into

99
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:09,120
flour. In this way, you lose a lot of

100
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,120
rice and therefore a lot of

101
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:17,919
money. Rice production demands a lot of

102
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,080
work and without care, we cannot obtain

103
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,600
a good

104
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,560
product. The harvest must not be delayed

105
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,720
until the panacles are too dry.

106
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:31,400
Because during milling, the overdrive

107
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,400
patty will only produce broken grains.

108
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,199
The right harvesting time for rice is

109
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,000
generally 5 weeks after flowering or 5

110
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,320
weeks after the appearance of the

111
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,720
panacle which is a characteristic easily

112
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,600
detectable by

113
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:59,160
farmers. At this stage also the color in

114
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,199
the grains

115
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:06,560
change. The green will turn

116
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:09,919
strawlike, yellow or even gold depending

117
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:13,039
on the variety. And generally when 80%

118
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:15,280
of the field has changed color, we can

119
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,280
start

120
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:24,479
harvesting. To ensure good quality rice,

121
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,479
ensure you harvest at the right

122
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:32,319
time. During threshing, stones and other

123
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:35,440
impurities can get in. To avoid this,

124
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:39,120
prepare a clean threshing floor. It may

125
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:41,800
be a tarpolin, bags sewn together, a

126
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,880
cemented or compacted

127
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:47,039
floor. Farmers in Bangladesh even thresh

128
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,199
on a table enclosed by bags sewn

129
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,240
together.

130
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,000
Threshing can be done by several

131
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:57,720
methods.

132
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,919
Manually or the use of pedal and power

133
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,639
threshers. Regardless of the method

134
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,720
used, threshing must always be done on a

135
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,560
clean

136
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:10,599
floor. Let's hear about an innovative

137
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,599
example of hand threshing.

138
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:16,479
Some farmers in the way we valley gather

139
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:19,520
the panacles and thresh them on a barrel

140
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:23,240
inside a mosquito net calmly and the

141
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:26,000
grains will not escape. They stay in the

142
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:28,560
net. This is an initiative of a farmer

143
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,240
who doesn't have a thresher. So to avoid

144
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:35,360
the contact with the soil and other

145
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,360
debris, they spread the nets and thresh

146
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:41,400
them. After threshing, carefully pick

147
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,880
the grains and winnow them on a clean

148
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:48,960
floor. Winnow the patty several times

149
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,960
and make sure no weed seeds

150
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:56,400
remain. After cleaning the patty of all

151
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:59,879
impurities, it's important to dry it on

152
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,879
a clean floor.

153
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:09,840
We use the tarpolin to dry the patty to

154
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,840
prevent stones from getting

155
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:15,680
in. Avoid drying on the bare floor or by

156
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,800
the roadside because stones and other

157
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,800
impurities can get

158
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,960
in. Now let's hear from the director of

159
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,360
the Songai Center, an NGO involved in

160
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,520
rice sector development in Africa.

161
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,680
quality rice could be sold twice the

162
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,919
price. So it is very very important for

163
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,880
them to invest themselves in producing

164
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:40,719
rice of quality making sure the sand is

165
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:43,519
not there the unripe rice is not there

166
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:48,560
so that the consumer who is becoming

167
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:50,320
more and more demanding will like to go.

168
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,040
Now that we've learned how to avoid

169
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,560
mixing varieties, to harvest at the

170
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,920
right time, and to avoid

171
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:02,399
impurities, let's see what effect the

172
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,399
water content has on the grains during

173
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:08,200
milling. Grains that are too dry have

174
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:11,120
cracks and break during

175
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:13,399
milling. The cracks are so small that

176
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,000
they can't be seen with the naked

177
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:19,680
eye. This phenomenon is comparable to

178
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,680
clay cracking in the sun.

179
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,560
When the rice is too dry, it breaks.

180
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,519
That's why it's tested every time by

181
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:36,680
rubbing it in the palms of the hands. In

182
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,680
this way, we avoid drying it too much.

183
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:44,320
If the sun is too high, dry the rice for

184
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,320
only a few hours in the open air. Turn

185
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,680
over the patty from time to time to dry

186
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,000
it evenly.

187
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,959
And if possible, continue to dry it

188
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,120
afterwards in the shade.

189
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,839
Dry until the grains have an acceptable

190
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:02,120
moisture content. Let's see how women in

191
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,120
a Benine village test this.

192
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,680
To know that the patty is dry, we take

193
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,680
some and rub it between the palms of our

194
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,680
hands.

195
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:16,320
We also test it with our teeth.

196
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:19,959
When it breaks at a dry crack, then the

197
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,959
patty is dry.

198
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,839
And if you think that after proper

199
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:29,839
drying the quality is guaranteed, no

200
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:33,040
way. Storage also determines the quality

201
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:36,399
of the rice because during storage the

202
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,399
patty can become moist

203
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:44,480
again. When the patty is stored directly

204
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,959
on a cement floor, It absorbs moisture

205
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,680
and then goes moldy. When the patty is

206
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:53,120
kept in a bag and stored on dry wood,

207
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:56,360
its conservation is good and it doesn't

208
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,360
go moldy.

209
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,160
As we've just heard from an experienced

210
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:04,720
trader, you should always store patty on

211
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,800
materials that support and isolate it

212
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,959
from the

213
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:11,360
ground. Avoid storing bags on rusted

214
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:14,399
iron.

215
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:17,600
Also leave a gap between the banks to

216
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:20,480
allow air to circulate and make pest

217
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,480
control

218
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:26,959
easier. As we saw, the quality of the

219
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,920
rice improves when we avoid varietal

220
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,920
mixtures and

221
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:36,959
impurities. We must also harvest at the

222
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:40,440
right time and ensure good drying and

223
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,440
patty storage.

224
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:48,800
Handling the patty well before milling

225
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,800
helps to avoid huge losses and ensures

226
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:56,519
quality. As you may well be aware by

227
00:11:52,959 --> 00:12:00,959
now, good quality rice requires

228
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:02,959
commitment and a lot of discipline.

229
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,519
It is important for we Africans to

230
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,519
really invest ourselves in quality

231
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,360
production. That culture of success,

232
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,480
culture of quality is very important for

233
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,959
us to push back all the dumping from

234
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,480
outside. If we don't do it, whether it's

235
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:19,040
African, whether it's from my mother's

236
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,800
kitchen, people are not going to buy it.

237
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,639
So we have to come to the left to be

238
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,279
competitive, we have to develop

239
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,600
competitive advantage and quality is the

240
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,920
most important element in competitive

241
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,560
advantage and it's at our reach. Within

242
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,040
our reach, we can do it.

244
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,079
African rice has excellent nutritional

245
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,000
and cooking characteristics. To ensure

246
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,560
that the final product is attractive to

247
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,440
the consumer, its quality must be

248
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,440
guaranteed at all

249
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:54,240
times. Rice farmers, traders, processes,

250
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,720
and consumers, we all have everything to

251
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,670
gain from protecting the quality of our

252
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:10,649
rice.
