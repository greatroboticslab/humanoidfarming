00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:13,660
[Music]

2
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:14,680
I was telling you that the first two

3
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,599
years were outstanding

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:18,250
we had lead we got different cover crop

5
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:20,169
mixes seeded you have these great strips

6
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:22,960
we had awesome field days with between

7
00:00:20,169 --> 00:00:24,250
40 to 80 people at them everything was

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,840
great the first year so I was like wow

9
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,239
I'm going to get two more years of this

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,250
because this is going so well and then

11
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:31,840
we got into really wet harvests and then

12
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,730
we got into PPE on a couple of our

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,829
fields and so really by the end of this

14
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:37,930
I have some great baseline data but I

15
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:40,480
don't have a lot of long-term data from

16
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:42,460
it from the four years so what I'm going

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,670
to focus on though are other

18
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:47,290
partnerships and and those partnerships

19
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:49,240
of those regional for farmers that were

20
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:50,980
part of the grants are very strong we

21
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,420
work about them I've met a lot of other

22
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:54,520
farmers through them and through those

23
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,560
boxes through those field days what

24
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,270
we've now expanded so just on our files

25
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,230
that they're doing on their parts and

26
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:00,579
things that were measuring and they've

27
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:02,440
come in as co-operators on their other

28
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:05,320
projects through commodity funding or

29
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,880
through NRCS or Sarah or any of those

30
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,490
things they participate our workshops

31
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,890
are Sarah professional development

32
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,119
workshop grants as well so so this isn't

33
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,380
going to be directly related to the

34
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,179
projects I have if you go look at the

35
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:18,639
reports online area I think it's what

36
00:01:16,179 --> 00:01:19,749
we've done is this has yeah push years

37
00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:21,999
would be great if it's the second two

38
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:24,070
years before I go over failure but I

39
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:25,750
think you'll see after way

40
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:28,659
it's really fun some great partnerships

41
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:30,190
within North Dakota because it's going

42
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:31,600
to do this I was noticing that a lot of

43
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:34,330
farmers I was talking with that part of

44
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,440
the source s podcast that we have now so

45
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm actually going to walk through it in

46
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,200
a way through their episodes and things

47
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,820
they're trying the things they explain

48
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,650
and describe so that you could go back

49
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:43,060
and listen to those different episodes

50
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:44,170
if you want to hear the farmers talk

51
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,630
about what they're doing whether they're

52
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:48,880
trying right but I think you know the

53
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:50,740
essence of our podcast was this which is

54
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,600
exactly what the partnership grant is is

55
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:54,310
that you know saw was a journey it

56
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,960
requires collaboration and curiosity

57
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:57,759
amongst farmers researchers consultants

58
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,619
and extension and those are the

59
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,330
partnerships we really focused on and we

60
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:03,039
have people from each of those groups

61
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:06,340
talking about their experiences in still

62
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:09,550
health on this podcast which the second

63
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:12,010
series now comes out at March 1st so

64
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:13,959
here's another example of the work that

65
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,730
we're doing Dave Franzen is our soil

66
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:17,890
fertility specialist and he's gone away

67
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:19,810
from doing fertility trials on research

68
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:21,880
centers and taking them out to farmers

69
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:23,620
fields because it means more it means

70
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,360
more to those farmers that have in field

71
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:28,209
data that made changes based on those

72
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,650
projects so here's de France and use one

73
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:31,930
of the most traditional rigorous

74
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:34,570
scientists that you'll find doing all

75
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:37,299
these on-farm trials because it means

76
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:39,459
more I think we can all agree to that

77
00:02:37,299 --> 00:02:40,989
it also has to be trust ready we can do

78
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:42,519
always work in the world and unless

79
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:45,220
somebody trusts us in the information

80
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:46,989
we're providing they're not going to do

81
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,930
those things so those those partnerships

82
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:51,700
won't develop and so one of the things

83
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,680
we're mostly on is system crop consult

84
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:56,170
does Lee breeze is those partnerships of

85
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,850
those relationships so I'd said earlier

86
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:02,049
when we're talking about there's a

87
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:03,640
presentation on on you know just the

88
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:04,870
crisis that's happening with our farmers

89
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,760
right then things that they're going

90
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,970
throughout their farms and probably half

91
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,200
this half of this past year I spent just

92
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:13,840
trying to help farmers through that and

93
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,550
it wasn't always about you know that

94
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,350
they were in a state of crisis or there

95
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:19,120
or they have these cos it was more just

96
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:20,500
hey I'm gonna be there and let's go look

97
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,960
at some fields let's talk about

98
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:25,090
something more positive and and so

99
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,680
that's where that trust comes in and I

100
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:29,230
guarantee any of those farmers know we

101
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,700
have a trust that if I need anything

102
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,870
you're gonna help me out on a project if

103
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:35,050
they need anything they don't the help

104
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:36,760
them out but here's one farmer that we

105
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:39,490
work with closely you Sam lemon he's

106
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:46,000
episode 5 it's kind of the calendar

107
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:47,440
who's got a say mr. genius Nancy I'm far

108
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,350
away just turned 30 he's got his first

109
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:53,050
kid on the way and and he's he's up in

110
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:54,340
north northeastern North Dakota so many

111
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:57,010
of those guys are still harvesting right

112
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,620
now Sam was able to give us was pintos

113
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:01,330
off you didn't have any acres of corn

114
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,730
he's cooperating on a large field scale

115
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:05,890
project we have where he's looking at

116
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:09,120
notes Phil pintos will be looking at

117
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:12,130
no-till pintos corn soybean and wheat

118
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,050
with a cover crop and then full tillage

119
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:16,510
to no cover crop and he's got a firm

120
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:18,010
trial for that but he likes he's he's

121
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:19,480
getting more and more confident that he

122
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,830
can just do if he runs anything at

123
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,120
vertical tillage he's gonna do in the

124
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:23,860
spring and he's gonna keep his soils

125
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,420
covered over the winter and if he's

126
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,340
gonna try to get a cover crop in it's

127
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:29,350
gonna be early and if it's not early

128
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:31,510
enough he's gonna skip the cover crop

129
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:33,670
because he thinks that his planter his

130
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:36,310
drill will do more cutting up a

131
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:37,510
president or damage than it will he just

132
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,710
leaves the residue and doesn't have a

133
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,930
cover crop because he wouldn't get

134
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:43,720
enough growth so making some really good

135
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:45,160
important decisions but he's got to

136
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,870
figure out those new management so this

137
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,640
is one of his fields it's got to warm up

138
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,220
in the spring he's got him the plant

139
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,780
into it so he's concerned about low

140
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,400
temperatures he's concerned about it

141
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,830
being too wet I mean these guys have

142
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,080
rust everywhere in their fields this

143
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:00,700
year but the notes what guys don't have

144
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,860
as many ruts I'll tell you that they've

145
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,480
been pretty proud about this year the

146
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,740
seeds at hare pinning he's very

147
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,410
concerned about that with his equipment

148
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:10,930
his stand his emergence seeding into

149
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:13,120
this is kind of scary force and so he's

150
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:15,280
got to figure out how to manage it so

151
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,350
his approach he's doing cover crops with

152
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,900
bio strip too so in that case

153
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:22,420
it's planting his radish uses a sugar

154
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,980
beet play tennis in his planter 30 inch

155
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:26,050
rows facing and they comes back in the

156
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:28,900
following year and plants as pintos on

157
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:30,580
that so he's creating a space for those

158
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,530
for the cover crops to be very

159
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,970
intensified in a strip where he's going

160
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:36,460
to plant his cover crop the next year

161
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:37,990
his cash crop the next year this gives

162
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:41,200
him a little bit of relief of that wheat

163
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:43,300
straw that he's concerned about but you

164
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,530
know his reward news reward is that

165
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,360
there's no reason to tell on the fall

166
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,790
he's had great stance with Miss residue

167
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,070
you see zero you know minimal difference

168
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:52,480
if I had zero difference between yields

169
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:54,580
on his pintos whether they're planted

170
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,530
into residue or into and the cultivated

171
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,240
soil and he's looking for that moisture

172
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:01,000
in August and this year they didn't need

173
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,260
Meister in August unfortunately but

174
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,150
that's what he still in front of those

175
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:05,320
dry years he's going to see I think

176
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:07,810
he'll really see the benefits of what

177
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:09,490
he's doing at this party

178
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:13,120
Doug Toussaint was the dark operator

179
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:15,850
episode 11 the sheriff farm on this the

180
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,370
sare project got shared arm ser and a

181
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:19,990
lot of them different acronyms the dog

182
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:22,710
is he's one of those farmers at five

183
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:25,270
years ago he transitions one quarter

184
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:26,710
into no-till and use cover crops and the

185
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:30,550
new transition the whole farm the next

186
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:31,930
year so he's his his quote is cover

187
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:34,930
crops it's not where to quit spending

188
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:36,550
money one year he cut back and he didn't

189
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,990
spend money on cover crops and he said

190
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:39,460
it was his biggest regret that you

191
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:42,130
didn't get every acre covered on his

192
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:44,020
farm and so either I don't know him fail

193
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:46,170
that if you just didn't do it at all and

194
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:48,190
I think Doug is a man of few words

195
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,870
often times there are problems of

196
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:52,710
whatever

197
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:54,270
but he says about his system and so he

198
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:55,710
will get his come across and every

199
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:58,310
single ad here he will make sure that

200
00:06:55,710 --> 00:07:00,270
happens whether is flowing on seated

201
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:03,510
however he's gonna do is gonna get it

202
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:05,370
done but this is one of the when we were

203
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:07,560
finding you know the cover crops after

204
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:09,389
leach was not happy because the harvests

205
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,620
are so wet we just couldn't ask a farmer

206
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:12,300
to get out there and add more to what

207
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,160
they were doing plus the cover crops

208
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,930
would have grown he switched his project

209
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,389
to getting cover crops with in

210
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:20,639
sunflowers and this one is a lot of

211
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:22,080
people are really interested in this he

212
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,310
was looking at it for the benefits of

213
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,990
getting some extra roots in his high

214
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,639
clay soil as he wants the beneficial

215
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:28,260
insects out there to be pretty

216
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,820
bittersweet affirmative the pest

217
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,680
pressures not so flowers and then he's

218
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,760
looking to manage weeds because he just

219
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,130
think about like he didn't have enough

220
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:37,139
tools to manage weeds in his system so

221
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:38,970
we did never threw the strip's we had

222
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:40,620
three fields for I think now it's been

223
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:42,600
three years if he passes out there forty

224
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,400
feet wide 60 feet long he sees this

225
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,780
cover his sunflowers on thirty inch row

226
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,460
spacing and then that same day he's

227
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:49,050
seeding with the journal at seven and a

228
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:51,570
half inch spacing the cover crop mixes

229
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:53,400
we've got the mix down to you know

230
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:55,050
eighteen bucks an acre which he can

231
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,880
spray that out if he has to and not feel

232
00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:00,630
that out about it and that's kind of our

233
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:02,400
goal and we're seeing no difference it's

234
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:04,849
statistically no difference in the yield

235
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,870
or oil content of those sunflowers

236
00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:08,610
there's still two hundred pound

237
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,810
difference for the cover crops are 200

238
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:11,190
pounds low and where he has no cover

239
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:14,190
crops and even though it's not stated

240
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:15,960
statistically significant to him it's

241
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:17,700
enough to be concerned about it

242
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,070
so he will probably never take

243
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:21,360
all fields which is fine I think he

244
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,620
could get away with it on the borders of

245
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,630
the field there you can do strips in a

246
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:26,760
field and not not have that risk of

247
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:28,500
doing the whole field or the cost of

248
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,850
doing the whole field but he had the

249
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,740
beautiful state IDs were some of these

250
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:32,730
beautiful fields we worked in because

251
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,169
those cover crops were blooming

252
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:38,700
throughout the growing season to bring

253
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:40,530
in the beneficial insects his approach

254
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,910
of cover crops on every acre this is

255
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:45,870
what he's often dealing with in the

256
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:47,700
spring this is a late spring - so he's

257
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,900
got a concern as he's you know his

258
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,100
potential issues with getting cover

259
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,290
crops that degree of care of man-hours

260
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,640
and power how many people they do does

261
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:56,310
he have to get out there and do these

262
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,900
things to get around that he's flying

263
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:00,300
out more cover crops and having good

264
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:02,580
establishment getting in a growth having

265
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,110
a bad residue other options of cover

266
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,520
crops which he put out there which do

267
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:08,790
not put out there what can you manage

268
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:11,070
but the reward is he's also getting in

269
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:12,570
the field not a problem and he's not got

270
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:14,190
a problem on any field or he's had cover

271
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,650
crops where he's not having cover crops

272
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:18,060
like cereal right but went awry he may

273
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:20,820
have potential issues and that's what

274
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:23,520
that's a few loses sleep over maybe you

275
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,720
can see this field so this is why I was

276
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,340
walking through in the middle of it no

277
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,130
no issues walking through all that water

278
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:31,710
on a 60% clay and then that title field

279
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:32,880
I stepped into next next to it that was

280
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:35,390
the first step by token that was the

281
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,390
last one I took

282
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:40,589
his approach planting into something

283
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,880
living so this is what he plants into in

284
00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:43,410
the spring and this is very different

285
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,720
for the southeastern corner of North

286
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:47,940
Dakota I mean this is not we typically

287
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,199
see it he's got you know he's like 200

288
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,060
pounds of cereal rise where he's putting

289
00:09:49,199 --> 00:09:52,800
on his fields because he likes a lot of

290
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:55,170
green I would recommend that for

291
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,610
everybody but we could have too much

292
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:58,019
growth when you if we have a job spring

293
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:00,329
and could rob him of moisture you have

294
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:02,009
too much water use seed placement

295
00:10:00,329 --> 00:10:03,540
equipment he's he's played with his

296
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:04,980
cronies put things on and pull them off

297
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,569
they're trying to get it so he can get

298
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:11,160
that seed in the ground in a consistent

299
00:10:06,569 --> 00:10:13,380
way but the reward from this is that

300
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,240
9:00 p.m. phone call doug is always very

301
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,430
respectful of my time and only calls me

302
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,810
during work hours but one time he called

303
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:20,339
me at 9:00 p.m. and he said you gotta

304
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:23,100
see this and so that next day I was down

305
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:25,019
there and and we look to this field this

306
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,509
is his field that has had cover crops

307
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:29,430
and no-till on it for I think at this

308
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:31,560
point it was four years they had a

309
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:32,759
soybean crop on it and they went through

310
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,519
harvest and two-wheel-drive

311
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:38,459
in the compound this is the neighbors

312
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:41,970
feel that that has had rippers chisel

313
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:43,470
plows field cultivators leech soybean

314
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:45,000
rotation on it

315
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:46,230
they use tracks to harvest this it was

316
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,069
the same day and you can see the ruts

317
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:52,589
and he was so excited to see that and

318
00:10:50,069 --> 00:10:54,870
this is also a benefit or the guy the

319
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:55,529
aerial applicator I was flying over the

320
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,510
field at the time

321
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:58,740
Eric going to see cover crops in

322
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:00,269
somebody else's farm that was starting

323
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,260
to use cover crops and we call that very

324
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:03,149
good said hey could you swing or not

325
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,889
take a picture and you did and this is

326
00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:07,740
and this is what we have to show for it

327
00:11:04,889 --> 00:11:08,130
so this is a really really proud day for

328
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,899
him

329
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,980
this fall we went around to the same

330
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:12,420
thing we drove and we looked at it

331
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:14,550
looked at his fields and came up with a

332
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,649
plan and he's love zero ruts in this

333
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,400
field and everybody else was sliding all

334
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:19,320
around

335
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,850
knocked out ground and they had a really

336
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,460
rough harvest people were chit were

337
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:25,140
reusing rippers in full season cover

338
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:27,330
crops I got out there that were PP I

339
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:29,550
mean it was a it was there's a lot going

340
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:32,160
on but he he was pretty proud about all

341
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:33,510
of us profit off his field and this is

342
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,410
this is what we saw this all this

343
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:36,180
systemic field

344
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:37,590
we drove across it he started laughing

345
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,720
at me because we drove to a really

346
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:41,640
standing water area and he looked at my

347
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,310
face and this apparently looks like I

348
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,960
was really scared you guys didn't think

349
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:47,100
we're gonna make it did you and we sat

350
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,450
we looked at this field and you could

351
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,100
just see on this face how proud he is of

352
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:53,160
what he's done and then this other field

353
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,330
this child right across the road and

354
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:57,210
that's what it was like in that field my

355
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:58,770
government so those compaction issues

356
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:02,100
are gonna be reflected in that crop for

357
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:03,780
years the deep compaction this is

358
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:08,490
another farmer Tony that I work with to

359
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:12,600
Jamestown he he's been no-till for 15 20

360
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:14,640
years he uses cover crops intensively at

361
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,250
least a third of his land and he farms a

362
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,720
lot a lot of land so he's always out

363
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,430
there receiving cover crops as the way

364
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,500
he does it and he farms a lot of sandy

365
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:24,480
soils that he doesn't like see in a so

366
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,830
low blow away and so that for him its

367
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,290
erosion he wants to keep his solos in

368
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:31,980
place this is an example at one of his

369
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:33,810
sandy fields where he's he had just

370
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,820
taken this one over he had a short

371
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:38,490
season crop on it because it's a sand so

372
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,810
he adjusted his rotation had a short

373
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:42,600
season crop on it followed it with an

374
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:43,890
oak cover crop he left it just he just

375
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,210
did oats because he wanted to come back

376
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:47,310
in and spray over the top of it to

377
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:48,810
control some wounds he had out there so

378
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:51,060
this is how this field looks going to

379
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:53,970
bed for the winter but he does have some

380
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:56,010
concerns lack or residue too much water

381
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:58,980
he's potentially on sandy soil lack of

382
00:12:56,010 --> 00:13:02,550
growth but he's been doing he's been

383
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:05,370
getting a really really nice stance he

384
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:06,720
also uses residue to his advantage so he

385
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:09,080
bought a stripper had a couple years ago

386
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,130
this is how he leaves his wheat straw

387
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,230
standing a lot of bare ground underneath

388
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,820
it becomes a

389
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:15,770
profit seeds it people think it's gonna

390
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:17,600
be a nightmare that next year well then

391
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:19,250
the residue and everything standing it's

392
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,710
not a problem to get into it and so

393
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:23,090
that's what he's learned and that's what

394
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:24,410
he's done don't catch a lot of snow and

395
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:26,750
he's caught a lot of snow this is my

396
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:28,310
turn this field but it's even and across

397
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:30,050
the field so it's gonna melt evenly into

398
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:31,790
the into the field that's not patched up

399
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:34,370
in low spots or on the edge of the field

400
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:35,810
he was that residue going around so he

401
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:39,140
has a very consistent field in the

402
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:40,640
spring to plant into and this was Tony's

403
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:43,460
reward I did a video from one of his

404
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,570
fields that he just took over and then

405
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:46,430
one of his fields and he's been doing

406
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:47,720
these practices on for 14 years

407
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:49,130
they were just kiddy Korner to each

408
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,180
other and I picked up the soils and it's

409
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,990
the first time he's ever seen him

410
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,940
side-by-side

411
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:54,140
he's never thought to take one slope on

412
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,330
my field and look at it next to the

413
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:58,400
other and you can see in this how dark

414
00:13:56,330 --> 00:14:00,200
his soil is how much he's built up with

415
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,720
organic matter and how much more walk

416
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:05,570
moisture he can retain and for him that

417
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,940
was that he knew he always knew Rudy's

418
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:09,440
doing is working but this told him again

419
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:12,770
that what he's doing is working and he

420
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:15,020
needed that confirmation I have an

421
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:17,630
episode two for this awesome

422
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:20,360
and I talk about the program we're gonna

423
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:21,860
done so oftentimes whether you're two

424
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,750
miles away or you're 200 miles away

425
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:25,220
there's something that you can take from

426
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:27,830
each other's systems and so a lot of

427
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:29,720
what I do is this network approach to

428
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:32,000
getting farmers to talk and gave people

429
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,820
an extension to talk and researchers and

430
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,610
Industry and consultants to talk so the

431
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:38,570
green dots on here are our NDSU people

432
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:41,120
whether they're researchers are

433
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:43,010
extension the red wants our consultants

434
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,590
the blue ones are farmers and the other

435
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:47,060
ones are industry and so if you look at

436
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:48,670
the idea of this is that you have all

437
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:51,620
the locations where we've had programs

438
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:54,310
particularly this cafe talk program that

439
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:56,480
I do which stairs is funding this year

440
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,980
so you've all these talks and all these

441
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,750
farmers show up and as they move to the

442
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,580
center of this diagram and there's in

443
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:03,270
there dot gets bigger that means they're

444
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:05,430
they're having

445
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:07,440
programs they're potentially having more

446
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:09,030
influence on people and sharing

447
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,170
conversations so we have people on the

448
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,460
inside that are sharing a lot of

449
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,960
information showing up to a lot of

450
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:15,150
events we have the people on the outside

451
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,260
that we want to get on the inside so I

452
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,310
can see where we're going to go we're

453
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:19,230
gonna bring on the outside to the inside

454
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:20,340
we're going to continue to strengthen

455
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:23,310
this will get more people on the outside

456
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:24,840
and keep this network building and the

457
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:26,490
idea of this is that one person could

458
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,590
step away at any time and the network

459
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:30,450
won't fail so it makes it so that one

460
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:32,120
person is not important it's how

461
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:34,800
everybody interacts that's important

462
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,810
what we do this we do another social

463
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,370
network analysis where we have farmers

464
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:41,550
list names and the three people they

465
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:42,750
talk to from like research perspective

466
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:44,820
and then three people they talk to in

467
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:46,650
general about soil health and in that

468
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:48,720
one the more somebody's name is listed

469
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:50,340
as somebody if somebody talks to the

470
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,830
larger their dockets and so there are

471
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:54,360
farmers that that we can pick out that

472
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:56,220
are very influential in their areas

473
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,540
because people listed them as somebody

474
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,700
is a resource and they're talking to

475
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:01,200
them all the time and so that helps us

476
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,400
with our program you say wow I'm gonna

477
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,230
make sure that that farmer has the

478
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,460
information they need the tools they

479
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,900
need whatever they need to make sure

480
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,760
that the information they're sharing is

481
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,770
science-based that it's practical

482
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,510
applications that we can keep soil

483
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:17,070
health of science and not just an

484
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:18,840
observation type program and then here's

485
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:20,760
one of the farmers are relying heavily

486
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:24,900
Joe Rutger who's been 40 some years

487
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:26,850
no-till and his 20 years of cover crops

488
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:28,530
he's a very wise farmer and she says

489
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:30,260
every situation is unique he never

490
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:32,550
pushes what he says on anybody else

491
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:33,990
every situations neat but he thinks that

492
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:35,730
everybody has the opportunity to make

493
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:37,170
these steps on their farms it's just

494
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:39,660
what steps they're going to use and how

495
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:41,490
they're gonna make it work and so he he

496
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,960
helps he helps quite a bit a lot of

497
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,920
these farmers I call and I say could you

498
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,870
come to this event

499
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,370
because I think that that you could talk

500
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:49,529
about this person or you know they would

501
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:51,899
benefit your from hearing your message

502
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:53,010
or hey could you just be there and if

503
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:54,779
somebody has a question then you can

504
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:56,250
help them answer it and they and these

505
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:57,570
farmers will do that now because of this

506
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,459
network we've built it because of the

507
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:03,480
relationships we've built I'm so I'm

508
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:04,770
very grateful for that and then one last

509
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,110
thing I want to show you is so are we

510
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:11,220
seeing changes we do pretty extensive

511
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:13,110
evaluations every three years is what

512
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,130
we've been kind of doing and so this is

513
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:15,600
from our programming these are the

514
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:17,880
topics you know establishing a cover

515
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,069
crop a standing soybean using multiple

516
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,720
species diversifying crop rotation for

517
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:23,819
inclusion of cover crops establishing

518
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,919
cover crop and corn growing cover crop

519
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:28,500
proceed establishing after harvest using

520
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,790
steroids alignment and the green part on

521
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,470
this and this is a draft this is

522
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:34,440
literally I was like gosh I show it or

523
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:36,419
not that this is I want to show it so

524
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,669
they change a little bit as we clean up

525
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:40,230
continue to clean up the data but this

526
00:17:38,669 --> 00:17:42,270
is in the green is what people are doing

527
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:44,580
is result attending one of our programs

528
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,990
called the cafe talks so they are using

529
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,610
these practices of cover crops now

530
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:51,240
because they learned about it at one of

531
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:52,679
our programs this black area is where we

532
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,660
see the most potential because they're

533
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:55,830
considering it and so these are the

534
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:58,679
practices we are going to make sure that

535
00:17:55,830 --> 00:18:00,270
we show work establishing something is

536
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:01,559
standing soybean establishing a cover

537
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,970
crop that's where I'm going to focus a

538
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:04,470
lot of efforts because 51 percent of

539
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:05,640
people are thinking about it and they

540
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:07,919
need more information to pull the

541
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,870
trigger and make that decision same with

542
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,669
the multi-species cover crop mix let's

543
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,840
help them find five species that really

544
00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:15,000
are going to work for them that they can

545
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,860
control again with establishing a cover

546
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,990
crop and standing corn let's find out if

547
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,190
you fly it on or if you seated or how

548
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:21,660
you're going to get that cover crop out

549
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:24,330
there how are you gonna modify equipment

550
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:26,630
to get that done and what fixes should

551
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:29,309
you use and then also that inclusion of

552
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:31,110
diversifying the crop rotation which we

553
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:33,419
know diversifying our operation is like

554
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:35,549
the number one tool we have and so if we

555
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:36,909
can get away from two crops or soybean

556
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:39,249
on soybean or corn on corn

557
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:41,080
benefit the system from a whole system

558
00:18:39,249 --> 00:18:43,720
perspective and then the other things

559
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:45,460
like growing cover crop proceed 44%

560
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,320
people are thinking of doing that so

561
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,460
we're not going to sleep it's not going

562
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,080
to be something I'm gonna make sure they

563
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,279
don't break any laws when they sow seed

564
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,809
to make sure it's not protected or

565
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:54,220
whatever if they're gonna start selling

566
00:18:52,809 --> 00:18:56,919
things so that they use certified see

567
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:58,269
their aspects like that but I'm gonna

568
00:18:56,919 --> 00:18:59,559
keep them out of trouble but I'm not

569
00:18:58,269 --> 00:19:03,099
gonna focus on it because they're not

570
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:04,720
really interested in it and then this is

571
00:19:03,099 --> 00:19:06,700
another reward this podcast is going to

572
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,460
be played over 11,000 times since we

573
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:10,720
released in August first so when I see

574
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,249
this this keeps me going

575
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,509
this is one of those things that I need

576
00:19:12,249 --> 00:19:17,229
to see that I know that what I'm doing

577
00:19:13,509 --> 00:19:19,239
is is working and if I didn't see this

578
00:19:17,229 --> 00:19:21,159
it was only like ten dots then I doing

579
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:22,929
it probably not the right tool so let's

580
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:25,840
find something else and ask the farmers

581
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:29,309
what do they want what do they need

582
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,309
so I'll take any questions

583
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:36,269
[Music]

584
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,269
[Applause]

585
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:47,120
you know I'm not familiar with that

586
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:50,630
study that they're that they're talking

587
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:52,300
about but my thought okay when you think

588
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:55,100
about tillage right you're incorporating

589
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:57,230
plant material from the surface into the

590
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:59,480
soil and then you collect that soil

591
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:00,950
sample and you send it off for analysis

592
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,720
so timing could be everything on that

593
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:05,420
did they collect it after they chisel

594
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,040
out it or tilt it and then set it off

595
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,360
and I've got big chunks of residue that

596
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,370
have a lot of carbon in it that are

597
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,800
complaining that organic matter - say

598
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:14,330
yeah this is working or is it its season

599
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,430
and they're capturing the roots from the

600
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:17,750
Krait you know of it and that's why I

601
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:19,370
think that test is very difficult

602
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,600
because it depends on timing it depends

603
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:23,480
on how the sample is collected it

604
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,830
depends on like I think a lot of people

605
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,170
when they transition from a full tillage

606
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:29,480
to no-till situation you know they

607
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:30,530
sample containers where you know they

608
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,970
don't have any other residue on the

609
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:33,710
surface and they could have sampled it

610
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:35,450
whenever in the season and then they

611
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:37,250
come back in and that consultants is in

612
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:38,810
their pickup and they drop the the auger

613
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:40,730
down to sample they don't brush away the

614
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:42,770
residue on the surface so then that

615
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:45,200
inflates that organic matter never that

616
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:46,430
comes back because it's determining

617
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,980
litter as part of that organic matter

618
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:50,180
pool but is it you know I mean that's it

619
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:52,070
so it all depends on what you think is

620
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:53,780
part of organic matter if I can identify

621
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:55,150
it I don't think it's organic matter if

622
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:57,350
I can say that's a piece of corn trash

623
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:58,910
then to me that's not sort of organic

624
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:00,560
matter so if it doesn't know it's

625
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:02,030
residue yeah organic matter something

626
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,470
you can't identify you look at it you

627
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:06,410
say boy I don't know what that was but I

628
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:09,770
bet it could've been rude he's a residue

629
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:13,480
it could have been imposed wasn't the

630
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:13,480
core part of the question

631
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,730
people to the right question have to do

632
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:36,290
the examples I haven't look for examples

633
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:39,110
for that but because the process is

634
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:41,030
flawed I can't even I can't even make an

635
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:45,530
assumption on whether that could happen

636
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:46,820
or not because summit I've seen a lot of

637
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:49,730
really inflated numbers and no-till

638
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:51,110
systems to but it's a big a so I don't

639
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:52,160
find out Ashley I don't mean fight I

640
00:21:51,110 --> 00:22:18,650
guess they just don't really look at

641
00:21:52,160 --> 00:22:20,600
that of her so I did you like yeah

642
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:22,460
mister annual ryegrass and Dutch white

643
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,290
clover oh yeah I'm sorry I think my

644
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:25,850
concern was if I did a peer stand of

645
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:28,100
clover it's a little slower to establish

646
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:29,960
and so that we would get some more weed

647
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,820
growth that would be coming up through

648
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,890
that so that was my goal to have

649
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:35,450
something that was would kind of grow

650
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:38,930
quickly it can't be over relatively

651
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:42,940
quickly so yeah I mean the mixture is

652
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:44,200
good I would certainly consider doing a

653
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:46,299
but

654
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,070
having some kind of grass in there it's

655
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:50,919
kind of a good good balance see look

656
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:53,529
here you're no you're not plastic

657
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:56,090
culture where the the pepper pot was

658
00:22:53,529 --> 00:22:58,549
right next to the roots

659
00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:00,350
at first but you didn't see any high

660
00:22:58,549 --> 00:23:02,419
spikes a nitrogen that might have caused

661
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:04,879
loss memmer are any issues like that

662
00:23:02,419 --> 00:23:05,870
Oh spikes an extra from having a leg you

663
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:09,080
in there yeah

664
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:13,309
no no in fact we saw quite a little bit

665
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:14,480
of a nitrogen detriment it takes a

666
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:17,120
little while for clover to get going

667
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,399
right so it's not doing a whole lot of

668
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,049
extra fixing until probably probably

669
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:25,460
realistically probably next year and

670
00:23:21,049 --> 00:23:27,679
I'll guess to your operational or your

671
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:31,460
scale for a certified mechanic yeah and

672
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:35,840
then after you had your pledge stick out

673
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:38,480
and you had seven establish covered you

674
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:41,509
didn't see me go and they broadcast

675
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:44,899
whatever was left over there so I mean

676
00:23:41,509 --> 00:23:46,519
you could do that I'd like to avoid it

677
00:23:44,899 --> 00:23:48,019
part of the issue is that I didn't think

678
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:49,490
we were getting much benefit when we

679
00:23:48,019 --> 00:23:51,440
were putting down winter I and late

680
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:54,740
October in Oregon's snow the first week

681
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,749
of November so certainly you couldn't

682
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:58,909
you could go you drop I don't really

683
00:23:56,749 --> 00:24:00,440
have an easy way just just like bandit

684
00:23:58,909 --> 00:24:02,509
on those areas that you probably drawed

685
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:05,269
cast got alcohol field in Broadway stood

686
00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:06,679
some speed so certainly you could do

687
00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:07,879
that and if you got a crop that came out

688
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:10,429
earlier and you thought you could

689
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:12,590
actually get some good growth then it

690
00:24:10,429 --> 00:24:14,269
might be worth doing we we did probably

691
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:15,100
because it was coming out like the 28th

692
00:24:14,269 --> 00:24:18,340
Rock dough

693
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:20,260
that's kind of part of the purposes well

694
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:23,080
you got we have 40 or 50 percent of our

695
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:25,590
field with like these strips you can do

696
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,700
a pretty pretty good job

697
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:30,130
given your New Deal which is the

698
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:32,460
constraints of the crop and production

699
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:32,460
system

700
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,420
you
