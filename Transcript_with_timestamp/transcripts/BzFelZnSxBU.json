  "text": "foreign [Music] good morning everyone I just wanted to share with you some information on my strawberry variety update which is this will probably be the last hopefully be the last uh discussion on these combinations of varieties that we've been looking at this is a five-year study so we've been able to I think get enough information out of these varieties [Music] but first of all as we all know that consumer that strawberry production has increased uh throughout the nation and it's increased in in Alabama also um be it through increased consumer awareness of Health promoting qualities of strawberries or just uh just the fact they're just plain good to eat and uh not only have we seen an increase in production overall but an increase in the number of households that are purchasing strawberries so this is the pretty good thing for the strawberry industry uh but uh the most productive varieties that we have are from the uh from California breeding programs and from Florida breeding programs and so uh it's it's especially important to determine how these varieties perform in our environment since strawberries are are very environmentally sensitive and so but and there's little documented information concerning the performance of these strawberries as well as the quality as I mentioned earlier the consumer awareness of Health promoting qualities of uh way into the purchase of these strawberries so we're looking at both yield performance as well as the quality all right so the objective uh the term of production potential as well as the antioxidant concentration of selective strawberry cultivars in order to enhance the sustainability of strawberry industry in Alabama all right so this as I mentioned was a I was a five-year evaluation uh in uh be planted on an annual plastic culture system as the name implies it is an annual system that's taking a perennial plant and making it using it as an annual plant we use black plastic mulch and resulted in about 15 000 plants per acre and we use plug plants in our uh in our planning we feel that blood plantings are uh plug plants are a lot easier to use and they're a lot more forgiving if you make mistakes all right these are the varieties that we've used as I mentioned that this will probably be now and hopefully be the last discussion on these this particular combination of varieties we I think we have enough information uh to determine how well these varieties will perform in at least in Central Alabama we are looking forward to getting a new group of varieties and we won't abandon these all together there will be some that will use just uh as sort of comparison to some of the new varieties so uh what data did we collect uh we looked at the plant size and stolen number uh What uh you know what is significance of this data plant size and stole one number uh plant size is an indicator or can be an indicator of yield overall plants that are larger tend to produce more fruit although there has been some there's some conflicting data in the uh in the literature that would suggest otherwise but a plant size can also play a role especially if you are in a pick your own operation uh where um you know that we have an increase in plant size you can have uh an air at a time where you're not able to really see the plants or see the fruit that grow uh not Growers but uh customers aren't able to see the fruit um and so that leaves fruit behind and just left to be a inoculum or uh for fruit disease so it becomes a management issue uh stolon number those of course you know that leads to the stolons need lead to daughter plants and and an annual plastic Ultra system a stolen number uh the number of stolons isn't as important it becomes more or less a detriment uh in this system as opposed to the uh the matted row system which is a a perennial system and it's driven by the uh the daughter plants but in this system we really don't want a whole lot of stolen so that becomes a management issue so we looked at that we're also looking at yield both early in total and as I mentioned fruit quality we tend to look at soluble solids and the main indicator or fruit quality the soluble solids or or sweetness as the main indicator of of quality but there are some other um some other aspects of the fruit that play into the flavor profile of antioxidants may be one of them but antioxidants have a another another role there are cancer fighting agents foreign first off we'll start with the strawberry size and uh camarosa as we can see camarosa is a pretty large Plant and as I mentioned this can be this can be an issue when you're when you have a you pick operation the customers are going to go to the fruit that they see and they're and oftentimes they leave a lot of fruit behind and it's left for an inoculum a left as inoculum or uh for disease and it also uh causes the grower to have to send his workers out into the field to sort of clean up and find find those fruit and harvest those so that that's an added cost and uh the larger the fruit the larger the plant it also is an indicator of uh well it can be a problem when it comes to spraying pesticides so you have a better coverage if you have uh if you have more space between the plants and we can see Camino Real it is a it's a much smaller plant a significantly smaller plant produces really nice compact plants uh there there is talk about maybe com taking advantage of this space that's left by these smaller plants and increasing the plant population but most Growers were probably just leave that space there so that especially if they have a U-Pick operation so that they can get better pesticide coverage as well as increased visibility of the fruit okay so that brings us to the number of stolons and we can see that Ruby June produces a significantly produces significantly fewer stolons than than all of the others we can see in 2020 and I I will point out though that in 2020 we took these measurements later in the year and in 2021 we took them pretty early but you can see that there's a with Ruby June in 2021 there's really not a column there there is there is data there but it can't be seen on columns so it just it just shows you how low um the production of um stolons are in Ruby June now if you were planning Ruby June in a matter Road system this this could be a problem but in an annual Hill plastic culture system this is this works pretty well pretty good now we can see that Camino Real along with uh in camarosa along with being uh well camarosa Along being a large relatively large Plant it also produces uh a number of stolons per plant so this leads us to the yield Berry size and coal uh Camino Real and Ruby June were both the most comparable to the camarosa both had lower occult root number and as well and the berry sizes are tended to be comparable to camarosa and then some years especially Ruby June those group can be a little bit larger than Cameros thank you uh Camino Real there's been an issue though with the the uh I don't know I'm talking about yield here but I'll inject here with flavor um Camino Real tended to uh tends to have a reduced sugar or reduced flavor and uh and that has been a problem in the past but some Growers said that they didn't notice it and their clientele even say that uh the dairy is is really really good Ruby June on the other hand produces a uh very tasty Berry it's not the yield is not quite there but uh compared to Camino and camarosa but it produces a pretty tasty Berry uh unfortunately the yields aren't quite as as high as as those others so this leads us to Quality um got a little ahead of myself though and I started talking about sweetness um but uh the sweetness of camarosa or Camino Real does tend to be uh a little low uh Camino Real it has and it core has a corresponding uh low soluble solids but I will mention that Ruby June tends to have can sometimes have low soluble solids and even when it has soluble solids that are low lower than the rest it still has great flavor so there's more playing in flavor than just the soluble solids there's some other components in that flavor profile that's providing that excellent flavor so in summary uh started with plant size Camino Real was smaller it was slightly more comparable to out uh Albion but it was slightly smaller than Albion uh as I mentioned this Growers could take it take advantage of this compactness of the fruit of the plant by Maybe planning them a little closer but I think that most Grovers will probably take advantage of this and allow this to to remain as a a way of increasing the visibility of the berries uh Ruby June had low stolen number and this again can be a great management benefit reduction in costs hopefully good production in Labor uh these it is recommended that the stolons be removed once they start because they will hinder the yield and so with Ruby June there's not as many stolons that have to remove um as opposed to Camino Real which was among the highest stolons at least when the stolons were counted later in the season uh Camino Real and Ruby June are most comparable in yield to uh camarosa as well as they are also comparable to Cameros in Berry size both had uh lower cult fruit and which is again another uh management benefit in management that's fewer group that have to be taken out have to be picked through and increasing the labor costs and time dedicated to this and dedicate and taken away from other things other activities in the operation foreign throughout the season or throughout the five years but Ruby June still had excellent flavor regardless of the soluble solid content and one thing that we noticed in anthocyanin content is that the anthocyanins tended to run a little low in Ruby June this could play uh play into the fact that uh you know as as consumer awareness grows they're gonna be more interested in compounds like this and berries and uh breeders are more interested in this and and trying to increase this or um higher concentrations and berries so on conclusion plant characteristics yield and fruit qualities indicate that Camino Real and Ruby June offer potential Alternatives camarosa in Alabama and I will say that maybe camera Ruby June to a lesser degree I think in fields where you've got a little you've got a few more stresses both Camino Real and Ruby June probably won't do as well as camarosa in terms of yield but Camino Real tends to be a little more comparable to camarosa even in those situations uh Ruby June tends to drop off a little bit because it it is a little less adapted when you have those more challenging environmental factors so some points to remember uh [Music] plug versus bare root I like plug plants as I mentioned these are better they're more tolerant to mistakes and and we do make quite a few and uh and so it's I think it's beneficial to get these these are a little more expensive and but some Growers really like working with bare root plants and they work well for them uh one thing to remember is that these new operations uh you know as Ed Sakura mentioned um you know we kind of have a an issue with uh the number of operations uh providing plants uh but the the operations that we deal with now they have a minimum order so you have to be up just ask them up front you know what that minimum order is and how much do you pay up front some require you know maybe half the uh the the cost the half the total cost of the berries foreign and one thing to remember is uh if if at all possible do not delay in place in your order uh place your order as soon as as you can as soon as the they are available this will help you to uh not only get the the types of berries that you want but also the number of berries and if you wait too late you you may not be able to get any at all so um now is the time actually it's getting a little a little late so if you have not ordered uh if you know Growers that who have not ordered uh you know encourage them to go ahead and place their orders um and uh Camino Real and uh Ruby June you know they have been used in or at least I know Ruby Camino Real has been used uh in uh in operations when uh in years where camarosa wasn't available uh and The Growers had a pretty good experience with Camino Real and uh and and to some degree Ruby June uh to the point to the to the point of not uh or or kind of swapping uh uh Camino Real or camera support Camino Real um because their clientele said that they're they're they're delicious they think they're delicious and they're just product just as productive and in some cases uh even more so again order on time uh test soil early uh and uh provide yourself with timely bed preparation so that you can get your plants uh in the ground earlier early planning or timely planning is is is critical I think in getting uh really good yields so this is a list of our current list of strawberry plug producers we have a Dixie Green in Alabama we did have uh Greenway plants but I understand you know Greenway plants in Anniston but I understand that uh they are no longer producing uh plants and we have an out-of-state list here but if you if you don't have this list and you need this list please just contact me and I can I can provide it for you so that's uh the end of this presentation hopefully next year I'll have another slate of varieties and I will answer any questions that you may have with this current set of varieties",
