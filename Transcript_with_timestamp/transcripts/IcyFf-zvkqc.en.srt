00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,360
Hello everyone
Welcome to jadam

2
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:23,100
In this episode I m going to talk about how
to use and store the JADAM Natural pesticide.

3
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,080
Here I have prepared Jadam wetting agent,
jadam sulfur and Jadam herbal solution.

4
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,170
With this combination you are getting perfect
natural pesticide for your garden.

5
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:36,589
And in this vdeo I will show you how mix all
the solution in proper way.

6
00:00:36,589 --> 00:00:38,670
This is Jadam herbal solution.

7
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,070
Which is the extract of any herbs with insect
repellent effect.

8
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:44,180
And usual herbs that are often used is pepper
mint, rose marry, lavender, Jerusalem artichoke,

9
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,180
and bracken.

10
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,820
Recently we have been testing the cosmos (flower)
and it is showing significant result.

11
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,100
With all these plants you can control aphid
and mite.

12
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,440
But above all our most favorite plant is the
gingko until now.

13
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,710
Because there is not a single pest that we
won t be able to control with this plant.

14
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,750
All the details and ratio are recorded in
my book JADAM Organic Farming and JADAM Organic

15
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:06,930
Pest and Disease control.

16
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,520
Briefly speaking, It is very simple to make
plant extracts.

17
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,801
All you need is to boil the plant for 5 hours.

18
00:01:11,801 --> 00:01:13,082
And more detail information is spoken in my
lecture.

19
00:01:13,082 --> 00:01:14,710
So please click the link above to see the
lecture video.

20
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,369
The first thing I would like to talk about
is how to store the herbal solution.

21
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:20,020
Once you are done with the boiling the herbs.

22
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:25,670
Pour the solution in a bottle and put in a
side way so that it will be vacuumed sealed.

23
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:29,610
In this way you can store the herbal solution
for couple of years.

24
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:30,610
But the problem is when you opened it for
use.

25
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:33,930
Because when it contacts with the air, The
properties of the solution start to change

26
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,280
gradually which cause decrease in its insecticidal
function.

27
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:41,750
Easy way to identify that the solution is
usable or not is the air pressure of the bottle

28
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:42,880
due to fermentation.

29
00:01:42,880 --> 00:02:00,549
But to make sure, best way is to drop small
portion of JADAM wetting agent into it.

30
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:20,930
Once you drop the JWA, if the color of the
JHS doesn t change, that means it is still

31
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,950
good for use.

32
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:31,639
The another problem is how to properly store
a opened bottle.

33
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:38,459
Even if you put into refrigerator, the changes
cannot be stopped.

34
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:41,780
So best way is to get a help of ethanol.

35
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:53,299
There are usually two types of ethanol sold
in a market,.

36
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:58,359
One is with 84% purity and the other one is
with 99% purity.

37
00:02:58,359 --> 00:03:04,040
When you are using 99% ethanol, add 15% of
ethanol from what is left over.

38
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,989
And 84% with 25%.

39
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:13,549
With the help of the ethanol you can increase
the shelf life of JADAM herbal solution even

40
00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:14,569
in atmospheric temperature.

41
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:19,790
When non of herbs are available near you,
You can also use the sodium hydroxide as an

42
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:20,790
alternative.

43
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:26,260
And the ratio is 1 kilo of sodium hydroxide
for 500 liters and 40 grams for 20 liters.

44
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:31,069
With sodium hydroxide you can treat a problem
of scale insects and snail.

45
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:36,230
However, I do not recommend constant use of
this substance because of concentration damage.

46
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:53,450
JWA is recommended to use around 200 to 600
ml for 20 liters and 5 to 15 liters for 500

47
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,450
Liters.

48
00:03:54,450 --> 00:04:02,440
JS is 40 ml to 60 ml for 20 liters

49
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,750
And JHS is 200 ml to 600 ml for 20 liters.

50
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,680
Recently, We have been receiving lot of question
from floweriest and Gardner about our JADAM

51
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,680
solution.

52
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,839
So let me elaborate how to combine all three
solution for pest and disease control.

53
00:04:13,839 --> 00:04:21,459
This is the spray tool that I use for testing
the solution first before the field test.

54
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:31,210
This particular brand of spray is my favorite
due to its long lasting durability.

55
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:56,229
It cost little more but this is a product
worth to checkout.

56
00:04:56,229 --> 00:05:02,000
Since we are testing 1 liter of small amount,
thing that we measure the ratio also have

57
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,020
to be syringes.

58
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,379
Before doing mixing process.

59
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:06,090
Please do use soft water.

60
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:37,530
It is mandatory in order to achive it s full
capability.

61
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:45,129
And now, Iet me show you how the disinfectant
is made.

62
00:05:45,129 --> 00:05:51,370
I will measure 800 ml of soft water.

63
00:05:51,370 --> 00:06:00,300
First I will add 10 ml of JADAM Wetting agent.

64
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,760
Next, 2ml of JADAM Sulfur.

65
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:10,639
This yellowish liquid is the natural disinfectant.

66
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:25,540
It can treat downy mildew, powdery mildew
and anthracnose.

67
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:31,800
Speaking of anthracnose, you can also control
this just by increasing the JWA,

68
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:37,871
As you can see JADAM s Natural pest solutions
are very easy to do with best effect on pest

69
00:06:37,871 --> 00:06:40,460
and disease control.

70
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:46,819
And by adding JADAM Herbal solution, It becomes
all purpose natural pest and disease solution.

71
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:51,580
Then add a little more water to make it 1
full liter.

72
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,770
Best thing about JADAM solution, unlike any
commercially available chemical solutions.

73
00:06:54,770 --> 00:07:00,370
JADAM solution is very safe to use.

74
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:09,949
There will be no big problem even it is contacted
on our skin.

75
00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:15,599
You can also just wash the fruit to eat right
after spraying.

76
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:23,460
JADAM Natural pest solution is all about the
combination of JWA, JS and JHS.

77
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:53,990
To increase insecticidal effects, all you
need to do is increasing the amouing of JWA

78
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,479
and JHS.

79
00:07:55,479 --> 00:07:57,249
And for disinfectant increase JS.

80
00:07:57,249 --> 00:08:14,509
But do concentration test in advance for JS
before spraying into crops.

81
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:16,969
In this way you can control almost all pest
and disease,

82
00:08:16,969 --> 00:08:22,830
You can add additional sodium hydroxide and
red clay powder for scale insect and snail.

83
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:27,060
Let me show you how to add them

84
00:08:27,060 --> 00:09:24,420
Just add the sodium hydroxide in a beaker
with water to melt it down.

85
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,000
This is very useful for scale insect.

86
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,070
And red clay powder is for increasing penetration
effect.

87
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:41,910
With this simple you don t have to worry about
the pest and disease that occurs during farming.

88
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:50,620
However, when you are adding sodium hydroxide,
the solution can irritate your skin when it

89
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,620
makes a contact.

90
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:56,200
I have also made all the detail videos how
to all of these.

91
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:01,880
It is also stated in my book so that you can
read one for your self.

92
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,350
Thank you for watching and I will see you
guys in the next video.
