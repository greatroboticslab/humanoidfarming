00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:13,540
hi my name is Brent hood

3
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:16,630
I received a Sagar SAR grant to look at

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:18,460
sustainable shrimp the idea less is to

5
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:21,190
raise them in an environment where we

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:24,150
could source all the components so that

7
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:29,500
we could raise an all-natural a

8
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:32,020
naturally raised product what we have

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:35,200
here I got my hands on what's called a

10
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:37,090
bio filter this helps control the

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,880
chemical composition of the water that's

12
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:43,030
in the pool or the shrimp are here we

13
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:46,420
have the solar panels these provide

14
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:49,200
power to the pump there's an air pump

15
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:51,579
and there's also the water pump that

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,670
causes water to flow through the bio

17
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:57,850
filter here and of course we have the

18
00:00:54,670 --> 00:01:02,260
pool inside the pool there are series of

19
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:05,560
substrates these are collections of

20
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:07,509
frames that have been covered with mesh

21
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,670
that allow the shrimp to actually get

22
00:01:07,509 --> 00:01:13,479
away from the other shrimp so they have

23
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:15,759
their own space to grow we feed twice a

24
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:19,740
day once in the morning once in the

25
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:23,950
afternoon we use aqua max 1000 it's a

26
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:28,749
sinking fish fry pelletized feed that

27
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:32,350
has a high protein content and so those

28
00:01:28,749 --> 00:01:34,749
are I think the primary components

29
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:36,759
you're probably asking yourself yeah so

30
00:01:34,749 --> 00:01:39,639
I go and I do all this well how do we

31
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:41,380
get out of it well these shrimp grow

32
00:01:39,639 --> 00:01:45,340
really large but they need a long

33
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:50,649
growing period so if you have at least a

34
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:53,590
hundred days you can raise shrimp these

35
00:01:50,649 --> 00:01:57,759
shrimp will end up being about somewhere

36
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:59,280
between a number 18 to a number 14

37
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,290
shrimp

38
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,440
backyard shrimping calm is the website

39
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:08,679
that we set up with this project with

40
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,539
the idea that if you were interested in

41
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:13,120
doing this in your backyard you could

42
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:15,700
actually see the firm details when that

43
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:20,290
site is complete what we are going to

44
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:22,140
provide is an itemized cost per item so

45
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:26,640
you'll be able to look at your budget

46
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:29,650
also a time frame there are certain key

47
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,120
benchmarks on the dates that you want to

48
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:34,810
make sure you have certain places in

49
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:38,980
place are certain things in place there

50
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:40,720
will also be the source for the juvenile

51
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:43,690
so you probably won't want to try to

52
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,450
erase them as a nursery environment but

53
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:48,070
there are a couple places where you can

54
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:50,950
actually get the juveniles which the

55
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:53,769
spot you want to stock typically you're

56
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:55,800
going to stock those at about a thousand

57
00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:58,989
at the beginning of your season

58
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,660
typically you'll have a eighty percent

59
00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:06,820
return which means you get eight hundred

60
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:09,250
and so eight hundred shrimp at just

61
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:12,220
under 2 ounces of piece will give you a

62
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:15,090
fairly decent return both for your

63
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:17,670
family to enjoy and honestly because

64
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:20,440
everything we've done is all-natural

65
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:22,900
you'd be able to market that to people

66
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,420
who are concerned about the sourcing for

67
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:46,770
their shellfish

68
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:49,839
