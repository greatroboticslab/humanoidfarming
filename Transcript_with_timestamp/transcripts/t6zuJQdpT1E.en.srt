1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,440
Hey folks, making something interesting

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,919
today. Uh,

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:12,160
one of my favorite uh, dipping sauces

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:16,480
now is from Wendy's and it's their uh,

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:20,640
their ghost pepper ranch dipping sauce.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,880
It tastes great, but it has no heat.

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,080
If you've ever had Wendy's ghost pepper

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,519
ranch dipping sauce, you you know the

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,080
same thing. You know, it tastes really

10
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:32,160
good. It's a really good ranch. It's got

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,760
just a little bit of heat in the back

12
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:38,960
end, but not not what you would consider

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,800
ghost pepper. So, I've been

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,879
experimenting and I think I've come up

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,520
with a really good um

16
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:51,760
probably better copycat than uh than

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,160
Wendy's. It's very similar, but uh it's

18
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:57,840
got a little bit more kick, but not too

19
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:00,320
much. It's got just enough to like Oh,

20
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,359
yeah. I I I can taste that ghost pepper

21
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,640
now, but it won't blow you away. So,

22
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,159
here's how I'm going to make it. And

23
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,799
then come back and I'm going to give it

24
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:11,119
a try.

25
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:14,960
Here I have a cup of mayonnaise and I'm

26
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:17,520
going to add a uh 1/4 teaspoon of garlic

27
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:22,080
powder, 1/4 teaspoon of onion powder,

28
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:26,400
and a half a teaspoon of salt. a

29
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:30,920
tablespoon of dried parsley.

30
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,920
A half a teaspoon of paprika.

31
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,880
And then the star of the show, the uh

32
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:40,000
the ghost pepper powder. This is a/4 of

33
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,600
a teaspoon. This should be plenty, but

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,799
if you want to really kick it up, you

35
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,799
could add a half a teaspoon.

36
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,799
And then I got a a half a cup of

37
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,799
buttermilk.

38
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,759
And I just want to whisk this all

39
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,759
together. Get it incorporated.

40
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,439
Okay, that looks good. Let's give it a

41
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,439
taste. See if we need to make any

42
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,439
adjustments.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,440
Uh, yep. It needs It needs more salt.

44
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,640
Yeah.

45
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,239
Yeah, definitely needs more salt.

46
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,160
Okay, let me add some salt. I'm going to

47
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:28,440
add another half a teaspoon or another

48
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,440
1/4 teaspoon actually. So,

49
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,560
that's about, you know, almost a

50
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:38,040
teaspoon of salt. So, let's see what

51
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,040
that tastes like.

52
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:53,840
Okay.

53
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:56,160
Okay. Salt is perfect. There we go.

54
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,480
Okay. Let's let it refrigerate and give

55
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,480
it a taste.

56
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,280
Okay, here's how it turned out.

57
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,879
I portioned it out into a little

58
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:12,680
container for dipping.

59
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,680
This is what my

60
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:20,200
ghost pepper ranch looks like.

61
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,200
Here it is. Wendy's.

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,720
They look

63
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:31,519
looks very similar. I think Wendy's is

64
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,480
just a tad bit orer, maybe a little bit

65
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:39,200
more paprika.

66
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:41,440
But, uh, that's the two side by side.

67
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:45,720
Okay. Let's

68
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,720
let me taste mine first.

69
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,040
Give a good dunk.

70
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:04,599
Got to go in again. Another dip.

71
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:15,040
Definitely has a really good ranch

72
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:17,680
flavor and so much more heat. It's it's

73
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:21,120
not overwhelming like I I was

74
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,960
mentioning. It's really it's it's right

75
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,639
on you. You know that that ghost pepper

76
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,000
is there. You can taste it. You can

77
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,120
taste the ranch. You can taste the ghost

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,720
pepper. And uh Wendy's nuggets are

79
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:36,400
pretty darn good. Let me taste uh one of

80
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,400
the nuggets here with the uh the Wendy's

81
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,120
ghost pepper

82
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,120
just for a comparison.

83
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,400
Very very similar.

84
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,240
Yeah, it's good. It just doesn't doesn't

85
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,400
have the heat level. I have to say one

86
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,440
thing about the Wendy's has a little bit

87
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,919
more of a a vinegar flavor. So, I think

88
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:04,720
the mayonnaise they use might have like

89
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:06,639
vinegar in it. So, that being said,

90
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,680
make this recipe with Duk's mayonnaise

91
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,919
and you'll get a lot closer to that that

92
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,919
vinegary flavor.

93
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,160
Dukes. I should have thought of that in

94
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,960
the first place. Well, there you have

95
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,840
it, folks. Want to really kick up

96
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,440
Wendy's uh ghost pepper ranch dipping

97
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,400
sauce?

98
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,720
Or you could cut it in half. Add a

99
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,199
eighth of a teaspoon.

100
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,800
And uh you could actually add a half a

101
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,280
teasp. You could really kick it up is

102
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,919
what I'm saying. That that ghost pepper

103
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,680
um that ghost pepper powder was

104
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,120
fantastic. And it's just pure ghost

105
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,639
pepper. I'll put a link in the

106
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,240
description box below where you can

107
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,479
order that on Amazon because I couldn't

108
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,170
find it anywhere. Well, there you have

109
00:05:46,479 --> 00:06:09,389
it, folks. Thanks for watching.
