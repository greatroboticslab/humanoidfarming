00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:16,359
Our food, our health, our animals, our

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,800
environment, all connected in one

6
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:22,519
system. And at the root of it,

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:26,080
plants. They give us the oxygen we

8
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:28,400
breathe, the food we eat, the feed our

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,119
animals need.

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:35,160
But plant health is under threat from

11
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:38,399
plant pests, diseases, and climate

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:41,840
change. When plants are in crisis, the

13
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:44,879
web of life begins to unravel. A single

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,399
pest outbreak can destroy harvests and

15
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,520
fuel hunger, spread harmful

16
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,840
pathogens, increase the risk of

17
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:57,920
zooonautic diseases, and antimicrobial

18
00:00:52,840 --> 00:01:00,920
resistance affecting every one of us.

19
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,640
But we can protect our plants through

20
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:06,479
science, innovation, and global

21
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:10,560
cooperation to make sure plant health is

22
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,200
at the heart of one health. FAO and the

23
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,320
International Plant Protection

24
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:19,600
Convention, IPCC, are leading the way.

25
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,439
Establishing global standards, advancing

26
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,400
plant health policies, building

27
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:28,759
capacities, investing in early warning

28
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:31,520
systems to put one health into

29
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:34,479
action. Join us in the global effort to

30
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,439
protect plants in our future. When we

31
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:41,079
protect plants, we protect one health,

32
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,079
we protect life.
