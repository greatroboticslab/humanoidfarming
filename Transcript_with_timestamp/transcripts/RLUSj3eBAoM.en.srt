4
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,400
let's start a

5
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,119
new topic on

6
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,280
the forward edition system

7
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,880
we'll look into the details of the full

8
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,799
irrigation system

9
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,799
the design aspects the various

10
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,360
design parameters which are required for

11
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,400
the detailed design

12
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,400
but before we do that

13
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:37,560
i'd like to

14
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,560
establish a relationship between

15
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,720
various elements

16
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,600
which are

17
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,840
at once

18
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,840
time

19
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,159
infiltration

20
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,000
and

21
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,000
depoculation

22
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,760
this relationship will be a general

23
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,879
purpose relationship which will be used

24
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,560
for

25
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:18,080
all these surface irrigation methods

26
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,520
even the border irrigation method which

27
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,800
we have considered

28
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,959
earlier

29
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,400
this would be applicable to that

30
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,920
this will give you a general

31
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,760
understanding that

32
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,680
how these

33
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,680
items the advance time

34
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,599
the infiltration

35
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,560
and the deep population are related to

36
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,080
each other

37
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,640
and these relationships you can exploit

38
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,959
for the design purposes

39
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,120
so this will be a very

40
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,160
important uh

41
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,519
way of

42
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,519
looking at the overall forces

43
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,239
let's take the

44
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,239
caustic of relationship

45
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:06,959
which we had defined

46
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,959
earlier and this gives

47
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,959
the

48
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,440
infiltration that the accumulated

49
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,319
inflation depth

50
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,319
with respect to

51
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,840
the opportunity time

52
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,519
and these two parameters which we have

53
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,680
defined

54
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,440
c and alpha are the

55
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,599
empirical constants or these parameters

56
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,599
we had also seen that how we can

57
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,319
derive these parameters from the

58
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:39,360
absorbed infiltration

59
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,720
data which is taken in the field

60
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,840
so these

61
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,360
are basically defining the type of soil

62
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,560
for each

63
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,599
type of soil

64
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,640
these parameters are known

65
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,000
and t

66
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,519
as nothing but

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,840
as the infiltration opportunity time

68
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,200
in other words

69
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,519
if i

70
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,680
write

71
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,680
t

72
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,000
i can write this t

73
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,799
in terms of

74
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,799
y and these two parameters

75
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,280
i can approximate

76
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,000
this t which is the infiltration

77
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,360
opportunity time

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,880
to

79
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,720
this t here

80
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,440
as we have used

81
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,400
this t is nothing but infiltration

82
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,400
opportunity time

83
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,759
which means that at the surface of the

84
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,080
ground

85
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,240
for how long the water was

86
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,840
available

87
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,440
and for how long the infiltration

88
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,639
opportunity was

89
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,199
prevailing

90
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:00,000
so accordingly the depth of infiltration

91
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,840
can be determined depending on

92
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,759
what is the time of

93
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,039
infiltration or what is the

94
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,400
time for which

95
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:11,199
at least that assumption is valid that

96
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,280
the amount of water is more than

97
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:16,160
the infiltration opportunity

98
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,840
or the infiltration capacity

99
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,440
those things we have seen and since in

100
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,000
irrigation

101
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,320
when we are applying irrigation water we

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,240
are ensuring that the depth of

103
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,639
irrigation is always more than

104
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,039
the infiltration opportunity

105
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:35,039
of the infiltration capacity

106
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,039
prevailing at that particular time

107
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,039
but we can make an approximation that

108
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,199
this time

109
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,720
can be approximated to

110
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,639
the time of

111
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,960
irrigation

112
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,320
so when we find out this time

113
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,919
the t

114
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,639
t now

115
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,639
may be taken as

116
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,520
the required time of

117
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,319
irrigation

118
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,360
but what assumption we are making is

119
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,440
that the time of infiltration

120
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,639
opportunity is equal to the time of

121
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,319
irrigation

122
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,600
so indirectly we can

123
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,880
we can find out that time if we know

124
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,400
the

125
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,960
the characteristics of the soil

126
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,560
this this relationship is known which we

127
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,039
have already

128
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,039
looked at

129
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,039
now let's assume that the soil is

130
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,680
we make

131
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,880
two more assumptions

132
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,600
first

133
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,600
the soil is

134
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,160
as

135
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,160
uniform

136
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,800
that means the soil characteristics are

137
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,800
not changing

138
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,400
for that particular field which is in

139
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,400
question

140
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,120
and

141
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,360
we also make another assumption that

142
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,360
the

143
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,840
initial

144
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,840
moisture content

145
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,360
and also

146
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,520
uniform

147
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:42,120
now making these two assumptions

148
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,120
let's take that

149
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,199
the distance

150
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,680
led

151
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,680
we take z as the vertical distance

152
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,360
the distance set from the soil surface

153
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,440
to the depth of

154
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,039
nothing

155
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,440
if we when we when you irrigate the soil

156
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,800
when the infiltration will take place

157
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,400
the wetting front will move so if you

158
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,479
want to express

159
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,159
that wetting front in the form of

160
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,159
distance z

161
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,719
then this distance z can also be

162
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,719
expressed

163
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,880
it can be expressed as a function of

164
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,200
y

165
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,480
okay

166
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,839
that will be proportional to

167
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,800
with some

168
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:58,240
proportionality constant f k

169
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:00,800
i define as a proportionality constant

170
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,800
of case

171
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,360
then i can

172
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,040
express

173
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,080
z

174
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,320
with respect to y

175
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,320
and

176
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,240
if i substitute

177
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:27,040
y from the

178
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,640
the caustic of equation

179
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,360
this can be

180
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:36,480
expressed as

181
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:38,959
plus c t to the power alpha and okay

182
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,279
now this

183
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:44,399
these are two constants

184
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:47,360
i can express this as

185
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,839
a new constant which is

186
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,800
k

187
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,800
dash to the power alpha

188
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,320
okay

189
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,800
let's take two more

190
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,200
quantities

191
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,640
tt is time

192
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,800
required

193
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,839
for advanced curve

194
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,800
another field

195
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,160
time required for advanced curve to

196
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,440
reach the

197
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,120
end of the

198
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,279
field

199
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,279
and

200
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,240
of tn is the time

201
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,480
required

202
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,800
to infiltrate

203
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,160
the net irrigation

204
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,079
requirement

205
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,680
which is

206
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,680
y n

207
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,040
so t to achieve the net irrigation

208
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,399
requirement

209
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,320
if you need

210
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,959
the time t n

211
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,320
that is the time which is required

212
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,720
to get this

213
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,240
net depth of irrigation

214
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,600
and tt

215
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,079
is the time

216
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,959
of advance of the waterfront to reach

217
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,959
the downstream end

218
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:57,800
now here comes

219
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,800
the various options available to you

220
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,839
it depends on your

221
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,519
type of soil

222
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,240
as well as

223
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:11,680
the length of the field

224
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,600
that what will be the the value of t

225
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,440
in terms of t n

226
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,720
or what is the proportion of

227
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,839
t t

228
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,920
of t n

229
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,600
which is required for the waterfront to

230
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,519
move in the

231
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,120
downstream direction and to reach the

232
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,920
downstream end of the field

233
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,040
for

234
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:33,200
example right now we'll assume that

235
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,320
we'll make assumption we'll take one

236
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,760
case

237
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,040
where

238
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:41,200
we will assume that this tt

239
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,360
is 1 4

240
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,680
the time of

241
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,880
net infiltration

242
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:52,720
that if that infiltration is 1 unit

243
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,079
will take 1 4 the time for the walk with

244
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,120
the advanced

245
00:12:54,079 --> 00:13:00,480
curve to reach the non-instrument

246
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,639
so if we make that assumption

247
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,240
there can be various cases it might it

248
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,399
depends on the

249
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,720
characteristics of the soil it depends

250
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,360
on the length of the field that

251
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,320
how what will be the tt because the

252
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,680
movement

253
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,839
is a function of

254
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,920
how much of the water is infiltrating

255
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,160
with the soil as the water is moving in

256
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,600
the forward direction and is also a

257
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,720
function of what is the length of the

258
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,720
field

259
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,320
so these are

260
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,639
there's only one possibility there can

261
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,040
be many possibilities depending on

262
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:34,959
how you have fixed the other parameters

263
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:37,360
so let's make assumption that

264
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,360
assume

265
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,519
we are making assumption that dt for the

266
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,720
present case which we are going to

267
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,360
consider

268
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,279
is 1 4 30 n

269
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,079
time taken

270
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,519
for the net education depth to be

271
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,680
achieved

272
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,680
is

273
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,199
is four times the time taken for the

274
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,800
advanced curve to reach the downstream

275
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:01,440
end

276
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,839
so with this assumption

277
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,839
we

278
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,519
we divide the total time taken

279
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,079
which is the tn

280
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,079
into four different

281
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,639
parts

282
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:19,440
in such a way that

283
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,440
delta t 1

284
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,720
each one of these

285
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,560
are the various intervals which we are

286
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,480
going to consider

287
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,600
and each one is

288
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,320
equal to

289
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,320
t n by four

290
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
okay

291
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,440
let's try to have a look what we have

292
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,120
done so far

293
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,680
i'll

294
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,680
try to

295
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,560
sketch

296
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:01,279
this

297
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,279
then this is your

298
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,639
this is your total

299
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,120
field

300
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,040
this is the upstream and

301
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,040
the downstream end

302
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,040
okay

303
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,160
i

304
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,839
say that this is the root zone depth

305
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,880
which you are interested in

306
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,880
irrigating

307
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,759
fine

308
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,560
and

309
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:51,040
this rules on depth

310
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,720
the total time taken

311
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,880
you are divided in when you are trying

312
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,120
to consider what will happen each time

313
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,040
in towel

314
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,680
which you have considered

315
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,480
each one is equal to one-fourth

316
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:08,279
the total time requirement

317
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,279
so if that is the case

318
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,279
let's look at that what will be the

319
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,759
the depth of

320
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:23,680
water infiltrated in the first time

321
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,759
interval

322
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,800
the first time interval

323
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,800
is delta t1

324
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,199
that proof infiltration

325
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,560
as

326
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,560
if i say that

327
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,759
in general

328
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,680
the depth of infiltration if you want to

329
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,759
take in any one interval

330
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,440
will be a function of

331
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,360
what is the

332
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,680
the initial depth in the soil

333
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,079
and what is the depth in filtered during

334
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,360
this time interval

335
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,280
so if

336
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,120
y i

337
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,240
is

338
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:16,000
the

339
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,000
infiltration during that

340
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:22,640
uh or the at the end of the interval

341
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,640
and y naught is the infiltration which

342
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,839
was already available

343
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,319
in the beginning

344
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:30,480
then during that interval you have the

345
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:33,679
the increment depth into the left of

346
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,200
infiltration is delta y i

347
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,200
so

348
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,200
similarly

349
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,799
uh the depth of

350
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,039
soil which will become

351
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,039
wet

352
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,720
which we'll

353
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,720
call as

354
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,600
delta z

355
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,600
one

356
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,919
you can write because we are we are

357
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:08,400
saying that this is our total z

358
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,919
this root zone is the

359
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,120
red which we have which we are

360
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,960
considered

361
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,520
this is the total depth

362
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,000
so in the first interval

363
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,120
this will be the

364
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,240
the

365
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:25,440
depth of soil which will be vectored

366
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,440
in the very first interval

367
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:33,679
if we assume that

368
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:37,600
zero to start with

369
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,600
let's make an assumption that z zero is

370
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,280
zero to start with

371
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,520
if it is known you can take that value

372
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:50,000
but if it is not known then

373
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:54,160
if it is it was totally dry you can

374
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,160
always take it to be zero not a very

375
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:01,200
appropriate assumption so once you

376
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:04,960
assume this

377
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:07,280
you also need the value of alpha

378
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,480
to be used in that equation the caustic

379
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,600
of equation

380
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,280
let's assume that the value of alpha is

381
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,799
also known

382
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,360
just for

383
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,360
the present

384
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,919
problem let's take this to be 0.5

385
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:30,480
then if these two things are known

386
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,480
then the very first interval delta t one

387
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,720
you can write this

388
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,440
delta z1

389
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,840
is equal to z2 minus

390
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,160
sorry is that

391
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:49,360
1 minus zero

392
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:52,840
and z1 is nothing but

393
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,840
you have said that

394
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,799
0.5

395
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,799
minus 0 in this present case

396
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,799
this is nothing but

397
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,799
z1

398
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,840
okay

399
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,360
so in this particular case if

400
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,360
this is

401
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,360
delta

402
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,320
red one

403
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:46,760
i can similarly write

404
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,760
the expressions for

405
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,880
other intervals

406
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,320
or delta t2

407
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,320
time interval

408
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,280
i will find out

409
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,840
what will be

410
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:09,840
delta z2

411
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,840
as z2 minus z1

412
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,559
okay

413
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,799
now z1 is nothing but

414
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,000
this much depth

415
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,600
isn't it

416
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,440
this is z1

417
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,000
is equal to delta z1

418
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,360
so to find out the next depth

419
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,840
i am trying to

420
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,840
reduce this

421
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,799
led to minus the previous step which has

422
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,559
been considered earlier

423
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,280
and the previous interval

424
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,440
so

425
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,960
z2 minus z1

426
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,240
which will be

427
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,880
equal to

428
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,320
k dash

429
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,640
into

430
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,240
t2

431
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,799
to the power

432
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,799
0.5

433
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,200
minus

434
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,880
delta z1

435
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,320
because that one is equal to delta that

436
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,120
one

437
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,120
now t2 is

438
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,320
2 times t1

439
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,840
okay

440
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,640
so if you

441
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:27,039
substitute that

442
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,280
your z2 will be

443
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:31,600
k dash

444
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,679
into

445
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,799
t1

446
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:40,400
to the power 0.5

447
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:42,960
into 2 to the power

448
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,960
0.5

449
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:50,240
minus delta z1 which is nothing but

450
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:52,640
delta z1 this part is defined r1

451
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,640
into

452
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,039
two to the power point five

453
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,200
minus

454
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:01,440
one

455
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,440
okay

456
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:08,240
similarly

457
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,360
you can write the

458
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,440
the other

459
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,280
forms also

460
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,120
delta z3

461
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,720
will be

462
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:21,120
delta z1

463
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:23,760
and 2 3 to the power 0.5 minus

464
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,600
2 to the power 0.5

465
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,080
and

466
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,080
so on

467
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,640
after that 5 will be

468
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:42,159
5 to the power 0.5 minus

469
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,159
4 to the power

470
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,279
0.5

471
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:54,240
so this general relationship can be

472
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:56,799
established

473
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,039
and if we plot this

474
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:02,679
onto this

475
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,679
you will find that

476
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,039
at the end of

477
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,240
t is equal to 1

478
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,279
this will be there

479
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,760
the simple general trend if we take that

480
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:25,039
this is a linear variation

481
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,200
you can

482
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:29,440
find that over the length of the field

483
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,440
this would be the variation which will

484
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,880
be encountered

485
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,080
because of the fact that the water is

486
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,640
moving from the upstream into the

487
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:39,919
downstream end

488
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,919
and the water is taking

489
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,240
one-fourth the time since the time is

490
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,640
equal to the time to reach the

491
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,480
downstream end when the water will reach

492
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,440
just the downstream end

493
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,200
the infiltration will be minimum there

494
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,480
similarly

495
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,720
the

496
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,200
other

497
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,200
segment

498
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,440
you'll find that the

499
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,840
side of the segment the depth of

500
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,200
infiltration will keep on reducing

501
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,000
that is what

502
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,320
you will see in the relationship

503
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,840
and in each case

504
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,840
this will be the

505
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:24,480
the trend

506
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,480
of the

507
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,400
the infiltration for each of the

508
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,400
the smaller segment

509
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,799
for example this is for t is equal to

510
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,559
2

511
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:39,360
d is equal to 3

512
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:43,039
d is equal to 4

513
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:45,120
and if you go beyond this

514
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,480
if you go beyond this

515
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,559
take another

516
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,279
segment

517
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:51,279
you will find

518
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,520
but in this

519
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,559
this is 40 is equal to

520
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,720
5 though you have gone beyond the roots

521
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,720
under

522
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:12,480
these

523
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:14,240
equations you

524
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,520
if you just analyze these equations you

525
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,279
will find that this trend will be shown

526
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,480
each successive

527
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,840
z

528
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,840
or delta z

529
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,320
which is lower down we'll be having

530
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:28,720
smaller and smaller depth

531
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:31,600
and that is quite understandable because

532
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:35,440
we have been studying this so far

533
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,440
that what happens uh when you go

534
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,480
when you have the infiltration for a

535
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:42,080
longer period so that is what is

536
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,080
reflected here

537
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,240
that the initial infiltration will be at

538
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:49,039
a higher rate the later infiltration

539
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,679
will be at a lower rate

540
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:53,760
now if you want to

541
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:56,640
satisfy the

542
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,880
the downstream end of the field also

543
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:02,000
you will have to provide

544
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,720
the water beyond the stools on depth

545
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,799
that means for an additional

546
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,240
time period

547
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:10,640
only then

548
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:13,520
this component the the lower part of the

549
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:16,240
field can also be

550
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,520
satisfied or in other words what you can

551
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,840
say is that

552
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,080
if you want to satisfy the needs of the

553
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:24,000
downstream and also you have to ensure

554
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:27,360
that at least the water should be

555
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,360
available there for tn time

556
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,120
what is the net

557
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,840
time for which the

558
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:36,399
infiltration should take place so that

559
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,720
to get the achieve the

560
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:40,960
net irrigation requirement

561
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,960
okay

562
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:53,679
so that is what

563
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:56,480
you will you can write in the form that

564
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,480
to infiltrate

565
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,840
depth yn

566
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:09,279
into the

567
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,279
lower end

568
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,919
of the field

569
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:17,840
there should be opportunity time

570
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:24,080
at the lower end

571
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,080
also equal to tn

572
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,320
okay

573
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:37,120
but we also know that t4 is

574
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:37,120
equal to how much 4 times t1

575
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:42,799
and correspondingly

576
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,640
z4 is

577
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:47,039
k dash

578
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,919
4 t1

579
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,679
or

580
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:52,399
delta z1

581
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:55,799
and 2 4 to the power 0.5

582
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,799
the same thing

583
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:12,399
so to achieve this

584
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:15,840
the infiltration opportunity at the

585
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:18,320
in order to achieve this requirement

586
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,000
the opportunity time

587
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:23,399
at the upstream end

588
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,399
has to be

589
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,679
has to be

590
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:36,080
d five

591
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,600
which is equal to

592
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:41,080
t n plus

593
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,080
t n by four

594
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,399
r is also equal to 5 times t1

595
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,799
and

596
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:52,960
the corresponding

597
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:55,440
z5 is

598
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,919
delta z1 into

599
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:01,679
5 to the power 0.5

600
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:04,679
as we have done here the same thing

601
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,679
okay

602
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,840
now if

603
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,840
that is what we have plotted here also

604
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,960
this this is basically the same thing

605
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:21,840
which we have plotted that if you want

606
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,600
what will happen at t is equal to 5

607
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,720
so that is what we have plotted already

608
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,000
here

609
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,960
now

610
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,760
we'll define two quantities

611
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:34,240
which are very important quantities for

612
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:38,159
our subsequent analysis and

613
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,919
the design purpose we can utilize these

614
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,760
the first is that if you want to know

615
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:44,080
the average

616
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,080
depth

617
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:52,320
of

618
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:54,000
soil which has been wet

619
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,799
by

620
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,799
depoculation

621
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,519
will be there at

622
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:08,320
average depth of soil

623
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,320
is basically

624
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,600
this part

625
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:14,960
this portion

626
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,960
which i can mark here

627
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:18,919
this is the deep percolation

628
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:23,600
which

629
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,919
could have been avoided

630
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,279
but since we wanted to

631
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,559
take care of the

632
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,840
downstream

633
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:31,600
areas

634
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:34,000
we have indulged in this

635
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:37,519
departure

636
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,519
so this deep percolation

637
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,679
if you want to know that how much

638
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:47,360
depopulation you have indulged into

639
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:48,960
you can

640
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,039
express that as

641
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,200
delta z 5 by

642
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:56,000
that's the average

643
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,000
the population

644
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,559
delta 5 is the

645
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:02,720
maximum deep percolation

646
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,919
if if we assume that this relationship

647
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,640
is linear

648
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:09,039
and is varying from delta five

649
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,360
on the upstream and to the zero level at

650
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:13,440
the downstream end then

651
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,440
we can say the average deep percolation

652
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,640
is delta 5 by

653
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,760
2

654
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,960
which

655
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,960
can also be written as

656
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,960
z5 minus

657
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:29,039
z4 by 2

658
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:32,080
because delta

659
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:34,960
delta 5 is nothing but

660
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,799
z5 is the absolute value

661
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,880
of the total depth

662
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:41,120
up to that level

663
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,399
and z4 is the depth

664
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,039
up to the root zone level up the

665
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:45,039
upstream end

666
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:48,960
let me

667
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,960
let me say that

668
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,159
this is

669
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,399
delta

670
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:57,120
z2

671
00:32:54,399 --> 00:33:00,159
the next one is

672
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,840
i'll charge that 3

673
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,679
this is

674
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,600
delta z 4

675
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,760
and

676
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,399
that does that 5.

677
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:12,320
okay these are the initial values

678
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:14,080
but for each one this is the

679
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,480
z1 up to this

680
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,559
up to the next one is z2

681
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,039
z3 is at 4

682
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:22,480
and that 5

683
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,679
so you can

684
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:27,200
you can

685
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:29,600
use it either way this is z5 minus z4

686
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:33,440
that's what is detailed at 5

687
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:35,679
by 2 that is also you can write so this

688
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,279
in fact is nothing but

689
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,480
you can write this

690
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:41,279
this in

691
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,960
the general form

692
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:45,120
minus 4

693
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,360
to the power 0.5

694
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,880
into delta z 1

695
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,880
by

696
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,880
2.

697
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:58,799
okay

698
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,799
this is one

699
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,799
which gives you that what is the average

700
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,840
deep percolation

701
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:13,040
and if you want to find out

702
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,520
the

703
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:19,079
average

704
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,079
depth of soil

705
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:24,720
which has been wet

706
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,839
then you can express that as

707
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,000
z 4 plus

708
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:38,879
that five by two

709
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,119
so the total depth which has been wet

710
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:42,720
was the average value of that is the

711
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,760
average of the

712
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:47,599
the two extremes on one side is z five

713
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,359
and the side is z

714
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,040
so the average of that

715
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:54,320
will give you the

716
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,320
total depth which has been wet

717
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,320
this you can

718
00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:00,000
also express as

719
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,320
4 to the point

720
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,200
5 plus

721
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,920
5

722
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,920
to the power of

723
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,560
okay

724
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:20,400
now if you take the

725
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,400
ratio of these two quantities

726
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,839
the

727
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,839
ratio

728
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,720
of average

729
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,000
depth of deep population

730
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,960
to

731
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,599
average

732
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,040
depth of wet soil

733
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,960
you can

734
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,240
write this as that

735
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,720
alternate five by two by

736
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,079
that four plus

737
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,560
z five

738
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:13,040
by two

739
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:15,599
which is

740
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:17,839
five to the power point five minus four

741
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,760
to the power point five

742
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:22,160
by

743
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:25,200
five to the power point five plus

744
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:27,680
four to the power point

745
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,119
five

746
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:32,560
and

747
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:34,000
z delta that one is cancelled out

748
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,480
so this is the

749
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,480
ratio

750
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:42,240
which

751
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:43,359
is and this particular case

752
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,320
is point

753
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:46,320
zero five six

754
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:57,359
now in this

755
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:59,680
in this specific case

756
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:02,160
what it amounts to is

757
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,160
you can

758
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:06,839
now formulate

759
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,960
that if

760
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:18,000
the

761
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,000
time of advance

762
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:26,160
dt

763
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,160
as one fourth

764
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,320
the tn

765
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:38,480
is one for the net infiltration time tn

766
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,160
and

767
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,040
for alpha

768
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,040
of 0.5

769
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:47,200
the average depth of

770
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:52,240
the percolation

771
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:02,920
as

772
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,920
5.6 percent

773
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:11,280
okay

774
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:14,400
this is only one

775
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,560
one instance which has been analyzed

776
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,320
similarly

777
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,839
there are

778
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,160
many other instances which have been

779
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:23,760
analyzed by taking different values of

780
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,960
alpha

781
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,640
which means that

782
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,320
by taking different characteristics of

783
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,280
the soil

784
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,160
and

785
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,640
by

786
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,839
taking different

787
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,560
fvr

788
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:39,119
ratios which is the

789
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:41,760
fractional advance ratio

790
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,760
this ratio

791
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:49,680
dt by tn

792
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,280
we call it as

793
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,520
far

794
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,520
or

795
00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:00,200
fractional

796
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,200
advance

797
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,359
ratio

798
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,280
so if these are known

799
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,440
then you can

800
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,079
you can formulate the relationships

801
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,359
which can be used subsequently for your

802
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,440
analysis

803
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:22,720
and i'll show you some

804
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,960
values of the table which have been

805
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,800
which has been provided through the

806
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:29,599
similar analysis which we have done just

807
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,599
now

808
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:33,440
this table looks like this i'll just

809
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:35,520
pick up some of the

810
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:39,960
the values out of this table

811
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:39,960
so that you can get a feel of

812
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,880
this table

813
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:50,240
gives the

814
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,240
expected percentage

815
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,440
of deep population

816
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:03,440
and

817
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,440
on this side you have

818
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,800
the fractional advance ratio far

819
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:18,480
here

820
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:20,640
you have the alpha values for different

821
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:24,359
soils

822
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,359
maybe ranging from

823
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:30,680
point one two

824
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:30,680
point nine

825
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,599
for a

826
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,560
fire ratio of

827
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:50,480
one

828
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:53,599
or you can write it as t

829
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:56,800
that means the time of opportunity is

830
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:58,319
same as the time taken by the

831
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:01,040
the advanced curve to reach the

832
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:01,040
downstream end

833
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:07,839
you will have

834
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,839
the values

835
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:16,160
you can look at the order of magnitude

836
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,160
of these

837
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:21,359
values that how much

838
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:24,240
if you have

839
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:24,240
this parameters

840
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:33,119
fixed in such a way that your advance

841
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,560
curve or the time taken to reach for the

842
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,440
advanced curve to reach the downstream

843
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,920
end

844
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:40,319
is equal to the opportunity time

845
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:42,319
uh requirement

846
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:43,280
for the knight infiltration to take

847
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:46,400
place

848
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:49,280
you will incur a lot of losses

849
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,680
and those losses will also vary from

850
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:55,040
soil to soil

851
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:56,079
the soil as a function of alpha

852
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,359
so

853
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:59,200
if your

854
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:01,520
alpha is increasing

855
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:05,359
the deep population losses are also

856
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:05,359
increasing let's take another

857
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:12,079
sample of

858
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:15,200
when you have t by 4

859
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:16,880
out of which we have analyzed only one

860
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,960
but for the others

861
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:22,720
for example when alpha is point one and

862
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:24,800
you have a ratio of t by four

863
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,160
in this particular case

864
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,160
the

865
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:30,079
depopulation losses will be one point

866
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:35,800
one percent

867
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:38,319
2.2 percent 3.3 4.5

868
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:40,160
5.6 that is what we have analyzed for

869
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:42,079
alpha is equal to 0.5

870
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:48,160
and for

871
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:49,599
a fair ratio of d by four or one by four

872
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:52,960
and

873
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:57,960
six point seven some point eight

874
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,960
point nine and ten percent

875
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:02,800
let's take the

876
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:05,280
other extreme of t by 10

877
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,960
that means you are

878
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,359
you are

879
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,400
flooding the total

880
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:12,560
length

881
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:15,599
in a very short period

882
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:17,920
that's where far ratio is t by 10

883
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:20,000
so in this particular case

884
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:23,040
your

885
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:26,040
the percolation losses will be still

886
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,040
smaller

887
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,359
this table now

888
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,040
can be

889
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:51,119
utilized

890
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:53,200
for picking up some of the

891
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:54,800
parameters

892
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,599
you can find out that

893
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,280
if

894
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,480
you want to accept

895
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,400
only the deep

896
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,800
population losses of a

897
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,000
specific range

898
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,920
you don't want

899
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,359
the depopulation losses to be more than

900
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,599
10 percent

901
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:11,200
or more than five percent

902
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:13,359
and you know what is the type of soil

903
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:15,440
which is the prevailing type of soil

904
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:17,359
you can pick up that alpha

905
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,560
and you can find out what is the the

906
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:21,520
most

907
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:24,319
preferable fpr ratio

908
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:25,040
which is which can be utilized

909
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:28,160
and

910
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:29,920
that can give you some indication

911
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:32,640
towards

912
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,640
what should be the

913
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,480
the time

914
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:40,640
of allegation

915
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,480
should be selected

916
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:45,119
and what will be the

917
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,119
the time of

918
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,839
accordingly the time of infiltration

919
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:54,240
which will be available

920
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:56,720
is not is not dependent on only these

921
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:59,119
things it will also be dependent on then

922
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:01,839
which stream size you will be picking up

923
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:01,839
what are the other

924
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:06,640
other parameters of the field what is

925
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:08,960
the grade all those things we have not

926
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:11,359
considered so far this is only

927
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,960
the starting

928
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:14,880
the

929
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,079
those parameters which are independent

930
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,440
of

931
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,920
the other

932
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:22,800
aspects of the field they are only

933
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,680
giving you the relationship between

934
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,280
the

935
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,440
soil type

936
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:29,599
which is through alpha

937
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,599
and

938
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:36,000
the advanced time

939
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:38,880
which is again dependent on the soil

940
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,160
type to solve a certain extent

941
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,480
and all these

942
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,920
relationships can be utilized to start

943
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,720
your

944
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,040
your

945
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:49,440
design

946
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,400
concentrations looking at which are the

947
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,400
most

948
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,839
suitable parameters which you should be

949
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,119
start with

950
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:57,440
okay

951
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:59,440
so this analysis is as i had mentioned

952
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,359
in the beginning that this not

953
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,960
only concerned with

954
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:05,680
the forward education

955
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:07,520
it is as a general purpose analysis

956
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,480
which can be made use of

957
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,240
and

958
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:13,240
all the surface irrigation

959
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:13,240
methods

960
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,880
next we'll

961
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,880
try to

962
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,200
now

963
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:30,800
start looking at the furrow irrigation

964
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:32,720
method in particular

965
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:35,839
first of all we'll try to

966
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:38,400
look at those relationships which are

967
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:39,520
obtained through experience

968
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,839
through

969
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,480
field

970
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:45,680
trials

971
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,680
so these relationships

972
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:55,000
which are based on

973
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:01,920
and

974
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:04,319
field trials

975
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:07,119
these relationships are

976
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:07,119
very important

977
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,359
in the absence of detailed data because

978
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,359
you can also use the hydraulic

979
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:15,200
relationships which are more

980
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:17,520
exact

981
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:19,040
but many a time you will find that

982
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:21,200
the

983
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,480
required data is not available

984
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:25,119
so you have to

985
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:28,160
you have to start at least looking at

986
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:31,119
the designs with some

987
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:32,240
some indicators which are available

988
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:34,240
and

989
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:35,520
since this is a very important area all

990
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,359
over the world

991
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:39,920
there are word organizations

992
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:42,160
like fu which have compiled this

993
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:43,599
information and made it available in

994
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:46,480
many reports

995
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:48,319
where is easily available where people

996
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,160
have come out with

997
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:51,040
under different conditions what will be

998
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,559
the

999
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:55,040
the limiting

1000
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:57,200
design parameters

1001
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:59,440
from various concentrations and we have

1002
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,880
already considered in the case of border

1003
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,920
irrigation also

1004
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,200
the consideration the major

1005
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,839
concentrations

1006
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:07,680
are

1007
00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:08,800
of the

1008
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,319
things like

1009
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,599
that the stream sizes shouldn't be

1010
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:13,359
erosive

1011
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:14,400
you shouldn't create problems for your

1012
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:15,760
uh

1013
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,720
fields

1014
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,960
then

1015
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:20,960
there's one consideration the other is

1016
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:23,119
that your efficiencies should be

1017
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,559
reasonable as with efficiencies

1018
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:26,800
so that

1019
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:29,359
will be basically dictated by

1020
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:33,280
what sizes you will choose will be the

1021
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:35,760
combination of discharge the stream size

1022
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:37,760
the size of the field

1023
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,040
with respect to the soil type and with

1024
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,920
respect to the

1025
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:43,520
slopes the prevailing grades

1026
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,240
when you look at the grades

1027
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:48,800
there again you have to look at

1028
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:52,240
are those grades excessive

1029
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:54,960
which can create problems of erosion

1030
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:58,480
are those grades very flat which can

1031
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:59,280
also create problems of

1032
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,200
the

1033
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,119
drainage

1034
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,319
so they are

1035
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:06,640
they know

1036
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:08,000
specific uh rules and regulations which

1037
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,920
are applicable

1038
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,359
all over other places you will have to

1039
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,720
look at the climate

1040
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:14,720
you have to look at

1041
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,240
as a technical area

1042
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,680
as it a

1043
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:20,079
a red area

1044
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:23,119
the rules will be different from the

1045
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:25,280
for the similar soils but if the area is

1046
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:26,800
humid on one extreme

1047
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:29,520
and the other extreme of the area is

1048
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,880
arid you might have to choose different

1049
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,960
parameters

1050
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:36,000
for example

1051
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:38,160
let's assume that it is a

1052
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,640
humid area

1053
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:43,760
in the case of humid areas

1054
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:45,599
you will have lot of rainfall occurring

1055
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:47,680
and that too

1056
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:49,200
the intensity of the infall will be very

1057
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:52,160
high

1058
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:53,520
if you go in for

1059
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,800
slopes

1060
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,319
which are

1061
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,359
steep slopes

1062
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:58,960
maybe that

1063
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:00,640
during the irrigation time you can

1064
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,880
control those

1065
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:05,440
those steam sizes you can control the

1066
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:07,680
rate of application of water but what

1067
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:09,760
will happen when the rain will occur

1068
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:11,359
there won't be any control

1069
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:13,040
at that time

1070
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:15,280
the slopes which are prevailing in the

1071
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:17,839
fields they will remain there

1072
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:19,040
so when the rain water will be

1073
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:21,520
generated

1074
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:23,680
the surface runoff will be generated

1075
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,800
that will create havoc

1076
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:28,160
they'll create

1077
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:29,119
lot of erosion and all your your

1078
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:33,040
fields

1079
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:35,520
might be distorted it might be

1080
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:38,160
divided of all the fertile land which

1081
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:40,000
was there it might

1082
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:42,079
damage the crop all together so all

1083
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,599
those things are possible so

1084
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:45,359
when you look at

1085
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:47,760
those

1086
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:49,280
recommended parameters you will have to

1087
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,640
take into consideration many other

1088
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,640
conditions which are beyond the

1089
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:55,200
irrigation conditions

1090
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:56,720
these things are very important

1091
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:59,119
and we'll uh

1092
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,000
we'll look at all these

1093
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:02,319
these

1094
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,400
relationships which have been formulated

1095
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:06,000
on the basis of

1096
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,720
the

1097
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,920
experience of the farmer as farmer might

1098
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:12,319
not be

1099
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,319
having

1100
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:19,119
the scientific explanations of all these

1101
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,880
practices which he has been

1102
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:21,599
indulging into

1103
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,800
but

1104
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:27,839
through the experience through the

1105
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:29,680
the common sense he has arrived at some

1106
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:31,280
of the combinations which are which are

1107
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:33,040
very scientific

1108
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:35,200
which are very realistic

1109
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:37,440
and those things have also been taken

1110
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:40,160
into consideration when the various

1111
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:41,920
researchers have looked into all these

1112
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:44,000
various possible

1113
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,520
details of these parameters and they

1114
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,160
have taken

1115
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:49,440
into confidence or into consideration

1116
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:53,359
all those

1117
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:56,559
those experiences of the local farmers

1118
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:56,559
and those have also been

1119
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:00,480
brought out in all those publications

1120
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:04,280
wherever possible

1121
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:04,280
along with that the other

1122
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:09,359
are based on the experimentation

1123
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:11,680
which for example in the case of border

1124
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:13,440
regression we had seen that how we can

1125
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:15,920
do the evaluation

1126
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:17,599
runs so through those evaluation runs

1127
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:19,280
you keep on taking the observations and

1128
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:21,119
then you analyze those

1129
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,200
those data and come out with the

1130
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:26,000
recommended procedures

1131
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:27,359
for example in the case of

1132
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,880
the inversion

1133
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:30,880
you run those

1134
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:33,040
stream sizes

1135
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:36,160
in the fields and see that how much

1136
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,160
erosion is taking place

1137
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,280
you find out which are the stream

1138
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:42,079
charges which are

1139
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:44,079
limiting steam sizes beyond which if you

1140
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:45,920
increase the stream size for those

1141
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:46,880
specific type of slides under those

1142
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,880
slopes

1143
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:51,359
you will have the erosion problem so

1144
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:52,960
that is how you collect the data and you

1145
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:55,760
make the recommendations

1146
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:57,680
all those things we will

1147
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,359
discuss in the next class

1148
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:02,000
and along with that we'll also look at

1149
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:02,000
the hydraulic

1150
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:06,960
relationships which have been formulated

1151
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:10,400
on the basis of the hydraulic principles

1152
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:13,200
and they can be used for the design

1153
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:15,280
wherever those data the required data

1154
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:18,480
are available okay

1155
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:18,480
any question at this stage

1156
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:23,480
thank you

1158

00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,880
you
