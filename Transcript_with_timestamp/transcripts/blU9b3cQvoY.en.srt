to this uh herum rice the her rice

5
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:37,000
project is one of the seven uh variety

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,520
projects of the Department of

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,039
Agriculture in the the international

8
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,840
rice research uh Institute in the

9
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:46,079
absence of short-term projects like the

10
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,840
heirloom project they could well be at

11
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,360
risk of Disappearing this aom rise

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,870
project is definitely a gift of the

13
00:00:49,360 --> 00:01:04,680
Philippines to the world

I am Mrs anah habing of baranga am ganad

00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:14,880
I'm married with six children and I have

17
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,799
also 12

18
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,079
grandchildren uh I am the leader of the

19
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:23,799
farmer here in Aman it is a respect to

20
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:25,680
our grandparents and without them we

21
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:30,119
should not be what we are so we have to

22
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,119
maintain the traditional rice

23
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:36,799
This research project of Erie and uh the

24
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:39,360
Department of Agriculture are of

25
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,759
significant because it will empower the

26
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,119
farmers get them organized so that they

27
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:49,439
will attain that economies of the scale

28
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:52,320
of late Market says that there is high

29
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,960
demand for uh aom rice and it even

30
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,840
command a higher price than the rice

31
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,640
variety that cultivated in the lowland

32
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,039
so there is a great opportunity for our

33
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:07,039
uh farmers at the upand community to

34
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:08,350
access uh the nich market which caters

35
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:11,720
to uh

36
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:15,239
[Music]

37
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:17,440
rice there is an existing market and we

38
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:19,840
believe that the market is even

39
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,120
expanding we're trying to get the

40
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,280
so-call geographical indication for

41
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:28,400
specific um traditional varieties so

42
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,200
this is like wine appellation where you

43
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,879
can really identify a particular ular

44
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:36,480
variety to a specific territory where it

45
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:38,480
is originating from and this is very

46
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,000
important for the farmers and for the

47
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,480
consumer life because we can know we can

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,920
trace where the products are coming from

49
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,560
and who's growing the varieties and the

50
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:52,720
location where the varieties are getting

51
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,720
the traits that they are known

52
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,640
for tourists are coming we are actually

53
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,560
helping the lodging in the manawi hotel

54
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,840
and we are helping people who are

55
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:07,159
involved in the tourism activities we

56
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:10,239
are helping them indirectly that's why I

57
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:13,200
convince the farmers that we should also

58
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:16,280
we should be active also and Revive Our

59
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:19,040
custom and tradition in farming we

60
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:22,200
return back our native rice we return

61
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,640
back all the fishes the delicious uh

62
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:27,159
foods that are growing in the rice field

63
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,959
and sell it and sell it to

64
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:33,799
the to the visitor so but while the

65
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:37,599
other people are gaining from the

66
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:37,599
tourist you are also

67
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:46,040
gaining this arum rice project is a

68
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:48,959
winwin win situation for Erie Erie got

69
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,840
to learn more about this um Alum rice

70
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,120
varieties particularly the traits the

71
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,720
unique traits that they carry to the

72
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,200
farmers because the farmers are getting

73
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,439
will be getting more from their produce

74
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,879
and they will be able to showcase their

75
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:05,480
culture their tradition to the world and

76
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,439
third to the consumers because they are

77
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,200
going to get the health benefits and

78
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,439
other important rats that these alom

79
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,799
rice varieties can provide it is a win

80
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,799
for the Philippines also for the

81
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,600
country the value of these heirloom

82
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:23,199
varieties comes from combining them with

83
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,479
the communities where they have been

84
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,280
traditionally grown the practices those

85
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:29,440
communities have used for growing them

86
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,759
their whole cultur is built around them

87
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,680
and and those heirloom varieties are ESS

88
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,280
central part of those communities their

89
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,639
whole life whereas when you bring those

90
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,720
varieties here into the gene Bank all we

91
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,960
brought is the genetic material we

92
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,720
haven't got the knowledge of those

93
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,880
communities we haven't got the rest of

94
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,960
the farming system that they're

95
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,680
maintaining we've just got the genes

96
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,199
what ought to happen is that we combine

97
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:56,160
their knowledge with our knowledge and

98
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:59,880
that would allow us to produce a package

99
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:03,080
of improved varieties and improved

100
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:05,600
agricultural methods that combine the

101
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,600
best of both

102
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:12,000
worlds in the Corda they own the seeds

103
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,080
like you go from one family they have a

104
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,800
selection of seeds that were passed on

105
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,479
to them from generation to generation

106
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,720
and you look at them and say like you're

107
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:22,440
looking at the gem every grain that is

108
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:25,240
sold really goes back to the farmers

109
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,840
because the way that our our NGO and the

110
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,960
market is set up is that there is a

111
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,400
dividend sharing sharing to all the

112
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,600
stakeholders the farmers the NGO and the

113
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,520
and the consumer and so all of that

114
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:40,720
plays into part when they sell the rice

115
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,720
and they you buy the rise at the premium

116
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:48,479
price if we lose the farmers if we lose

117
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:53,000
the teres if we lose all these earlom

118
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:56,039
grains we are poor what is Filipino food

119
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,639
is what grows in our environment and

120
00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:02,680
what people do to it I want you to be

121
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:04,680
feel that you're eating the Tera of this

122
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,880
country you want to taste the

123
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,160
Philippines you want to taste the food

124
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,199
this

125
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:16,680
grew from our land this was stealed by

126
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:20,420
Philippine Farmers the DNA of these

127
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:23,609
grains come from our forefathers
