fertilizer through a simple five-step

9
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:21,240
process step one collection and

10
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,920
preparation the first step in the

11
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,640
process of turning chicken manure into

12
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,439
fertilizer is the collection and

13
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,519
preparation phase collecting chicken

14
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,279
manure may sound straightforward but it

15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,600
requires careful planning and

16
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,120
consideration of

17
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:37,280
hygiene start by regularly cleaning the

18
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,360
chicken Coupe or poultry house to ensure

19
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,239
a steady supply of fresh manure it's

20
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,559
crucial to collect a balanced mixture of

21
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,440
chicken manure including both droppings

22
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,480
and bedding materials Like Straw or wood

23
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,399
shavings the combination of these

24
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,559
elements creates an ideal environment

25
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:56,840
for beneficial microorganisms that play

26
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:58,600
a key role in the decomposition process

27
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,920
to prepare the collected manure for the

28
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,800
next steps create a compost pile by

29
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,680
layering the manure with other organic

30
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,799
materials such as leaves grass clippings

31
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,400
or kitchen

32
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,320
scraps this balanced mixture will help

33
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,840
achieve the optimal carbon to nitrogen

34
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:16,240
ratio promoting efficient

35
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,439
decomposition step two

36
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,000
composting composting is the heart of

37
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:22,280
the magic when it comes to Turning

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
chicken manure into a valuable

39
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,759
fertilizer the composting process breaks

40
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,360
down organic matter kills pathogens and

41
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,520
stabilizes nutrients transforms the raw

42
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,360
manure into a safe and nutrient-rich

43
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,399
material for plants to initiate the

44
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,439
composting process turn the pile

45
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:42,360
regularly to ensure proper eration the

46
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:50,880
compost pile should reach a temperature

47
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:53,320
between 130° F to 150° F 54° C to 66° C

48
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,119
to effectively kill harmful bacteria and

49
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:58,240
wheat seeds if the temperature drops

50
00:01:56,119 --> 00:02:01,039
below this range turn the pile more

51
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,640
frequently to reintroduce oxygen

52
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:06,079
composting typically takes 2 to 4 months

53
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,759
depending on factors such as pile size

54
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,959
turning frequency and environmental

55
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:12,879
conditions regular monitoring and

56
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,800
adjustment are essential to ensure a

57
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:18,599
successful composting

58
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,959
process step three curing after the

59
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:24,080
composting process is complete the next

60
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:26,040
step is curing curing allows the compost

61
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,680
to stabilize further and ensures that

62
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,959
any remaining heat

63
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,000
dissipates this step is crucial to to

64
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:34,760
avoid potential damage to plant roots

65
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,160
when applying the compost to the soil

66
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,599
transfer the compost to a curing area

67
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:42,200
and let it rest for an additional 2 to 4

68
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,480
weeks during this period continue

69
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:47,560
monitoring the compost for any signs of

70
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,400
excessive heat or unpleasant odors if

71
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,159
the compost remains hot or smells

72
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,120
ammonal likee it indicates that the

00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:56,080
curing process is not yet complete

74
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,280
properly cured chicken manure compost

75
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,480
should have a dark crumbly texture and a

76
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,720
rich earthy smell

77
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,760

78
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,560
the compost is ready for the next step

79
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:10,400
in the transformation into a powerful
