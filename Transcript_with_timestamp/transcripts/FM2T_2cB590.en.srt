00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,920
hey y'all

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,400
welcome this is crystal from crystal's

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,800
denim garden aka crystal's den

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,880
and i'm back here with you today last

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,680
time i was here i spoke about the five

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,640
mistakes i made as a beginner gardener

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,320
today i wanted to share six tips to get

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,359
your summer garden started

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,120
let's get into it so the first tip i

11
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,800
have is choosing your spot and

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,840
considering how much space you have to

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,399
work with

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,160
when choosing a spot make sure to choose

15
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,559
one that gets lots of good

16
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,160
sun most crops need about four to eight

17
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,680
hours of sun a day

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,680
so we want to make sure our spot can

19
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,079
accommodate that we also want to

20
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,440
consider how much like space we want to

21
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,360
use for gardening

22
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,760
some plants like tomatoes and oak grill

23
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,440
will grow really tall and bushy

24
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,840
other plants like squash and watermelon

25
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,359
are going to vine out really long

26
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,280
so just think about and consider how

27
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,119
much space you can have for your garden

28
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,760
and how much you can

29
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,479
give for your crops my second tip is

30
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,400
choosing

31
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,320
the crops that you want to grow this may

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,400
seem like a no-brainer but i wanted to

33
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,880
give a couple pieces of advice or

34
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,000
give a couple tips on uh some crops that

35
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,080
you could choose

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,520
one think about native plants so what's

37
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,360
native to your area

38
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,040
how can you create a nice ecosystem of

39
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,000
plants that you know can thrive where

40
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,560
you live

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,240
also think about companion planting

42
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,759
companion planting is something that i

43
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,600
like to do and that

44
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,040
i kind of that's kind of the way that i

45
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,040
situate my garden

46
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,159
um that's just when you plant plants

47
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,079
together that can

48
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,759
really benefit from each other and grow

49
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,640
well together and you keep ones that

50
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,799
don't grow too

51
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,560
well together far away some complaining

52
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,560
planting that i have going on right now

53
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,640
are my tomato and basil

54
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,600
which both enhance the flavor for each

55
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,720
other my sage and tomato sage helps the

56
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,799
growth of

57
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,880
the tomato i have some jalapeno with my

58
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,840
squash and cucumbers

59
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,200
and pumpkins because they help the they

60
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,119
help those vegetables not

61
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,360
develop root rot and then i have

62
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,720
geraniums and marigolds spread

63
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,560
throughout my garden

64
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,239
to kind of keep away different pests

65
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,400
since they don't like the smell

66
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,920
so all of that is um some examples of

67
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,560
companion planting and what i'm doing

68
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,560
and just kind of

69
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,080
something that you can consider as well

70
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,319
and then also make sure you have some

71
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,640
really great pollinators in the garden

72
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,879
some pollinators uh that i have going

73
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,519
are sunflowers echinacea

74
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,239
marigolds geraniums nasturtiums to name

75
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,080
a few

76
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,920
those pollinators are gonna help bring

77
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,280
the bees out and get that pollination

78
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:41,040
process

79
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,480
going and continued so just think about

80
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,599
that when you're choosing the vegetables

81
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,360
you want to grow

82
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,959
the third tip i give is think about the

83
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,080
medium that you want to grow your

84
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,360
vegetables in

85
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,440
what are you going to grow them in are

86
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,560
you going to do a container garden

87
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,640
are you going to be growing in the

88
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,360
ground are you going to be doing raised

89
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,360
beds

90
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,959
think about how you're going to grow all

91
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,720
of your crops and what that best looks

92
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,360
like for you when you're dwelling

93
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,159
that leads me to the soil choosing your

94
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,959
soil

95
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,760
when i was first starting out gardening

96
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,440
i

97
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,000
kind of thought i could use any old type

98
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,080
of soil i remember going and buying a

99
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,760
big bag of in-ground soil

100
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,440
and thinking i could put it in my raised

101
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,360
bed well

102
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,480
yeah that part of my raised bed did not

103
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,440
turn out so well

104
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,480
and i didn't get the best like result

105
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,959
with that because i put

106
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,720
in-ground soil in the raised bed um so

107
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,360
make sure you're getting the right soil

108
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,080
if it's if you're doing uh gardening in

109
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,840
the ground

110
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,840
you'll need like a soil amendment so

111
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,680
something to add nutrients to the soil

112
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,040
if you are doing containers or raised

113
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,400
beds you'll need the raised bed or

114
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,400
container soil

115
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,959
go to your local nursery let them help

116
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,000
you i've gone plenty of times to my

117
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,239
local nursery or

118
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,920
seed store ask them what's some really

119
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,200
good soil to use for this

120
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,040
different type of gardening that i'm

121
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,120
doing and they've been really helpful

122
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,159
so let that also be a way to help and

123
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,000
guide you too

124
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,480
fifth tip is getting a good watering

125
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,040
system going i like to have water in the

126
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,519
morning

127
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,799
or in the late evening try to avoid

128
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,480
watering in the middle of the day

129
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,120
especially if you live in a super hot

130
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,319
climate

131
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,000
because then the water is just going to

132
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,319
evaporate and your plants won't get that

133
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,040
good

134
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,720
the nutrient those the good nourishment

135
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,239
so get you a good watering schedule

136
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,600
figure out what's best for you

137
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,440
figure out what's best for your crops

138
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,600
how often they need to be water

139
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,440
and you know kind of like let that guide

140
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,000
you and then my sixth tip

141
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,199
is just have fun beloved don't give up

142
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,960
you can do this

143
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,639
there will be obstacles there will be

144
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,199
failures there will be things that go

145
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,919
wrong

146
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,360
it's okay it's part of the process it's

147
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,680
how we grow and learn

148
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,800
last year all my corn got destroyed by a

149
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,400
horrible wind

150
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,000
this year i have something eating my

151
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,560
cabbages and i keep losing cabbages

152
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,759
left and right and you know there will

153
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,440
probably be other stuff

154
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,800
happening too but it's part of the

155
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,600
process it's how we learn

156
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,320
is how we grow so don't give up keep the

157
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,400
