you're watching video on demand, skip

through about 4 minutes. We will be

that's a good start. That's a good

start.

00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:57,120
Excellent. Scrapn, how you doing, buddy?

15
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:00,000
Always good to see you, my friend. Love

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,000
having you here.

well, right? That's good to see. Well, I

22
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,159
better get this game started cuz I'm

23
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,159
pretty sure my character's going to fall

24
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,159

screenshot to somebody and I've got that

28
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,280
black screen again. Oh, cool. Blime me.

29
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,960
At least we know what it is now. It's

30
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,040
just my character falling asleep

31
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,040

I'll wait for him to wake up this time

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,320
instead of starting with a black screen

36
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,880
like we did last time.

37
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,399
Come on, wake up. There we go. Right,

38
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,800
let's hold

39
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:11,080
that. Now, we need chats.

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,879
We want that one. We want that

41
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:17,760
one. Let's try text to speech. See if we

42
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,760
get that one working

43
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:26,480
today. I need to add those. I'm going to

44
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:29,080
try and get to that this week. I do not

45
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:33,760
have any

46
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:38,040
of the blurps working in here. Was it a

47
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:40,720
blurp? I think it was.

48
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,239
Um, I need to go back to installing that

49
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,680
software. We've been testing for a

50
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,720
couple of weeks now. We know everything

51
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,800
else is working. I think what I'll do is

52
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,599
I'll go back to running my source clone

53
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,950
this week.

54
00:02:51,599 --> 00:03:00,389

So, I switched extra stuff off and never

58
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,879
added that one

59
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,040
back. All right, let's jump into this,

60
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,040
shall

61
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:21,360

stream. I'm Glenn Bixley and we are back

63
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,120
with more Farmers Life. Welcome

64
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,720
everybody. So, first thing we'll do as I

65
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,959
always do, we take a bit of a look

66
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,519
around just to see where we are. Okay,

67
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,239
so the still is still running. Get it?

68
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,959
Still still. Oh, okay. I'll come down.

69
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,040
Uh, next bottle. 2 hours 45. Got 27

70
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,000
hours on the clock. There's Dez. How you

71
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,400
been, my friend? Good to have you here,

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,760
Dez. Thank you, buddy. I don't know if I

73
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,120
say it enough, but you're a great

74
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,200
moderator. and I do appreciate you. Uh,

75
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,319
blueberry mash will be ready in 11

76
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,239
minutes.

77
00:03:55,319 --> 00:04:00,080
Okay, 11 minutes. We got 28:00. So,

78
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,519
we're all right there. We're all right

79
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:07,200
there. Okay. Now, for anyone that might

80
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,959
be new, welcome. This is This is our

81
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,680
farm in the dark. Let's switch our

82
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,200
lights on. There we

83
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,519
go. So, in the last couple of weeks,

84
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,680
what we've done is we have built a

85
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:21,120
pigsty recently.

86
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,440
We've built all new sheds. You'll get to

87
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,720
see them better in the daylight. Uh we

88
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,720
do have all these new sheds built, which

89
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,639
we can have a look at shortly. We have a

90
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,040
new chicken coupe. We have a new

91
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:37,280
entrance way and a new mushroom

92
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,840
farm. And we have 30 hours on those

93
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:43,400
potatoes. Right.

94
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:47,520
So, let's go to bed and wake up in the

95
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:49,680
morning and let's get this day started.

96
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,040
What was our temperature, by the way?

97
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,880
We're coming into winter, I think.

98
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,800
18°. Yes, it's getting a little cold.

99
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:01,280
Okay, okay.

100
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,639
All right. So, yes, let's go to bed. We

101
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:08,240
shall wake

102
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:10,280
up. 10 hours sleep sounds pretty good.

103
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,039
I think cuz we're coming into

104
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,360
winter. No, let's go with a 10hour

105
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,680
sleep. We'll do some longer sleeps in

106
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,680
winter, I think. Let's actually see how

107
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,680
that sets us anyway for

108
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:27,840
stamina. Oh, I've never noticed that.

109
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,840
So, even the night takes a little

110
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:34,479
longer. Okay. While you're sleeping.

111
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,320
Okay, we do have full stamina.

112
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:39,759
Excellent. Yeah, everything's a little

113
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:43,759
slower now. We changed our clock speed

114
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:45,479
or at least our game speed last week and

115
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:50,280
I am now

116
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:51,880
playing with reduced speed. We're at

117
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,039
0.1

118
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,600
speed which I am finding a lot more

119
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:00,320
relaxing and

120
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:03,479
enjoyable. Really love the slower speed.

121
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:06,080
Uh let's grab Oops, wrong

122
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:09,199
button. I keep forgetting. You can't do

123
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:12,000
that. Uh, let's drag you over and we'll

124
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,479
grab eight is more than enough. We only

125
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,080
need like two.

126
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:17,160
Probably three. Oh, there you go. I

127
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,160
wasn't far

128
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:23,680
off. All right. Next bottle is what? 1

129
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:26,479
hour 42. Okay. And we still have mash.

130
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:30,120
So, let's throw that back in there. We

131
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:32,400
have six bottles of moonshine to sell.

132
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,319
Beautiful. Why am I holding on to some

133
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,600
mash? cuz I just took that off the stove

134
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,759
clean. All right, I think what we should

135
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,440
do today is buy some more distilleries.

136
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,039
Now, I've had a few people criticize

137
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,960
that I only have one

138
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:50,319
still. And considering I brew in real

139
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,880
life, I do agree. One still, it's just

140
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,880
still not

141
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:58,639
enough. Uh,

142
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:01,039
let's Oops, not the lights. No, not the

143
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,520
lights. The door thingy. Right. Thank

144
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:06,240
you. Let's have a quick drink of some

145
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,199
water. We'll go check on our animals.

146
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,800
Make sure they're all

147
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:13,599
good. We'll grab some food as we go and

148
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,560
do our rounds. Actually, let's just cuz

149
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:21,120
this is so much more organized now.

150
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,120
Let's do our rounds properly. We

151
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:26,120
need a

152
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:29,440
pitchfork. We need a

153
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,560
brush. Oh, we need our coffee. Oh, we've

154
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,240
actually got some in there. Actually,

155
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,319
we'll leave some in the tool shed. I

156
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,759
think that's probably a good idea. All

157
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,199
right. All

158
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:40,560
right. This is so much more organized.

159
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,720
Look at that. We can go straight from

160
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,599
there to

161
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:47,120
there. 116 food. Oh, that might be a

162
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:50,160
little too much. Oh, no. We can carry

163
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,319
more now. I forgot I also turned up the

164
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,000
carry capacity so I wouldn't have to

165
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,560
spend so much time running back and

166
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,800
forth all the time cuz that can be a

167
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,479
little boring to watch as a live stream.

168
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,479
We've got the pretty good idea on how

169
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:05,879
the base game runs now with

170
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:09,680
time as well

171
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:11,599
as Oops. The cat is still missing. Yes.

172
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,120
Um with time and everything else. We

173
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,800
pretty much got that sus now. Can you

174
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,960
move? Cuz I want to get that food

175
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,720
without getting you. All right. Um we'll

176
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,360
clean this place up before I brush them.

177
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,280
I think this is much nicer with fewer

178
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,440
picks.

179
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:33,200
I should clean up the dung. I did.

180
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:36,719
So now we've got a few less pigs or

181
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,839
fewer fewer. Yeah, we got less pigs and

182
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,279
there's a lot more space in here. Hey

183
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:44,800
Fluffy, this is certainly a lot easier

184
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:47,279
to get around. The only thing is we're

185
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,959
going to want some of this done for our

186
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:52,120
fields in spring. Hopefully there'll be

187
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:55,040
enough. All

188
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:57,839
right, let's clean these guys up.

189
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,959
Actually, if I put that on two and I put

190
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:03,120
the pitchfork

191
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:05,680
on one, that'll make it easier. Right

192
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,360
now, we can just hot pee these. So,

193
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,640
well, yes, we'll just feed the animals.

194
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,279
We'll clean up the place a little bit.

195
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,480
There's a bit done I

196
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:15,200
missed. And then we'll figure out what

197
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:18,560
we got to do. So, we are coming up

198
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,800
towards winter now. I have one small

199
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,760
potato crop.

200
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,959
Other than

201
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:27,000
that, we're pretty much just getting

202
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,200
ready for what's going to be my longest

203
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,360
winter. And I say that because of the

204
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:35,200
slower time, but it may mean all these

205
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,360
jobs that I keep saying I will do in

206
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:42,640
winter are finally going to be able to

207
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:45,760
get done. So, this enclosure here, the

208
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:48,920
pigs die, was one I've been trying to do

209
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:52,800
for about 3 years in

210
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:54,959
game in game years, I mean, and never

211
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,600
actually managed to get it done until

212
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:59,040
last winter. So much nicer. I think

213
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,640
we'll keep all the trees and everything

214
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,880
in here. I kind of like those for the

215
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,399
pig sty. That's right. This is a small

216
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,320
gate, isn't it? I keep forgetting about

217
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,120
that one.

218
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,959
Uh, our berries all along the back of

219
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,399
the house. We got some wood there. All

220
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:17,120
right, so we got to clean up a little

221
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,040
bit this winter. Do we brush sheep? We

222
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,279
do.

223
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,760
I stepped on dung. Damn it. Oh, well, we

224
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,279
better clean that up

225
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,839
first. All right, we'll give the give

226
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:30,640
the ladies a haircut. Uh, not a haircut.

227
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:33,000
Sorry. Give him a brush. We'll clean up

228
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,680
all this

229
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,560
dung. Hey, Mumu.

230
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,079
How are

231
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,000
you? Oh, this is so much better with

232
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,440
less

233
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,360
animals. You don't step in it everywhere

234
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,360
you go.

235
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,320
My shoes wreak. I didn't step in it, did

236
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,959
I? Oh, man. Now my shoes are going to

237
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,959
stick all

238
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:00,399
day. It's so much easier to clean up

239
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,680
when you got less animals. I think what

240
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,240
I need to do as part of our new

241
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,560
organization this

242
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:10,640
winter will

243
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:13,600
be to make separate areas for each

244
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,560
animal. So, this will be for the cows.

245
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:19,399
At the moment, the sheep are in here.

246
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:22,399
Oh, I need another bin back here, don't

247
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:25,120
I? I do. No, we got this one. We got the

248
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:28,160
original one. I forgot about it. Right.

249
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:32,040
That's the very first one. Right. Why

250
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:35,120
are you sleeping in the dung

251
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:38,000
pile? Recovering after giving birth 1

252
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,880
month. Okay, you will live for 15. So,

253
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,399
we might sell you this year. Well, maybe

254
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:48,079
it wasn't you. Maybe it was a

255
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:50,320
rat. Uh, fatness pregnant seven month

256
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,560
not have get back here and I'm brushing

257
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,959
you. Lamb chops. I remember watching

258
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,000
lamb chops when I was a kid. Was that

259
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,000
not the lamb chops you

260
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,760
me? We could make lamb chops. We

261
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:08,600
certainly

262
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:13,040
could. Hey, get back here. Right, you're

263
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:15,839
done. All right. I love lamb. Lamb is my

264
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:18,240
favorite meat. I have to say I eat a lot

265
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:22,079
of chicken, but that's cuz it's cheap.

266
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,440
When I was a kid, lamb used to be cheap.

267
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,639
Some of you have probably heard that New

268
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:29,680
Zealand's in the country with more sheep

269
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,279
than people. That's true, but we need

270
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,880
more sheep in this country. We used to

271
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:38,480
have more and now there's not enough.

272
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:41,279
Lamb is so expensive here. Used to be a

273
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,200
really cheap meal. All right, let's uh

274
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:46,079
actually we're going to need we're going

275
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,480
to need probably a bin in here. Let's do

276
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,399
that

277
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,639
now to keep a milking bucket. That's not

278
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,880
what you meant to

279
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:56,760
press. Cuz I would

280
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:59,240
like a milking bucket

281
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:03,240
here. A

282
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:06,680
chest. Big chests, aren't

283
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:08,920
they? So, we might build this this

284
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,399
winter just

285
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:16,040
to make sure that we

286
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:16,040
have stuff for the cows.

287
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,279
Oh, tree needs material. I keep

288
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,240
forgetting in this game you have to have

289
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,760
materials to lay down a blueprint. Um,

290
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,440
that's all right. We'll get to it. Okay,

291
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,000
you can cancel the blueprint now. Thank

292
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,600
you. We'll get to that. So, that'll be

293
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,490
something we'll do during this winter as

294
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:38,919
well. Right. Let's throw some food in

295
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:38,919
[Music]

296
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,120
here.

297
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,959
Excellent. Shut that. Actually, that's

298
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,800
right. I left the other side open in

299
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:56,040
case chickens decide to come in here.

300
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:58,720
Now, we've got no animals in here at the

301
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:00,079
moment. All right. Do we brush the dog

302
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,680
in this game? I've never thought about

303
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:06,000
it. Let's try brushing the

304
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:07,920
dog. Oh, you're 100% clean. Still have

305
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,600
not seen the cat. No, no idea where the

306
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,399
cat's gone, but there is food in the

307
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,519
cat's bowl, so that's not an excuse.

308
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,440
Maybe we could try finding the cat

309
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:18,720
today, cuz we did find some animals last

310
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,480
week.

311
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,560
amazed at the amount of animals we found

312
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,040
with slower time period. Is there a

313
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:28,440
bucket in here? We could use this one

314
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:32,519
instead of the shed bucket. Oh, I want

315
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:35,680
that. And we'll give that to the

316
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:38,880
pigs. We'll give that to the pigs. So,

317
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,880
they have a second food

318
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:48,720
bowl. All right. Uh, wrong button.

319
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,800
inventory. If I bring the tractor

320
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,360
through that

321
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:00,560
way, let's actually just pop it over

322
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,959
here. Make it nice and easy when they're

323
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,959
side by

324
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,560
side. There we go. Plenty of food for

325
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,959
the pigs. No excuse for them to not

326
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,480
fatten up this season. Cuz last year

327
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:15,040
they got a bit skinny. When we sold

328
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,399
them, they were all very skinny. I'm

329
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,959
going to keep the brush. I was about to

330
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,880
get rid of it, but let's see. Oh, yeah.

331
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:23,279
Okay. Stupid idea. I was about to say,

332
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:27,279
let's see if we can brush a chicken or a

333
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,279
duck. How you going to catch it,

334
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:34,399
Glenn? Right. Now that we've got a lot

335
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,160
of food trays in here, we should end up

336
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,079
with more chickens and ducks this year

337
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,040
as well.

338
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:44,199
Now, in this game, you do not need to

339
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:49,279
worry about the eggs you take

340
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:50,720
from the nests. They don't prevent the

341
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,880
chickens from breeding. You can take

342
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,880
them

343
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,160
all. When I first started, I was leaving

344
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:01,199
eggs behind cuz I wanted the chickens to

345
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,920
breed. And then it didn't seem to make

346
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:05,839
any difference. So, I

347
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,839
Googled. And according to the developers

348
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,199
on

349
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:11,360
Steam, it says you don't need to worry

350
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,360
about

351
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:18,279
it. Some of those uh Steam forums are

352
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:21,279
pretty good and you need

353
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:21,279
help. All

354
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,360
right, go check our mushrooms. I think

355
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,160
our mushrooms are going to need another

356
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:31,519
day or so. But we do

357
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,279
have chicken. I'm going to brush. I'd

358
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,480
watch out if I was you. I think I

359
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:38,639
actually managed to brush that

360
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,720
chicken. I heard the noise. All right.

361
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,079
Why are you not There we go. Okay. So,

362
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,399
yeah, we got a couple of

363
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:48,160
days. We are going to run out of manure.

364
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:51,199
We're going to need more animals just

365
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:53,839
for the manure. Interesting. Unless we

366
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,839
start buying

367
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,880
poo. What's the best place to click?

368
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,959
I've been clicking hack, but I don't

369
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:04,480
think Oh, maybe it is. I say I don't

370
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,480
think it is, but I don't

371
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:09,360
know cuz see when you click these they

372
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,360
highlight. Oh no, it did work. I must

373
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,439
have just missed before. Oh well, we're

374
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,039
all good. Yeah, they have a day to go.

375
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:19,520
We have another day on the potatoes. 19

376
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:22,880
hours. All right, let's put our tools

377
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:25,760
away. So, our sheds that we have, this

378
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,919
is our new repair shed. We can actually

379
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:31,440
repair our items. I wonder if a brush

380
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,440
ever needs repairs.

381
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,520
Do brushes ever need repairs? I had

382
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,919
never thought about it

383
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:42,000
before. I've never actually repaired. I

384
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,960
don't know how to repair this. Ah, that

385
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
won't make sense. What about this?

386
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,160
I don't know how to repair it. Is that

387
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,080
cuz it's not broken? All right. We have

388
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,799
our new sewing shed. Last week, we made

389
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:56,080
a whole lot of new clothes. So, we made

390
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:58,880
a night gown for when we get married.

391
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,880
And we also

392
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:09,080
made was

393
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:09,080
it not bear fur? No. We also made

394
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:17,240
which set was it?

395
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:20,080
Welcome Michelle. How are

396
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,679
you? Red set. Oh, we might need to get a

397
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,440
red set. We need three wool and

398
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,039
raspberry. Oh, we can actually make

399
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,720
that. I might make some more cloves

400
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:29,360
today. I want to see a few more of the

401
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,799
clothing items. Um, nothing you can

402
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,880
actually do in here. This is the sharing

403
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,640
shed, but you don't actually need it. So

404
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,200
long as you've got a sharing shed and

405
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,000
you've got clippers, you can share your

406
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,080
sheep. I don't know who you're going to

407
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,440
share them with, but it's always nice to

408
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:45,840
share, isn't it? All

409
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:48,559
right, let's pop those away. Pop the

410
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,559
rest of this food

411
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,520
away. Oh, okay.

412
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,799
Is that all the food we have? I might

413
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,080
have to think about

414
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:04,559
that. We're going through a lot of food

415
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,720
right now. Okay. So, what do we have in

416
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,720
the

417
00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:12,000
dugout? Okay. Is that cooked fish? Fried

418
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,799
fish. Well, fried fish does not need to

419
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,120
be in the dugout. It won't go

420
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:18,559
rotten. I don't know if these go rotten.

421
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,000
That's an interesting one. We might have

422
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,240
to try that this year. I think I did

423
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,480
last season, actually. I think I did

424
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:28,160
last season.

425
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,160
Um, I think they did go

426
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:33,600
wrong. Oh, sorry. I'm thinking what is

427
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,600
that game noise? It's not actually a

428
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,640
game noise. It's sitting outside. All

429
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,640
right. Put our fish away. We don't

430
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,799
really need that. We'll put our eggs

431
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:46,400
away for now. We're not going to the

432
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:48,799
shop right now. Okay. Yes. Welcome

433
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,120
everybody. I hope everybody is having a

434
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:54,480
brilliant day. And if you're new to the

435
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:58,000
channel, thank you for uh joining us. I

436
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:00,520
hope you subscribe because we've got a

437
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,679
very friendly

438
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:06,720
community and I am so happy to have

439
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:09,520
every one of you here. Uh let's do some

440
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,760
more cooked ham. Requires a stove

441
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:14,320
burning. That generally tends to be a

442
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,400
thing.

443
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:20,039
So yes, thank you everybody whether you

444
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:22,720
be a subscriber, channel

445
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:27,600
member. I definitely appreciate every

446
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,600
last one of you. I don't say it

447
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:33,919
enough. All right, we'll throw the ham

448
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,440
on. An hour and a half. We got plenty of

449
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,640
time. I've got to better make sure it

450
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:41,840
doesn't burn. But because we're not

451
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,679
actually moving time so fast now, I

452
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,520
should be all right with that. Actually,

453
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,600
we could go sell all of

454
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:52,240
this and our

455
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:54,799
eggs. What are we at? 22. Wait. Let's

456
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,039
grab our eggs and anything else we have

457
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,679
to

458
00:20:56,039 --> 00:21:01,600
sell. I'm going to sell these

459
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:03,960
because we can't use three. We need

460
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:08,280
four. And you can't plant

461
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:12,320
them. Excuse me. can't plant

462
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:13,760
them. So, I think if we take that I

463
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,720
haven't milked the cows yet. I got to

464
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,720
milk the cows before I

465
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:23,919
go. What is that? That's our sourdough.

466
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:26,720
True. That's something I need to try in

467
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:31,799
real life. Making sourdough. I've never

468
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,799
made sourdough. Thanks for the dono.

469
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:38,280
Oh, $2. Thank you, script mech.

470
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:40,960
Appreciate it, mate. Thank

471
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:43,200
you. Can we sell Mark? We would never do

472
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,679
that. You know better than that. Why

473
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,440
would you do

474
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:49,240
that? Where would we be without people

475
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,320
like you and

476
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:55,760
Mark? I mean, I appreciate all of you

477
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,120
guys. We'd never sell you. Okay, we do

478
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,039
actually have a lot of broth I could

479
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,960
sell. Now, somebody was asking the other

480
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,880
day on the Discord how to make broth.

481
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,159
And in all honesty, I don't remember how

482
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,919
I made that. But the answer from the

483
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:11,120
developers looked a lot more complicated

484
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,120
than I thought.

485
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:16,039
Apparently getting the recipe is a bit

486
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,919
of trial and error. Bit of

487
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:19,480
experimentation. What are you doing the

488
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,919
wiggle

489
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,240
for? I haven't got him on leash by

490
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,080
chance, have I? So apparently there's a

491
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,120
bit of

492
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:32,559
experimentation. We're getting the right

493
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:32,559
brute. What is your problem? Come

494
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:38,880
here. I don't know what his problem

495
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:51,120
is. I can't even get him out of the

496
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,120
door. All right, that's a load of

497
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:56,919
bull. Never mind. Let's milk the cows.

498
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:03,280
What? What' that say? Everything works

499
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:06,039
just fine, but there's no milk yet.

500
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,840
What's your problem? Fatness

501
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:11,720
96%. Pregnant 3

502
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:14,080
months.

503
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:16,039
Oh, we might have to wait for her to

504
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,799
give

505
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:20,679
birth. Let's Let's put you out in the

506
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:23,840
field for the

507
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:25,039
day. Oh, we got two from that one. We're

508
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,600
going to let you out for the day as

509
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:29,440
well. Come on, ladies. Come and enjoy

510
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,640
the day. You didn't get a brush though.

511
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,480
That's probably not

512
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:37,240
good. We'll get to you guys later or

513
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:40,240
ladies

514
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,840
actually cuz you're both at 95%. Come

515
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,799
over here where the food is. That hell

516
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,799
got out. I just

517
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:52,679
noticed. What happened to your friend?

518
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:57,400
Did I not have her on the

519
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:57,400
lead? I do. Okay.

520
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,080
She's having issues. Okay, we're having

521
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,280
a couple of issues today. That's all

522
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:07,039
right. At least now we're not in such a

523
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:10,159
rush. Little issues like that used to

524
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,159
stress me out a bit

525
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:16,520
because with the time flow Oh, you're

526
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:19,520
right there. What are you trying to

527
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:21,919
do with the time flow? It made it really

528
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:24,880
frustrating cuz you'd spend 5 10 minutes

529
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,600
trying to sort them out.

530
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,880
Not such a problem now that time is

531
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:32,159
slow. We'll ignore them. We'll move

532
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,559
on. All right. So, that's all of our

533
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:36,159
little jobs done. Where should I put

534
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,919
this bucket? Cuz I really need the

535
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:41,480
bucket for milking the

536
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:44,840
cows. What did I just

537
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:46,360
see? Oh, the

538
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,720
dog. All

539
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:51,120
right. So, let's I think we should go

540
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,200
and buy ourselves a new still. Get

541
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,880
another one

542
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,440
going. And then what we could probably

543
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,919
do is use the

544
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:01,520
stills to make more

545
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:04,720
income. Okay, so we have Okay, let's put

546
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:07,039
the milk away. I'm not selling my milk.

547
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,559
We use that for making butter. We're

548
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,799
probably better off to sell the butter,

549
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,799
but at the moment, all my butter's been

550
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:16,240
getting used for cooking cuz we're doing

551
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:16,240
a lot of cooking in game at the

552
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,760
moment. Okay. All right. All right.

553
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:26,279
We're good. Everything's good. See you

554
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:29,600
guys. An hour and 16

555
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:31,360
minutes. I Oh, the last king of retail.

556
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,080
I thought you meaning there's another

557
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,080
one. What is it?

558
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,919
Retail. The first one was really good.

559
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:45,360
Oh, it's King of Retail.

560
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:47,520
Yeah. Oh, sorry. Okay. I misread. Yes.

561
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:50,480
King of Retail 2. It's actually out. Is

562
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:53,440
it? That looks Well, I don't know about

563
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:55,400
King of Retail, too, but I saw that the

564
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:58,080
other day. Where's my

565
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:00,640
bike? And King of Retail looked like a

566
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,640
really cool

567
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:06,559
game. I don't know where my bike is. Oh,

568
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,760
well, how's anybody going to say on your

569
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:13,080
bike if we don't know where it is? Did I

570
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:15,840
leave it in town or is it over

571
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:18,400
here? Are you saying no to the potatoes,

572
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,080
dog? You don't have to eat them.

573
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,840
Maybe my bike's over here. Oh, there's a

574
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:25,279
goose in the shed. Here's my bike. All

575
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:27,240
right. Hey, you guys can s your bike.

576
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:29,840
Oh, too late. I'm already on

577
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,159
it. Let's have a look in this shed and

578
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,559
see what's

579
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:36,159
here. Let's just see what's

580
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:39,159
here. I'm curious to know. No, that's

581
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,600
the wrong one for this game. It's E.

582
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:43,600
Oops. Oh, so we do have more food. I was

583
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,440
thinking I'm sure we have more food.

584
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,640
Yeah, we do. We do. I'll sort that out

585
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:51,120
when we get back or at least in winter.

586
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,120
something. All right.

587
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:58,480
So, things found by Telka. Oh, yes, yes,

588
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,080
yes, yes, yes, yes. That was last week.

589
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,120
All

590
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:03,120
right. All the pigs are home

591
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,120
now.

592
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:13,039
Okay. Keep getting off on the wrong side

593
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:17,000
of the bike. Our trailer's here, too.

594
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:17,000
Maybe we can take that home.

595
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:22,280
[Music]

596
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:24,440
All right, you'll buy the

597
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:27,440
[Music]

598
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,440
eggs.

599
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:34,120
Oops. Where's

600
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,440
Henry? Has he just not spawned

601
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:39,679
in? Where is

602
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:41,600
Henry? Usually Henry the drunk is

603
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:44,000
standing in the middle of town and

604
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,360
trying to pick a fight for no reason.

605
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,799
Uh, actually, we don't need to go to

606
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,559
everybody, Glenn. We just need to go to

607
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:52,240
the ones that you have goods

608
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:55,480
for. No Costa. Nope. We haven't got to

609
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,480
her yet.

610
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:01,200
We'll get to her in a

611
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:02,240
sec. Right. We'll sell that to you cuz

612
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,679
we're going to have to go sell the rest

613
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:07,679
of our eggs to the no cost

614
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:07,679
lady.

615
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:14,159
Um, you'll buy that.

616
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,159
You'll buy

617
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:23,960
these. Oh, we should have used these

618
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,720
pelts. Oh, there wasn't

619
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:29,200
enough. I want to make some money today.

620
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,039
Well, what about making pelts in winter?

621
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,159
We can go hunting in winter. Oh, why am

622
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:36,000
I trying to sell that to

623
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:39,600
you? Can we pet the doggy? I want to pet

624
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,399
the dog. Can I pet that dog? Oh, sorry.

625
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:46,159
Oh, here is here.

626
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:46,159
Henry's here.

627
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:52,159
Um, I don't know where Henry got to, but

628
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:55,120
he's here now. Are you not going to buy

629
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:57,360
my beets? You are going to buy my beets.

630
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,679
I just didn't try. You have already sold

631
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,840
out on eggs. Yeah, they only sell so

632
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,799
much of a certain produce. So, if you've

633
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:08,880
got too much, they will not buy it. You

634
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:11,039
need to take it to the state farm.

635
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,320
So, what we might do is grab our trailer

636
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:15,679
today cuz

637
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:18,320
apparently I left it here for whatever

638
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,320
reason last

639
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:39,279
week. Well, that sent it flying.

640
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:45,559
Okay, let's try this again. Not sure why

641
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:48,440
that didn't connect. Can you stay

642
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:51,440
standing? Oh, said stay

643
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,440
standing.

644
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:07,559
No. What am I doing wrong? Attach. Thank

645
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:09,720
you. Right. So, we get this trailer

646
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:13,000
home. Then I

647
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:16,159
think we should go buy a new

648
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,919
still. How much money did we have? Two

649
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:21,120
grand. That's enough. I'm pretty sure

650
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:25,240
that's enough. Matt, it's fast travel

651
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,240
home. 1 minute.

652
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,640
All

653
00:30:38,679 --> 00:30:44,080
right, detach

654
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:46,240
that. Um, whoops. Stuck, stuck, stuck.

655
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,320
Right. So, now another thing discussed

656
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,960
on the Discord for any of you who are

657
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,799
from the Farmers Life Discord. I did say

658
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,799
I have most of the equipment cuz

659
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:56,559
somebody was wondering about equipment.

660
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:58,480
So, of course, this is your original

661
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:01,679
tractor. It's generally found over that

662
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,640
way somewhere. I think next to here. You

663
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:06,960
need to put it together using the

664
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:08,399
wrench. So if you when you start, you'll

665
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,640
have a wrench, pretty sure. Otherwise,

666
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:12,240
you can go and purchase one. When you

667
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,320
walk up to the tractor with the wrench,

668
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,279
it will then tell you what parts are

669
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,880
required to fix it. I have the trailer.

670
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:22,559
One of the most important things you'll

671
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,559
need. We have the lawn

672
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:28,640
mower. We have a tiller cuz somebody was

673
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,919
suggesting that the game needs a tiller.

674
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:34,000
Uh sorry, a a plow. So this is our three

675
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:36,480
row plow. There is also a single row

676
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,760
plow I believe as well. But this is the

677
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,960
three row. Then you've got the digger.

678
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:44,279
So that is what we use to dig out our

679
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:46,679
potatoes and other

680
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:50,679
vegetables. Then we have our manure

681
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:55,320
spreader. What a load of that is.

682
00:31:50,679 --> 00:31:57,840
Uh sorry I had to.

683
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:59,360
Um and then of course our cedar.

684
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:02,960
Probably the most important of all of

685
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:06,159
our vehicles is the cedar. And I forgot

686
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:08,880
we had tobacco in the ground. 32 hours.

687
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:11,440
Excellent. All right. So, that is most

688
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,519
of the equipment. There may be a few

689
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,799
other items that I haven't as yet got

690
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:18,320
to, but that is the bulk of

691
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:20,799
it. Okay. So, we're going to head down

692
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:23,360
now to the state farm and go sell the

693
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:23,360
rest of our

694
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:27,200
eggs. I don't know why I always turn

695
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,279
around. Oh, that was the other two

696
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,200
pieces of equipment we purchased. Well,

697
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:33,799
we had one for a while. We have the

698
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,799
threshers. So, these are the big

699
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:40,880
thresher, which you put your grain crops

700
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:44,799
into. It will give you wheat or other

701
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:47,080
grains, but it also gives you straw for

702
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:49,679
feeding your

703
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:51,519
animals. And then down here, don't run

704
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:54,399
that way, goose. I'm scaring you. Like

705
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,880
we have the small threshes which we put

706
00:32:54,399 --> 00:33:00,000
some of

707
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:03,600
our hay into and and then of course we

708
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:07,240
get our foder as well as we get straw

709
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:10,640
from that. Right. Let's fast

710
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:13,440
travel. Is it an? I don't think it is an

711
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:15,919
but oh wait I shouldn't have done that.

712
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,679
Okay let's let's go and see. I'm pretty

713
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,159
sure it's not Anne. I think I've come to

714
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,960
the wrong person, but I was meant to go

715
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:24,440
all the way into town first

716
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:27,519
anyway. How you doing,

717
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:30,880
Anne? So, yeah. No, Anne does not sell

718
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,880
the stills. I didn't think

719
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:37,279
so. Okay. I think that's Thaddius's

720
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:39,440
wife. Pretty sure that's Thaddius's

721
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:41,679
wife. But we need to go sell the rest of

722
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,679
these

723
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:47,600
eggs. There we go. No

724
00:33:49,399 --> 00:33:58,240
Costa. All right. Check the board. Check

725
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:58,240
our prices. So, we are here to sell

726
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:04,640
eggs. So, you can see all your prices

727
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:06,559
for everything on here basically. No

728
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:11,679
eggs though cuz eggs is not a crop.

729
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:11,679
Glenn, you can't grow eggs. What are you

730
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:18,159
crazy? Yeah. Okay. Okay. So, it is only

731
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:20,159
it's only crops that you grow. Okay. All

732
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:24,000
right.

733
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:27,200
Mimi sprry. Mimi sprry. Exactly. Yeah.

734
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,200
Buy some eggs off me, love. 500 bucks.

735
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:33,040
Nice. That gives us 2 six.

736
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:35,119
Excellent. Right. Two six should be more

737
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:38,399
than enough to buy us still. Pretty sure

738
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,399
that's Thaddius's

739
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,000
wife. Let's go visit the wife. Fadius

740
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:51,200
isn't important to us right now. How you

741
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,960
doing? Helen, that's your name. Okay, so

742
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,679
a

743
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:57,720
distillery. They are

744
00:34:54,679 --> 00:35:01,119
1,120 each, so we can afford

745
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:03,680
two. Freaking awesome. All right. All

746
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,680
right. All

747
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:10,280
right. Tobacco, but not tobacco

748
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:14,160
seed.

749
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:15,640
68. We might be able to make some money.

750
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:19,440
buying

751
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:21,760
tobacco, rolling cigarettes, which I

752
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,960
really hate doing cuz it's such a thing

753
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:27,359
that my brain doesn't work with. That's

754
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,480
something we might try this winter.

755
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:32,640
Actually, we've only got 400 bucks

756
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:36,480
left. Okay, let's try that. I'm going to

757
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:39,920
see if we can take $400 worth of tobacco

758
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:42,079
and make money out of it.

759
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,079
And if you want to buy any com of your

760
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:47,040
tractor parts, anything you need to

761
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:50,079
assemble your tractors, this uh nice

762
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:51,800
fine young man here will sell you your

763
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:55,119
bicycle, your

764
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:57,040
trailers, your motor for your equipment,

765
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,680
all your tools, including the wrench

766
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,880
that you need to fix the

767
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:04,079
tractor, and then of course your tractor

768
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,760
parts and a saw bench. So any of your

769
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:09,079
tractor parts that you need to assemble

770
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:11,599
your tractor, they're all right here.

771
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:14,160
Um, yeah, cuz I know somebody on the

772
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:16,000
Discord was having a bit of trouble

773
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,920
trying to figure out how to get their

774
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,599
tractor

775
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:21,839
running. So, there's where you get all

776
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:26,079
your parts. That's what you need. Let's

777
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:26,079
head back home with our two new

778
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:38,520
stills. Now, we might end up

779
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:38,520
finding Oh, you're going to stand now.

780
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:45,599
Like we might end up finding

781
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:48,040
that we don't have enough room in this

782
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:50,880
kitchen. Actually, I have an

783
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:52,400
idea. Disassemble the table. We don't

784
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,760
need that anymore. We're going to get

785
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:57,720
new furniture this season, too.

786
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,480
I want to get all new furniture this

787
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:04,440
season.

788
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:04,440
Uh we're just going to pop that there.

789
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,160
Look at this rag. A rug. I was going to

790
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:24,079
call it a rag. It looks like a bit of a

791
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:29,720
rag, doesn't it? God blow me. Uh, I

792
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:29,720
actually think what we could do is

793
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,839
we rotate this

794
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,520
cabinet. Now, do I have to put it down

795
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:42,160
or can I put it? No, that's what I

796
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:45,560
thought.

797
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,560
Put it down first.

798
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:55,520
We'll make this our brewing kitchen. I

799
00:37:51,920 --> 00:38:00,040
mean, um, is it the stall in the way? Is

800
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:00,040
the rug in the way? Cancel.

801
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,640
Only.

802
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:12,160
Whoops, wrong button. Uh, can't remember

803
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:14,960
how to rotate in this game. This is our

804
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,280
stool for rolling our tobacco. Pop that

805
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,880
down

806
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:22,680
there. Can I move a still while it's

807
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:26,079
still running? Oh, sorry.

808
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:29,920
Um. Oh, I can. Don't know if that was a

809
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:29,920
good idea or a bad idea, but we did

810
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:38,440
it. And then what we can do,

811
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,480
pop you out of the way for now.

812
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,359
Um, actually I can pop you back here

813
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,880
because that's now moved. But I want to

814
00:38:53,359 --> 00:39:00,200
be able to see out my window. So, let's

815
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:00,200
grab this. Grab you out of the way.

816
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:07,720
Oh, there's another thermometer here.

817
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:07,720
Well, I've never even noticed this.

818
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,320
Let's just pop it up there for now. I'm

819
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:15,520
going to rearrange the room to make us a

820
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:19,640
little bit more space.

821
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,640
There's still room.

822
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,680
Right.

823
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:33,520
Silent protagonist thing. I got it

824
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,760
laughed and I turned it off not knowing

825
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:39,280
what it did. And now that he's back to

826
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,280
moaning again, I kind of missed

827
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:46,640
it. I kind of like listening to him

828
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,640
moan. I don't know why.

829
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,400
It's going a bit further, I

830
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:58,240
think. Hard up against the wall. That's

831
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:58,240
what we

832
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:14,480
want. All right. I used Oh, I was going

833
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:17,200
to say thought it was working for a sec.

834
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,200
What happened to the

835
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:23,920
wood? Did we lose the wood when I picked

836
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,920
it up? We lost everything when I picked

837
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,359
it

838
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:29,520
up. All right. I should have left it

839
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:31,839
alone. Should have waited, but never

840
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:34,160
mind. What's done is done. Oh, that's

841
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:34,160
what I

842
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:38,960
believe. What about that cupboard when I

843
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:41,920
picked up that cupboard? Oh, that still

844
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:44,480
has a stuff in it. That still has stuff

845
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:47,000
in it. And that still has stuff in it.

846
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:50,599
Okay, so we didn't lose all of that at

847
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:54,800
least. That's good. What I might do,

848
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:54,800
though, is I'm going to pack up these

849
00:40:55,480 --> 00:41:00,240
cupboards, cuz we don't use them. We

850
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,240
don't need

851
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:07,000
them. And I want to make a bit more

852
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,000
space in this kitchen for the brute.

853
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,839
Uh, it's all one covered. I'm pretty

854
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:17,200
sure this is I've never pulled this one

855
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:19,720
apart. Let's disassemble. It's all one

856
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,839
covered. I thought it was

857
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:23,560
right. Just going to get this stuff out

858
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:26,000
of here for

859
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:29,359
now. And this will just give us a bit

860
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,359
more space in the

861
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:36,880
kitchen. That's fine.

862
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:49,839
Why are you off to one side? That is

863
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,839
really

864
00:41:51,319 --> 00:41:54,319
awkward.

865
00:41:54,599 --> 00:42:00,400
Okay. And now we've got enough space for

866
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:03,119
one more still. We still have space for

867
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:05,359
a still. Something like that. That plate

868
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:07,359
up.

869
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:09,520
All right. I think I like that. Much

870
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:12,520
better. Much better. We can put another

871
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:15,520
cabinet down here, actually. All

872
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:18,800
right. So, we have 24 minutes left on

873
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:20,720
the ham. Okay. Excellent. Yeah. When I

874
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:23,119
took picked this up, we lost everything.

875
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:25,280
We lost the wood. We lost the water.

876
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:29,359
That's a real shame. And we also lost

877
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:31,119
the mash and any else that was in it. I

878
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:33,040
don't think there was any brew cuz we

879
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:36,280
actually picked that up.

880
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:38,640
Okay, we need another bucket as

881
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:41,440
well. There's a few things I want to get

882
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:43,640
on top of this winter. Now that we got

883
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,960
more time, we're going to be able to do

884
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:48,359
that. Excuse

885
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:52,520
me. I'm just a little

886
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:55,520
um disappointed we lost all of that

887
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:58,040
wood. There was quite a bit of wood in

888
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:02,599
that

889
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:02,599
distillery, but never mind.

890
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:13,480
Oh, saved. Okay. No, the

891
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:16,599
stills. So, what we're going to

892
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:19,720
do, let's get all these stills ready to

893
00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:24,000
go. We can get all three of them started

894
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:24,000
now. And we'll use the money from

895
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:31,280
these to get another one.

896
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:33,200
Actually, you know what I should have

897
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,680
done? I should have taken the booze that

898
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:37,560
we had in that

899
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:39,800
cupboard and sold that to get another

900
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:42,240
one. We still

901
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:46,400
could. I think the actually the lady

902
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:46,400
that sells us the stills will buy our

903
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,880
booze. All right. Yeah, it's a pity we

904
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:58,880
lost at

905
00:43:53,880 --> 00:44:00,800
wood. That would not be good. Uh, so

906
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,400
where do we have wood? I'm just going to

907
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,440
check. I'm pretty confident there's

908
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,880
nothing in

909
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:08,599
here. I think there might be some in

910
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,560
here for

911
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:14,599
repairs. 14. It's not a

912
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:18,560
lot. It's not a lot. We're going to take

913
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:18,560
it. We're going to have to find some

914
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:25,920
more. We might have to go out this

915
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:27,440
winter and just find wood.

916
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,400
Oh, we are going to have to get more

917
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:32,720
wood.

918
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:34,839
Okay. Is that going to be enough wood to

919
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:38,079
at least get the three stills

920
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:38,079
running? We

921
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,800
go.

922
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:53,440
Five. Five.

923
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:56,480
Let's just try that for now while I've

924
00:44:53,440 --> 00:45:00,319
still got some. So, blueberry mash, not

925
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,319
raspberry mash. Ah,

926
00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:08,880
stink. I want to do an apple mash.

927
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:08,880
Actually, we got three stills. We

928
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:16,800
could do apple mash in

929
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,800
one

930
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:21,440
start. Oh, this one's having trouble

931
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:23,720
starting. Here we go.

932
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:26,079
Okay, 3

933
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:28,359
hours. Give it another bit of wood.

934
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:33,119
Okay, we have enough wood to do that.

935
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:33,119
Excellent. We'll do potato mash in

936
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:46,000
here. Yeah, I had a lot of wood in

937
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:46,000
there. I lost. Never mind. That's

938
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:53,359
life. Okay. We're going to need to get

939
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,359
some more

940
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:04,000
wood. the mash

941
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:11,960
back. And we've got empty jars. They can

942
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:15,960
go.

943
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:19,960
Oh, might put some jars in here for

944
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:22,480
now. I think what we should do sell this

945
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:24,000
booze. Now I have flowers. What am I?

946
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,839
Oh, flowers could go over here in the

947
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,240
cupboard with the flowers on it. There's

948
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:29,839
yeast in here. I must have run out of

949
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,440
space and put yeast in there. I didn't

950
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:35,119
know it was in there.

951
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,119
We need to put that in the other

952
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:41,680
cupboard. Just going to stick all of

953
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,680
this in here for

954
00:46:45,079 --> 00:46:50,160
now. More

955
00:46:46,839 --> 00:46:54,839
yeast. We could do more bread then. All

956
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:57,960
right. Uh let's pop this down

957
00:46:54,839 --> 00:47:01,920
somewhere. Right here will

958
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:01,920
do. and we'll pop you

959
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:08,160
down. Right, that might light up our

960
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:09,880
kitchen a little bit. Now, I'm going to

961
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:12,560
do the cigarettes

962
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:15,359
later cuz I don't want to confuse the

963
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:16,880
money from the brew. Let's go sell this

964
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:19,920
brew. Actually, I'm just going to leave

965
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,920
this bucket in

966
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:27,680
here. Tobacco. We have more

967
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:29,920
tobacco than I thought. 27 tobacco.

968
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:33,160
Okay, we'll get to that shortly. Should

969
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:35,920
I? No, let's just do it all in one

970
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:37,440
go. Actually, I'm not going to do what I

971
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,440
thought. I'm going to leave that till

972
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:42,960
later. What we're going to

973
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:45,440
do, let's roll some cigarettes. Now, I

974
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:47,520
have a bit of issues with this. So, you

975
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,680
put down your paper and your tobacco.

976
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:52,520
Then you

977
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:56,720
get the dot has to stay inside the bike

978
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:58,319
bar, but my brain always looks at it

979
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:00,040
differently. And I used to try and keep

980
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:03,520
the white

981
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:04,960
bar to keep up with the red dot, which

982
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:08,720
is completely wrong. You got to keep the

983
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,720
red dot inside the white

984
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:14,240
bar. Jeez, I've got more right today so

985
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:17,680
far. Doing

986
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:24,119
well. Nope. We're definitely not lost.

987
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:33,119
So, we'll go sell all this booze. We'll

988
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:33,119
sell these

989
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:46,079
cigarettes. We'll go and get ourselves

990
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,079
another

991
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:52,760
still. And then we're going to have to

992
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,760
find some more wood.

993
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:12,480
Now, cigarettes can be used to

994
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:16,160
bribe or make friends. Are you bribing

995
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:18,559
people or are you making friends?

996
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:21,440
You need them anyway to bring up the

997
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:22,280
level of friendship between you and some

998
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,480
of the

999
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:26,640
traders. Some people will like

1000
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:29,359
cigarettes. Oh, that's what we needed

1001
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:30,800
cigarettes for today. We needed to bribe

1002
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:33,359
somebody. Sorry, not bribe. It's

1003
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,720
probably the wrong word. Excuse me for a

1004
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:38,160
sec. I'm going to take my jacket off.

1005
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,160
Caught my throat. It's croaky

1006
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:46,480
today. Get my jacket off. Starting to

1007
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:46,480
warm up now. Sun's out.

1008
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:52,720
It's winter, so I've got my window uh my

1009
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:54,079
curtains open, letting the sunlight in.

1010
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,880
During summer, I tend to keep my

1011
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:59,920
curtains closed.

1012
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,920
Keep the house cooler.

1013
00:50:01,319 --> 00:50:07,079
But yeah, I forgot we need these

1014
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:08,599
cigarettes in order to make friends

1015
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:11,040
with

1016
00:50:08,599 --> 00:50:14,040
somebody. I don't recall who it was,

1017
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:14,040
though.

1018
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:22,720
really can't recall

1019
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:23,920
who we needed the cigarettes for. We

1020
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:26,920
might have to go around and visit

1021
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,920
everybody.

1022
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:46,559
Oops. Screwed that one up. Let's do it

1023
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:57,280
again. But I do remember last week we

1024
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,839
went to

1025
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,359
try and trade with

1026
00:50:58,839 --> 00:51:03,040
somebody. It makes no sense to start

1027
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:05,520
without any tobacco. Yeah, you're right.

1028
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:06,520
It does. We went to trade with somebody

1029
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:10,720
last

1030
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:12,359
week, but we did not have a high enough

1031
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:16,559
friendship

1032
00:51:12,359 --> 00:51:16,559
level. So, we need to sort that out

1033
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:23,359
today. Okay. So, that'll be ready in 7

1034
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:25,839
minutes. So, we'll have to sort that out

1035
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:25,839
before we go

1036
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:33,440
anywhere. Oh, it would have been this

1037
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:35,440
one. Next spot already.

1038
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:39,280
said one of the bottles was ready. I

1039
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:39,280
swear it said a bottle was

1040
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:49,240
ready. I don't know. But we're going to

1041
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:51,839
run out of wood real soon. All right. I

1042
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:54,880
think what I might do very quickly is

1043
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:54,880
we'll just go and look for some

1044
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:04,160
wood. We are going to need

1045
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:04,160
it. already picked it all up out

1046
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:13,040
here. Now I can probably cut these

1047
00:52:08,839 --> 00:52:16,000
logs into firewood. It's not really a

1048
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:18,480
good use for Oh, that's um not really

1049
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,480
the best

1050
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:24,520
use. This is what we really need.

1051
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:29,559
Sticks.

1052
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:31,760
Um take it all. It's not much. It's not

1053
00:52:29,559 --> 00:52:33,680
much. Yeah. We'll very quickly go over

1054
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:35,119
here into the trees, get some wood so we

1055
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:39,520
can get those stills running. I have to

1056
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:40,839
wait seven minutes anyway for the ham to

1057
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:44,160
be

1058
00:52:40,839 --> 00:52:44,160
cooked. Quite

1059
00:52:44,359 --> 00:52:49,720
full. And we need to do these while

1060
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:49,720
we're out.

1061
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:58,800
only sticks out in the trees is

1062
00:52:56,040 --> 00:53:01,119
not the best way to get away. Oh,

1063
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,400
there's berry picking to do. All right.

1064
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:04,240
Well, that's what we're going to do

1065
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,760
then. We're going to get berries. We're

1066
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:08,079
going to get mushrooms. And we're going

1067
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,079
to get

1068
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:22,839
sticks. We'll kill eight birds with one

1069
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,839
rock or whatever that expression is.

1070
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:28,160
Yeah, I hope you guys are enjoying this

1071
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:30,359
game. I am. I'm thoroughly enjoying it.

1072
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:34,200
It's a great little

1073
00:53:30,359 --> 00:53:37,000
game and the developers are listening to

1074
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:40,160
feedback. So, if you do have the

1075
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:43,040
game and you'd like to make suggestions,

1076
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:46,200
okay, there's no sticks in here. You got

1077
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:50,160
suggestions or

1078
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:53,440
ideas, the developers are listening.

1079
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:58,200
They have a big list apparently of

1080
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:58,200
things they want to do.

1081
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:17,720
Give me a second. I need to clear my

1082
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,720
throat.

1083
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,520
All right. I don't know why I'm so

1084
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:41,400
croaky

1085
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:41,400
today. Don't know why I'm so croaky.

1086
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:50,960
Don't really like to cough or clear my

1087
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:50,960
throat when the mic's on. I try to mute

1088
00:54:51,559 --> 00:54:56,000
it. All

1089
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:57,760
right. Yeah, we'll get some sticks.

1090
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,800
We'll get some berries. We'll get some

1091
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:01,920
uh

1092
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:04,160
mushrooms. And then I think we need at

1093
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:06,800
least one more still to finish that

1094
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:08,960
kitchen. We might get more more of them

1095
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:11,839
later. But for now, the big problem is

1096
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:13,520
going to be keeping enough wood to keep

1097
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:16,800
them all burning. So, there's no point

1098
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:18,559
me going out and buying 12 stills and

1099
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:21,599
then only be able to afford to run a

1100
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:24,520
couple cuz of wood. That makes no sense

1101
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:27,839
at all. That would make no

1102
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:30,200
sense. It's still a bad idea. Oh, okay.

1103
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:34,599
I'll stop with the

1104
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:34,599
puns. They're not punny.

1105
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,240
There's

1106
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:50,319
two. We definitely need to come back and

1107
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:52,000
do a bit more of this today, actually.

1108
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:54,200
Oh, where's the hit box? Stop being

1109
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:59,000
awkward. Thank

1110
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:59,000
you, silly little stick.

1111
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:07,760
We should have brought the rifle as well

1112
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:10,079
so we could do some hunting. Come back

1113
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,079
in a

1114
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:19,920
minute. All right, we'll get those hams

1115
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,920
off the

1116
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:24,720
stove. We're going to need to cut all

1117
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:28,760
this firewood this winter. We'll use

1118
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:28,760
this for building next season.

1119
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:34,160
Another question that somebody had asked

1120
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:36,880
on this Discord was in regards to making

1121
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:40,240
money out of selling wood from growing

1122
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:44,760
trees. I wouldn't know because I've put

1123
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:44,760
all my wood so far into building.

1124
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:13,359
Right, there's another four hams on.

1125
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:17,960
Hour and 25 hour and 30. Perfect. We're

1126
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:20,160
not going to burn that lot, are we?

1127
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:21,920
Um, I'll throw my berries in the

1128
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:24,559
cupboard. So, we're going to make mash

1129
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:24,559
out of those

1130
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:31,640
probably. Uh, we want to put

1131
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:33,440
the sticks into them

1132
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:35,240
stills. I'm just going to put these

1133
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,960
tools in here for now just to get rid of

1134
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:38,160
them. We're going to leave the

1135
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,480
cigarettes cuz we don't need to be

1136
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:41,839
carrying

1137
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:44,400
them. And we'll come back to that bottle

1138
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:44,400
of booas

1139
00:57:44,839 --> 00:57:51,240
later. Oh, setting this one. I'll get

1140
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:55,359
the order of those right

1141
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:56,520
soon. All right. So, how are we doing?

1142
00:57:55,359 --> 00:58:01,400
You have

1143
00:57:56,520 --> 00:58:03,559
three, you have two, and you have one.

1144
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:06,559
Okay. Let's give

1145
00:58:03,559 --> 00:58:10,160
you I didn't really do math very well at

1146
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:10,160
school. 10 for you. That's

1147
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:21,240
11. Give you half roughly.

1148
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:24,079
I'll give you half

1149
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:27,119
roughly. Okay, they all have around

1150
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:29,599
about 10 each. Excellent. Now, how much

1151
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:33,319
time do they have though? Burning for 4

1152
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:39,240
and 1/2 hours. We're good. And 10

1153
00:58:33,319 --> 00:58:42,640
sticks. Seven uh 7 hours. 10 sticks.

1154
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:43,640
Yep. 7 hours and 11. Yep. We're good.

1155
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:46,480
We're

1156
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:49,599
good. Okay. Actually, what I'd like to

1157
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,599
do before we take off

1158
00:58:50,119 --> 00:58:55,480
again. Is it raspberry

1159
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:59,000
mash? Don't need all of

1160
00:58:55,480 --> 00:59:01,280
that. And wool. Do I have any more

1161
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:04,960
wool? I think we have some out in the

1162
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,960
shed out side. I hope we

1163
00:59:08,359 --> 00:59:13,040
do. Otherwise, we might try and share

1164
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:15,040
some sheep. I don't know how often you

1165
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:18,319
can share sheep in this game. In real

1166
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:18,319
life, you only share them once a

1167
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:29,440
year. We do have wool. Okay, some

1168
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:31,119
wool, some string. And why not? We might

1169
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:33,040
actually try shearing some more sheep.

1170
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:35,599
See if we can do it again. In theory, I

1171
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:39,000
shouldn't be able to. No harm in trying,

1172
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:42,240
though. Right. Now, I wanted to

1173
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:45,040
try the red set. Raspberry mash. Is it?

1174
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:46,880
That's what we have. Raspberries. Oh,

1175
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:48,920
Glenn. Yes. It's not mash. It's

1176
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:51,559
raspberries. We need to make the mash.

1177
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:56,119
Oh, fine. Be like

1178
00:59:51,559 --> 01:00:00,200
that. Did we have raspberry mash?

1179
00:59:56,119 --> 01:00:03,520
No. No. Blueberry mash.

1180
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:06,319
Okay. There's a difference. There is.

1181
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:08,119
We'll get to that later. for now. Throw

1182
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:13,839
all of this back in

1183
01:00:08,119 --> 01:00:13,839
here. Let's go try shearing some sheep.

1184
01:00:15,559 --> 01:00:19,040
Oops. I'm just going to drop it in

1185
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:22,720
there. We got plenty of space in there

1186
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:24,880
right now. I don't think we can, but it

1187
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:26,599
be interesting to see. The sheep are not

1188
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:28,960
in here. That's

1189
01:00:26,599 --> 01:00:32,119
pigs. They look similar, but they're not

1190
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:32,119
the same.

1191
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:40,000
Right. I don't think this should

1192
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:48,040
work. Can we shear them every m every

1193
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:48,040
day?

1194
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:53,559
We can shear the sheep every day. We're

1195
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:53,559
going to end up with a lot of wool.

1196
01:00:54,319 --> 01:01:00,200
You have to have a sharing shed. You

1197
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:00,200
haven't got a sharing shed.

1198
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:07,799
Don't worry, pal. I'm not going to try

1199
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:07,799
shearing you.

1200
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:16,760
Right. Let's try fixing you cuz the fact

1201
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:20,799
that you're broken is kind of bothering

1202
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:20,799
me. You're not going to move, are

1203
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:27,040
you? Is it? I haven't done the math on

1204
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:28,720
that. Let's fix this cow. Now, one thing

1205
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:30,319
that the developers said to me, if you

1206
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:32,559
have any issues with any of the animals

1207
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:32,559
getting

1208
01:01:32,839 --> 01:01:39,400
stuck, put them on the lead and fast

1209
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:44,079
travel them to the entrance uh to your

1210
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:44,079
gate. And so far, that rule has

1211
01:01:44,359 --> 01:01:48,240
worked cuz yeah, I was having a few

1212
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:51,599
issues with occasionally the animals do

1213
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:54,160
get a bit stuck in their path, but that

1214
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:58,160
was the advice from the developers.

1215
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:58,160
stick him on a um

1216
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:05,599
lead and then just fast travel to the

1217
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:09,280
gate. Right. Uh actually, we'll keep the

1218
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:09,280
wool on us cuz we put the other wool

1219
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:15,040
inside. No, I won't empty out my

1220
01:02:12,119 --> 01:02:16,799
inventory. Got other jobs to do. Glenn,

1221
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:20,559
let's head back. We'll do some more

1222
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:20,559
berry picking. Actually, if we take a

1223
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:30,319
bicycle and at least ride it up to the

1224
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:30,319
tree

1225
01:02:33,319 --> 01:02:37,599
line. That'll just hopefully get us here

1226
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:39,400
a little quicker. I don't know if it

1227
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:43,760
actually does or

1228
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:46,079
not. Um, where should we start? I think

1229
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:49,359
up here in this corner. We can always

1230
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:49,359
find the bike next to this

1231
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:56,079
tree. Yeah,

1232
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,079
exactly. All

1233
01:02:56,599 --> 01:03:03,720
right. So, we'll get some more berries,

1234
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:03,720
sticks, mushrooms.

1235
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:11,040
Let's look at the map for a sec. We're

1236
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:13,119
heading up to Thaddius. That's where

1237
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:15,920
we're actually going.

1238
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:18,559
Oh, but I didn't bring I didn't bring

1239
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:20,880
the booze with me.

1240
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:20,880
Doesn't

1241
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:29,079
matter. I have it. Thank you.

1242
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:55,680
All

1243
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:59,680
right. Yeah, it's actually really nice

1244
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:59,680
to have the time to just come out and do

1245
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:05,760
this cuz I have not had time to get out

1246
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:10,960
and pick up sticks and Oh, I didn't

1247
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:10,960
bring the rifle. That's your fault, Dez.

1248
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:17,079
You didn't remind me. And speaking of

1249
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:19,920
reminding, I need to bring my chat back

1250
01:04:17,079 --> 01:04:21,880
up. Put it down when I'm muted cuz I

1251
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:25,280
always like to make sure that it

1252
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:26,559
unmutes with the mic I've got doesn't

1253
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:29,640
actually have a light on it. So, you

1254
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:33,680
can't tell if I've muted or

1255
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:33,680
unmuted. And I like to visually

1256
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:39,400
check. All right.

1257
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:42,480
Oh,

1258
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:51,680
pardon. Well, this should keep our STS

1259
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:51,680
running for a

1260
01:04:52,599 --> 01:04:59,400
day. We'll make a whole lot of

1261
01:04:56,359 --> 01:05:02,799
mash. And then I think next

1262
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:05,520
season if we've got four stills or maybe

1263
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:08,240
five. I'm actually thinking five is a

1264
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:09,480
really good round number. Oh, we're

1265
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:12,839
getting a bit of

1266
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:15,200
freezing. We got five

1267
01:05:12,839 --> 01:05:18,240
stills. The amount of booze that we'll

1268
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:21,520
be able to make in a day, we should be

1269
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:21,520
better make some pretty good

1270
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:27,520
money. And now that we've got the better

1271
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:30,079
chicken coupe, our chickens will start

1272
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:32,480
to well chickens and ducks now will

1273
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:34,680
start to breed. And we should get a few

1274
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:37,039
more of them. In the

1275
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:40,520
past, they were kind of struggling to

1276
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:45,119
get enough food between all of

1277
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:45,119
them, and they weren't breeding very

1278
01:05:54,760 --> 01:06:01,520
well. I am kind of keen to see how much

1279
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:03,920
wood we would get if we cut up a log.

1280
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:06,480
But at the moment, I don't know if it's

1281
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:06,480
going to be worth

1282
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:11,319
doing. I probably want to start growing

1283
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:14,480
some

1284
01:06:11,319 --> 01:06:16,400
trees. I wonder I've not growing any

1285
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:19,039
trees in this game. Should we try

1286
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:19,039
growing a

1287
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:32,559
tree? Is it a tree, not an ice cream?

1288
01:06:29,359 --> 01:06:32,559
Told you I should have brought the

1289
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:41,599
rifle. Need to remember that when you go

1290
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:45,319
out from now on when we go out berry

1291
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:47,319
picking. We've also got to get

1292
01:06:45,319 --> 01:06:50,400
sticks,

1293
01:06:47,319 --> 01:06:52,640
mushrooms, take the rifle, and then what

1294
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:55,240
we need is little areas where we can

1295
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:58,640
just dump everything on the edge of the

1296
01:06:55,240 --> 01:07:00,960
forest. Empty our inventory out. near a

1297
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,960
road

1298
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:12,160
somewhere. See, like this would be a

1299
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:13,760
perfect spot. It's next to Thaddius's

1300
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:17,200
farm. It's really easy to remember where

1301
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:19,640
it is. And if we drop this stuff on the

1302
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:21,680
edge of the road, it's really easy to

1303
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:25,400
find. So, that's what we might have to

1304
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:25,400
start doing in future.

1305
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:39,200
I want to know if we can sell clothing

1306
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:41,839
this winter as well. Who would we sell

1307
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,839
clothing

1308
01:07:46,599 --> 01:07:55,079
to? I'm guessing it would be the shop in

1309
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:55,079
town, the general store.

1310
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:18,760
No mushrooms here. Oh, there's some.

1311
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:31,520
Yeah, I'm definitely preferring this

1312
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:31,520
more relaxed speed. I like

1313
01:08:32,759 --> 01:08:36,719
this. Oh, it's a fox. I was thinking,

1314
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:39,120
was that one of my sheep? No, it's a

1315
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:40,960
fox. A white fox. I bet you we could

1316
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:43,600
make a really cool piece of clothing out

1317
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:45,279
of a white fox. Isn't it terrible when

1318
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:48,080
Glenn now looks at animals and thinks

1319
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:48,080
clothing,

1320
01:08:55,159 --> 01:09:00,480
food? Yeah, there's animals that look at

1321
01:08:57,359 --> 01:09:00,480
us that think food,

1322
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:13,440
too. Bet lions in Africa look at people

1323
01:09:10,239 --> 01:09:13,440
and think food.

1324
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:34,319
There's more mushrooms that went

1325
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:38,600
past. All right.

1326
01:09:44,239 --> 01:09:49,040
Who's that? Oh, it's a stick. So, we

1327
01:09:46,239 --> 01:09:49,040
probably didn't get you

1328
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:56,920
there. Now, I've remapped my farmer's

1329
01:09:54,320 --> 01:10:00,480
vision to my middle mouse

1330
01:09:56,920 --> 01:10:02,239
button. I think it started out as Z, but

1331
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:06,360
I was having issues with that cuz I had

1332
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:06,360
to keep looking at my keyboard.

1333
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:11,640
So, I've remapped it. I still have the

1334
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:15,920
Z. I think it's

1335
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:18,159
C. Yeah, it is. Yep. But I don't tend to

1336
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:18,159
use

1337
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:25,199
it. Middle mouse button is a lot more

1338
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:27,080
convenient. Some of these sticks I'm

1339
01:10:25,199 --> 01:10:31,560
picking up

1340
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:31,560
twice. Not going to complain.

1341
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:50,000
We're getting on

1342
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:57,560
42. When I first started, this is how I

1343
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:59,760
made all my

1344
01:10:57,560 --> 01:11:01,280
money. I've had people on the Discord

1345
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:04,159
asking what's the best way to make

1346
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:06,199
money. I don't know. I haven't figured

1347
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:09,840
that out

1348
01:11:06,199 --> 01:11:11,400
yet, but this is a really good

1349
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:13,360
convenient way to get

1350
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:14,719
started. Oh, it's a deer. I was

1351
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:16,600
thinking, is that one of my sheep? Why

1352
01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:20,600
do I keep thinking everything's my

1353
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:25,120
sheep? I don't know about Rich,

1354
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:27,320
but hey, we do all right, I think,

1355
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:29,920
considering this is how we started the

1356
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:31,840
game and we were struggling to make any

1357
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:35,520
money.

1358
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:40,440
Now, when we have a harvest,

1359
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:40,440
go out, spend good amounts of money.

1360
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:44,679
I think we're doing all right in the

1361
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:47,360
game. Character is not any

1362
01:11:44,679 --> 01:11:51,199
younger. We definitely need to get him

1363
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:53,120
married off soon.

1364
01:11:51,199 --> 01:11:56,080
Now, I don't know what the story is with

1365
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:59,040
as far as I know your character can die

1366
01:11:56,080 --> 01:12:01,880
of old age. I'm guessing it's probably

1367
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:04,040
around 65 years of age. I'm

1368
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:07,440
guessing, but I don't

1369
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:07,440
know. Oh,

1370
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:11,560
three. However, what we do need to

1371
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:14,400
figure

1372
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:18,440
out is what happens when he does die.

1373
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:21,000
Can you leave him an air to carry

1374
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:24,840
on? Now, this game

1375
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:27,400
has a before and an after. So, you've

1376
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:30,400
got the farmer's

1377
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:33,120
father, which although it came out after

1378
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:36,040
this game, is set before it. You're

1379
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:39,280
actually playing the part

1380
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:39,280
of our

1381
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:45,679
father. Now, I've looked at that one in

1382
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:48,000
the past. At the time, it needed more

1383
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:49,520
work, but I do think we could go back

1384
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,679
and have another look at that at some

1385
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:53,280
point.

1386
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:55,520
being the same developers. Hopefully,

1387
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:57,719
they've made improvements to it and it

1388
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:59,760
could be worth trying

1389
01:12:57,719 --> 01:13:02,120
again. But then there is another one

1390
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:05,280
which the developers are working

1391
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:08,000
on which is set after this one and

1392
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:12,360
that's going to be Cyber Farmer. I have

1393
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:14,560
no idea what it's like cuz it's still in

1394
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:18,520
development, but that might be one that

1395
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:18,520
I'd like to try as well.

1396
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:44,840
a robot farmer. Yeah, I think something

1397
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:47,159
along those lines. It seems a bit

1398
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:50,480
weird,

1399
01:13:47,159 --> 01:13:53,199
but I like this game. And as part of the

1400
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:56,760
story line, I think it could be worth

1401
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:59,159
just at least the very least taking a

1402
01:13:56,760 --> 01:14:02,159
look. Is that a tree or a

1403
01:13:59,159 --> 01:14:02,159
nice?

1404
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:09,360
Um, definitely worth at least taking a

1405
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:09,360
look to see what it's going to be

1406
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:13,920
like. Yes, I should have brought my

1407
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:16,080
rifle.

1408
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:16,080
Never

1409
01:14:20,199 --> 01:14:23,199
mind.

1410
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:32,159
Okay. Thought I saw mushrooms there.

1411
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:35,800
Nope. Right. I didn't actually bring

1412
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:35,800
anything on me,

1413
01:14:37,719 --> 01:14:43,520
but how much cigarette? I never thought

1414
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:43,520
about it.

1415
01:14:45,239 --> 01:14:51,840
So, oh, I thought she had a sale price

1416
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:54,080
on here as well. A buy and a sell price.

1417
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:56,000
No, we can buy them for 101, but I don't

1418
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:59,760
know what the sale price is. I would

1419
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,760
have to have some on me.

1420
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:06,640
Okay. No costa. None at all. What is

1421
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:09,040
that one? Cider. Oh, we're making cider

1422
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:13,000
now.

1423
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:14,520
Okay. So, cider, raspberry,

1424
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,440
blueberry,

1425
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:19,080
vodka,

1426
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:22,440
moonshine.

1427
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:24,360
Okay. And it still is, 1100. It's

1428
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:26,640
still,00. Hasn't

1429
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:31,000
changed, right? Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.

1430
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:33,520
Yep. Yep. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

1431
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:35,719
Okay. See, even an apple tree is

1432
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:38,440
something we

1433
01:15:35,719 --> 01:15:41,400
need, cuz

1434
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:43,760
apples can be used to feed the animals,

1435
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:46,040
too. Maybe an apple tree would have been

1436
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:49,440
something good early game. I don't

1437
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:52,159
know. But for now, let's head back. We

1438
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:52,159
got some sticks

1439
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:57,120
finally. We'll go check on whatever's

1440
01:15:57,320 --> 01:16:01,800
cooking. Where's our bike?

1441
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:32,280
have a quick drink.

1442
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:43,159
How you getting

1443
01:16:41,239 --> 01:16:45,000
on?

1444
01:16:43,159 --> 01:16:47,600
10,

1445
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,360
10, and 11. Okay, so they're actually

1446
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:51,920
still

1447
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:54,080
good. They're still good. Oh, sorry.

1448
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:56,480
What I might do for now is we're just

1449
01:16:54,080 --> 01:17:00,360
going to stick that in there. It won't

1450
01:16:56,480 --> 01:17:02,800
take it. Oh, we're not going to take it.

1451
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:04,719
Nope, we're not going to take it. What

1452
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:10,560
about this one? No, that won't take it

1453
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:10,560
either. Ah, can we put sticks in here?

1454
01:17:14,199 --> 01:17:18,719
Brilliant. All right, let's empty out

1455
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:18,719
our

1456
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:24,640
inventory. So, we could go sell these

1457
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:27,520
berries. Let's actually see what we end

1458
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,520
up with. 31

1459
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:37,120
mushrooms. 40 and

1460
01:17:31,159 --> 01:17:41,320
152. A lot of raspberry. We really do.

1461
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:44,640
I mean, if I sold the

1462
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:44,640
raspberry, not

1463
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:50,320
chocolates, they're worth five each, I

1464
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:55,840
think. So, that's only 500 if I sold

1465
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:59,679
them. It's not enough for a still. Okay,

1466
01:17:55,840 --> 01:18:04,040
it's still not enough for a still. Oh,

1467
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:07,440
we do have this. That can't be right.

1468
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:09,719
Five. Is that the sale price? That can't

1469
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:13,760
be right. Let's

1470
01:18:09,719 --> 01:18:16,080
try. Let's sell that. And I am going to

1471
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:18,640
take take those cuz we have way more

1472
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:21,199
than we can deal with right now. So,

1473
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:21,199
let's take a

1474
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:29,840
100. We'll go and sell

1475
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:35,199
that. I'm actually thinking let's just

1476
01:18:32,719 --> 01:18:37,920
sell the meat. Let's Okay, here I go.

1477
01:18:35,199 --> 01:18:41,120
Let's sell the meat. But let's take the

1478
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:41,120
meat gathering

1479
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:45,880
device. That could be a good way of

1480
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:48,159
going, I

1481
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:51,360
think. And if we're going to go out and

1482
01:18:48,159 --> 01:18:51,360
sell, let's get rid of these

1483
01:18:54,920 --> 01:19:00,360
two. Okay, 40 and 52. That sounds fair.

1484
01:18:58,719 --> 01:19:03,840
I think we'll keep

1485
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:06,640
that. All right, we have 12 yeast. Let's

1486
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:06,640
Oh, I'm too

1487
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:10,400
heavy. Way too

1488
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:18,560
heavy. Put something

1489
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:21,320
back. Actually, actually, hang on.

1490
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:23,520
Rather than put something

1491
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:27,040
back. Well, what we'll do is we'll drop

1492
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:27,040
the coffees. We'll drop our

1493
01:19:28,199 --> 01:19:32,760
buns. 158. I'm just thinking if we get

1494
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:36,520
on the

1495
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:38,960
bike, we can get on the

1496
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:41,440
bike. I don't think it takes us any

1497
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:41,440
additional

1498
01:19:41,719 --> 01:19:47,679
time cuz we're on the bike. Weight

1499
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:47,679
doesn't matter when you're on the

1500
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:57,080
bike. Let's just let's just let's

1501
01:19:55,080 --> 01:20:00,080
just grab the

1502
01:19:57,080 --> 01:20:01,800
bite. Bring the bite.

1503
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:05,360
to the

1504
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:08,880
berries. Sure, there's an old proverb

1505
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:08,880
there somewhere. Bring the bike to the

1506
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:18,440
berries. Pretty sure it'll still only

1507
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:21,679
take us about 15

1508
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:25,280
minutes to get to the farm. Yeah, cuz

1509
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:25,280
we're on a bike, the weight doesn't

1510
01:20:26,199 --> 01:20:31,760
matter. Or does it? We seem to be biking

1511
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:31,760
really

1512
01:20:42,199 --> 01:20:48,960
slow. Stop. Okay. By God, blink and blow

1513
01:20:46,239 --> 01:20:52,080
me. It didn't stop.

1514
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:55,600
Me my spry. Me my spry. Exactly. Yeah.

1515
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:58,600
Buy these off us, love. 2,100. Now we're

1516
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:58,600
talking.

1517
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:00,880
All

1518
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:10,280
right. Does this guy buy our meat? I'm

1519
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:12,880
pretty sure he

1520
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:15,360
does. I don't normally sell meat to this

1521
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:16,679
guy. I usually sell meat to the one in

1522
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:20,920
the

1523
01:21:16,679 --> 01:21:22,440
town, but pretty

1524
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:25,440
sure.

1525
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:25,440
Beautiful.

1526
01:21:25,719 --> 01:21:29,880
Beautiful. All right. So, what does that

1527
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:32,719
give us

1528
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:35,760
now? 2,600. It's enough there for

1529
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:35,760
another couple of stills,

1530
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:41,520
mate. Why are we going

1531
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:50,920
backwards? All

1532
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:54,400
right. No

1533
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:54,400
trial. There you go.

1534
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:59,719
Five. Nice. What is this? Raspberry

1535
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:03,560
mash. Oh,

1536
01:21:59,719 --> 01:22:06,719
true. Okay. Well, we want your last

1537
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:08,600
still. Right. I might even buy another

1538
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:14,560
bucket.

1539
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:14,560
$112. No. No. Let's prioritize. I

1540
01:22:17,159 --> 01:22:21,679
want I think we're going to go up and

1541
01:22:19,199 --> 01:22:25,360
visit Ann or at least go to Ann's farm

1542
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:25,360
and won't be here. She's in the

1543
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:36,320
town. What trees do you have? Oh, you

1544
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:39,840
don't have any trees. I thought she had

1545
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:42,000
some sort of tree here, like an apple or

1546
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:43,600
something.

1547
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:47,280
Apparently not. Do you sell buckets for

1548
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:47,280
the same price? I think yours are

1549
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:53,679
dera. Okay, so all the trees must come

1550
01:22:50,239 --> 01:22:58,480
from the forestry. Gentlemen, I I

1551
01:22:53,679 --> 01:22:58,480
actually thought this lady had the apple

1552
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:11,000
trees. I'm

1553
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,280
You don't sell trees. He does.

1554
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:20,320
Okay. So, we

1555
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:28,320
have popppler, which I've heard is very

1556
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:30,960
popular these days, and birds.

1557
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:34,520
I don't know another tree as charming as

1558
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:38,560
this one. Not only does it

1559
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:40,920
have its snow white bark, but in autumn

1560
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:44,239
the leaves take on beautiful

1561
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:47,120
colors. Yes, these are lots there are

1562
01:23:44,239 --> 01:23:49,719
lots of growing around, but lots of them

1563
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:52,239
get turned into fences, sheds, and

1564
01:23:49,719 --> 01:23:54,440
outouses. So, we might run out of these

1565
01:23:52,239 --> 01:23:59,600
one day.

1566
01:23:54,440 --> 01:24:01,679
Okay. Yes, there are lots. Hang on.

1567
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:05,840
The description on fur and popular is

1568
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:05,840
the same. Okay. So, let's

1569
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:12,480
take one of

1570
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:15,560
those. One of those. And we can't afford

1571
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:17,159
that. 756. We're

1572
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:18,920
$45

1573
01:24:17,159 --> 01:24:22,120
short.

1574
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:25,520
Man, that just sucks like a

1575
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:28,520
raspberry. All right. 45 freaking

1576
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:28,520
dollars.

1577
01:24:29,199 --> 01:24:36,480
Okay, I want to start growing some

1578
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:36,480
trees. Now, we paid 750 for

1579
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:41,960
those. I think I might plant them right

1580
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:46,320
here. Can I plant them this time of

1581
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:46,320
year? Maybe we might have to wait till

1582
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:54,920
spring. And I'll need to ho the

1583
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:57,199
ground.

1584
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:59,000
Okay. I don't know. Do we wait till

1585
01:24:57,199 --> 01:25:03,040
spring or do we take a

1586
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:05,360
chance? Take a chance on me. Oh, sorry.

1587
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:05,360
I

1588
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:13,360
think Oh, the tools aren't in here

1589
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:14,880
anymore. Glenn, you moved them. I think

1590
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:16,360
what I'm going to do is I'm going to try

1591
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:18,400
planting

1592
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:20,600
them. I think if I get them in the

1593
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:23,199
ground now, it'll be

1594
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:24,679
fine. If it's not, we've just wasted

1595
01:25:23,199 --> 01:25:27,639
1,500

1596
01:25:24,679 --> 01:25:30,080
bucks. We need a ho ho ho. Merry

1597
01:25:27,639 --> 01:25:31,159
Christmas. We need that. Yeah, we're

1598
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:34,800
coming into

1599
01:25:31,159 --> 01:25:34,800
winter. Coming into

1600
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:42,400
winter. All right. So, what do I

1601
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:46,199
think? Actually, no. Cuz we have this

1602
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:46,199
line of trees here.

1603
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:11,440
Um I put in a popler

1604
01:26:12,199 --> 01:26:17,360
here. 375 hours.

1605
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:25,480
Interesting. Actually, this ground's

1606
01:26:22,159 --> 01:26:25,480
already been hoed.

1607
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:35,320
Need to cut down the voltage. Okay.

1608
01:26:40,239 --> 01:26:44,159
All

1609
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:47,560
right. For now, we're going to try one

1610
01:26:44,159 --> 01:26:47,560
of each tree.

1611
01:26:53,360 --> 01:27:00,520
There we go. 375 for a

1612
01:26:56,600 --> 01:27:03,239
fur, 375 for a popler. They're the same.

1613
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:04,960
Okay.

1614
01:27:03,239 --> 01:27:06,080
Interesting. I've got a little bit of

1615
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:09,560
grass on me. I'm just going to go and

1616
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:09,560
give it to the cows.

1617
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:20,120
Not enough space.

1618
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:25,000
All right. At least then it's not

1619
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:29,040
wasted,

1620
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:29,040
right? It's about the gate over

1621
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:34,300
here. You look like you're longing for

1622
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:37,719
somebody else's farm.

1623
01:27:34,300 --> 01:27:39,480
[Laughter]

1624
01:27:37,719 --> 01:27:44,239
Cal

1625
01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:47,040
375 hours to grow trees. Man, that's a

1626
01:27:44,239 --> 01:27:47,040
long time.

1627
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:53,960
All right. What I think we should do is

1628
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:57,199
go out

1629
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:59,480
hunting. Get us some meat. Cuz now that

1630
01:27:57,199 --> 01:28:02,080
we've got better control over the

1631
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:03,480
time, hunting is going to be a lot

1632
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:06,120
easier to

1633
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:09,960
do. Still, that's what I was

1634
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:15,080
thinking. Cuz in the past, going out

1635
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:15,080
hunting could take a lot of time.

1636
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:28,400
We'll leave some sticks in

1637
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:39,880
there. What? Oh, yep. Um, grab a bucket

1638
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:42,239
of water. That's all smoky in this

1639
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:44,800
house. Has somebody been smoking in

1640
01:28:42,239 --> 01:28:44,800
here?

1641
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:56,719
We're definitely going to have to put

1642
01:28:54,159 --> 01:28:59,679
more water into these stills, but it's

1643
01:28:56,719 --> 01:29:02,400
enough to get us started for now. We now

1644
01:28:59,679 --> 01:29:02,400
have five

1645
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:10,000
stills. I guess it doesn't really make

1646
01:29:08,239 --> 01:29:12,199
any difference which one I use,

1647
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:14,080
actually. Oh, no. Cuz it'll take ages

1648
01:29:12,199 --> 01:29:15,840
anyway. I was going to say we could do

1649
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:19,159
the raspberry mash now, but no, we got

1650
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:19,159
to cook that.

1651
01:29:23,679 --> 01:29:26,800
All right, that's off and

1652
01:29:31,239 --> 01:29:38,639
going. Keep the

1653
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:41,320
mash. Oops, this one's mashed clean.

1654
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:43,400
All right.

1655
01:29:41,320 --> 01:29:47,199
Um, take these

1656
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:50,320
off. I sold all my meat. So, let's do

1657
01:29:47,199 --> 01:29:53,440
some mash. We wanted a raspberry mash.

1658
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:53,440
Can I do a raspberry

1659
01:29:54,120 --> 01:30:00,080
mash? Raspberry mash. Must obtained a

1660
01:29:57,080 --> 01:30:02,360
recipe. Yeah, it's why we're not doing

1661
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:06,800
it. We might have to buy

1662
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:09,760
it. We may need to buy it. Okay, in that

1663
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:09,760
case, let's do

1664
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:14,199
blueberry. Do they all take the same

1665
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:18,080
length of time? I

1666
01:30:14,199 --> 01:30:18,080
wonder. Um, they

1667
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:23,800
should. Did I click the wrong

1668
01:30:22,199 --> 01:30:29,520
thing?

1669
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:29,520
Cook. We did blueberry. Don't have any

1670
01:30:32,679 --> 01:30:37,880
apple. Oat mash. We could do that one

1671
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:41,080
too to do our

1672
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:43,280
vodka. We got no

1673
01:30:41,080 --> 01:30:46,000
potatoes. Okay, so there is only one

1674
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:49,880
mash I can do today.

1675
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:52,639
Oh no, I'm out of sugar. Oh

1676
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:53,960
man, sugar. So now that's going to be a

1677
01:30:52,639 --> 01:30:56,000
problem,

1678
01:30:53,960 --> 01:30:58,320
too. We're going to have to go and buy

1679
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,320
some

1680
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:04,199
sugar. Okay. Right.

1681
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:15,000
Exactly. That's exactly right. We need

1682
01:31:11,159 --> 01:31:18,040
sugar. So, we only have 700

1683
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:22,000
bucks. Sugar. Can you get

1684
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:24,920
$700? Not a lot. I bet you, you know, I

1685
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:27,360
don't know about you guys, I like

1686
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:30,360
sugar. I like things that are bad for

1687
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:30,360
me.

1688
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:42,400
I am actually thinking the farm might be

1689
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:42,400
the best

1690
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:51,480
place. Let's see what it's going to cost

1691
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:53,679
us. Rather than buying

1692
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:57,320
sugar, let's see what the beets will

1693
01:31:53,679 --> 01:31:59,880
cost. Mimi Bry. Mimi Bry.

1694
01:31:57,320 --> 01:32:02,600
Exactly. So, the

1695
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:03,639
beats the beats are 14

1696
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:06,840
[Music]

1697
01:32:03,639 --> 01:32:09,560
each. How many can we

1698
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:13,520
buy?

1699
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:15,560
50. All right. Sold. I probably should

1700
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:18,159
have hung on to those other ones

1701
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:20,400
before, but we only had three and you

1702
01:32:18,159 --> 01:32:20,400
need

1703
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:25,960
four. That's fine. Head back home.

1704
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:30,480
What's that chicken doing in my potato

1705
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:38,120
patch? And then what we might do is go

1706
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:40,960
out and do some more berry picking cuz

1707
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:43,920
there's not a lot we can do other than

1708
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:43,920
building fences and

1709
01:32:47,159 --> 01:32:52,400
things. And I think if we go out berry

1710
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:56,400
picking could be a damn good idea just

1711
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:56,400
to get us some extra cash coming in.

1712
01:32:56,719 --> 01:33:02,239
Right.

1713
01:32:57,960 --> 01:33:04,920
Cook sugar from beets. Yeah. Four water.

1714
01:33:02,239 --> 01:33:07,199
Oh, and six beets. I thought it was

1715
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:09,360
four. That's why I said before we didn't

1716
01:33:07,199 --> 01:33:09,360
have

1717
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:17,600
enough. Okay, we'll get some sugar

1718
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:19,679
going. Sugar takes 5 hours 42. The

1719
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:21,320
blueberry mash is about the same. Let's

1720
01:33:19,679 --> 01:33:25,600
throw some more wood in

1721
01:33:21,320 --> 01:33:25,600
there. About 6 hours.

1722
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:32,960
558. Beautiful. Yep. All right, we're

1723
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:32,960
going to go hunting, berry

1724
01:33:41,239 --> 01:33:48,639
picking. I could go fishing. I don't

1725
01:33:45,239 --> 01:33:48,639
know. Don't

1726
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:55,040
know. Aussiey's playing out of ore

1727
01:33:52,159 --> 01:33:55,040
again.

1728
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:21,120
Yeah, I think we'll we'll head up around

1729
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:21,120
the outside. We'll do some more berry

1730
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:26,159
picking

1731
01:34:23,480 --> 01:34:28,800
and if we see any animals this time,

1732
01:34:26,159 --> 01:34:28,800
we'll hunt

1733
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:36,480
them. We'll leave our bike here cuz it's

1734
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:39,280
junk. Sort this out while we're at it.

1735
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:39,280
Oh, this is already

1736
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:48,480
done. Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes. I recall

1737
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:52,719
there's something in that mountain and

1738
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:52,719
we need to get that out.

1739
01:34:54,280 --> 01:35:00,320
Right. Let's grab our

1740
01:34:57,639 --> 01:35:05,360
rifle. Actually, let's hotkey the rifle

1741
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:05,360
for slot five. Is this thing loaded?

1742
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:13,159
Yes. So, sticks, berries, animals,

1743
01:35:10,159 --> 01:35:13,159
mushrooms.

1744
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:21,560
This should make us a few green.

1745
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:54,440
Bambi running away.

1746
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:05,960
Yeah, definitely getting close to winter

1747
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:05,960
now. All the rain starting to set in.

1748
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:11,719
Winter will be a good time to do our

1749
01:36:08,719 --> 01:36:11,719
building.

1750
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:26,400
We must have already been in here berry

1751
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:29,040
picking. Yeah. All these berry bushes

1752
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:29,040
are

1753
01:36:32,199 --> 01:36:35,719
harvested. Yep. We've already been in

1754
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:39,840
here

1755
01:36:35,719 --> 01:36:39,840
apparently. Must have been last time I

1756
01:36:45,639 --> 01:36:51,159
played. Be more sticks in this forestry

1757
01:36:48,159 --> 01:36:51,159
area.

1758
01:37:02,719 --> 01:37:09,199
Berry bush is right here.

1759
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:12,560
What? Oh, in the rock face. That's a

1760
01:37:09,199 --> 01:37:12,560
cool place for a berry bush to be

1761
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:17,280
growing. Sorry, just having a quick sip

1762
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:17,280
of my

1763
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:23,310
coffee. All

1764
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:27,339
right, there's another berry bush in the

1765
01:37:23,310 --> 01:37:27,339
[Laughter]

1766
01:37:29,320 --> 01:37:33,679
cliff. What am I stuck on?

1767
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:03,360
You're not complaining. and hunt Call of

1768
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:06,159
the Wild again. Haven't played that for

1769
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:06,159
a few weeks, have

1770
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:21,600
I? We might have to go on a community

1771
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:21,600
hunt again sometime soon. It's been a we

1772
01:38:22,360 --> 01:38:30,239
while. What about some of you

1773
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:34,719
new community members?

1774
01:38:30,239 --> 01:38:34,719
Have you do you play Hunter Call of the

1775
01:38:35,159 --> 01:38:40,239
Wild? We used to go on a bit of a

1776
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:40,239
community hunt

1777
01:38:41,960 --> 01:38:49,000
together. Haven't been on one for a

1778
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:53,600
while. Nice relaxing

1779
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:53,600
game like this is now. Nice and

1780
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:59,639
relaxing. Good bit of fun going out

1781
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:59,639
hunting every so often.

1782
01:39:17,119 --> 01:39:21,040
Come here. Freaking

1783
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:28,040
egg. No animals out here in the open.

1784
01:39:34,239 --> 01:39:37,480
kind of hoping I might see something out

1785
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:40,239
here in the

1786
01:39:37,480 --> 01:39:44,480
open. I was hoping to find something in

1787
01:39:40,239 --> 01:39:44,480
the open. Okay.

1788
01:39:57,800 --> 01:40:04,600
Um, typical. I bring him a gun and we're

1789
01:40:00,159 --> 01:40:04,600
not seeing any damn thing to shoot now.

1790
01:40:55,920 --> 01:41:00,080
We're going to have more than enough

1791
01:40:57,119 --> 01:41:02,719
berries to do mash. I mean, one bottle

1792
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:07,320
of mash.

1793
01:41:02,719 --> 01:41:07,320
What is it? 3 and 1/2 hours in game.

1794
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:17,360
Well, to brew. It's actually 4 and a

1795
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:17,360
half in real life.

1796
01:41:20,639 --> 01:41:29,239
So at that rate, you're only

1797
01:41:24,360 --> 01:41:32,520
getting few bottles a day.

1798
01:41:29,239 --> 01:41:37,199
Anyhow, so the 50 odd that we

1799
01:41:32,520 --> 01:41:37,199
have should be

1800
01:41:43,320 --> 01:41:48,880
plenty. We might be able to sell more of

1801
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:48,880
them quite

1802
01:41:55,080 --> 01:42:00,440
frankly. Oh, looking at the wrong tree.

1803
01:41:57,920 --> 01:42:02,920
They're both looking

1804
01:42:00,440 --> 01:42:06,800
red. Ah,

1805
01:42:02,920 --> 01:42:08,159
now found you. Found this earlier, but I

1806
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:10,080
couldn't remember where we found it.

1807
01:42:08,159 --> 01:42:13,880
Hell, this is a quest that we're on at

1808
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:16,400
the moment, but

1809
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:18,280
um we might have to bring a spanner to

1810
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:23,320
it.

1811
01:42:18,280 --> 01:42:27,840
Oh, nope. It's ours. It's already

1812
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:30,719
ours. So, first gear has no fuel. Okay,

1813
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:33,679
if that's the case, let's Oh, I just hit

1814
01:42:30,719 --> 01:42:35,800
the damn tree. Oh, Gen, what did you hit

1815
01:42:33,679 --> 01:42:41,880
the tree

1816
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:45,360
for? All right. Um, can we push?

1817
01:42:41,880 --> 01:42:45,360
No, I can't

1818
01:42:45,719 --> 01:42:50,000
push. Can I use my physical body to

1819
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:50,679
push? I shouldn't hit the damn tree,

1820
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:55,440
should

1821
01:42:50,679 --> 01:42:55,440
I? We were coasting downhill until I did

1822
01:42:58,119 --> 01:43:05,000
that. Come on, get off the tree. Come

1823
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:05,000
back with some fuel.

1824
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:16,719
No, we'll come back with fuel cuz I'm

1825
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:19,320
just wasting time otherwise. All right,

1826
01:43:16,719 --> 01:43:22,320
where exactly are

1827
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:25,719
we? We're just behind the sawmill next

1828
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:25,719
to the river.

1829
01:43:27,880 --> 01:43:31,840
Who do you and I bring? Okay, we're

1830
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:35,679
right behind the buildings. We should be

1831
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:35,679
able to easy find that.

1832
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:40,119
We'll get some gas. We'll come back.

1833
01:43:38,719 --> 01:43:42,239
Grab our

1834
01:43:40,119 --> 01:43:44,639
motorcycle. We're not lost. We just

1835
01:43:42,239 --> 01:43:44,639
found a

1836
01:43:45,239 --> 01:43:50,400
motorcycle. So, I did find that earlier,

1837
01:43:47,679 --> 01:43:53,520
as I say, but we couldn't do anything

1838
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:56,159
with it. Only. Now, one of the quests

1839
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:56,159
that I did

1840
01:43:57,080 --> 01:44:03,520
recently, he told me about the bike out

1841
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:05,280
in the bush or we discussed it. I can't

1842
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:08,480
remember quite how it came about, but

1843
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:12,080
during that quest when I completed it, I

1844
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:14,880
was told we can have the bike. So,

1845
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:14,880
that's our new

1846
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:21,239
transport. Bet it'll be better than a

1847
01:44:18,239 --> 01:44:21,239
bicycle.

1848
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:37,760
Reload.

1849
01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:39,920
Yeah, we just got to get some gas. I

1850
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:41,280
couldn't remember where it was. And one

1851
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:42,800
of the things I had in the back of my

1852
01:44:41,280 --> 01:44:45,840
mind was, let's try and find the

1853
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:45,840
motorcycle while we're out

1854
01:44:56,119 --> 01:45:01,480
here. Fall over you stupid pig.

1855
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:10,639
Damn pig. Stop

1856
01:45:08,360 --> 01:45:12,840
running. Why is this pig running away

1857
01:45:10,639 --> 01:45:15,440
from a man with a gun? That makes no

1858
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:18,320
sense. Why would a pig ever run away

1859
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:18,320
from a man with a

1860
01:45:21,639 --> 01:45:26,960
gun? Silly damn pig. You know how many

1861
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:31,040
berries we probably missed cuz of you?

1862
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:31,040
All over. Thank you.

1863
01:45:35,800 --> 01:45:40,920
Okay. Right. Let's pick you up. Where

1864
01:45:38,639 --> 01:45:45,520
are we going to take you

1865
01:45:40,920 --> 01:45:45,520
to? Oh, we're a long way from a

1866
01:45:51,239 --> 01:45:58,400
road. Free range bacon. Definitely

1867
01:45:54,239 --> 01:46:00,440
freerange bacon is yum.

1868
01:45:58,400 --> 01:46:04,119
Nobody's ever had wild

1869
01:46:00,440 --> 01:46:06,719
pork. There's a huge difference in

1870
01:46:04,119 --> 01:46:09,360
taste. Any wild animal though, there's a

1871
01:46:06,719 --> 01:46:11,280
big difference in taste. When I used to

1872
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:15,080
breed my own chickens, cuz they were

1873
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:15,080
truly free range.

1874
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:21,080
Even though I eat a lot of chicken and I

1875
01:46:18,239 --> 01:46:25,000
love chicken. When I had my freerange

1876
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:28,239
chickens, the flavor to them was so

1877
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:30,000
strong that I actually didn't like a

1878
01:46:28,239 --> 01:46:33,199
roast chicken. I actually had to do

1879
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:34,440
other things with them. So, I made

1880
01:46:33,199 --> 01:46:37,239
chicken

1881
01:46:34,440 --> 01:46:41,560
soup

1882
01:46:37,239 --> 01:46:44,800
or chicken pie or something

1883
01:46:41,560 --> 01:46:47,679
else because the taste was so much

1884
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:47,679
stronger.

1885
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:58,639
I kind of want to go and get

1886
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:58,639
that. Oh, there's another

1887
01:46:59,960 --> 01:47:05,480
pig. Kind of want to go and get that gas

1888
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:05,480
now.

1889
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:15,800
Don't run from me, pig.

1890
01:47:16,719 --> 01:47:19,920
Oh, then the deer ran

1891
01:47:20,280 --> 01:47:28,040
too. Trying to get a head shot, but it's

1892
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:33,000
not easy. Not when they stand side on to

1893
01:47:28,040 --> 01:47:33,000
you. Damn pig. Stop running.

1894
01:47:44,639 --> 01:47:49,119
I wonder if we can stick a trailer on

1895
01:47:46,639 --> 01:47:51,679
the motorcycle. I know we can stick

1896
01:47:49,119 --> 01:47:55,199
Fluffy on the motorcycle and take Fluffy

1897
01:47:51,679 --> 01:47:55,199
for a ride. We might have to do

1898
01:47:55,560 --> 01:47:59,920
that just for a bit of fun. Grab Fluffy

1899
01:47:58,239 --> 01:48:02,320
and stick him on the motorcycle in the

1900
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:04,000
side car of the motorcycle. I know you

1901
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:07,000
can do that cuz I've seen the picture of

1902
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:07,000
it.

1903
01:48:20,239 --> 01:48:22,960
screaming. I bet you that's what that

1904
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:26,679
pig was thinking while I was chasing

1905
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:26,679
after him with a gun.

1906
01:48:32,080 --> 01:48:36,600
Crazy man with a gun. Run.

1907
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:13,119
So, what have we got? Two pigs so

1908
01:49:13,719 --> 01:49:21,840
far. I think we'll be all right when we

1909
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:21,840
sell these berries. Sell that

1910
01:49:22,360 --> 01:49:26,719
meat. I think I'm just going to sell the

1911
01:49:24,719 --> 01:49:28,800
meat and the skins and everything for

1912
01:49:26,719 --> 01:49:32,480
now.

1913
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:36,239
rather than make clothes or any cooking.

1914
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:36,239
I think we just want some fast

1915
01:49:39,560 --> 01:49:45,600
cash so we can get ready

1916
01:49:42,199 --> 01:49:45,600
for next

1917
01:49:52,280 --> 01:49:58,960
spring. So that those two trees we

1918
01:49:55,199 --> 01:50:02,320
planted 365 hours or whatever it said.

1919
01:49:58,960 --> 01:50:02,320
I'm guessing that's an entire

1920
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:14,719
year. I'm guessing it's one

1921
01:50:11,639 --> 01:50:17,239
year. I would be very keen to know what

1922
01:50:14,719 --> 01:50:20,719
sort of money we can make out of

1923
01:50:17,239 --> 01:50:24,400
them cuz forestry should in theory be a

1924
01:50:20,719 --> 01:50:24,400
relatively good income.

1925
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:29,520
You

1926
01:50:43,880 --> 01:50:49,639
only have some luck. I tell you what, we

1927
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:52,400
need to figure out what the

1928
01:50:49,639 --> 01:50:53,920
best money-making crop is. Cuz I mean,

1929
01:50:52,400 --> 01:50:57,840
somebody asked me on the Discord and

1930
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:59,280
it's not for that reason, but if we can

1931
01:50:57,840 --> 01:51:01,320
figure out what the best money-making

1932
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:05,520
crop

1933
01:51:01,320 --> 01:51:05,520
is, start really making some

1934
01:51:09,080 --> 01:51:15,560
money. I do have to laugh cuz with the

1935
01:51:13,320 --> 01:51:18,199
farmlands this

1936
01:51:15,560 --> 01:51:20,400
good, it seems very much that the

1937
01:51:18,199 --> 01:51:24,239
developers are quite happy to sit back

1938
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:24,239
and let the community just help each

1939
01:51:24,440 --> 01:51:30,080
other. And it seems at the moment

1940
01:51:27,600 --> 01:51:32,480
everybody seems to think, even though

1941
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:34,639
it's a lie, it's incorrect. Well, it's

1942
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:36,480
not a lie. It's an incorrect assumption.

1943
01:51:34,639 --> 01:51:38,880
They all seem to think I'm a professor

1944
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:41,440
and I know everything about this game.

1945
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:41,440
Far from

1946
01:51:44,840 --> 01:51:48,800
it. Yeah, I've been asking answering a

1947
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:51,159
few questions on the Discord and trying

1948
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:56,040
to help other people

1949
01:51:51,159 --> 01:51:58,719
get problems solved that I've

1950
01:51:56,040 --> 01:52:01,840
had. I would prefer questions came on

1951
01:51:58,719 --> 01:52:03,679
the video. So guys, if any of you from

1952
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:05,400
the Discord rather than asking me

1953
01:52:03,679 --> 01:52:08,520
questions on the

1954
01:52:05,400 --> 01:52:11,119
Discord, ask me questions on the

1955
01:52:08,520 --> 01:52:13,360
video cuz that helps to promote the

1956
01:52:11,119 --> 01:52:15,840
video in the algorithm. YouTube

1957
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:15,840
considers

1958
01:52:15,880 --> 01:52:18,880
it

1959
01:52:19,239 --> 01:52:26,960
interaction and leaving a comment on a

1960
01:52:23,159 --> 01:52:29,920
video always helps a lot to promote that

1961
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:31,599
video.

1962
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:33,320
So, if any of you ever feel like coming

1963
01:52:31,599 --> 01:52:35,599
in and leaving a comment on a video

1964
01:52:33,320 --> 01:52:37,000
afterwards, I'd appreciate it. And I

1965
01:52:35,599 --> 01:52:39,679
answer all the

1966
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:41,480
questions, all the comments, whether it

1967
01:52:39,679 --> 01:52:44,320
be a question or just a

1968
01:52:41,480 --> 01:52:47,119
comment. It helps to promote the video

1969
01:52:44,320 --> 01:52:49,599
in the algorithm. And most people don't

1970
01:52:47,119 --> 01:52:52,480
leave any comments on my videos. I don't

1971
01:52:49,599 --> 01:52:54,840
know why. Maybe they think I don't need

1972
01:52:52,480 --> 01:53:00,560
comments. I'm not

1973
01:52:54,840 --> 01:53:00,560
sure. But it does help. rightly in the

1974
01:53:04,840 --> 01:53:09,400
algorithm. I know one of our community

1975
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:12,000
members,

1976
01:53:09,400 --> 01:53:14,920
Oddball, always actually asks people to

1977
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:17,400
go and leave comments after the videos,

1978
01:53:14,920 --> 01:53:19,760
but yeah, look at

1979
01:53:17,400 --> 01:53:21,480
that. I don't know how successful he is

1980
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:24,239
with

1981
01:53:21,480 --> 01:53:27,239
that. All I know is it makes a huge

1982
01:53:24,239 --> 01:53:27,239
difference.

1983
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:34,960
If you guys want to leave comments after

1984
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:36,880
the video in the comment section, I'd

1985
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:39,440
appreciate it and I'll definitely

1986
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:39,440
respond to

1987
01:53:41,159 --> 01:53:46,800
them. Where are

1988
01:53:44,040 --> 01:53:51,880
we? Okay, let's take that carcass to the

1989
01:53:46,800 --> 01:53:51,880
nearest road. Where was it? Right there.

1990
01:53:58,400 --> 01:54:05,480
So, the nearest road is that

1991
01:54:01,480 --> 01:54:05,480
one. Yes.

1992
01:54:33,119 --> 01:54:39,000
One shot straight through the

1993
01:54:35,080 --> 01:54:44,199
head. Now he's dead. That was a good

1994
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:44,199
shot. Even if I do say so myself.

1995
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:55,360
We'll come back with a trailer for

1996
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:58,679
collect all of these up later. Who was

1997
01:54:55,360 --> 01:54:58,679
that other one?

1998
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:19,400
Don't run, pig.

1999
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:29,280
What's wrong with him?

2000
01:55:25,119 --> 01:55:29,280
What's wrong with him? He seemed

2001
01:55:29,320 --> 01:55:34,440
broken. Right, we'll pick you up. Get

2002
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:37,440
you off the track. What you with that

2003
01:55:34,440 --> 01:55:40,560
one? There's a fox.

2004
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:40,560
We're doing all right with the hunt

2005
01:55:41,480 --> 01:55:46,080
now. Missed. Let's get a bit

2006
01:55:56,280 --> 01:56:01,119
closer. Don't be rude. Trying to shoot

2007
01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:01,800
you. That's just being rude. Trying to

2008
01:56:01,119 --> 01:56:07,760
run

2009
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:07,760
away. Have some manners, Fox. Lay down.

2010
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:13,920
I'll try and get as many as I can along

2011
01:56:11,679 --> 01:56:13,920
this

2012
01:56:18,280 --> 01:56:23,040
roadway cuz then it means we can just

2013
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:26,000
turn up later with the tractor, pick

2014
01:56:23,040 --> 01:56:26,000
them all up at the same

2015
01:56:30,840 --> 01:56:35,440
time. Look at them all. Freaking

2016
01:56:33,520 --> 01:56:37,159
awesome, mate.

2017
01:56:35,440 --> 01:56:40,119
Drop this with the other

2018
01:56:37,159 --> 01:56:42,560
one. Two in the same spot just makes it

2019
01:56:40,119 --> 01:56:45,360
easier. Now, what time is it? It seems

2020
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:45,360
to be getting a little

2021
01:56:45,639 --> 01:56:53,000
dark. Uh, it's only

2022
01:56:48,119 --> 01:56:53,000
lunchtime. It might be about to rain.

2023
01:57:17,920 --> 01:57:22,159
Now, with all this extra time on our

2024
01:57:19,960 --> 01:57:23,840
hands, we might actually be able to make

2025
01:57:22,159 --> 01:57:26,840
some really good money just hunting

2026
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:26,840
alone.

2027
01:57:32,080 --> 01:57:35,679
Why have you got your head buried in a

2028
01:57:42,040 --> 01:57:47,360
tree? Had his head buried in a tree.

2029
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:47,360
Let's try and get a head

2030
01:58:08,119 --> 01:58:14,679
shot. Whoa, we're getting a bit of

2031
01:58:10,080 --> 01:58:14,679
freezing today. Apologize.

2032
01:58:15,440 --> 01:58:20,080
Maybe I should turn my settings

2033
01:58:17,960 --> 01:58:24,639
down. Wonder if that would make a big

2034
01:58:20,080 --> 01:58:24,639
difference. Let's have a quick look.

2035
01:58:28,040 --> 01:58:32,040
Settings. Visual

2036
01:58:30,119 --> 01:58:34,440
quality.

2037
01:58:32,040 --> 01:58:37,920
Post-processing. Texture

2038
01:58:34,440 --> 01:58:41,400
quality. Lamp shadows. Shadow quality

2039
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:41,400
can go down.

2040
01:58:43,639 --> 01:58:48,760
average. I'm not sure what anti-aliasing

2041
01:58:46,599 --> 01:58:52,320
does. Texture

2042
01:58:48,760 --> 01:58:53,480
quality. I don't know. Feat quality.

2043
01:58:52,320 --> 01:58:57,679
We'll go down to

2044
01:58:53,480 --> 01:58:57,679
average. See if that just helps to

2045
01:58:59,560 --> 01:59:04,400
avoid some of the freezing.

2046
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:05,719
I've got a damn good computer. It

2047
01:59:04,400 --> 01:59:08,239
shouldn't be

2048
01:59:05,719 --> 01:59:11,400
freezing, but this game tends to freeze

2049
01:59:08,239 --> 01:59:11,400
a little.

2050
01:59:16,080 --> 01:59:20,440
Right next to the road. Perfect.

2051
02:00:09,040 --> 02:00:13,040
Why am I not getting There we go.

2052
02:00:11,360 --> 02:00:15,679
Spamming the E key and it wasn't picking

2053
02:00:13,040 --> 02:00:15,679
it up.

2054
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:29,800
I do find sticks a little hard to pick

2055
02:00:24,719 --> 02:00:29,800
up sometimes. The hit boxes aren't huge.

2056
02:00:53,840 --> 02:00:57,040
Ah, is that him over

2057
02:00:57,159 --> 02:01:03,040
there? Oh, that's a fox,

2058
02:01:00,199 --> 02:01:05,440
though. I don't have the recipe for rat

2059
02:01:03,040 --> 02:01:08,320
soup. You got to have recipes. You can't

2060
02:01:05,440 --> 02:01:11,460
make things without recipes. If you got

2061
02:01:08,320 --> 02:01:14,900
the recipe for rat soup, you let me

2062
02:01:11,460 --> 02:01:14,900
[Laughter]

2063
02:01:23,320 --> 02:01:28,960
know. Yeah, we need the recipe

2064
02:01:26,280 --> 02:01:32,000
first. Just like we need the recipe for

2065
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:35,880
raspberry mash, we need the recipe for

2066
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:35,880
rat soup as well.

2067
02:01:43,119 --> 02:01:46,080
Fox. Foxes are good cuz you can just

2068
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:48,239
pick them straight up and put them in

2069
02:01:46,080 --> 02:01:48,239
your

2070
02:01:49,880 --> 02:01:55,960
backpack. Not that we have a backpack,

2071
02:01:52,159 --> 02:01:55,960
but you know what I mean.

2072
02:02:12,480 --> 02:02:15,920
Right

2073
02:02:13,880 --> 02:02:18,719
away. Oh, I thought he was coming

2074
02:02:15,920 --> 02:02:20,400
towards us. Thought I'd pick up a couple

2075
02:02:18,719 --> 02:02:22,719
of sticks while he was coming towards

2076
02:02:20,400 --> 02:02:26,199
us. Turns out he's not. I might have

2077
02:02:22,719 --> 02:02:26,199
scared him off.

2078
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:32,679
Give me. Give me. Give me.

2079
02:02:57,119 --> 02:03:02,000
Where was

2080
02:02:58,360 --> 02:03:04,560
he? Looked down to pick up that and now

2081
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,560
I've lost

2082
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:08,239
sight. Oh

2083
02:03:16,599 --> 02:03:21,360
well. It was a pig there. I saw

2084
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:32,000
it. I think I'm getting a little heavy.

2085
02:03:30,080 --> 02:03:36,520
Yes, I am. Okay, so let's do this pig.

2086
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:38,639
We'll head home, go get some gas for our

2087
02:03:36,520 --> 02:03:41,610
motorcycle, and then we can all start to

2088
02:03:38,639 --> 02:03:45,750
sing the motorcycle song.

2089
02:03:41,610 --> 02:03:45,750
[Laughter]

2090
02:03:51,520 --> 02:03:55,000
to you an operator.

2091
02:04:04,639 --> 02:04:10,840
Stop freezing.

2092
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:10,840
Turn down the freaking settings.

2093
02:04:13,199 --> 02:04:15,679
Where's that

2094
02:04:22,520 --> 02:04:26,080
pig? Let's get it

2095
02:04:28,599 --> 02:04:33,440
off. Any more carcasses just here? Yes,

2096
02:04:31,280 --> 02:04:33,440
there

2097
02:04:38,119 --> 02:04:43,840
is. Bugger.

2098
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:43,840
Got to take a quick snap at

2099
02:04:59,639 --> 02:05:04,280
him. I hit a fox.

2100
02:05:08,400 --> 02:05:13,520
Oh, straight over his head. Yeah, I'll

2101
02:05:10,719 --> 02:05:13,520
go back and get the

2102
02:05:19,480 --> 02:05:23,199
trailer. Still over his

2103
02:05:24,360 --> 02:05:32,320
head. Actually, what I could do is if we

2104
02:05:28,679 --> 02:05:32,320
put all of this

2105
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:39,679
down, we're going to be able to move a

2106
02:05:37,040 --> 02:05:39,679
little quicker.

2107
02:05:40,639 --> 02:05:43,920
We're coming back with the trailer

2108
02:05:49,239 --> 02:05:55,920
anyway. Everything here in one

2109
02:05:53,480 --> 02:06:01,520
spot. What? What did I just hit? I think

2110
02:05:55,920 --> 02:06:01,520
it was Q. Oh, it was Q's a auto

2111
02:06:04,040 --> 02:06:10,480
run. Stupid fox. Stop running away,

2112
02:06:08,080 --> 02:06:12,719
coward. Get back here and fight like a

2113
02:06:10,480 --> 02:06:12,719
real

2114
02:06:14,360 --> 02:06:20,440
man. Says a guy shooting small animals

2115
02:06:17,119 --> 02:06:20,440
with a gun.

2116
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:54,440
Oh, kind of wanted that white fox, too.

2117
02:06:51,119 --> 02:06:54,440
Kind of.

2118
02:07:00,719 --> 02:07:06,239
Still missing that damn fox. How many

2119
02:07:02,719 --> 02:07:06,239
times have I missed that same fox

2120
02:07:06,840 --> 02:07:11,239
now? Barely worth the amount of bullets

2121
02:07:09,199 --> 02:07:13,639
I spent on

2122
02:07:11,239 --> 02:07:18,760
it. That was too low. I've been trying

2123
02:07:13,639 --> 02:07:18,760
to get the right distance, but

2124
02:07:25,530 --> 02:07:30,880
[Laughter]

2125
02:07:33,440 --> 02:07:41,719
No, stop running, pig. That's not a pig

2126
02:07:36,320 --> 02:07:41,719
thing. Damn foxes cost me a fortune.

2127
02:07:52,480 --> 02:07:58,159
It's gone now. That one fox, he's cost

2128
02:07:55,440 --> 02:07:58,159
me like 10

2129
02:08:03,960 --> 02:08:09,920
bullets. All right, let's head home.

2130
02:08:07,040 --> 02:08:09,920
Let's go get that

2131
02:08:12,199 --> 02:08:17,639
gas. I feel funny sitting on the back of

2132
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:17,639
the bike.

2133
02:08:26,639 --> 02:08:30,599
Where am

2134
02:08:28,119 --> 02:08:34,320
I? Need to go

2135
02:08:30,599 --> 02:08:34,320
left. Where's that damn

2136
02:08:38,920 --> 02:08:46,599
fox? Feel like I'm on the back of the

2137
02:08:41,040 --> 02:08:46,599
bike. How'd that happen? I zoomed out.

2138
02:08:47,760 --> 02:08:53,119
How do I change the zoom? Whoa. V

2139
02:08:53,880 --> 02:08:57,520
button. That'll look

2140
02:08:58,020 --> 02:09:04,400
[Laughter]

2141
02:09:00,679 --> 02:09:04,400
cool. All right. The V

2142
02:09:10,280 --> 02:09:17,719
button. Right. Leave you

2143
02:09:13,719 --> 02:09:19,920
there. How much gas do we even

2144
02:09:17,719 --> 02:09:21,840
have? Cuz we're going to need Oh, we got

2145
02:09:19,920 --> 02:09:24,239
a bit. And so we're going to need gas

2146
02:09:21,840 --> 02:09:24,239
for the

2147
02:09:25,480 --> 02:09:31,760
tractor. Okay. Our gun needs fixing.

2148
02:09:29,040 --> 02:09:31,760
What is that going to

2149
02:09:34,040 --> 02:09:41,079
take? Tools. Okay. Do we still have

2150
02:09:37,599 --> 02:09:41,079
tools in here?

2151
02:09:53,199 --> 02:10:03,560
All right, let's grab the track guitar

2152
02:09:58,199 --> 02:10:06,000
track. Yep, we're good. Uh, refuel

2153
02:10:03,560 --> 02:10:09,719
it. Watch out if I was you, chicken. I'm

2154
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:09,719
not good with this machine.

2155
02:10:18,800 --> 02:10:21,520
straight in front of

2156
02:10:22,679 --> 02:10:25,510
us. We'll gather up all the animals that

2157
02:10:25,280 --> 02:10:30,979
we've

2158
02:10:25,510 --> 02:10:30,979
[Applause]

2159
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:37,800
shot. Can't shoot on the tractor.

2160
02:10:50,960 --> 02:10:53,960
missed.

2161
02:11:08,719 --> 02:11:15,880
All right, let's just admit I'm a bad

2162
02:11:11,639 --> 02:11:15,880
shot. Move on.

2163
02:11:36,480 --> 02:11:39,760
Oh, come on. That was a head

2164
02:11:40,040 --> 02:11:43,679
shot. That's just

2165
02:11:47,320 --> 02:11:52,760
rude. Okay, so the first one's just to

2166
02:11:49,599 --> 02:11:52,760
the right.

2167
02:11:59,679 --> 02:12:04,639
Not with a view. Why do I keep ending up

2168
02:12:02,239 --> 02:12:04,639
behind?

2169
02:12:05,159 --> 02:12:09,679
It feels very strange being

2170
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:18,000
behind,

2171
02:12:21,320 --> 02:12:26,960
right? We might as well go down to the

2172
02:12:23,440 --> 02:12:26,960
road and go up that way.

2173
02:12:34,960 --> 02:12:36,960
Come

2174
02:12:56,719 --> 02:13:00,719
on, old

2175
02:12:58,520 --> 02:13:03,440
girl. Oh, do you have to keep your

2176
02:13:00,719 --> 02:13:04,800
finger on the accelerator? Okay. See, I

2177
02:13:03,440 --> 02:13:06,159
was thinking cuz it's a tractor, you

2178
02:13:04,800 --> 02:13:08,400
don't need to do that. But apparently

2179
02:13:06,159 --> 02:13:08,400
you

2180
02:13:18,040 --> 02:13:23,079
do. In real life with a tractor, you

2181
02:13:20,560 --> 02:13:25,360
just pull the throttle

2182
02:13:23,079 --> 02:13:28,520
lever down to the position where you

2183
02:13:25,360 --> 02:13:28,520
want it.

2184
02:13:31,679 --> 02:13:34,960
And then it'll just stay at that

2185
02:13:38,360 --> 02:13:43,679
speed. Can I shoot through this barn?

2186
02:13:40,960 --> 02:13:43,679
Should be able to,

2187
02:13:43,719 --> 02:13:50,000
right? No. Apparently, you can't. Oh,

2188
02:13:47,040 --> 02:13:50,000
they're running for their

2189
02:13:51,400 --> 02:13:55,520
lives. I forgot about that. People don't

2190
02:13:54,159 --> 02:13:57,520
like it when you pull out a gun and

2191
02:13:55,520 --> 02:14:01,040
start shooting me at them. Don't know

2192
02:13:57,520 --> 02:14:01,040
why. It's kind of

2193
02:14:02,440 --> 02:14:05,860
bizarre. Don't get in front of my

2194
02:14:04,400 --> 02:14:10,760
tractor, boys. I run you

2195
02:14:05,860 --> 02:14:13,920
[Applause]

2196
02:14:10,760 --> 02:14:16,920
over. Oh, you ran away, too. It's just

2197
02:14:13,920 --> 02:14:16,920
rude.

2198
02:14:34,320 --> 02:14:36,960
Got the wrong

2199
02:14:39,800 --> 02:14:44,560
side. Oops. Didn't mean to gut on sight

2200
02:14:42,400 --> 02:15:04,139
to get less meat.

2201
02:14:44,560 --> 02:15:04,139
[Applause]

2202
02:15:08,960 --> 02:15:17,400
No, it's not what I said. Pick it back

2203
02:15:13,400 --> 02:15:17,400
up. Right.

2204
02:15:38,719 --> 02:15:44,480
And then we'll take all these we'll take

2205
02:15:40,880 --> 02:15:44,480
all these home and we'll gut them this

2206
02:15:45,880 --> 02:15:50,639
evening. Thought I butchered them

2207
02:15:52,520 --> 02:15:56,960
anyway. All right, just ignore the damn

2208
02:15:59,880 --> 02:16:08,440
bullet. What

2209
02:16:02,520 --> 02:16:08,440
the Can you pretend to at least be dead?

2210
02:16:19,599 --> 02:16:24,079
They're not doing a very good job of

2211
02:16:20,880 --> 02:16:24,079
pretending to be dead, are

2212
02:16:24,440 --> 02:16:28,920
they? I'm not sure. Is that hitting the

2213
02:16:27,119 --> 02:16:32,920
bush in front of

2214
02:16:28,920 --> 02:16:32,920
it? Six.

2215
02:17:07,840 --> 02:17:12,960
Oh, come on. All you're doing is wasting

2216
02:17:10,399 --> 02:17:16,280
my bullets. We definitely need that

2217
02:17:12,960 --> 02:17:16,280
better gun.

2218
02:17:29,439 --> 02:17:34,559
How many bullets do I have left? Only

2219
02:17:31,200 --> 02:17:38,920
four left. Oh well, let's use up the

2220
02:17:34,559 --> 02:17:38,920
last of our bullets then, shall we?

2221
02:17:41,439 --> 02:17:44,960
Where's that big white stag

2222
02:17:46,599 --> 02:17:54,000
gone? Really wanted that big white stag.

2223
02:17:50,319 --> 02:17:54,000
It's not actually a white, is it?

2224
02:17:54,280 --> 02:17:59,840
But Oh, come on. I've only got four

2225
02:17:56,800 --> 02:18:03,479
bullets. Don't do this to me. It's rude.

2226
02:17:59,840 --> 02:18:03,479
Get back here.

2227
02:18:07,679 --> 02:18:11,960
You come towards me. That's it.

2228
02:18:22,719 --> 02:18:27,080
Was that last comment on this day?

2229
02:18:35,920 --> 02:18:38,800
This is my last

2230
02:18:40,040 --> 02:18:45,439
bullet.

2231
02:18:41,880 --> 02:18:45,439
Missed. Oh, we got

2232
02:18:52,599 --> 02:18:57,040
one. That freaking fox. He just keeps

2233
02:18:55,120 --> 02:19:00,160
getting further and further away. Oh,

2234
02:18:57,040 --> 02:19:00,160
wait. Hang on.

2235
02:19:10,319 --> 02:19:15,160
Nope.

2236
02:19:12,960 --> 02:19:18,319
I'm out of

2237
02:19:15,160 --> 02:19:18,319
ammo. All

2238
02:19:22,120 --> 02:19:28,040
right, we're going to have to spend this

2239
02:19:24,080 --> 02:19:28,040
money on more ammo.

2240
02:19:31,840 --> 02:19:37,599
See, now that they I've got no ammo,

2241
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:37,599
that fox is not afraid of

2242
02:19:43,080 --> 02:19:49,760
me. All right. Where is our

2243
02:19:46,920 --> 02:19:53,000
tractor? Oh, there's that carcass over

2244
02:19:49,760 --> 02:19:53,000
there, too.

2245
02:19:55,359 --> 02:20:04,960
We got plenty of meat. We'll go sell the

2246
02:20:00,359 --> 02:20:04,960
meat. We'll um get some more

2247
02:20:05,960 --> 02:20:11,720
bullets. We got all those berries to

2248
02:20:08,240 --> 02:20:11,720
sell as well.

2249
02:20:31,680 --> 02:20:35,720
Bring the tracker a bit closer.

2250
02:20:36,370 --> 02:20:47,889
[Applause]

2251
02:20:59,040 --> 02:21:04,240
The lawnmowing crew are here. It's going

2252
02:21:00,880 --> 02:21:06,319
to get noisy soon. Okay. I can't get

2253
02:21:04,240 --> 02:21:07,399
out. I can't get up there cuz you pigs

2254
02:21:06,319 --> 02:21:10,640
in the

2255
02:21:07,399 --> 02:21:10,640
way. A

2256
02:21:13,960 --> 02:21:19,359
rare. Nope. Get back

2257
02:21:16,760 --> 02:21:23,359
here. Escape. It's too late for that.

2258
02:21:19,359 --> 02:21:27,200
You're already being shot. You're dead.

2259
02:21:23,359 --> 02:21:27,200
You do a gymnastics thing. I don't

2260
02:21:29,960 --> 02:21:35,920
mind. That bag didn't fit. It fitted.

2261
02:21:36,280 --> 02:21:43,600
It okay. Well, that one did. So, the

2262
02:21:40,399 --> 02:21:43,600
bags aren't going on properly,

2263
02:21:43,640 --> 02:21:48,120
but there we go.

2264
02:21:57,680 --> 02:22:02,240
Yeah, lawn mowing crew is here, so it's

2265
02:21:59,439 --> 02:22:02,240
going to get noisy

2266
02:22:06,040 --> 02:22:11,800
shortly. Oh, now just put these in your

2267
02:22:08,240 --> 02:22:11,800
inventory. Clean.

2268
02:22:15,359 --> 02:22:18,760
Let them all now sitting next to the

2269
02:22:17,120 --> 02:22:21,120
road like they feel

2270
02:22:18,760 --> 02:22:23,520
safe just cuz they know I got no

2271
02:22:21,120 --> 02:22:23,520
freaking

2272
02:22:26,920 --> 02:22:30,080
bullets. Go

2273
02:22:34,359 --> 02:22:39,319
away. Okay, I'm going to have to climb

2274
02:22:36,319 --> 02:22:39,319
up.

2275
02:22:49,080 --> 02:22:52,560
Ah, what is

2276
02:22:52,680 --> 02:22:57,359
that? No, not closed. Mr. Climb

2277
02:23:01,800 --> 02:23:07,319
on. Can you please behave?

2278
02:23:12,240 --> 02:23:16,000
And I fell off. Oh, come

2279
02:23:20,840 --> 02:23:29,920
on. You don't have to be difficult about

2280
02:23:23,600 --> 02:23:29,920
this, pig. All right, behave yourself,

2281
02:23:30,359 --> 02:23:34,560
please. Still trying to figure out the

2282
02:23:32,560 --> 02:23:37,840
best way to load as many animals onto

2283
02:23:34,560 --> 02:23:39,760
the tractor as possible.

2284
02:23:37,840 --> 02:23:41,800
because they're a little awkward to load

2285
02:23:39,760 --> 02:23:45,359
as you can

2286
02:23:41,800 --> 02:23:45,359
tell. Right, you're

2287
02:23:47,160 --> 02:23:52,720
on. Oh, I think I know what it is. I'm

2288
02:23:49,840 --> 02:23:55,359
on the downhill slope, so I'm having

2289
02:23:52,720 --> 02:23:58,600
trouble reaching up. That could be what

2290
02:23:55,359 --> 02:23:58,600
it is.

2291
02:24:08,640 --> 02:24:12,359
Can you throw it?

2292
02:24:13,680 --> 02:24:17,600
I haven't thought about that. Let's try

2293
02:24:15,200 --> 02:24:17,600
throwing

2294
02:24:19,160 --> 02:24:26,359
it. Oh, that worked. Who would have

2295
02:24:22,560 --> 02:24:26,359
thought you could throw it?

2296
02:24:36,319 --> 02:24:41,000
Should have should have thought of that

2297
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:41,000
earlier.

2298
02:25:10,960 --> 02:25:14,080
That is not climbing

2299
02:25:14,280 --> 02:25:18,960
game. Okay. It doesn't like that, does

2300
02:25:22,200 --> 02:25:26,800
it? Okay. Let's try throwing it on

2301
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:53,469
then. Oh, here you go. That'll work.

2302
02:25:31,890 --> 02:25:53,469
[Applause]

2303
02:26:00,319 --> 02:26:05,319
I think that went straight over the

2304
02:26:01,680 --> 02:26:05,319
other side, didn't it?

2305
02:26:12,560 --> 02:26:20,439
No, not gut on sight.

2306
02:26:14,840 --> 02:26:20,439
A you get less meat if you go on site.

2307
02:26:47,720 --> 02:26:51,600
Nope. Can you behave,

2308
02:26:52,040 --> 02:27:00,319
please? Nope. You're not going

2309
02:26:55,240 --> 02:27:00,319
to climb on either. It's too full now, I

2310
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:06,240
think. Oh, it doesn't like me doing

2311
02:27:03,359 --> 02:27:06,240
that, does it?

2312
02:27:15,960 --> 02:27:19,840
Beautiful. I didn't hear it make a noise

2313
02:27:18,479 --> 02:27:22,840
though, so it may not be on there

2314
02:27:19,840 --> 02:27:22,840
properly.

2315
02:27:31,680 --> 02:27:34,600
See if we can rotate it around rather

2316
02:27:33,680 --> 02:27:37,920
than the

2317
02:27:34,600 --> 02:27:37,920
legs being

2318
02:27:42,040 --> 02:27:48,880
on. Ah, keep it and get on

2319
02:27:45,800 --> 02:27:51,920
sight. Not what I want. It's costing us

2320
02:27:48,880 --> 02:27:51,920
meat. I'm sure it

2321
02:27:52,680 --> 02:27:57,200
is. There we go. I heard that one.

2322
02:27:58,399 --> 02:28:03,130
Yeah, I think one of these might fall

2323
02:28:00,160 --> 02:28:07,870
off.

2324
02:28:03,130 --> 02:28:07,870
[Applause]

2325
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:25,280
No

2326
02:28:20,920 --> 02:28:25,280
noise. Makes a noise when it goes on

2327
02:28:30,280 --> 02:28:35,800
correctly. Yeah, you're fine. You made

2328
02:28:33,280 --> 02:28:38,000
the noise. That's all that

2329
02:28:35,800 --> 02:28:41,000
matters. All right, that's all about

2330
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:41,000
carcasses.

2331
02:29:01,680 --> 02:29:07,560
While I was looking at the map, I very

2332
02:29:03,920 --> 02:29:07,560
nearly hit a rock.

2333
02:29:33,840 --> 02:29:38,080
There's a few hours work here.

2334
02:29:43,359 --> 02:29:47,760
I should be throwing them. I keep

2335
02:29:44,720 --> 02:29:47,760
forgetting you can throw

2336
02:29:50,359 --> 02:29:56,120
them. Can you throw? Thank you.

2337
02:30:16,399 --> 02:30:22,680
See if we can throw it right over the

2338
02:30:18,120 --> 02:30:22,680
top. Not even close.

2339
02:30:38,880 --> 02:30:42,760
blanking mower. Anyway,

2340
02:31:08,560 --> 02:31:12,160
Chicken looking at all the dead animals

2341
02:31:10,160 --> 02:31:15,960
thinking, "I got to get out of here.

2342
02:31:12,160 --> 02:31:15,960
This man's gone crazy.

2343
02:31:28,960 --> 02:31:31,920
Oh, what a

2344
02:31:40,040 --> 02:31:44,120
stat. Just seeing how much I can stack

2345
02:31:42,479 --> 02:31:49,120
it

2346
02:31:44,120 --> 02:31:49,120
now. Stay up there. Ah, that's

2347
02:31:50,040 --> 02:31:53,760
rude. What do you reckon,

2348
02:31:58,359 --> 02:32:02,080
dog? I got all of

2349
02:32:10,840 --> 02:32:16,280
those. What time is it? 1:00.

2350
02:32:38,280 --> 02:32:45,399
Oops. Oh, that might have been a bit

2351
02:32:40,520 --> 02:32:45,399
much. Oh, dropped the foxes.

2352
02:32:48,800 --> 02:32:56,200
Drop the

2353
02:32:51,160 --> 02:32:56,200
gas now. Can we move here?

2354
02:33:21,520 --> 02:33:25,840
All right, that's all we can fit in

2355
02:33:22,800 --> 02:33:25,840
there is 97.

2356
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:35,240
Okay, good enough.

2357
02:33:45,359 --> 02:33:51,240
And you still got eight.

2358
02:33:48,040 --> 02:33:55,479
Okay. How does this get

2359
02:33:51,240 --> 02:33:58,080
on? 3 hours. You still got plenty of

2360
02:33:55,479 --> 02:33:58,840
time. Oh, this is so much better with a

2361
02:33:58,080 --> 02:34:04,120
slow

2362
02:33:58,840 --> 02:34:04,120
speed. Getting so much more done today.

2363
02:34:09,120 --> 02:34:15,640
Look at these

2364
02:34:11,080 --> 02:34:15,640
animals. Freaking awesome.

2365
02:34:22,240 --> 02:34:26,560
That bounced

2366
02:34:23,880 --> 02:34:28,600
back. Okay, whatever. Right, let's go

2367
02:34:26,560 --> 02:34:30,640
get our

2368
02:34:28,600 --> 02:34:34,080
motorcycle and then we'll come back and

2369
02:34:30,640 --> 02:34:35,960
gut all of those. Run, chicken.

2370
02:34:34,080 --> 02:34:38,840
But not that

2371
02:34:35,960 --> 02:34:42,760
way. 14 hours on the

2372
02:34:38,840 --> 02:34:46,080
spuds. All right, we just

2373
02:34:42,760 --> 02:34:46,080
teleport fast

2374
02:34:46,760 --> 02:34:53,520
travel now. Hang

2375
02:34:49,880 --> 02:34:54,280
on. So that's his farm. Motorcycle must

2376
02:34:53,520 --> 02:34:57,680
be

2377
02:34:54,280 --> 02:35:00,840
here. That can't be right. It was behind

2378
02:34:57,680 --> 02:35:00,840
the sawmill.

2379
02:35:01,439 --> 02:35:04,479
I thought it was behind

2380
02:35:05,640 --> 02:35:11,200
Thaddius. We did pick that fuel up. I

2381
02:35:08,240 --> 02:35:11,200
didn't grab the

2382
02:35:14,760 --> 02:35:19,280
fuel. I took the fuel off the

2383
02:35:27,319 --> 02:35:34,000
tractor. Oops.

2384
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:35,840
Right, let's try that again. Was it

2385
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:38,640
actually Thaddius or was it the sawmill?

2386
02:35:35,840 --> 02:35:38,640
I'm sure it was behind

2387
02:35:41,960 --> 02:35:49,439
Thaddius. Ruined church. Yeah. So, was

2388
02:35:45,760 --> 02:35:52,960
it in there or over here? Don't think it

2389
02:35:49,439 --> 02:35:52,960
was next to the ruined church, was

2390
02:35:53,160 --> 02:36:00,479
it? I'm lost. That's your fault, Dez,

2391
02:35:56,720 --> 02:36:00,479
cuz Yuri is telling me I'm lost.

2392
02:36:10,479 --> 02:36:16,240
Where was

2393
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:16,240
it? Yeah,

2394
02:36:23,399 --> 02:36:29,520
exactly. I think it must have been

2395
02:36:25,359 --> 02:36:29,520
behind the ruined church, was it?

2396
02:36:32,680 --> 02:36:36,160
Actually, while we're

2397
02:36:51,319 --> 02:37:00,640
here. Oh, look at all

2398
02:36:54,920 --> 02:37:00,640
this. Oh, it's 25. Look like so much

2399
02:37:08,840 --> 02:37:14,200
more. Gather all this up while we're

2400
02:37:11,200 --> 02:37:14,200
here.

2401
02:37:27,600 --> 02:37:32,000
Um, that thing looks like it might be a

2402
02:37:30,160 --> 02:37:34,399
bad idea to play with. We don't have a

2403
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,399
loaded

2404
02:37:37,960 --> 02:37:41,520
gun. Where did he

2405
02:37:43,960 --> 02:37:50,200
go? We're supposed to hunt that

2406
02:37:47,640 --> 02:37:54,880
thing. Where did he

2407
02:37:50,200 --> 02:37:59,680
go? Oh, there he is. There he is. Run.

2408
02:37:54,880 --> 02:37:59,680
I hope you can't get in here. Freaking

2409
02:38:04,600 --> 02:38:07,600
heck.

2410
02:38:09,640 --> 02:38:14,880
Quiet. Now, I've been up here already,

2411
02:38:12,600 --> 02:38:17,000
but let's just take another look. Now

2412
02:38:14,880 --> 02:38:19,280
that time has slowed

2413
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:22,600
down, maybe we'll see something we

2414
02:38:19,280 --> 02:38:22,600
didn't before.

2415
02:38:31,120 --> 02:38:34,399
Oh, I didn't mean to stick

2416
02:38:34,439 --> 02:38:38,240
down. Where's the bear

2417
02:38:41,080 --> 02:38:47,080
gone? That's what you usually say when

2418
02:38:43,280 --> 02:38:49,760
all the booze is gone. Where's the bear

2419
02:38:47,080 --> 02:38:52,640
gone? Now, did we check this? Yeah, I

2420
02:38:49,760 --> 02:38:56,399
thought so.

2421
02:38:52,640 --> 02:38:56,399
Can we see the motorbike from

2422
02:39:00,600 --> 02:39:04,479
here? Nothing in the bird's

2423
02:39:06,840 --> 02:39:11,120
nest. I want to try and ring the

2424
02:39:14,840 --> 02:39:19,760
bell. Oh, we can get in here, but we

2425
02:39:17,439 --> 02:39:20,880
can't ring the bell. I was thinking I

2426
02:39:19,760 --> 02:39:24,960
wasn't going to get going to be able to

2427
02:39:20,880 --> 02:39:24,960
get here cuz I thought I'd fall

2428
02:39:25,080 --> 02:39:29,520
down. Where is me

2429
02:39:31,640 --> 02:39:36,920
cycle? Whoa, whoa,

2430
02:39:34,600 --> 02:39:39,000
whoa. Oh

2431
02:39:36,920 --> 02:39:41,680
 Oh

2432
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:45,800
man. I presume that beer will kill me

2433
02:39:41,680 --> 02:39:49,520
given half a chance. Even quarter of a

2434
02:39:45,800 --> 02:39:51,080
chance, I presume.

2435
02:39:49,520 --> 02:39:54,359
Where did he go

2436
02:39:51,080 --> 02:39:56,200
now? Okay, we know where the bear

2437
02:39:54,359 --> 02:39:59,520
is. Hi,

2438
02:39:56,200 --> 02:40:02,399
bear. We know where he is now. We can

2439
02:39:59,520 --> 02:40:06,399
come back and try to get him later.

2440
02:40:02,399 --> 02:40:06,399
Let's go this way. And let's just

2441
02:40:06,600 --> 02:40:13,240
run. We'll see if we can get a bravery

2442
02:40:09,240 --> 02:40:13,240
award. Run.

2443
02:40:29,240 --> 02:40:33,160
Oops. Probably shouldn't have done that.

2444
02:40:31,120 --> 02:40:35,560
It's a bear following us.

2445
02:40:33,160 --> 02:40:38,080
No, we might have lost

2446
02:40:35,560 --> 02:40:43,319
him. We either outsmarted him or out

2447
02:40:38,080 --> 02:40:43,319
maneuvered him. Maybe even both.

2448
02:40:48,160 --> 02:40:52,080
Where's that freaking

2449
02:41:00,760 --> 02:41:06,479
bicycle? Uh, M. No, we've definitely

2450
02:41:07,319 --> 02:41:12,760
not sure. It was near Thaddius, wasn't

2451
02:41:09,760 --> 02:41:12,760
it?

2452
02:41:13,160 --> 02:41:17,760
Mushrooms must be over this

2453
02:41:15,640 --> 02:41:21,600
way. Maybe I should have come back with

2454
02:41:17,760 --> 02:41:23,439
the rifle. I do have my rifle. Oh, yeah.

2455
02:41:21,600 --> 02:41:27,280
But I don't have any bullets. It's not

2456
02:41:23,439 --> 02:41:27,280
going to help me. I need the

2457
02:41:30,439 --> 02:41:35,640
bullets. I need to refill my refill.

2458
02:41:38,640 --> 02:41:42,399
Where the stinking heck was that

2459
02:41:45,560 --> 02:41:49,680
motorcycle? Can't believe I've lost

2460
02:41:59,240 --> 02:42:03,240
it. Disappear.

2461
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:07,359
Uh, where was

2462
02:42:08,040 --> 02:42:13,040
it? I really think maybe I should just

2463
02:42:10,560 --> 02:42:14,720
go home, get all that meat, and we'll

2464
02:42:13,040 --> 02:42:18,359
come back when we have more bullets so I

2465
02:42:14,720 --> 02:42:18,359
can take out that beer.

2466
02:42:32,800 --> 02:42:37,479
I'm freaking lost. All right. Was it

2467
02:42:34,640 --> 02:42:39,520
behind the sawmill? I'm sure it was near

2468
02:42:37,479 --> 02:42:41,319
Thaddius. Damn sure it was near

2469
02:42:39,520 --> 02:42:44,520
Thaddius, but let's head over

2470
02:42:41,319 --> 02:42:46,760
here. Oh, guys, I haven't got my gun out

2471
02:42:44,520 --> 02:42:51,960
today. Calm

2472
02:42:46,760 --> 02:42:51,960
down. Whoa. Did you see that?

2473
02:42:59,120 --> 02:43:03,720
That man can

2474
02:43:01,080 --> 02:43:06,280
fly literally,

2475
02:43:03,720 --> 02:43:10,399
figuratively, probably in other ways as

2476
02:43:06,280 --> 02:43:10,399
well. Okay, here it is. Here it

2477
02:43:15,720 --> 02:43:22,960
is. No, no, no.

2478
02:43:18,520 --> 02:43:22,960
Refill. Yeah, now we got a

2479
02:43:23,560 --> 02:43:28,080
broom. Don't crash this stinking thing

2480
02:43:25,920 --> 02:43:30,720
as soon as you get it, Glenn. At least

2481
02:43:28,080 --> 02:43:30,720
wait five

2482
02:43:36,880 --> 02:43:40,100
[Applause]

2483
02:43:45,399 --> 02:43:51,279
minutes. This seems quite fast actually.

2484
02:43:49,439 --> 02:43:54,439
Find out in a minute when I get out onto

2485
02:43:51,279 --> 02:43:54,439
the open.

2486
02:43:55,520 --> 02:44:00,200
Not afraid to go fast in here, though.

2487
02:44:11,400 --> 02:44:14,680
[Music]

2488
02:44:22,800 --> 02:44:25,279
Oh, you

2489
02:44:26,439 --> 02:44:31,000
idiot. He ran straight in front of the

2490
02:44:28,960 --> 02:44:33,359
bloody

2491
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:38,479
bike. I don't think you can kill them,

2492
02:44:33,359 --> 02:44:38,479
can you? Far route, man. What a

2493
02:44:39,640 --> 02:44:47,120
monkey. He ran straight in front of me

2494
02:44:44,040 --> 02:44:47,120
bike. All

2495
02:44:56,000 --> 02:45:00,080
right. See what sort of speed this

2496
02:44:57,760 --> 02:45:00,080
thing's

2497
02:45:00,439 --> 02:45:07,040
got. Oh, Glenn. Glenn, stop.

2498
02:45:04,040 --> 02:45:10,319
Wow. It's changing gears. This thing's

2499
02:45:07,040 --> 02:45:14,840
not easy to ride, man. This thing is not

2500
02:45:10,319 --> 02:45:14,840
easy to ride. It slides.

2501
02:45:23,200 --> 02:45:29,840
[Applause]

2502
02:45:26,560 --> 02:45:29,840
I don't know if I like

2503
02:45:38,680 --> 02:45:46,319
it. Every little turn is quite dramatic.

2504
02:45:43,920 --> 02:45:49,240
Plus, I've found every vehicle in this

2505
02:45:46,319 --> 02:45:52,760
game seems to pull to the blowen

2506
02:45:49,240 --> 02:45:56,479
left. I don't know

2507
02:45:52,760 --> 02:46:00,920
why. We can do 30 km per hour. 35. Look

2508
02:45:56,479 --> 02:46:00,920
at the boys. 42.

2509
02:46:10,230 --> 02:46:13,430
[Applause]

2510
02:46:19,840 --> 02:46:27,840
Oh, well, we got

2511
02:46:22,600 --> 02:46:27,840
it. Yeah, even if it does feel like it's

2512
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:36,319
um crazy machine, we got it. That's the

2513
02:46:32,399 --> 02:46:37,000
good news. All right. And it is 1:00 in

2514
02:46:36,319 --> 02:46:39,920
the

2515
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:42,960
afternoon. Should I? Yeah, there's a few

2516
02:46:39,920 --> 02:46:46,240
hours work in this. Let's do this. I

2517
02:46:42,960 --> 02:46:46,240
don't want to be up all night doing

2518
02:46:48,840 --> 02:46:55,040
it. See, 39 minutes per animal. There's

2519
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:55,040
about a dozen animals

2520
02:47:00,200 --> 02:47:05,319
here. Yeah. See, it's getting dark now.

2521
02:47:38,080 --> 02:47:46,040
Oh, we're pretty

2522
02:47:40,840 --> 02:47:46,040
heavy. Uh, we'll drop the toes.

2523
02:47:51,840 --> 02:47:55,319
Drop the mates.

2524
02:48:25,680 --> 02:48:29,319
You're not close enough.

2525
02:48:42,479 --> 02:48:47,160
be interested to see what time it is.

2526
02:48:44,640 --> 02:48:50,000
Definitely getting

2527
02:48:47,160 --> 02:48:52,520
dark. Oh, look at that. I'm glad I

2528
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:54,640
didn't leave it too much

2529
02:48:52,520 --> 02:48:56,439
later. Let's turn the light on. Make

2530
02:48:54,640 --> 02:48:59,439
sure everything's

2531
02:48:56,439 --> 02:49:03,439
done. Pardon me.

2532
02:48:59,439 --> 02:49:03,439
Okay, let's go empty out this

2533
02:49:15,560 --> 02:49:20,600
weight. Now, I'm pretty sure we have one

2534
02:49:18,240 --> 02:49:24,399
more

2535
02:49:20,600 --> 02:49:24,399
day to sell this

2536
02:49:24,439 --> 02:49:27,439
meat.

2537
02:49:29,080 --> 02:49:35,560
Pretty sure it wasn't a complete waste

2538
02:49:31,680 --> 02:49:38,479
of meat. We've got all the

2539
02:49:35,560 --> 02:49:40,560
carcasses, but the meat has to be sold

2540
02:49:38,479 --> 02:49:42,319
before the end of winter if I'm not

2541
02:49:40,560 --> 02:49:43,560
mistaken. So, we have at least one more

2542
02:49:42,319 --> 02:49:47,720
day, I

2543
02:49:43,560 --> 02:49:47,720
think, at least.

2544
02:49:58,319 --> 02:50:01,279
58 bits of

2545
02:50:02,040 --> 02:50:07,760
meat. All right, let's head to

2546
02:50:04,439 --> 02:50:11,479
bed. How we doing for time? Two and

2547
02:50:07,760 --> 02:50:13,600
three hours for a day. God blam

2548
02:50:11,479 --> 02:50:17,200
me. We're not going to get another day

2549
02:50:13,600 --> 02:50:20,200
out of it then, are we? Let's get up at

2550
02:50:17,200 --> 02:50:20,200
8:00.

2551
02:50:22,960 --> 02:50:27,920
I mean, 3 hours. I could call it a day,

2552
02:50:25,040 --> 02:50:30,520
but

2553
02:50:27,920 --> 02:50:35,840
I want to sell all this

2554
02:50:30,520 --> 02:50:35,840
meat. Okay, so let's add something to

2555
02:50:44,680 --> 02:50:49,520
eat. Some animals will die soon. That's

2556
02:50:47,439 --> 02:50:54,200
what happens.

2557
02:50:49,520 --> 02:50:56,120
die eventually. We all get there one

2558
02:50:54,200 --> 02:50:59,120
day. That's

2559
02:50:56,120 --> 02:51:01,399
why everybody should always take care of

2560
02:50:59,120 --> 02:51:04,399
each other. Make sure that

2561
02:51:01,399 --> 02:51:04,399
you

2562
02:51:05,399 --> 02:51:09,800
don't get you nowhere.

2563
02:51:16,720 --> 02:51:18,880
Thank

2564
02:51:19,399 --> 02:51:24,160
you. All right. So, we're going to sell

2565
02:51:21,439 --> 02:51:24,160
all this meat

2566
02:51:27,800 --> 02:51:33,319
today. So, I'll keep the fuel cuz we're

2567
02:51:30,960 --> 02:51:37,319
probably going to run

2568
02:51:33,319 --> 02:51:37,319
out. Mushrooms.

2569
02:51:38,960 --> 02:51:42,000
All right, we need to buy

2570
02:51:43,720 --> 02:51:52,920
ammo. Woof woof. Oh, sorry. Dog's still

2571
02:51:49,080 --> 02:51:55,319
asleep. Dog got it. There's more

2572
02:51:52,920 --> 02:51:57,359
meat. More

2573
02:51:55,319 --> 02:51:59,920
mushrooms. Let's see what we can make

2574
02:51:57,359 --> 02:51:59,920
out of this

2575
02:52:01,640 --> 02:52:06,600
lot. I'm going to sell these berries.

2576
02:52:07,120 --> 02:52:12,080
cuz we can't do those ones. So, let's

2577
02:52:09,600 --> 02:52:12,080
just sell

2578
02:52:13,319 --> 02:52:19,359
them. That wasn't all of them

2579
02:52:16,040 --> 02:52:22,560
anyway. Ah, it's not even all of them.

2580
02:52:19,359 --> 02:52:22,560
Oh, man. I'm so

2581
02:52:27,640 --> 02:52:32,840
heavy. Okay, hang on. Let's

2582
02:52:50,880 --> 02:52:53,359
One didn't

2583
02:52:54,359 --> 02:52:58,840
stack. There we go.

2584
02:53:16,560 --> 02:53:22,160
Oh, true. I've never bothered

2585
02:53:19,800 --> 02:53:25,800
to never actually bothered to put any of

2586
02:53:22,160 --> 02:53:25,800
these up on the wall.

2587
02:53:29,600 --> 02:53:32,080
Just the

2588
02:53:35,479 --> 02:53:41,600
one. Put our fox heads above the wall.

2589
02:53:39,200 --> 02:53:41,600
We could

2590
02:53:45,479 --> 02:53:49,439
put our deer over the

2591
02:53:53,960 --> 02:53:58,760
bed. A pig up there.

2592
02:54:00,560 --> 02:54:06,080
Right. Um, grab

2593
02:54:03,080 --> 02:54:08,080
these. I could have sold them, but I

2594
02:54:06,080 --> 02:54:10,080
just thought, let's decorate the house

2595
02:54:08,080 --> 02:54:13,080
with a few. What am I stuck on? Oh,

2596
02:54:10,080 --> 02:54:13,080
motorcycle.

2597
02:54:17,680 --> 02:54:25,359
I left the light on all night last

2598
02:54:20,520 --> 02:54:27,640
night. That's cost me some power.

2599
02:54:25,359 --> 02:54:30,319
I should not have left the light

2600
02:54:27,640 --> 02:54:34,080
on. You know the song, don't leave the

2601
02:54:30,319 --> 02:54:37,040
light on for me. Oh, never mind. Right,

2602
02:54:34,080 --> 02:54:38,600
that's What time is it? It's 1:00 in the

2603
02:54:37,040 --> 02:54:40,880
stinky

2604
02:54:38,600 --> 02:54:42,720
morning. What do you mean it's 1:00 in

2605
02:54:40,880 --> 02:54:47,520
the morning? I thought I slept until a

2606
02:54:42,720 --> 02:54:50,479
proper time. I didn't, did I? Oh well.

2607
02:54:47,520 --> 02:54:54,520
Can we make anything out of this? Oh, I

2608
02:54:50,479 --> 02:54:54,520
need the spring and the wall.

2609
02:54:58,160 --> 02:55:04,560
I thought we slept through the night. I

2610
02:55:00,240 --> 02:55:04,560
must have only slept for 1 hour. Oh

2611
02:55:06,680 --> 02:55:15,200
well. Albino set. Nice. Albino set too.

2612
02:55:12,040 --> 02:55:19,880
Nice. We can't do the bear set. The

2613
02:55:15,200 --> 02:55:22,800
black set. The bore set. The bore

2614
02:55:19,880 --> 02:55:24,120
set. Hang on. No, we just need Yep. We

2615
02:55:22,800 --> 02:55:26,080
need more

2616
02:55:24,120 --> 02:55:27,520
spring. Okay, we're going to make some

2617
02:55:26,080 --> 02:55:30,640
clothes and then we'll go back to bed

2618
02:55:27,520 --> 02:55:33,279
again cuz apparently I forgot to sleep

2619
02:55:30,640 --> 02:55:36,240
through the night. But we got some cool

2620
02:55:33,279 --> 02:55:36,240
new winter

2621
02:55:46,600 --> 02:55:54,279
clothing. So the beer set. No black set.

2622
02:55:50,479 --> 02:55:59,840
Bore set. Four. Three. Bore

2623
02:55:54,279 --> 02:56:03,960
furs. I only have two. Ah, I have deer.

2624
02:55:59,840 --> 02:56:09,279
Okay, I only have the deer. So, deer

2625
02:56:03,960 --> 02:56:09,279
set. Deer set. That's all we can

2626
02:56:12,040 --> 02:56:16,439
do. Be fur.

2627
02:56:17,040 --> 02:56:21,760
We need potato mash for doing the

2628
02:56:19,840 --> 02:56:25,200
springtime set. We'll get that done

2629
02:56:21,760 --> 02:56:28,439
before spring, summertime set, and a

2630
02:56:25,200 --> 02:56:30,880
work set. Oh, we've got lots of clothing

2631
02:56:28,439 --> 02:56:33,080
now. I'll go sell the rest of my fur

2632
02:56:30,880 --> 02:56:35,399
rather than hang on to

2633
02:56:33,080 --> 02:56:37,600
it. I'll sell

2634
02:56:35,399 --> 02:56:39,720
it. Oh, wait. That's not where we

2635
02:56:37,600 --> 02:56:42,880
putting clothes now, is

2636
02:56:39,720 --> 02:56:45,439
it? Uh, should we use this one? Cuz it's

2637
02:56:42,880 --> 02:56:46,880
where I put Yeah, we'll put all of it

2638
02:56:45,439 --> 02:56:50,000
together.

2639
02:56:46,880 --> 02:56:50,000
Oh, we got two of the

2640
02:56:50,200 --> 02:56:57,120
same. I wonder if we can sell

2641
02:56:53,800 --> 02:56:57,120
them. Never

2642
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:08,920
mind. Okay. So, what's this? Fur

2643
02:57:06,920 --> 02:57:12,240
cat. Fur

2644
02:57:08,920 --> 02:57:12,240
vest. Fur

2645
02:57:12,840 --> 02:57:17,600
hat. Well, aren't they all winter?

2646
02:57:18,160 --> 02:57:21,600
Aren't they all winter clothing? I'm a

2647
02:57:20,399 --> 02:57:23,080
little confused by that. Let's go back

2648
02:57:21,600 --> 02:57:25,359
and have another

2649
02:57:23,080 --> 02:57:26,800
look. Yeah, maybe what we could do is

2650
02:57:25,359 --> 02:57:28,359
actually call it a day cuz we have been

2651
02:57:26,800 --> 02:57:33,319
going for 3

2652
02:57:28,359 --> 02:57:35,720
hours. We did the deer

2653
02:57:33,319 --> 02:57:40,000
set. Oh, I can do

2654
02:57:35,720 --> 02:57:43,399
more. True. And the albino set. Oh, that

2655
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:46,399
was the difference. I did the albino

2656
02:57:43,399 --> 02:57:46,399
set,

2657
02:57:47,080 --> 02:57:52,080
right? Okay. But I don't think we can

2658
02:57:49,680 --> 02:57:52,080
sell

2659
02:57:57,240 --> 02:58:01,840
clothing. Let's just have a look and see

2660
02:57:59,200 --> 02:58:01,840
if it has a

2661
02:58:04,120 --> 02:58:11,760
value. I'm not sure if that's a value.

2662
02:58:09,200 --> 02:58:15,920
No, it's weight and storage capacity.

2663
02:58:11,760 --> 02:58:18,040
It's not value. Ah, okay. Yeah, I don't

2664
02:58:15,920 --> 02:58:20,200
know if we can sell this

2665
02:58:18,040 --> 02:58:23,600
stuff. I

2666
02:58:20,200 --> 02:58:25,920
think what we'll do is we'll keep one of

2667
02:58:23,600 --> 02:58:29,520
each on us and we'll try and sell them

2668
02:58:25,920 --> 02:58:29,520
tomorrow. I probably

2669
02:58:32,120 --> 02:58:37,200
can't,

2670
02:58:33,720 --> 02:58:40,560
but why not give it a try? If I can

2671
02:58:37,200 --> 02:58:42,560
start selling clothing. Yeah, why not?

2672
02:58:40,560 --> 02:58:45,200
All right, I think what we'll do because

2673
02:58:42,560 --> 02:58:47,000
it has been three hours and I didn't

2674
02:58:45,200 --> 02:58:49,600
sleep a full

2675
02:58:47,000 --> 02:58:52,319
night and I've just noticed YouTube has

2676
02:58:49,600 --> 02:58:53,840
started buffering. There we go. I don't

2677
02:58:52,319 --> 02:58:56,080
know why YouTube's buffering, but I'm

2678
02:58:53,840 --> 02:58:57,960
having a bit of a slow internet week. I

2679
02:58:56,080 --> 02:59:00,640
have noticed

2680
02:58:57,960 --> 02:59:03,960
that sometime my YouTube pages aren't

2681
02:59:00,640 --> 02:59:03,960
loading fully.

2682
02:59:04,000 --> 02:59:08,200
All right. I think what we'll do is

2683
02:59:05,439 --> 02:59:11,640
we'll try and sell all of

2684
02:59:08,200 --> 02:59:14,720
this. Yeah, it's back again

2685
02:59:11,640 --> 02:59:16,840
now. We'll try and sell all of that next

2686
02:59:14,720 --> 02:59:19,279
time we play. So, we'll call that it for

2687
02:59:16,840 --> 02:59:21,920
today. Next time we come back, we got

2688
02:59:19,279 --> 02:59:23,960
all that and all of this stuff. We're

2689
02:59:21,920 --> 02:59:26,439
going to try and sell all of

2690
02:59:23,960 --> 02:59:29,120
it. We're already after

2691
02:59:26,439 --> 02:59:31,439
midnight, so our food's not going to go

2692
02:59:29,120 --> 02:59:34,000
off. Yeah, hopefully. That's a lot of

2693
02:59:31,439 --> 02:59:36,720
good stuff to sell. So, yes, I'm going

2694
02:59:34,000 --> 02:59:39,359
to call that it for the day. I'll call

2695
02:59:36,720 --> 02:59:40,720
that it for the stream. And next week

2696
02:59:39,359 --> 02:59:42,319
when we come back, we're going to sell

2697
02:59:40,720 --> 02:59:44,000
all of that stuff. I kind of like it

2698
02:59:42,319 --> 02:59:45,359
with that on the wall. That's kind of

2699
02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:48,279
cool. We're going have to start

2700
02:59:45,359 --> 02:59:51,200
decorating our house this winter, too.

2701
02:59:48,279 --> 02:59:53,520
Um, yeah. So, we'll be back to this

2702
02:59:51,200 --> 02:59:55,040
again next week. Thank you everybody for

2703
02:59:53,520 --> 02:59:57,760
watching. Hopefully, you've enjoyed

2704
02:59:55,040 --> 02:59:59,279
today's stream. If you have, you know

2705
02:59:57,760 --> 03:00:02,720

didn't we have somebody else donate bits

2727
03:01:00,840 --> 03:01:05,920

I feel like we did Clint.

I need to keep track of

2733
03:01:19,560 --> 03:01:27,600
that. Anyway, appreciate it. I've gone

2734
03:01:23,680 --> 03:01:29,279
back two days now. Definitely not there.

2735
03:01:27,600 --> 03:01:32,520
I need a better system to keep track of

2736
03:01:29,279 --> 03:01:36,760
it. Cheers, guys. I do appreciate the

2737
03:01:32,520 --> 03:01:36,760
bits. Thank you.
