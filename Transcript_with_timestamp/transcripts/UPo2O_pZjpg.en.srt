00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,720
guys how we doing welcome to the channel

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:04,080
this is courtney with good works

3
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,080
tractors today we're going to talk about

4
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,359
the top 10 snow removal mistakes for

5
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,360
tractor owners

6
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,880
it's that time of year the snow pushers

7
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,080
are flying off the shelves just as quick

8
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,639
as we get them in

9
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,960
snow hasn't fallen yet unusually here in

10
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,320
michigan we are in nearly mid-december

11
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,800
i'm going to call it mid-december why

12
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,960
not

13
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,880
but the snow rest assured will be on its

14
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,439
way so pay attention we won't keep you

15
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,800
long

16
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,240
these could save you some time they can

17
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,439
save you some money they can save you a

18
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,800
heck of a lot of frustration

19
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,560
after you're done watching this video

20
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,399
consider giving me a thumbs up a thumbs

down and also hit that subscribe button

22
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,200
that would really help me out

23
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,239
if you see something you like here read

24
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,200
through that description right

25
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,480
underneath the video

26
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,600
there'll be a lot of links down there

27
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,320
where you can buy cool stuff for your

28
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,680
tractor

29
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,280
if you've been wondering what these big

30
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,280
old hunks of steel are right here these

31
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,800
are called snow pushers these go right

32
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,360
on the end of your loader in place of

33
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,039
your bucket very easy to take on and off

34
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,640
there's no other hydraulics required

35
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,399
there's no electric required you just

36
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,239
simply put it on and away you go

37
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,680
the reason these things are so popular

38
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,000
is for the fact that they are good for

39
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,079
small

40
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,840
snowfalls deep snowfalls the light

41
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,280
fluffy stuff the heavy wet stuff and

42
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,559
everything in between i've done all

43
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,560
sorts of videos on these

44
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,320
hla snow pushers in particular and why

45
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,600
they kind of stand above and beyond all

46
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,439
the others that are on the market

47
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,880
so check those videos out we can get

48
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,720
these in all sorts of different colors

49
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,159
and sizes and combinations to fit your

50
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,799
machine whether it's a john deere quick

51
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,320
attach

52
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,799
a skid steer quick attach or even a

53
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,280
custom mount so visit

54
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,040
goodworkstractors.com to get more

55
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,960
information and to place your order

56
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,080
damage to your plowing surface can be a

57
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,320
real bummer and a

58
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,439
very expensive repair i just had my

59
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,439
parking lot out here

60
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,960
resurfaced just earlier this year it

61
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,040
looks fantastic and i want to keep it

62
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,720
that way i get requests all the time

63
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,400
i just got new concrete i just had my

64
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,000
driveway redone we've had gravel for

65
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,280
years we finally got asphalt

66
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,640
what we're staring at right here are

67
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,000
going to be a couple of good options

68
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,280
that are going to protect your driveway

69
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,079
you have uhmw poly for the easy way to

70
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,399
talk about it

71
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,680
or rubber right here either one of these

72
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,439
materials here are going to be very

73
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,000
protective of a paved or concrete

74
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,680
surface

75
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,200
they're going to plow very well also

76
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,320
they're going to be very quiet and very

77
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,079
durable as well

78
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,439
these kinds of materials can generally

79
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,880
be flipped over so you can get double

80
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,640
the usable life out of them also

81
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,399
i've done comparisons on edges including

82
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,680
the poly the rubber and even the steel

83
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,160
ledge so you can see the pros and cons

84
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,360
of each

85
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,800
check out that video if you haven't done

86
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,560
so already if i was going to sum up

87
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,239
anything about this poly material right

88
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,760
here the easy way to say is that it

89
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,440
protects like rubber but it cuts like

90
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,959
steel so if you have that brand new

91
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,319
driveway that brand new surface and you

92
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,360
want to keep it looking good for years

93
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,599
to come

94
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,440
avoid steel at all costs that is a quick

95
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,920
way to cause damage to your drive get

96
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,840
yourself

97
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,200
either this uhmw or the rubber

98
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,640
now i don't know if this one bothers

99
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,560
anybody else out there but it sure

100
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,680
drives me nuts and i do it every year

101
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,280
at least in the beginning of the year

102
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,640
and then what do i do i find myself out

103
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,400
there with a shovel in hand just

104
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,840
picking away at it until it's all gone

105
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,599
now what am i talking about

106
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,360
you drive over the snow before you

107
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,879
remove it before you clear it out before

108
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,480
you plow it out it just drives me nuts

109
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,239
because you'll have a perfectly clean

110
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,879
driveway perfectly clean parking lot

111
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,640
except for

112
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,560
that two track where you drove in or out

113
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,239
whatever it might be so if your pusher

114
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,280
or plow has a steel edge on it there's

115
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,000
going to be a pretty good chance that

116
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,440
you can get rid of

117
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,680
most of that packed snow that you've

118
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,200
driven over already even the uhmw

119
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,800
or that poly is going to do a pretty

120
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,200
darn good job of getting rid of that

121
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,159
however packed snow is just a very tough

122
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,760
job for rubber

123
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,440
so if you have a rubber edge on your

124
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,959
plow or pusher that is specifically

125
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,840
designed to protect the surface that

126
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,120
you're plowing

127
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,640
well guess what it's probably not going

128
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,519
to do a very good job at cutting through

129
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,720
that packed snow

130
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,640
so the best thing you can do in that

131
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,879
kind of scenario is get to plowing it

132
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,799
before you drive over it

133
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,400
a very painful lesson that you can learn

134
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,080
is on a plow that can be used both in

135
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,920
the summertime and the winter time

136
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,760
right here we have a john deere a quick

137
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,040
attach plow for the front of either

138
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,720
it could be a garden tractor it could be

139
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,959
a 10 25 hour it doesn't matter they go

140
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,400
on

141
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,120
on all those kinds of machines right

142
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,799
there but pay close attention to this

143
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,080
pin that goes right through here

144
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,200
generally in the summertime because of

145
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,879
the weight of the dirt that you're

146
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,000
pushing you want to lock this pin

147
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,239
otherwise you're going to find these

148
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,200
trip springs constantly in that release

149
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,640
position there

150
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,040
however when you get to winter time and

151
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,400
you're dealing with hidden obstacles say

152
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,159
it's a curb or

153
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,840
landscape edging or a rock or whatever

154
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,159
it is just off the driveway

155
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,680
if you don't have this pen released here

156
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,560
you could find yourself coming to a

157
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,400
sudden jarring stop and you'll see posts

158
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,319
online on forums of folks that

159
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,159
have either had really significantly

160
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,959
damaged equipment or even hurt

161
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,200
themselves

162
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,720
jamming breaking a wrist ribs lots of

163
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,000
issues that come up lots of painful

164
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,000
injuries that come up

165
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,600
to the tractors and to yourself so it's

166
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,840
very simple it's just this little pin

167
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,840
right here make sure you pull that out

168
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,360
get that in the release position right

169
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,240
up there and then

170
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,680
you'll you'll notice here i can actually

171
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,400
pull that all the way back that's going

172
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,000
to be the trip

173
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,919
action there so if you hit an edge in

174
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,440
the winter time on a hidden obstacle

175
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,720
whatever it is it's going to give it's

176
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,199
just going to rock forward and then try

177
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,759
to

178
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,360
slip over it and come back into position

179
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,720
versus if it's locked

180
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,720
up front it's just going to come to a

181
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,800
jarring stop and hurt everything else

182
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,400
that's behind it

183
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,000
now certain pieces of snow removal

184
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,600
equipment are going to require extra

185
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,280
parts just to keep on hand they're

186
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,360
usable parts they're

187
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,800
sacrificial parts something like a snow

188
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,400
blower right here is going to have

189
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,639
shear bolts or shear pins you might hear

190
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,160
them called similar to what a brush hog

191
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,600
or some other pto driven piece of

192
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,240
equipment would have on the back of your

193
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
tractor

194
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,280
you're going to have a couple on on this

195
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,320
type of snow blower right here one on

196
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,000
either end

197
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,680
it's important to know that you have

198
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,680
those on hand ahead of time

199
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,440
now some folks will go their entire life

200
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,840
without ever having to replace the shear

201
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,520
bolt

202
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,880
others are going to have to replace them

203
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,320
on a constant basis

204
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,840
but i want to show you a hidden spot on

205
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,600
these john deere snow blowers that might

206
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,360
already have a handful of shear bolts

207
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,280
spare shear bolts for you you didn't

208
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,880
even know about so take a look right

209
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,479
here along the edge of the snow blower

210
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,000
on the back side near the chute

211
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,600
you may even just have a handful of

212
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,160
holes right here without any shear bolts

213
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,759
in them

214
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,440
wondering what those holes are for well

215
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,360
that's exactly what they're intended for

216
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,639
so stock these up if you happen to shear

217
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,080
one or two of them off make sure you go

218
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,520
to the store right away and replace them

219
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,360
that way you always have a full stock if

220
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,720
you need it

221
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,160
one of the most frustrating signs of

222
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,720
damage that you can have is damage to

223
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,479
your yard

224
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,400
damage to your landscaping damage to

225
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,240
your curbs get yourself

226
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,440
some stake markers okay these things are

227
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,639
what a couple bucks a piece something

228
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,000
like that at least get yourself a

229
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,440
handful of them so you know

230
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,199
after there's 12 inches of snow on the

231
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,759
ground where that line is because i

232
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,319
swear

233
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,000
i tell myself i can tell where the

234
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,680
driveway ends and the yard starts you

235
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,240
know what the few times i've done that i

236
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,840
normally

237
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,520
clip at least a little bit of my turf

238
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,039
off looks like crap in the spring so

239
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,639
avoid that problem now

240
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,000
get out there get yourself some stakes

241
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,039
even a handful of them okay you don't

242
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,680
spend a hundred dollars if you don't

243
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,199
want to

244
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,120
just get a handful so you kind of had

245
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,400
that line up and down and you don't have

246
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,720
to push the limits right you don't have

247
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,960
to go

248
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,160
and get every single micro inch of your

249
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,840
driveway cleared

250
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,600
play it safe give yourself an inch or so

251
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,600
of space there you'll have nothing to

252
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,039
worry about then

253
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,960
one of the worst things you can do is

254
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,600
when you get that first good snow of the

255
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,440
year

256
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,280
is push that snow right off the drive or

257
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,960
the parking lot right to the edge and

258
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,039
then leave it sitting there okay

259
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,720
you got to have a plan for not just the

260
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,720
first snowfall of the year but for the

261
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,400
entire season because oftentimes

262
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,319
you get that first snow the first couple

263
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,360
snows it kind of warms up a little bit

264
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,120
then freezes up

265
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,280
you'll never be able to move that pile

266
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,160
of snow that you have right along the

267
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,800
edge of your

268
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,680
plowing area so push it deep push it

269
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,960
somewhere way back

270
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,039
way further than you think you're going

271
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,560
to need to do to give yourself room to

272
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,800
pile it up to stack it up

273
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,639
as snow continues to accumulate because

274
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,520
sometimes it all melts away halfway

275
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,759
through the winter

276
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,880
other times it just keeps on coming you

277
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,880
run out of room to put it

278
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,560
so plan ahead get that plan in place

279
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,000
every year i feel like out of my shop in

280
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,440
particular i got to figure out a

281
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,240
different game plan of what to do with

282
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,919
the snow

283
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,080
this year there's absolutely nowhere to

284
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,919
put the snow down back behind the shop

285
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,440
we got to bring it all up front and push

286
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,639
it somewhere around up here we're going

287
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,039
to have to get a little bit creative

288
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,960
this year

289
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,639
one of the big mistakes that i try to

290
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,639
kind of guide folks to especially new

291
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,800
tractor owners is going to be avoiding

292
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,080
the lack of traction there are several

293
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,919
ways you can go about improving your

294
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,680
traction let's talk about those now most

295
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,199
often folks want to put as big of a

296
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,400
piece of snow removal equipment on their

297
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,919
machine as possible

298
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,520
it's not so much that it's a big piece

299
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,080
of equipment that's the problem it's

300
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,840
really

301
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,680
that contact surface with the ground

302
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,800
where the problem lies the type of tire

303
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,479
that you have on your machine is going

304
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,039
to make a huge difference the amount of

305
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,400
traction

306
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,560
therefore the amount of snow that you

307
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,160
can push i changed up my tires to this

308
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,759
tread pattern right here specifically

309
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,720
for snow removal purposes

310
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,400
last year on a 4066r i had the r4 the

311
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,800
industrial style of tread pattern

312
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,240
it did terrible it just did awful okay

313
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,160
and i'm not alone in that i've done

314
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,160
videos all about different tire tread

315
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,840
patterns this tread pattern right here

316
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,160
is just going to be designed a lot

317
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,440
better for snow for mud that kind of

318
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,039
application there but

319
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,039
i'm really looking forward to using it

320
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,599
this year so the other main component of

321
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,879
traction

322
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,240
is going to be weight there are several

323
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,840
ways you can accomplish getting that

324
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,199
additional weight that you need

325
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,719
one can be through the use of a ballast

326
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,640
box on your three-point hitch you can

327
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,000
load this puppy up get about 800 pounds

328
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,839
or so a ballast weight

329
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,159
even in my tires right here i've got

330
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,159
about 1200 pounds of liquid ballast

331
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,599
just hiding right in plain sight you can

332
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,080
also add on wheel weights if you want to

333
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,519
as well

334
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,640
but if your machine is just too light

335
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,080
and you're just sitting there spinning

336
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,880
on top of the surface with a big load of

337
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,560
snow in front

338
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,399
it's not going to do you any good so get

339
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,040
enough weight to plant you and help push

340
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,959
you along

341
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,959
and of course in extreme situations you

342
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,680
may even need to add on tire chains or

343
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,600
tire studs

344
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,600
another big snow removal mistake for us

345
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,160
tractor owners is our machine won't

346
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,080
start

347
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,120
isn't that fun it happens at the most

348
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,160
opportune time no it never does

349
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,760
what are those things you can do to

350
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,040
prevent that from happening to you

351
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,720
there's several reasons in the winter

352
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,480
time when it's really cold outside while

353
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,720
your tractor might not start your fuel

354
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,200
system is critical and diesel will

355
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,640
freeze or gel okay technically it's

356
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,000
gelling how do you avoid that from

357
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,440
happening well typically you're going to

358
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,920
want to add something like a

359
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,800
anti-gel treatment all right what this

360
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,720
is going to do

361
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,080
is lower the temperature that it will

362
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,279
freeze at so it's going to lower that

363
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,320
freeze point meaning that you're going

364
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,839
to be able to use it

365
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,279
in colder temperatures before having an

366
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,959
issue this is something where you can

367
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,000
basically buy a can of this it'll last

368
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,519
you all winter long

369
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,959
you can see the mixing ratios on there

370
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,360
you're really not putting a whole lot in

371
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,200
there

372
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,040
so the guys over at lube shuttle parent

373
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,920
company air tech right here sent over

374
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,399
this frost line

375
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,760
minus 40. this is a another german

376
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,600
engineered product right here so i'm

377
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,720
going to be trying this out this year

378
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,760
i'm going to be adding it into my

379
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,360
tractors i'm going to have a couple

380
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,640
machines sitting outside all winter long

381
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,160
i'm looking forward to that

382
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,839
you'll see though it says you can lower

383
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,320
the gelling temperature 18

384
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,000
25 30 degrees just based on these mixing

385
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,519
ratios right here so basically the more

386
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,480
of this product that you put into your

387
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,640
diesel system

388
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,920
the lower the temperature that's outside

389
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,360
you'll be able to operate in

390
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,680
the good thing about this product is you

391
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,440
get five percent off with code gwt order

392
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,720
manufacture direct at the link below

393
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,880
now depending on if you're storing your

394
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,320
tractor indoors or outdoors in a heated

395
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,240
or unheated environment

396
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,079
you may need to get something like this

397
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,360
right here an engine block heater you're

398
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,880
just going to see a plug like this

399
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,000
on the side of your engine compartment

400
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,120
right here maybe even for the

401
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,640
transmission as well

402
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,240
just plug it in give yourself a half

403
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,680
hour an hour before you're going to go

404
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,959
out there and plow you'll be all set

405
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,800
these are something that can typically

406
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,839
be added on by the dealer for maybe a

407
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,360
few hundred bucks

408
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,640
another common problem as soon as the

409
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,720
temperatures start to drop are going to

410
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,120
be with batteries alright so as soon as

411
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,720
it gets

412
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,240
really cold outside you could definitely

413
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,920
have an issue with your battery

414
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,600
one way to prevent that of course

415
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,959
replace the battery or

416
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,880
something else you could do is put on a

417
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,320
battery tender or a trickle charger to

418
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,200
make sure especially if you're using it

419
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,480
infrequently

420
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,920
that you're good to go you don't have

421
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,160
any issues when it's time to push that

422
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,160
snow

423
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,800
isn't that a beautiful sound now if you

424
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,480
want to hear that sound all winter long

425
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,160
make sure you use your glow plugs that's

426
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,760
something that's pretty much standard on

427
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,440
all modern day tractors

428
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,120
so don't just go cranking your tractor

429
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,880
on that's just asking for problems or

430
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,360
asking for it to not start and the

431
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,279
frustration to kick in

432
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,200
it's 20 minutes after five and it's

433
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,720
already getting dark that's what we deal

434
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,680
with all winter long when we're pushing

435
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,440
snow

436
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,360
make sure you have your light situation

437
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,160
figured out your tractor has flashes for

438
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,600
a reason now

439
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,200
is a great time to use them if you're

440
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,560
going out into a public road

441
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,640
even inside your neighborhood in the

442
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,399
cul-de-sac for instance i know i like to

443
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,000
put my flashers on make sure i have all

444
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,440
my lights on every single one

445
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,279
i want to be seen from every different

446
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,320
angle you might think you're just going

447
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,600
out there really quick to turn around

448
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,399
and spin back and come back up the

449
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,519
driveway

450
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,519
that's when accidents happen

451
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,440
now's a really good time to check out

452
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,040
your lights turn them on

453
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,600
give a look around see if anything needs

454
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,839
to be replaced oh

455
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,279
well looks like i have work to do and if

456
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,920
these lights look a little bit brighter

457
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,000
to you

458
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,000
i replaced all six of the work lights

459
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
and headlights with an led bulb

460
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,600
for less than 80 bucks switching out

461
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,880
those halogens to these leds has been

462
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,000
one of the first things i've done on

463
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,079
every tractor i've owned

464
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,680
it's super easy to do i really love the

465
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,440
clarity of these lights and it just

466
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,680
allows me to see so much better when i'm

467
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,839
working at night

468
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,519
now of course the worst or possibly the

469
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,360
best mistake that you can make is the

470
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,320
dreaded you buy a new piece of snow

471
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,160
removal equipment

472
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,600
and it doesn't snow curse but that's

473
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,360
okay we don't buy this kind of snow

474
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,959
removal product just for one season it's

475
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,639
meant to last us for years and years to

476
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,920
come so if we can pay to keep the snow

477
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,920
away for just one year

478
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,200
i know most of us won't be complaining

479
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,639
well hopefully you found that fun and

480
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,160
informative and will help you avoid

481
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,440
making those mistakes this winter
