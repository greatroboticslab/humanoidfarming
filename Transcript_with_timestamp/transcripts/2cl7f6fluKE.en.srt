1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,599
uh my name is Tim Taylor I operate

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,679
Crossroad Farm in post Mills Vermont and

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,839
I farm approximately 50 acres of mixed

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:17,439
vegetables we have um Greenhouse

5
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:20,000
Tomatoes we grow approximately 15 16,000

6
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:22,680
pounds of those uh uh quite a big

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,400
bedding plant business now and in the

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,240
field crops Out Here We Grow just a uh

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:31,240
about everything uh one time we even

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:34,360
tried artichokes one year uh we have um

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:36,399
as far as weed strategies uh I think

12
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:39,440
probably the one I focus on the most is

13
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:42,600
to keep my corn crop the cleanest I can

14
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:45,440
I use that as a way to come into my next

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:49,360
Fields because it in my operation it

16
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,760
takes up a great deal of the uh acreage

17
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,719
I like to let no weeds go to seed there

18
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,600
so we'll actually but we use no

19
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:57,000
herbicide there I want to stress that

20
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,359
right from the start we never have I've

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,120
always cultivated it uh I use a single

22
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,760
row cultiv Ator I use a a two row

23
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,840
cultivator the rolling Liston type

24
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:10,040
cultivators and I use some blind

25
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,040
cultivation with rotary

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,400
hose this is a rotary

27
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,759
hoe which we use in uh corn comes in all

28
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,640
different lengths this is actually a

29
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,159
very small one it's been cut down so it

30
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,479
does two rows of

31
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:33,560
corn we use it for blind

32
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:36,240
cultivation uh after we've sewed the

33
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:39,079
corn approximately anywhere from 4 to 5

34
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,320
to oh perhaps a week to 10 days later

35
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:43,479
depending upon the soil temperature and

36
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,680
the time of the year we'll come in and

37
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:48,680
we just run this right across the top of

38
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,960
the crop blindly uh this is usually

39
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:54,799
pre-emergent or just as it's spiking up

40
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,960
I use this in corn I've used it in peas

41
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,000
and in

42
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:01,079
beans uh it will get about approximately

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,439
50 to 60 % of the

44
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:07,439
weeds uh it will get approximately oh

45
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:10,120
maybe 2 to 3% of the corn or the crop

46
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:13,000
you're trying to actually

47
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:15,720
grow uh depending upon that your

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,920
timing uh you can actually come in when

49
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,840
the crop is uh not so much corn but peas

50
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,440
and beans when the crop is actually up

51
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,720
and starting to Leaf

52
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:28,480
out uh it's one of the pros and the cons

53
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:31,680
of of this it allows you a little more

54
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:35,599
time for more finer cultivation because

55
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:38,680
it does reduce the uh pressure the weed

56
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:41,200
pressure for a period of time and yet it

57
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,239
doesn't get them all and you still need

58
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,319
to do cultivation I find I still need to

59
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:49,720
do uh single row cultivation as well uh

60
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:52,800
each sprocket here is spring-loaded

61
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:56,040
it'll bear the full weight of the

62
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,319
unit uh you can get a little nervous

63
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,200
sometimes when you use it because it

64
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:01,599
does sink into the ground quite a ways I

65
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,680
find that I'm quite safe as long as I

66
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:08,000
keep my corn planted at 2in level corn

67
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:11,640
planted up a little in the 1-in zone

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,879
will tend to be dug up a little more

69
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,319
often and one of the problems with this

70
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:17,760
tool is that it picks up all my loose

71
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:22,480
plastic from

72
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:24,599
my crops like melons and zucchini and

73
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,799
squash I don't know if it's exactly a

74
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:31,760
downsize it gets it out of the

75
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,760
field which I do want to get it out

76
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:44,879
the other primary cultivation tool I use

77
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:47,319
is a slightly modern version of 2in

78
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,239
shovels we call these the

79
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:53,239
curbco bat

80
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:55,280
wings and they're for single row

81
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:59,040
cultivation although I have seen them

82
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,239
used in in other applications in two and

83
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,560
three and four

84
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:06,439
cultivation what they consist of is a

85
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:09,040
series of old car bumpers that have been

86
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:12,159
fashioned into these bat wings for

87
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,519
throwing dirt uh some of the things I I

88
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:17,040
really like about it are if I have some

89
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:21,000
very mature weeds and then come in quite

90
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,720
late uh it will it cuts under them and

91
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,040
cuts them quite effectively and rips

92
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,759
them up uh it's quite effective where I

93
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,720
do have some witch grass CU again it

94
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:31,720
rips it

95
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,720
up

96
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:41,080
well here we have the budding basket

97
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:43,560
weeder and what we do here is we plant

98
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:47,000
all our lettuce is grown from and is

99
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,919
transplanted we do do nothing from seed

100
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,880
into the field it's all transplanted and

101
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:54,240
it's a two row bed

102
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,000
system and a week after transplanting

103
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,759
approximately we'll come in with a

104
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,880
budding basket here which is ground

105
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:05,840
driven off of this chain here and we we

106
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:09,039
can go approximately oh just about as

107
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:13,039
fast as you'd want to drive it on the

108
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:15,039
open field uh 5 mil an hour or so uh it

109
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:18,479
doesn't its Advantage is that it won't

110
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:23,440
throw dirt into the lettuce it'll just

111
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:26,880
it moves in this manner and kicks up the

112
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,639
weed seeds cultivating at about 1 in

113
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,199
depending upon where I set it in the

114
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,600
ground

115
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:33,560
wait about a week because we get a

116
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,759
little bit of germination but we don't

117
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,400
want to wait too long because we don't

118
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:40,800
want the weeds to be too big the

119
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:43,360
advantage of the belly Mount is that it

120
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,039
does not wander the cul the cultivating

121
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,240
tool doesn't wander in the field as it

122
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:50,199
would behind the tractor if it was

123
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,639
placed behind the tractor I'm able to

124
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:55,080
view straight down at the at the uh

125
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:58,120
single row I can't see both rows but I

126
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:00,440
can see one row and I just uh can see

127
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,240
exactly where I'm placing the tool tool

128
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:05,160
absolutely exactly if I daydream a

129
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,680
little bit and it wanders off I can

130
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,639
catch it real quick whereas when it's

131
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,440
behind me in the case of some of the

132
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,800
three-point hitch tools that I use for

133
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:15,080
cultivation it it tends to wander a

134
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,520
little more and I tend not to have quite

135
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,240
the same control that I would have

136
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,360
wanted to stress this I own two of these

137
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:24,000
cotas and this is mounted here all year

138
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,599
long I don't take this off it's not

139
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,400
difficult to mount it's just has four

140
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:30,840
bolts here and four bolts on the other

141
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,759
side but I have set just perfectly the

142
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,520
way I want it and I honestly believe you

143
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,120
should have a tractor for each piece of

144
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,639
cultivating equipment you have uh

145
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,120
because the downside on all cultivation

146
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,759
is the setup

147
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,479
time what we do is the the basket is

148
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:49,720
spaced 6 Ines apart and I'll do two

149
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:52,800
passes here the first pass I'll be

150
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,919
nursed right up next to the radishes

151
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,599
down one side I'll turn around and come

152
00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:59,639
back in the same bed up against the

153
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:02,199
other side as close as I can go in that

154
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:04,759
that way I get within usually an inch to

155
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:07,560
2 in of the

156
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:09,759
crop even though I have 6in spacing on

157
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,759
the

158
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,479
basket here's the profecta field

159
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,639
cultivator this is something new for me

160
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:24,759
that I'm just experimenting this year

161
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:26,520
with I hope it's going to be uh reduce

162
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:30,960
my Reliance upon a

163
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:33,879
rator uh in my field bed preparation

164
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,120
normally what are my present practice is

165
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:39,919
to

166
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:42,280
uh subsoil in the spring put the subsoil

167
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:46,080
on a two shank subsoiler run around the

168
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:48,800
entire 30 40 Acre Farm

169
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:53,080
subsoiling and then gradually manure and

170
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:56,240
rivate and make beds as I need them

171
00:07:53,080 --> 00:08:00,400
uh and then in the fall once again use

172
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:02,360
the rator to incorporate the residue

173
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,159
and I have some concerns about soil

174
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,479
structure and I'm trying to uh look for

175
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:09,960
alternatives to that uh and especially

176
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:13,520
the bed preparation in the spring and

177
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:16,520
also in again in for witch grass

178
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,520
control
