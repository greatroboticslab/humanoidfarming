  "text": "today i'm going to demonstrate a simple way to plug the end of a header pipe plug in the end of a lay flat header pipe is quick easy and necessary for the irrigation setup there are various sizes of late flat header pipe to choose from for this reason be sure to double check that your connector fitting and plug are the same diameter as the pipe you are using we are using a two inch pipe and two inch fittings sometimes it is possible to find a one piece plug but we have found them hard to find locally so in this video we are using a couple different fittings to make a plug we wrap teflon tape around the white threaded cap screwed it into the gray bar fitting and tighten it with a pipe wrench once you have the cap ready place the clamp on the lathe pipe next put the barb cap inside the end of the pipe this part can be a little tricky so gently twist and push the connector in until the pipe is snug against the connector fitting another option is to put a full grade lubricant like vaseline or vegetable oil on the outside of the connector so it slides on the pipe more easily push the clamp to the top of the fitting and using a flat head screwdriver tighten the clamp now you are ready to attach the drip tape to the header pipe we hope this video was very useful please check out our video series to learn all the steps in installing a simple irrigation system on a small phone thank you you",
