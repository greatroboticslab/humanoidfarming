2
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:09,240
Nathan dony here with crop King and

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,360
today we're going to go through and be

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,480
transplanting Our tomato plants for this

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,679
upcoming year so last week we went

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,320
through and we filled all of the buckets

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,320
with the perite and I've had the

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,560
irrigation in here running since Friday

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,680
to a go through and make sure that

10
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,680
everything's running the way that it's

11
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,960
supposed to it's therefore if I had a

12
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,880
selenoid that was going to fail or a

13
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,160
line that was going to go through and

14
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,359
plug up I'd know that before I had

15
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,480
tomato plants in here um then the other

16
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,120
thing too is to go through and make sure

17
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,040
that we've got that whole meteor profile

18
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,320
moist so we go through and Transplant

19
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,559
plants into here that they're going to

20
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,600
go through and have all the moisture

21
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,079
that they need to go through and get

22
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,000
their initial route started when we go

23
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,399
through and plant we're going to go

24
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,120
through and do two plants per bucket and

25
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:46,960
then we go through and we've got our top

26
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,320
covers already on top of the bucket so

27
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,520
that that gives us an indication where

28
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,359
our plants need to go and when we start

29
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,039
these plants out we'll take our

30
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:55,399
irrigation stake and it'll go directly

31
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:57,399
into the rock wool to go through and

32
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:58,920
make sure that that rock wo stays moist

33
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:01,760
until those roots have an opportunity to

34
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,000
go through and root out into the perite

35
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,600
and so then about days 10 or 14 as when

36
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,600
we'll come back through and move those

37
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,159
irrigation Stakes back out away from the

38
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,960
plants into the holes in the top covers

39
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:13,360
where they're supposed to be so here

40
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,400
we've got half of our top covers so this

41
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,240
goes through and shows us where our

42
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,040
plants are going to go so we make our

43
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,320
little Dibbles here we' go through

44
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,680
transplant the plant into there then

45
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,880
we've got our other half of our top

46
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,880
cover that goes through and sits in the

47
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,320
bucket and then our plants would be here

48
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,720
so we would take our two irrigation

49
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,000
stakes and that would go directly into

50
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,759
the rock wall so again these would go

51
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,200
through and stay here for the first 10

52
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,079
to 14 days and then after the plants

53
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,439
rooted out we'd go through and we move

54
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,799
these Stakes into here where they'd go

55
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:40,680
through and stay for their duration the

56
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:42,960
time that we have the crop in the

57
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,399
greenhouse so typically when we go

58
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,799
through and we transplant the tomatoes

59
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,840
they're going to go through and be in

60
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:52,240
their full sheet 98 counts 1 and 1/2 in

61
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,479
x 1 and 1/2 in Cubes but due to needing

62
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,000
to get the greenhouse cleaned up and

63
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,119
some different things fixed we knew that

64
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,240
we were going to go through and have

65
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,399
these plants a basically a week late

66
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,920
transplanting them so what we did is we

67
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:05,479
went through and we moved them up into

68
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,520
these grow smart trays so it's a rigid

69
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:10,200
plastic tray that goes through and has

70
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,400
78 holes and then I went through and we

71
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,560
spaced them out into every other hole to

72
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,160
go through and basically end up with 39

73
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,480
plants in that same 10x 20 footprint

74
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,560
just to go through and give these plants

75
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,440
a little bit of additional space so they

76
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,800
didn't become overcrowded end up shading

77
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,599
the growing points and causing them to

78
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,959
stretch if you knew you were going to be

79
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,560
late and it was going to go through and

80
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,319
be 2 or 3 weeks before you were going to

81
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,000
go through and get those transplanted

82
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,920
you can go through and shift up into the

83
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,800
3X3 grow Cube so basically what this

84
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,120
does is you take that plant and you go

85
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,200
through and you stick it into this hole

86
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,640
here make sure this cube is wet it'll go

87
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,200
through and root out into this Cube

88
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,280
giving you a couple more weeks of growth

89
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,400
before you need to go through and get

90
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,120
that plant transplanted into the bucket

91
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,800
so a grower might decide that they want

92
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,680
to go into these blocks if they know

93
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,239
that the weather's coming in and it's

94
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,720
going to be you know highs of 5° and

95
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,760
they don't want to go through and heat a

96
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:03,120
5 10,000 ft Greenhouse to go through and

97
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,440
take care of plants that are this size

98
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,480
to go through and occupy that space to

99
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,680
go through and buy them a couple more

100
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,120
weeks wait for a little bit warmer

101
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,440
weather they can go through and heat a

102
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,920
smaller space but give those plants

103
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,350
enough space that they need to go

104
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:24,250
through so they don't go through and

105
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:24,250

00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:43,240
