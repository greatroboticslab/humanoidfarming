00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,929
hi I'm Shane Harris with the algebra

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,360
cartridge extension system it's

4
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:14,429
officially Azalea season azaleas are

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,780
blooming and garden centers are full of

6
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:17,820
the plants trees ready for you to go

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,590
purchase them so what do you do with

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,869
these a is once you've mostly bought

9
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,820
them or you brought some home for the

10
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:26,570
new landscape today we're going to show

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,189
you how to plant those azaleas

12
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:31,320
when it comes to site selection on your

13
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:32,790
new zone you need to take a lot of time

14
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,100
to look where you're going to want to

15
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,840
put this particular plant does it need

16
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,239
to be near the house does it need to be

17
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,719
more of a natural area you want to give

18
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:46,140
it room to grow azaleas prefer filtered

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:49,350
Sun and afternoon shade in other words

20
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,570
they would prefer morning Sun maybe more

21
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:54,059
shade in the afternoon they will

22
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,610
tolerate Sun but they can get very hot

23
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:59,600
in the summer time also looking for an

24
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:02,340
area that's going to be well-drained

25
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,619
azaleas prefer well-drained soil but

26
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,720
cannot have any winter feet so an area

27
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:09,479
that provides filtered Sun may be under

28
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,760
pine trees just a few hardwoods maybe an

29
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:14,820
open area that gives a plenty of Sun in

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,420
the morning and afternoon shade when

31
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:20,220
it's hot this summer is gonna be ideal

32
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:23,390
as it should be grouped together based

33
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:25,430
on color or variety and spaced properly

34
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:29,729
around three to four feet apart

35
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:32,610
depending on their maturity size now

36
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:34,650
let's put the Azalea in the ground the

37
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,509
planting hole should be no deeper than

38
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:39,810
the depth of the container it came in

39
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:43,140
but at least twice is wide to allow the

40
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:45,090
proper root development one common

41
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,310
mistake is playing the azalea's too deep

42
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,170
in the ground adjust the depth of the

43
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,450
planting hole by adding more salt

44
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,930
underneath the root ball or under the

45
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,549
pot to get the correct height and depth

46
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:58,950
remove the Isaiah from the container and

47
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:01,469
massage and loosen up the roots along

48
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:04,500
the root ball this allowed those fibrous

49
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:07,079
roots to grow out properly in keeping

50
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:10,830
you from being pot bound while in the

51
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:13,400
ground a common horticultural saying

52
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,500
with azaleas is plant them high and then

53
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,620
ever die you want to be sure that the

54
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:22,099
root ball was about one inch above the

55
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:24,019
native soil level there's again if

56
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:28,040
they're planted too deep they will not

57
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:30,290
survive before adding the native soil

58
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,840
back into the planting hole and around

59
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:35,750
the Azalea it's a good idea to add a

60
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,609
little bit organic matter into the

61
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:41,120
native soil to have the best of both

62
00:02:37,609 --> 00:02:44,989
worlds common Sol amendments would

63
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:48,159
include compost or fine pine bark or

64
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:50,989
they're store-bought soil amendment

65
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:53,480
almost finished let's add the native

66
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:56,840
soil and organic matter mixture back

67
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:59,689
around the Azalea gently pushing it on

68
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:03,349
east side and pressing downward so that

69
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:06,349
root ball is covered and all air pockets

70
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:08,950
are removed be sure not to bury the

71
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:12,560
plant above the top of the root ball

72
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:16,849
gently spread it out and firming the

73
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:19,730
soil with your hands now add a layer of

74
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:22,849
mulch around the plan choices could be

75
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:24,949
pine straw or even pine bark this is

76
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:27,919
very critical for the first year of the

77
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:30,530
Azalea as it will lose moisture since

78
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:32,690
its roots are not fully established this

79
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:35,180
is very critical the first year to

80
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:39,650
maintain that moisture in order to can

81
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:41,959
survive the hot summers the last step is

82
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:44,209
to give the Azalea drink of water you

83
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:46,069
will want to water the Azalea at least

84
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:48,889
once a week depending on the amount of

85
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:53,720
rainfall and how hot the summers may be

86
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:55,639
again spring planted azaleas will need

87
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:58,790
at least one year for those roots to get

88
00:03:55,639 --> 00:04:01,959
well-established so again be sure to

89
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:04,400
water them throughout the year

90
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:06,650
azaleas are one of our prized Suns and

91
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,900
landscape plants because they last so

92
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:10,940
