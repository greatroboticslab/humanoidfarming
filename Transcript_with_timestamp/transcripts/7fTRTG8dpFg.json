  "text": "[Music] hi my name is not Raylan I'm the owner of Serrano creepazoid Limits during my day I receive a wide range of phone calls from folks about how to use compost in their gardens and it seems in the last few years as we've been transitioning to irrigation systems that conserve more water at the same time more folks are just not getting the results with our product that they historically have been getting so I've made this video as a way of trying to explain the role between water conservation irrigation systems compost soil health and plant vitality the answers for this video come from my own experience here in my own yard where I use a variety of irrigation systems as well as visiting many of your gardens and seeing how you irrigate do you stay to the end of this video you'll definitely have a much better understanding of what goes on underground how that underground is affected by the type of irrigation you use and ultimately the vitality of your garden so let's get started if you think dirt is only made up of rock and sand and clay how wrong you are living in that dirt are literally trillions of organisms and it is their presence that converts the organic matter on the surface those leaves that bison manure into food that feeds your plants and the amount of life that exists underground is orders of magnitude much more dense that would exist above ground but because we live above ground we give little thought what happens below ground so I'm gonna change your terminology going forward dirt is what stains your genes of plants live in soil so soil is the dirt portion the rock the sand the Clay's but it's also the water organic matter in the organisms and we use that term soil understanding this relationship is so important that you may want to stop this video right now and watch one of the two videos I've shown on the screen that's possible that video may expire when you actually watch this but no doubt you'll find other videos by dr. Langham and Jeffrey Lewin fellows they really give you a true appreciation of how complex and how important the organisms that live in your soil are to the success of your plants so let's look at an actual cross-section of Sol we start with dirt and on top of that dirt is somewhere on organic matter meaning some set of carbon-based matter it could be from fallen leaves buffalo manure or maybe compost we made from our kitchen scraps into that a few seedlings have sprouted there's a large fungal mass associated with the roots of our little seedling so we're going to put those in that there are billions of bacteria that break down the organic matter that helps feed the soil organisms and just for graphic purposes we're gonna add some amoebas and earthworms and centipedes and pull bugs just the name of you in all these organisms either feed from the organic matter that's on the surface or secondarily feed from those who bring it into the soil and very important these organisms just like you and I require water to survive as well as to move about so let's see what happens in our simple graphic it rains and that rain travels through the surface organic matter into the soil below and while this may seem very elementary when this organic matter is wet enough a few of our worms and pill bugs etc will move into it consume it and then bring it into the soil also very important remember that soil must have moisture for those organisms that live in the soil who remain alive when there's a dry area the organisms either die move away from there if you think to an earlier time in our lives our home irrigation systems were pretty close to natural rainfall looking at our graphic we can see that while it is not truly rainfall coming from the sky these robust wrinkler systems were able to wet everything and provide the moisture content the soil organisms needed to continue on so in the first step towards water conservation we took the same concept of these overhead sprinklers and reduce them to much smaller versions of the larger ones so if we look at our graphic we see what happens when we start using these sort of micro spray systems so how does that soil change when we go from the old standard above-ground water everything method to these new micro systems what we see is that we start to get dry spots in between the various sprinklers as these become more pronounced the soil organisms leave these dry areas total population Falls and hence eventually less nutrients are available for the plan while we may change our sprinkler system all in one day the drawing of these areas could take months maybe more if you go through a few rainstorms we will likely go through a honeymoon period where the plants are thriving that was so much less water how wonderful a new irrigation system is that's a false economy because eventually those dry spots will start to form you also notice that portions of the surface organic matter are no longer wet and without this moisture the very organisms that were consuming it will leave for wet areas their numbers will dwindle as the amount of damn compost is reduced the dry organic matter will no longer support a vibrant soil it will become hard and brittle and it makes sense that you would think hey the reason my yard is not doing well because this compost is terrible let's look at a simple chart comparing damp areas versus dry areas so first we begin with a natural setting or old-fashioned thoroughly irrigated area and with plenty of water the bacteria and fungi flourish they're bright products open up the soil allowing oxygen and water to easily get to those organisms that live in the soil and hence those produce more nutrients for our plants and everything's looking good now let's look what happens when we turn off the water the bacteria and fungi die off and soil structure begins to collapse as it collapses becomes more compacted oxygen and water cannot get to the organisms and soon anaerobic organisms colonize the soil their byproducts don't create plant food but instead create poisons such as alcohols and acids which eventually either stress or kill our above-ground plants remember all this takes time months or years after an irrigation system has changed in soil dry means dead back to our irrigation story in an effort to save more water we've moved from these micro spraying systems to drip systems by now you realize that the volume of soil that supports a plant can be hundreds of times larger than the above-ground plant yet somehow we believe that a sink or a few prepping emitters can support a thriving soil does not make sense as we see with these systems the dry zone is further increased so how do these systems get installed they don't make sense I think it's because we view the world through our own experiences and when we're thirsty we can meet all our water needs through a very small pore called our mouth but as we know plants do not absorb water this they require a very large diffuse area if you took time to watch either of those two videos you've come to understand it takes a lot of soil to support a plant in an area far far larger and what we see above-ground I have visited struggling Gardens where the homeowner is baffled at what is going on that's because they have reverted from traditional systems that watered all the soil to maybe one or two emitters placed at the base of a very mature tree and as we see this cannot possibly work continuing with our irrigation story inline drip systems by these few photos we can clean these wet versus dry areas and these systems suffer from the same problem as conventional existence at large dry areas here's another effect we need to look at changing soil composition so we may have installed an over designed drip system that did in fact water all of our soil but recently it seems like our plants are really struggling as we saw earlier it could be that there was leftover soil moisture from the old system that took a while to be used up but another explanation could be that we've worked hard to improve the organic levels in the soil and that very action has damaged the efficiency of this system so let's see how that happens if we compare clay in sandy soil they're very different place oils tend to be very compacted so that water is very slow to sink in hence water will tend to spread over a greater area before it soaks into the soil on the other hand sandy soils are very porous meaning that there's a lot of space between the particles a lot of room for water to go in and these soils water soaks in very quickly if you look at a cross-section you will see two different lighting patterns from these two types of soil another factor is capillary action because of the skin effect of a water molecule in clay water can travel sideways as well as upwards to find gravity in very porous soils that skin effect is greatly diminished so water moves down so now let's look at a drip system that was built for yard that was all clay this year worked very well in terms of distributing water that's because it had capillary action over time either organic matter is added from falling leaves we've begun adding compost to the surface whatever the reason is the soil has become more porous which is great for the organisms that live there because now they can get water and oxygen but unfortunately drip systems water distribution narrows as the soils porosity increases in capillary action is reduced as our soil improves ironically we strive to see those dreaded dry zones begin to form over time as more organic matter into the soil the drip system becomes less and less capable providing the needed moisture now we know that pure clay soil is a little value that we must add organic matter so keeping our soil sterilization these systems the answer is using only synthetic fertilizers injected into the irrigation water any and all organic matter must be avoided to maximize the clay content in foster this spreading of water so how can we have both how can we have lush healthy gardens as well as conserve water hopefully by now you see that watering the entire garden soil and that just a base of the plant is the key to a healthy underground soil and that healthy soils foster healthy plants that's something we cannot get around the easiest and most cost effective solution to conserving water is to mulch over the entire surface this as much as 50% of that soil moisture can be lost to evaporation from the Sun and the wind this is especially true with clay soils or that dawn capillary action will draw moisture from deep down bring it to the surface where it is then lost to evaporation a layer of compost ops that capillary draw by shading the soil from the Sun as well as blocking the drying effects of wind so either mulch for three to four inches of compost or just leave any fallen organic matter where it fell second if you have a drip system buried raise those emitters up onto the surface the reason we do this is we want our organic matter on the surface could be wet enough for the organisms will consume it and integrate it into the soil if we bury that line the compost will become extremely dry and never get into the soil to feed the organisms that eventually feed the plants again remember that all the soil needs to have moisture putting water or there no plants does not mean you are wasting water shake yourself of that drinking glass analogy if you have an inline drip system consider adding additional lines in my vegetable garden I initially installed this system exactly as detailed in the manual I've since come back and have added twice to recommend a number of lines with these additional lines I also chose an emitter with a much higher flow rate so the water would spread rather than soak in just below the emitter the results have been spectacular in my bumper crops are back another feature I've added is a weather-based irrigation timer now before Warren needs to be pretty expensive in a quite complicated to program but the water savings can be worth the price hey watering when it rains is the pure waste but who remembers to run out and turn off our irrigation system when that happens then there the cases when there's a heat spell and we see our plants wilting so we do adjust the time upwards the heats out passes but we forget to reset our timing schedule and as a result we over water so that concludes a few of my thoughts about watering and compost I hope you've gotten a little bit better understanding and can make more informed decisions going forward your patience has been most appreciated and of course your calls are always welcome thank you [Music]",
