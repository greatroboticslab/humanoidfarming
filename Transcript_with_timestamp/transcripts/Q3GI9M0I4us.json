  "text": "guys i'm confused third function diverter rear remote grapple-ready okay these are common terms that kind of all apply to the same type of remote that we're going to talk about today that's where the confusion lies right there's so many names there's very little standardization i'm going to give you my take on it it might not be your take but it's how i'm going to explain it to you if we have a conversation i did a video recently about 15 attachments for a third function several of the comments in that video said i got it wrong and what a third function is and that's what i want to discuss today is how do we interpret a third function is there a standardized system or do we kind of have to read between the lines maybe visually see the machine that we're looking to buy figure out what we need to set up our equipment and the position of it on the front in the middle or the back does any of it really even matter i'd love to get your feedback so leave a comment down below we can all help each other and learn a little bit more the goal is to get smarter every day so if you like what you see here i'd love to get a thumbs up and make sure you hit that subscribe button right down below if you haven't done so already and as always read through the description underneath the video all sorts of helpful links right down there for cool tractor products or head on over to goodworxtractors.com all right let's get to it let's dissect this a little bit we are talking about a function all right not the third it could be the first second the fourth to fifth but a function in general on a hydraulic system could be called a circuit as well pretty much any modern air attractor that has a front-end loader is going to have two hydraulic circuits so you'll have two hoses down here with corresponding outlets that are on your machine that is going to be one hydraulic circuit it allows the flow to go this way and maybe raise your loader up and then it allows the flow to come back through the other hose the other direction so that you can lower your loader as well now if we work our way up this next set of hoses is going to be the second function or the second hydraulic circuit so if the flow goes through the hose this way it's going to allow you to curl the bucket back if the flow comes back this direction it's going to allow you to dump the bucket now what you see here on top is going to be that additional function or this additional hydraulic circuit so what that allows you to do is maintain the first two circuits add on a third function so if you have a grapple connected to your front end loader not only can you raise and lower you can curl and roll you can also open and close and again that's controlled by hydraulic flow going one direction or another direction through those hoses so two hoses kind of makes a circle or a loop and allows that functionality to be complete that circuit to be complete going both directions so now that we have a basic understanding of what a third hydraulic circuit is let's explain the different variations of what that is primarily a third function versus a diverter kit they're going to both give you a additional hydraulic circuit that third circuit that you need to run something like a grapple however they're going to function differently let's dive into that now now i don't want you to pay too much attention to the location of these hoses the location of these couplers the location of this third circuit more importantly i want you to understand that what's found on my 4066r for example is going to be a third function control so this is a factory option you can get after-market third functions as well but this is going to be plumbed into your traktor's hydraulic system in a way that allows you to control not just the first and the second but the first second and third hydraulic functions all at the exact same time so you can run hydraulic flow from your tractor through all of those hoses all three of those circuits to raise and lower at the same time as you curl and roll and at the same time as you open and close the grapple for example third functions can be used for other attachments i'm not focusing on that we're just focusing on functionality now the other primary variation of that third hydraulic circuit is known as a diverter kit or a diverter valve so instead of being able to use the first circuit that second circuit and the third circuit at the same time you're going to t in to those hoses into the fittings that are part of that curl roll function so you're going to tap into that second hydraulic circuit you're going to put in a diverter hence the name which is essentially going to have a solenoid or a little valve on it so it's going to send a a signal to the solenoid solenoid chris gives me garbage for that all the time the point being you're going to get an electrical circuit it's going to divert the flow from your curl roll function and as long as you have that redirection going on it's going to send that hydraulic flow to your third circuit to instead of curling and rolling you can then open and close so you are diverting the flow from that second curl roll function to the third function of opening and closing the grapple so as you can see a diverter kit is a way to get that third additional that third hydraulic circuit however you just can't use all three circuits at the same time okay so if you've made it this far let's see if this next part confuses you is a third function and a rear remote the same thing well i'm going to make the case that it does not matter if it's on the front or the back of your tractor now before we get to that i need to explain what we have going on here because if three functions just isn't enough for you well get yourself 10 functions like what i have right here it might be a little bit overkill but i want to go through it really quick because it gets kind of confusing and intimidating now we're not going to count the two functions that are up front for the front end loader besides that there's eight additional hydraulic circuits that we could have back here so right here you're gonna have your third function these lines are actually plumbed up with some soft hoses going all the way up front to run the grapple then you're gonna have a fourth function down here and then we've sacrificed our fifth function and plugged it into this hydraulic multiplier you see up top this is going to give us six additional functions you can see there's a couple extra circuits here or functions that are not being used right now but we have the ability to do so if we should ever need it remember just like the third function you need two quick couplers to complete a hydraulic circuit or a function whether it's the third fourth fifth sixth seventh eighth ninth or tenth i don't want you to think that you can run ten hydraulic circuits at one time because compact tractors simply can't do that there's not that much hydraulic capacity or flow rate to do so and in fact controlling just two functions like raising and lowering and maybe curling and rolling at the same time can be challenging enough even for a semi experienced operator like myself trying to throw on a third function such as opening and closing a grapple while controlling those other two i'm not very good at that but just because you can't use six or seven at the same time doesn't mean that you don't need to have six or seven or eight circuits hooked up in my case and i'll give you the quick rundown as i have it set up right now i have eight total functions connected right now the first function will raise and lower the front end loader the second function will curl and roll a bucket or a grapple in this case the third function is going to open and close the jaws of the grapple now the fourth and the fifth are going to control the top and tilt kit that i have while the sixth seventh and eighth function are going to control the hydraulic chute rotation the hydraulic deflector and the hydraulic back drag now fortunately i don't have to use all of those circuits at the same time because i don't have enough arms and i don't have enough brain power most of these functions here are just momentary knees but nobody wants to be hopping on and off a tractor connecting or disconnecting hoses from one circuit to another circuit and vice versa every time you need to do it very inefficient so to control that big shiny multiplier back there i simply use this little switch panel right here to select the circuit i want to turn on flip that button and then actuate it with a lever and then turn it back off so if you're looking for an affordable way to add on additional hydraulic capability to your tractor you need to check out these hydraulic multipliers from summit hydraulics now if this wasn't sweet enough by itself it gets even sweeter when you can get five percent off with code gwt at summit hydraulics so a couple folks took issue with a statement or a general theme of a recent video i did on 15 attachments that proved the value of the third function because i included attachments that were mounted on the back side of a tractor not just mounted to your loader it was their interpretation that a third function was ran right up front and something connected up there and operated that way nothing to do with the back side if you have this additional function on the back side of your tractor that's called a rear remote and so that's why this is so confusing because this john deere 4066r i purchased it with a rear remote and a third function which are the same exact thing and in fact even inside the cab right underneath the third function control which is just a push button right on my loader joystick it's got a little roman numeral for three right and when i received this tractor that third function terminated on the back side of the machine right back here it did not have these hoses plugged into it and running up front that's something i added on after the fact but it was identified by john deere as a third function and the outlets terminated on the back side of the tractor so if you're new to the tractor world welcome to the confusion you know i think you just need to have a good understanding of what that third function capability can do and realize there's a way to route that functionality towards the front of the tractor or on the back side but having that additional hydraulic circuit that's the important part so similar to the factory third function that's on the 4066r a diverter kit that's giving you that third function or that third circuit could be mounted up front it could also be mounted on the back side the tractor does not care either way because wherever you need that additional hydraulic circuit you're going to care about that so if you have something mounted on the back side of your tractor like a snow blower that needs to have a hydraulic shoot rotation that's where you want the third function or if you need it mounted up front to have that third circuit up here to control the grapple that's important to you as the operator but a third function in my opinion can be mounted on the front can be mounted on the back it doesn't really matter so part of a diverter kit besides the hoses and the solenoid and the lines that go up front or maybe to the back is going to be a new joystick that you get to control that entire operation so this new joystick is going to include controls to operate that third function or in this case a diverter kit let's talk about price you know you want to get that additional hydraulic circuit on your tractor on the front or the back but you don't want to spend a lot of money well a diverter kit might be the way to go typically you're going to spend 500 or 600 bucks maybe somewhere in that ballpark to get a diverter kit and get that additional circuit mounted on your tractor however if you want to get a factory third function like what you see on my 4066r you could spend possibly 2 000 maybe even 2 500 if you get those grapple lines that run all the way up front as well so if you want to get the functionality of the third circuit but you don't want to spend thousands of dollars on completing that process maybe a summit diverter kit could be the solution for you and like that hydraulic multiplier you can get five percent off with code gwt you just go to summit hydraulics.com there's a link right down below do some shopping on there find the right kit for you we've done a video on how to install this kit we've also done a field video of this as well so you can see it in action out there picking up brush and logs and other debris with the work saver mini grapple this is a really great combination for a subcompact or smaller compacts as well so my interpretation if i'm listing a tractor for sale having a conversation with the customer i'm going to identify if it's a diverter or if it's a third function i'm going to let them know but that does not mean that it's ran all the way up front and ready to plumb in a grapple right at the end of the loader arms but if you do have hoses or lines ran all the way up front to the very business end of your front end loader i am going to go a step further and call that grapple-ready because you don't have to invest the cost to run lines from the back of the tractor all the way up front okay or from the midpoint all the way up front you already have those lines there so that's an extra cost that you don't have to consider or worry about it's already done but if your third function your third circuit your diverter terminates on the back side of your tractor all you need to do is just get some soft hoses made up plug them in back there route them all the way up front to your loader and you're ready to go the important part is having that third circuit on your tractor so maybe that helps you maybe it doesn't but for me when i'm looking for tractors because that's what i do i buy used tractors and i resell them if i see something has that third additional circuit whether it's a true factory third function or a diverter kit to me in my opinion having that third circuit of some kind on your tractor that's the valuable part that's going to open up the versatility and make it more appealing to future customers like yourself and really the other big takeaway for me is the fact that with compact tractors in general they have a pretty limited flow rate for hydraulics so it's really challenging to run three functions at one time let alone two functions at one time because there's simply not the hydraulic flow and the mental capacity at least for me to operate all those smoothly and succinctly so investing that money into a cheaper diverter kit still allows me to get the job done but at a lower cost so i've given you my interpretation of what a third function is but
