00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,929
hey folks is Josh Tony rich farmer

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:07,290
welcome to the farm blog today it is

3
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:08,639
what I like to call Golden Hour the Sun

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,980
is setting the trees are beautiful

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,269
everything looks wonderful we've got a

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,620
few things we've got to tackle today

7
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:15,599
we've got to go up and check on the

8
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,980
goats I'm gonna show you some new gear

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,810
that we got for the Gator we're gonna

10
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,490
have a little bit of an unboxing I've

11
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,170
got a big shipment in from Amazon today

12
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,640
and about a bunch of goodies to put on

13
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,350
the Gator to make things a little bit

14
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,060
easier to haul around the farm and the

15
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,699
last thing we're gonna do my lawn mower

16
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,170
seems to constantly have a flat tire so

17
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:33,210
today we're going to address that

18
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,950
problem I've got some new inner tubes

19
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,110
for the front wheels on my zero turn

20
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,480
mower we'll take the tire off the rim

21
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,590
slap those new tubes in there come on

22
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,090
along I'll have a little bit of fun

23
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,440
today first we're going to go check on

24
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,530
the goats get a little bit of work done

25
00:00:43,440 --> 00:01:01,330
all right

26
00:00:44,530 --> 00:01:01,330
[Music]

27
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,530
so first thing we're gonna do is head up

28
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:08,320
to the goat pin where I'm gonna need

29
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:10,690
this pitchfork I'll show you why I need

30
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,820
the pitchfork I've got an issue and

31
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:15,310
we're gonna solve this issue probably in

32
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,570
one of the next few vlogs and I'll take

33
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,160
you up there and I'll show you what the

34
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:19,720
biggest issue is it's easier if I can

35
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:23,110
show you let's go have some play that's

36
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:27,340
one thing about golden our golden hour

37
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:30,070
doesn't last very long and the grass is

38
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:32,859
really coming in nice the Sun it's

39
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:35,570
beautiful man look at that

40
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:37,759
this is all the new ground the new grass

41
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:40,070
that we sowed this year it's coming in

42
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,920
nice and thick we saw this last

43
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:46,640
September and this is some of the debris

44
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:49,789
that's fallen from the windstorm so over

45
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,159
the past two days here we've had bad bad

46
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:54,709
winds the East Coast is experiencing

47
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,500
what they call a nor Easter and that's

48
00:01:54,709 --> 00:02:00,109
pushing a lot of wind a lot of cold wind

49
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,880
off the coast right to us and it's

50
00:02:00,109 --> 00:02:03,859
knocking trees down so we had a fire

51
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,270
yesterday my neighbor called me up he

52
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:07,459
said hey man you know your fields on

53
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:09,860
fire I said what let's feed the goats so

54
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:12,590
here's the goat feed and here's the

55
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:15,590
goats I am getting ready to start

56
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:16,880
relocating the goats in this area right

57
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:19,640
here and basically we're going to move

58
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:29,030
them from plot to plot to plot all

59
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:30,140
throughout this field hay goatees so

60
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,790
let's talk to you a little bit about the

61
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:34,280
problem that I'm having up at the goat

62
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:36,680
pen I put round bales in the goat pin

63
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,989
for the goats to eat and this is what

64
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,970
happens to them they get climbed all

65
00:02:38,989 --> 00:02:43,819
over and they eventually just get kind

66
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:47,420
of spread out there all over the field

67
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:49,099
the pasture here and they bind up the

68
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,930
fence with it also so this is an

69
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:52,760
electric poultry net and that's what

70
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:54,349
keeps the goats in but it doesn't work

71
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,840
if it looks like this let me show you

72
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:58,940
the goats have spread out the hay all

73
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:02,480
the way up against the fence right in

74
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:03,950
here all the way down to here so we've

75
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,660
got to get that off I've got to get that

76
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:08,900
under control and we've got to find a

77
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:11,120
better way to feed our goats hey they're

78
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,799
just wasting hay they're just wasting it

79
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,450
they're spreading it out on the ground

80
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:16,459
which is good for the ground that's okay

81
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:17,630
but they're wasting hay and I'm gonna

82
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:20,000
take you over here and I'll show you

83
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:22,459
what my idea is this is an old tobacco

84
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,290
trailer used to haul tobacco I bought it

85
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:27,709
from a guy a few years back and I built

86
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:28,519
a mobile chicken coop a egg mobile out

87
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:30,650
of this thing

88
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:32,720
well I've built the egg mobile a little

89
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:35,150
bit too top-heavy and it nearly turned

90
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,099
me and the Gator over so we had to

91
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:39,500
rethink what we were doing and we took

92
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:41,540
off the chicken coop and reuse the

93
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,310
materials when we built our chicken coop

94
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:45,680
down by the garden so my thought is to

95
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:46,730
convert this to the goat mobile the goat

96
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,530
mobile will

97
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:50,569
about the farm with the goats and the

98
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:52,099
goats will go up inside of it I'll feed

99
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:53,510
them inside of it so when I get ready to

100
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:55,580
move them I can just close the door and

101
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:57,230
move the goats and I also want to rig up

102
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:59,209
an apparatus probably on the front here

103
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:00,980
that keeps the hay bale up off the

104
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:02,810
ground where the goats have to reach up

105
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,370
and eat that's going to make for some

106
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,080
fun times on the Stoney Ridge farmer

107
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,640
channel building this thing we'll call

108
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,500
it the goat mobile you know I went

109
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,810
searching farm channels and looking for

110
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,190
ways to feed goats that you know they

111
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,540
didn't waste so much hay and there's

112
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:16,760
just not a lot of information out there

113
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:22,280
so I'm gonna put some info out there for

114
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:24,889
you guys I hurt my finger the other day

115
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,780
out this finger right here not my middle

116
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:29,150
finger but my ring finger on my right

117
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:32,120
hand I think I broke it on something the

118
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:34,039
other day kind of got twisted and it's

119
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,530
like you hear about the tiger that got a

120
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:38,750
thorn in his paw you just can't function

121
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:40,729
I just I'm having the hardest time

122
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:42,229
because I just want to work I want to be

123
00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:44,960
able to throw stuff and pick stuff up

124
00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:52,550
and this hand is really hindering that

125
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:54,440
it's a bummer as you can see it's a pain

126
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:56,539
in the butt hopefully having the goat

127
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,729
mobile and a place to keep the hay up

128
00:04:56,539 --> 00:04:59,870
off the ground will solve this problem I

129
00:04:58,729 --> 00:05:01,820
won't have to get in here and do this

130
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:03,560
anymore all right we got our chores done

131
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:05,900
with the goats we ride down here to the

132
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,490
shop at this unboxing done and get the

133
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,900
wheels off of this lawnmower at least

134
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,490
the plan is today to get the front

135
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,260
wheels off I think I'm gonna take the

136
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:14,150
back tires off and take them to the tire

137
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:15,470
shop a local tire shop here does a

138
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:17,630
pretty good work in and they don't

139
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:18,590
charge very much so we'll take the tires

140
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:20,030
to the tire shop

141
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:21,200
have them go through make sure they

142
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:22,490
don't have any leaks and if they do

143
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,229
we'll have them put patches in the

144
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:26,330
inside of the tire and do it right that

145
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:28,099
way I'm not filling up tires all summer

146
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:29,389
long that's a pain in the butt I don't

147
00:05:28,099 --> 00:05:30,440
know if you guys have ever experienced

148
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:32,840
that if you've ever experienced that

149
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,400
post me a comment guys I asked you click

150
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,900
that like button right now go down there

151
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,830
click that like button tell me what

152
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,830
you're thinking all right

153
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:44,730
so we've been putting off this job

154
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:46,560
pretty much all winter long

155
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:48,750
I bought the inner-tubes last fall

156
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,180
because I was just so sick of filling up

157
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,380
the tires on the lawnmower and I'll show

158
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,640
you over here they're probably already

159
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,280
flat again I just filled them up

160
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,450
yesterday yeah you can see that one

161
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,540
there it's going flat

162
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:02,220
and this one here is just it's just mush

163
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,660
first thing we got to do is sweep up

164
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,250
this area so we got a nice clean place

165
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,790
to work nobody wants to work in a big

166
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,790
pile of dirt

167
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:17,310
shop owners best friend right there so

168
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:20,600
much easier to sweep up your mess one of

169
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:23,160
these little handheld jobs like that

170
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,750
so one bad thing about a zero-turn the

171
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:28,320
large zero turn like this this is a

172
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:30,540
commercial john deere 777 you really

173
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:32,910
can't move it unless you start it so I

174
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:34,650
really hate to start an engine like this

175
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:36,810
and let it run for fifteen seconds and

176
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:38,760
back up it just seems to me it's doing

177
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:40,410
more harm than good but we got to get it

178
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,980
into the middle of the shop so we can

179
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,980
work on it

180
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:49,860
but the nice thing about having a zero

181
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,000
return is you can whip it around in a

182
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,710
little bitty tight spot

183
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,540
let me show you what we've got to do the

184
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:56,460
front tires on the zero turn come off a

185
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,900
little bit different than you know then

186
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,820
your normal tire let me show you

187
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,620
so what I'll have to do is jack it up

188
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,930
from this point right here and slip a

189
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:06,690
jack stand in right here and we

190
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:08,669
basically unbolt this bolt and the wheel

191
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:12,210
should come right off and you can see

192
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:14,490
that tyre is pretty much shot this one

193
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:16,320
this one holds air pretty good you know

194
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:18,240
the wheels are all kind of scrubby there

195
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,940
so we may do a little wheel restoration

196
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,979
we'll also just take this nut off and

197
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,470
remove it and we'll put jack stands

198
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:28,020
underneath here well fix these first and

199
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:29,880
then we'll take off the rears so the

200
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,590
rears have a pretty easy system you just

201
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:35,040
unbolt those four bolts and off comes

202
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:37,200
the wheel and I also write down 18 psi

203
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:39,120
so this is my piece of equipment it's

204
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,669
gonna be my piece of equipment until it

205
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,160
falls down dying and screaming it's

206
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:46,260
gonna go down in flames before I get rid

207
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,210
of it on my wheels I wrote down what the

208
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:50,100
PSI needs to be for the tires that way

209
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:52,500
I'm running the same tire pressure on

210
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:54,150
all four tires and I get a good even cut

211
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,710
so if you're really OCD like me

212
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:57,630
sometimes having a tire that's a

213
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:59,610
different pressure on one side a

214
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:01,289
lawnmower versus the other will cause

215
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:03,000
your cut to be off you know it'll cause

216
00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:04,830
you to get an uneven cut on your lawn

217
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,539
and make your lawn look like crap we

218
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:08,160
want our lawn to look like gold so

219
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:09,960
that's why I'm so obsessed with tire

220
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,940
pressure and getting these tires right

221
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,919
because I check the tire pressure before

222
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:15,090
I mow every time I always check the oil

223
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,950
and I always check the tire pressure

224
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:18,510
that way I don't make a mess what good

225
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,440
what all this work do if you went out

226
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,729
and mowed your yard and it looked like

227
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,250
crap when you got done so we're gonna

228
00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:26,729
use these little wimpy jack stands we'll

229
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:31,669
take our jack get our mower up off the

230
00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:33,539
ground here slide in our jack stands

231
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:36,450
we need to do a little manual

232
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:38,729
manipulation here there we go

233
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:40,229
pop that dude loose that suckers in

234
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:42,360
there I'm gonna have to get him a rubber

235
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:43,890
hammer and tap on it a little bit always

236
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,150
be careful if you're hammering on some

237
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,470
bolts or something like that that you

238
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,880
don't damage the threads if you're gonna

239
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:49,590
hammer on them so we're gonna get the

240
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:52,740
rubber deadblow hammer to knock this

241
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:54,810
thing out with deadblow every guy needs

242
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,190
a dead blow hammer in his toolbox I'll

243
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:57,180
post links to all the tools that I'm

244
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:59,040
using down below in the video

245
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,110
description if you see something in here

246
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,610
that you're thinking about getting

247
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:08,000
there'll be a link down below if you

248
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:15,950
think you need it it's down there man

249
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:19,770
pain in the butt put the wrench on it

250
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:20,370
come on out of there buddy nothing's

251
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:23,370
ever easy

252
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:24,810
I will now deploy the beater screwdriver

253
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:27,900
everybody needs a good beater

254
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:30,090
screwdriver nothing ever goes like it

255
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,860
should so this thing should have just

256
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:33,810
slid right out it's rusty it's been

257
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,970
outsides head grass on it grass is

258
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:38,220
really acidic and grass is really really

259
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:39,870
hard on metal so when I get done with my

260
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,430
mower I normally try to blow it off the

261
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,110
best I can I'll take the leaf blower and

262
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:44,640
blow it off and then once every couple

263
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:46,560
weeks I'll take the air hose and blow it

264
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,660
off try to get all that old grass off

265
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,900
there especially wet grass don't use a

266
00:09:48,660 --> 00:10:01,290
water hose just blow it off Buster out

267
00:09:51,900 --> 00:10:05,670
of here come on Buster come on out of

268
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:09,660
there good lord you're making me look

269
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:14,010
bad I'm gonna knock it back and forth a

270
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:18,020
couple times see if that makes it slide

271
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:22,890
out a little easier of course it doesn't

272
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:25,100
good gracious I'm gonna have to use the

273
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,100
feet

274
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:33,709
there we go that's what daddy likes

275
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:37,620
there we go

276
00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:39,180
see all that crusty rustiness we'll

277
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:42,149
clean that up before we put it back on

278
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:45,029
all right so here's our wheel entire

279
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:48,269
assembly has two little grease caps on

280
00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:50,399
the ends right here that one and that

281
00:10:48,269 --> 00:10:53,040
one and those cover up the bearings

282
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,570
we'll set those to the side and we'll

283
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,010
look at our bearings our wheel bearings

284
00:10:54,570 --> 00:11:00,209
in here and make sure they're turning

285
00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:04,470
free you can tell here this one really

286
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:05,880
isn't turning that free this one yeah

287
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:07,529
they're both kind of gummed up my

288
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,910
inclination is to clean them up really

289
00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:10,529
good take the air hose and clean them up

290
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:12,449
really good maybe put a little bit of

291
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:15,810
oil in there what I did not know is

292
00:11:12,449 --> 00:11:19,110
there is a metal shim down in there

293
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:21,510
about that long like a tube down inside

294
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:24,240
this wheel so I'm gonna slide the bolt

295
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:27,870
back in here that's what it was all

296
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,639
hanging up on there so that's kind of

297
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:33,329
kind of work it back and forth here

298
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:34,800
trying to work that rest off anytime

299
00:11:33,329 --> 00:11:36,240
you're doing a job like this you might

300
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,829
as well try to do it right make sure

301
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,180
everything's functioning properly when

302
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:40,529
you put it back together I'm gonna rub

303
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:42,480
and clean on these bearings a little bit

304
00:11:40,529 --> 00:11:43,740
and put some white lithium grease on it

305
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,350
I think that's probably the right thing

306
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,940
to do if you guys are wondering the free

307
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:49,709
lawn mower that I got still on the back

308
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,269
of the hundred dollar truck we'll get

309
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,769
that off in the next day or so it's

310
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:54,720
supposed to be a rainy day coming up I

311
00:11:52,769 --> 00:11:56,850
want to get it off there bring it in the

312
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,010
shop here on a rainy day and take the

313
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:00,269
engine off of it first we got to make

314
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,680
sure it fires up so we'll throw a

315
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:03,660
battery on it and see if it fires up

316
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,910
there we go spinning pretty freely

317
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:07,860
they're not brand new and we don't

318
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:09,480
expect them to be brand new but they're

319
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,000
not making any kind of grinding noises

320
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,529
or anything so I'm okay with that

321
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,779
let me start by saying I've never done

322
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:19,110
this here's the inner tube the new tube

323
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:22,290
and appears to tire this is a tubeless

324
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:25,880
tire that's in it right now and I'm

325
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:28,649
really wondering how the valve stem

326
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:31,829
situation is gonna work out so we're

327
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:34,110
gonna go on and open our tube hopefully

328
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:37,500
this isn't beyond my scope of practice

329
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:38,130
okay cool so it has a metal valve stem

330
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:43,040
on the two

331
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:45,360
and this is a Carlile lawn and garden

332
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,149
trailer - but I think it's what it says

333
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:52,050
yeah lawn and garden trailer tube cool

334
00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:54,540
and the tire is a 13 by 6.5 once again

335
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:57,240
I'm not done this before I have a tire

336
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:59,069
removal tool basically for a mountain

337
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:02,699
bike and I'm gonna try to get in here

338
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:04,589
and wedge the tool in and ring it around

339
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:06,690
and pull that tool that tire back to the

340
00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:09,420
side and then I'll slide the tube in and

341
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:10,920
put the valve stem through hopefully

342
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,389
that'll be good I think the first step

343
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,769
in this should be removing the valve

344
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:15,769
stem good lord

345
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:21,120
right now some of your Pro tire guys are

346
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:23,759
laughing at me I probably need to cut

347
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:31,940
this don't I yep so we'll give it a

348
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:35,000
little bit of a slice here razor knife

349
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:38,639
that suckers tough it's got metal in it

350
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,009
so basically you have to I'll show

351
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:43,380
you here you basically have to take your

352
00:13:41,009 --> 00:13:45,540
valve stem and it over like that

353
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:47,600
and then cut right in there and that's

354
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:50,819
what I'm gonna do right here and that'll

355
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,529
get that valve stem to where I can

356
00:13:50,819 --> 00:13:54,750
remove it man having this messed up

357
00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:56,880
finger makes everything a pain in the

358
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,949
butt every time I bump it on something

359
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,829
it hurts cuz I'm a big wuss and that's

360
00:13:58,949 --> 00:14:04,470
how I roll good lord that's some good

361
00:14:01,829 --> 00:14:06,240
rubber on there yeah there it is that's

362
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:08,189
what it looks like we'll get rid of that

363
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,680
throw him in the trash can over here

364
00:14:08,189 --> 00:14:12,870
inside the tire is now the little valve

365
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,600
stem okay so we know when we pop our

366
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:17,910
tire off with our tire tool which

367
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,920
hopefully works we know that we've got

368
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:21,509
to get that valve stem a little rubber

369
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,949
piece out of there or that's going to be

370
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:25,620
a potential hazard we're going to take

371
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:28,980
the tire off the rim on the valve stem

372
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:31,399
side about me a tire changing tool to

373
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,399
get it off

374
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:42,260
ladies and gentlemen huh this is beyond

375
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:43,610
what I can do in this shop I'm just

376
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:45,620
going to pull off four wheels

377
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:47,750
this is beyond what I can do I'm gonna

378
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:49,250
pull all four wheels make sure all the

379
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:52,820
bearings are okay all the bearings are

380
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:54,080
good but uh this is beyond what I can do

381
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:58,120
I'm gonna have to take it to the tire

382
00:14:54,080 --> 00:15:01,670
shop that that thing right there is

383
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:03,590
really it has a huge lip on it and it's

384
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:06,470
a really really stout tire you know this

385
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:08,150
is a commercial mower so it may be best

386
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:11,060
that I have them put air in the tire and

387
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:13,460
fix up the rim I'd like to take the

388
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:15,650
wheel all the way off scrape it clean

389
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:17,840
with a wire brush or a wire wheel and

390
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:20,810
make sure it seats really well the

391
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:23,900
problem with this is that the wheel is

392
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:26,390
rusting right in here and it's rusting

393
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:29,870
along the edge where the tire touches it

394
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:32,210
now once again my farm tractor tire

395
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:33,590
store knows how to deal with this stuff

396
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:35,480
and they'll hit it with a wire wheel and

397
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:37,310
be done they'll probably hit it with a

398
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,530
little bit of primer too it's a job for

399
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:41,450
another day that's a bummer you know

400
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:42,380
sometimes that works out that way well

401
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:44,360
let's get over here

402
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:46,070
and we'll set this tire and wheel down

403
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,450
we'll go ahead and pop off all the

404
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,010
wheels and tires and I'll get them all

405
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:50,780
cleaned up and ready to take to the tire

406
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:52,550
store make sure not only have any leaks

407
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:54,140
and that they'll hold air okay let's get

408
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:55,340
over here to the unboxing I want to show

409
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:57,380
you all the cool stuff that I got

410
00:15:55,340 --> 00:16:00,740
basically I just bought a box of goodies

411
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:02,690
that I need around the farm I bought my

412
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,280
favorite kind of overalls I bought two

413
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:06,530
different kinds of mounts to put on the

414
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:08,360
Gator and we'll try both of those mounts

415
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:10,340
they're like a hook type mount I'll show

416
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,830
you in a second and and we'll tell you

417
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:14,570
which one's the best so I think that's

418
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:16,490
what it's all about is learning what's

419
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,670
the best what works and what doesn't

420
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:19,040
work

421
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:20,150
so let's show you what we got my little

422
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,000
friend came to help me

423
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:24,470
you my friend shake my hand good girl

424
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,020
good girl

425
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:27,740
here's what we got this is a huge box

426
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:32,420
from Amazon

427
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:35,090
we bought double rhino clips for the

428
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:37,550
Gator and we'll put those on either in

429
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:40,580
the next vlog or in Monday or Tuesday

430
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:44,390
blog we'll put these on it's a clip

431
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:45,510
designed to hold two rifles or two

432
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:47,550
shovels or two

433
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:51,660
whatever I really want to start keeping

434
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:53,910
a rifle like kind of a beater rifle 22

435
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:56,040
or something on the Gator so in case we

436
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:59,690
run across a coyote we can take care of

437
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:02,700
business and the next thing is these

438
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:05,400
Copland mounts these are ratcheting

439
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:08,250
Rhino grips and we'll install these we

440
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:11,250
already have one of these on the Gator I

441
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:14,220
have been through five of these they

442
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:16,920
work really great until you bump into a

443
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:19,920
tree and they don't hold up so good

444
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:21,720
bumped into a tree heavy-duty magnets so

445
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,670
I have a steel building if you guys have

446
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,440
a steel building this that's what this

447
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:28,860
is is a steel building a steel structure

448
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:32,340
and in this box right here I bought two

449
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:33,930
boxes of them there are 40 pound magnets

450
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:36,000
I'll post links to all this stuff down

451
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:37,740
below and especially once we start

452
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,240
putting this stuff together I'll post

453
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,400
links on that these are heavy-duty

454
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,110
magnet hooks and they're really

455
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:46,790
heavy-duty because it's hard for me to

456
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:48,330
get them apart so basically they come

457
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:50,840
gosh almighty

458
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:53,520
things on there nothing's going right

459
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:55,890
alright so this is the little magnet and

460
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:59,910
it's a 40-pound magnet and it screws in

461
00:17:55,890 --> 00:18:01,350
to a little hook like that and I use

462
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:04,110
these all over the place here in the

463
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:04,740
shop so you can screw it in screws in

464
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:07,110
nice and tight

465
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:08,820
and you stick it on your metal building

466
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:10,350
so let me show you so I've got several

467
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,910
types of these this is a really really

468
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:13,860
heavy duty one I've got some locks

469
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:17,250
hanging in here this is one and I have a

470
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:20,700
gate opener on it and basically they

471
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:23,490
just stick on there like good gracious

472
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:25,410
let's do a comparison so I bought this

473
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:28,800
one on Amazon and I got this one at

474
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:31,680
Walmart I can whack that I can white

475
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:34,560
coat that one that one just falls off so

476
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:36,420
this is extremely stout and if you

477
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:39,180
wanted to you could probably put a

478
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:41,490
longer bolt in there so if you've got a

479
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:43,650
steel building like this these hooks are

480
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:45,630
indispensable you need to hang stuff up

481
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:47,880
hang your keys up or whatever these

482
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:49,770
Walmart brand or whatever brand these

483
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,500
are these little cheapies are not so

484
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:54,270
good so tried-and-true it's almost this

485
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,250
stout is that one right there so I'll

486
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:57,950
post a link down below

487
00:18:55,250 --> 00:19:00,139
gosh that thing's on there

488
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:02,510
they stick really really good they'll

489
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:04,639
hang 40 pounds a little tiny magnet this

490
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:07,220
thing's as big as a nickel and then a

491
00:19:04,639 --> 00:19:08,809
whole 40 pounds it's amazing so the last

492
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:10,519
thing that we ordered the last few

493
00:19:08,809 --> 00:19:12,139
things that we ordered is what we're

494
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:15,409
gonna be wearing throughout the summer

495
00:19:12,139 --> 00:19:18,409
while we work on the farm and that is

496
00:19:15,409 --> 00:19:21,049
overalls so these are the key brand

497
00:19:18,409 --> 00:19:23,360
overall and the style pocket that these

498
00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:24,889
have in them there's a snap pocket and

499
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,649
another snap pocket and a place for your

500
00:19:24,889 --> 00:19:28,970
pin and then I have the Liberty brand

501
00:19:27,649 --> 00:19:31,039
I'll show you the difference in the

502
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:34,549
Liberty brand pocket and the key brand

503
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:36,740
guys if you've never worn a set of

504
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:37,580
bibbed overalls you might think you look

505
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,590
like an idiot

506
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:42,019
you might feel like an idiot for the

507
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:43,850
first day or the first 15 minutes that

508
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:45,590
you wear them once you wear these things

509
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:48,679
around your farm and around your house

510
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:50,570
you'll realize how restrictive your belt

511
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:54,110
is on your belly

512
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:56,210
it basically constricts you in the

513
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,919
midsection of your body and makes you

514
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:59,899
have a gut they're really really

515
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,159
lightweight so if we get tired of me in

516
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:03,500
long pants we'll cut them off and make

517
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:06,740
some really sexy shorts and this is the

518
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:08,690
Liberty brand and the Liberty brand it

519
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:11,059
has a different feel to it it's more of

520
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:15,950
a I would say more of a country looking

521
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:18,200
brand and it has a bigger front pocket a

522
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:20,630
bigger front in it has a zipper pocket

523
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,220
here which is very very convenient whoop

524
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:23,450
you put your phone in there and your

525
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,370
phone won't get all dirty and dusty

526
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:28,309
which is very nice and you can feel it

527
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:31,429
vibrate on your chest and it also has

528
00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:34,460
the snap pocket with one big pocket in

529
00:20:31,429 --> 00:20:36,529
there and it also has a spot for your

530
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:38,000
pin it's kind of a toss-up between the

531
00:20:36,529 --> 00:20:39,320
Liberty and the key I'll tell you what I

532
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,029
think at the end of the summer or

533
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:43,159
sometime later on whether I like the key

534
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:45,200
or the Liberty better or what I have on

535
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:46,880
right here which is a Carhartt the only

536
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,590
problem with the Carhartt that I have is

537
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,850
this right here this is turning into a

538
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:51,380
clothing commercial it's not what I

539
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:52,970
wanted to do but what I want to tell you
