00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:08,360
Hello. So, Eric here. Today we came to

2
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:10,679
Co or is that the

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:14,320
Ou within the

4
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:17,039
Smurb for us to come and survey a new

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:20,080
field that one of our clients want to

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,680
put to uh use. After surveying it, we

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,000
will be able to choose the particular

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,000
crop. But key among them was to know the

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,880
history of the land what they've used it

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,439
for over a period of time where we are

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,760
going to source water of course to also

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,079
make sure the land belongs to them and

13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,079
thankfully they came to meet uh their

14
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,399
neighbors in order to make sure

15
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,320
everything align with each other and

16
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,480
also one of their threat even before we

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,840
start is cattle invasion. They usually

18
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:50,160
see a lot of cattle. The land has been

19
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:52,320
used from 2012 and then they went on a

20
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,680
pause cultivating some crop like

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,320
tomatoes, okra and what have you. And

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,120
you also do cava the farm owners are

23
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,159
here and then we have key trees like

24
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,840
palm tree one of them some few coconuts

25
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,280
about eight acres. So from here you

26
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,000
can't see all of them but just to give

27
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,840
you a very close shot and a good view

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,920
the land is good. We have some part that

29
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,640
is a little slopy and then some part

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,560
that is very flat when you go uphill.

31
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,720
The intention of course is to construct

32
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,439
a mini dam that will serve during the

33
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,040
dry season if possible. During the rainy

34
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,240
season we accumulate water and then

35
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,600
during the dry season will be

36
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,479
sustainable and surely we are able to uh

37
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,799
supply or prod produce throughout the

38
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:37,600
entire season. This is what we do. We

39
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,079
start with you from the word go. We come

40
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,320
to see the realities on ground. Then we

41
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,640
are able to prepare a well customized

42
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,640
budget for your case. And we always say

43
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,200

44
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,000

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,119

order to make your investment a good

49
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,680
deal for you. Thank you and see you
