1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,559
buster's top ram

2
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:17,920
so he's let all the boys out finn bar

3
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,920
and my three ram lambs

4
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,840
hello

5
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,480
it's a beautiful sunny day i'm setting

6
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,840
up the electric fence for the horses

7
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,840
so they're gonna have this field

8
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,760
i'm gonna bail graze them through this

9
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,280
field through the winter

10
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,280
you can see the electric fence there

11
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,680
so i'm gonna let them through gate one

12
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,600
of my primitive gates that are right

13
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,640
there

14
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,640
hey alfie you got left behind

15
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:24,960
yeah everybody else is gone

16
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,840
for arthritic alfie except he has

17
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,840
a good life here

18
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,200
his shoulders are arthritic

19
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:43,600
so he walks with a funny gait now

20
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,600
hey you alfie

21
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:50,159
brindle leaving me you good boy

22
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,159
he's an old man now

23
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,040
all your buddies have gone up over the

24
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,079
hill yeah i know

25
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,079
you're gonna go join them

26
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,600
you've chosen a lovely sunny spot cozy

27
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,600
and warm

28
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,680
now to let the horses through

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,680
who are anticipating it

30
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,400
you can see they're waiting they've

31
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,319
figured out

32
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,800
i'm gonna be letting them through here

33
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:26,400
this little gate

34
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,400
you can see there's the owl box

35
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,400
up in the oak tree one of them

36
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,840
okay girls and boy i'm gonna let you out

37
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:48,400
okay now it's very slippy

38
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,840
oh gosh i don't want to fall underneath

39
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,840
galloping horse's hooves

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,280
they're not going far because they only

41
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,319
they can only graze a bit of grass

42
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,800
at a time and that makes it last through

43
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:24,159
the winter

44
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,159
so they're already coming back

45
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:34,159
so they've got a good length of grazing

46
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,879
they're annoyed that they don't have as

47
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,879
far to gallop

48
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:48,319
maya come here come on you two

49
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:48,319
come on good girls come on

50
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,000
there's the rams

51
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,000
in the same field but they get to free

52
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,080
range

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,239
because the horses are heavier beasts so

54
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,439
we'll cut up the soil

55
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,920
so that's why they're only given

56
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,920
sections

57
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,519
snorting

58
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,959
good girl come on leave it leave it

59
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,639
leave it

60
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,639
good girl maya leave it

61
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,840
you're so thrilled with the new place to

62
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,360
graze

63
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:42,479
cutting it all up now ladies

64
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:45,440
inca no leave them be

65
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,040
so they'll only get a section at a time

66
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,199
just so they don't tear the whole field

67
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,199
up

68
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,280
piece by piece also having the horses

69
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,840
out gives the dug

70
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,840
dung beetles winter feeding

71
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:04,080
oh she's very frustrated she didn't get

72
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,080
more

73
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:12,880
inca leave it

74
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:16,400
come back here come here you bold pup

75
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:20,320
come on come here

76
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:25,840
you're bold no lee inca

77
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,840
leave them good girl come on

78
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,639
look at that gala rearing

79
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,880
definitely frustrated they can't get

80
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,240
more of a gallop in

81
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,160
but i also don't want them to burst

82
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,960
their lungs because they haven't had

83
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,000
the space for a real gallop and a horse

84
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,440
can

85
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,280
burst their lungs if they suddenly are

86
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:52,160
given too much space when they've been

87
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:54,320
confined for so long in small spaces

88
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:58,160
the weather's been miserable so it's

89
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,160
really been really really mucky out

90
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,800
which is why they've been confined in

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,800
small spaces

92
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,840
come down to your side in a minute okay

93
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:11,199
big fella

94
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:14,160
this is one of my more primitive

95
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,160
homemade gates

96
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,520
we're above the large trees and the line

97
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,039
of beech trees

98
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,880
this is the top field or what we call

99
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,479
the wind charger field

100
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,880
because there used to be a wind charger

101
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:30,160
right there that's how my mother

102
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,120
grew up with electricity and it used to

103
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,120
flicker

104
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:38,319
if the wind was not consistent

105
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,360
so they still had gas lights or kerosene

106
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:44,000
lights

107
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:46,240
so here's the first bale for the horses

108
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,600
and i'm gonna let them through and

109
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,880
hopefully they've had a little bit of a

110
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,919
gallop

111
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:55,280
hopefully they won't do a huge

112
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:58,800
secondary gallop um

113
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,639
actually no you know what i'm gonna wait

114
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,240
till later today

115
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,240
to let them down to this section

116
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,840
no

117
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,880
no i'm going to let them through now i'm

118
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,039
going to let them through now

119
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,639
because where they're grazing now will

120
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,160
over the winter months will become one

121
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,479
of the muckiest areas

122
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,280
so may as well let them into this green

123
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:29,360
there's plenty of grass

124
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:32,319
for them to eat in amongst the leaves

125
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,000
and then out there around the bale so

126
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,039
when the grass is gone they graze the

127
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,360
bale

128
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,599
then i put another bale and then that

129
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,360
next section

130
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,120
and then when that's gone i put another

131
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,840
bale here then there

132
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,240
then there and the next section there

133
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,360
there

134
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,800
there and that's how so that this end of

135
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,000
the field

136
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,080
will be growing grass again

137
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,400
and will be green by the time the horses

138
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:02,240
are in this section

139
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:04,080
so that's a form of bale grazing it

140
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,759
makes it so the dung beetles have food

141
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,759
through the winter those that are flying

142
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,160
about the winter dung beetles as sally

143
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:13,840
anne mentioned there are

144
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:17,599
and it also keeps the horses outside

145
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:20,000
and healthy and fed

146
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:22,240
so yeah i'm gonna let the horses through

147
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,240
now

148
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,580
come on

149
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,810
come on

150
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,810
[Music]

151
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:41,839
inca maya no

152
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,839
come on inca leave it

153
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,959
maya oh my lips are so cold and dry they

154
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,839
can't whistle

155
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:15,839
at a girl good girl good maya

156
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:23,760
clever pup never

157
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:26,959
yes you clever girl

158
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:29,279
so that's the beginning of

159
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,720
winter bale grazing for the horses and

160
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:34,320
how they help the farm

161
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:38,240
they'll manure that area the hay will

162
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:41,440
fertilize the area and seed the area

163
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:44,640
and i'll throw seed out there as well

164
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,640
to add to the diversity

165
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,720
and they're lovely and calm which is

166
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,640
good

167
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,760
so no lungs will get blown out that's

168
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:00,160
the scary thing with horses is

169
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,560
if they've been confined to barracks due

170
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,680
to the really mucky wet weather

171
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,320
and you let them out into a big space

172
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,519
they could gallop for glee and burst

173
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,360
their lungs

174
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:16,640
or burst along so it's always better to

175
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:19,839
let them out slowly yep here we go no

176
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,839
she's not going to jump the fence

177
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:33,839
maybe i spoke too soon maya

178
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,839
maya no maya good girl

179
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,839
well settle down no burst lungs today
