1
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:08,240
if the weather man is to be believed we

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,040
got a big ice and snow event coming so

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,080
we got a lot to do today to get ready

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,080
for it so let's get to

5
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:20,359
work got to do a little work on my uh

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,320
gate up here at the entrance to our

7
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:24,800
place cows have rubbed the toost

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,320
loosened it up got to drive it in a

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,080
little farther uh then I need to grease

10
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:34,640
the gate this gate the hinges need to be

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:37,800
greased every few months doesn't take

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,000
much this TST that the gate comes up

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,039
against during the night time when the

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,120
gaug is closed the cow's rub on it you

15
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:46,960
can see it's all loose needs to be

16
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,960
driven in a little

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,800
farther got this automatic gate opener

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,920
it's really handy but it's gotten a

19
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,039
little bit out of adjustment doesn't

20
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:03,000
quite close liks about 3 or 4 in so so

21
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:05,720
I'm going to make a couple of rounds

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,920
adjustment there and hopefully that'll

23
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,920
do

24
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:11,790
[Music]

25
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,880
it this Gate's been really handy because

26
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:22,360
the Cales don't respect the cattle guard

27
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,360
so I have to close this at night

28
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:30,040
time still needs a little bit more

29
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,759
adjustment

30
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:35,840
got to give it a couple more turns

31
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,840
didn't quite get it enough

32
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,920
there that's no better I guess we're

33
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,960
just going to have to leave it that way

34
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,640
or till I read the owner's manual and

35
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,119
figure out another way to do it we also

36
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,680
got the gate down here at the Creek

37
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:59,079
Place it needs to be greased as well a

38
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,840
little cold today so that grease is a

39
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:01,840
tad stiff

40
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,640
watch out pigs watch

41
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,959
out it's only the second day of

42
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,640
captivity and Roger has already learned

43
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,000
to eat and getting right in there with

44
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,000
the big

45
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,040
boys good back girls

46
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,480
lots of things to do today before the

47
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,760
expected winter storm arrives but extra

48
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:21,440
feeding is the order of the day at every

49
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,560
place I have several cows that are

50
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,720
really fat but this one right in front

51
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,959
of us right now

52
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:31,680
578 one of the reasons she's so fat is

53
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:35,959
ever since I've had she has sucked other

54
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,920
cows after they've had a calf and most

55
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:40,560
people would get rid of her but she

56
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,319
doesn't seem to get enough to hurt the

57
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,560
Cales so I just keep her but that's why

58
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:48,640
she's so fat I'm feeding these cows hay

59
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,159
every other day till the weather gets

60
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,159
bad it's supposed to get bad this

61
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:55,519
weekend and stay bad for a week so it's

62
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,480
pretty soon I'll have to start feeding

63
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,400
them hay every day but I'm trying to

64
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,760
stretch that out as long as I can and as

65
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,640
you can see the cows are in really good

66
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,280
shape so they don't need a lot of extra

67
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,079
feed right now but probably as the

68
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,360
weather gets bad next week they'll start

69
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:11,340
getting hay every day just to give them

70
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:16,280
enough

71
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:18,639
[Music]

72
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:22,360
energy counted these cows and I'm

73
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:26,120
missing one so we got to go find

74
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:28,720
one and as I suspected it's The

75
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,759
Loner one with a dot in her face off

76
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,720
barell before I start feeding hay every

77
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,840
day I usually try to spread out cubes

78
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,600
right beside the hay that I fed

79
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,639
yesterday so that when they finish the

80
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:44,120
cubes hopefully they'll go clean up that

81
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,120
hay that they haven't quite cleaned

82
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,199
up got to wrap up this water Outlet out

83
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:55,320
here in the yard before the singled

84
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,960
digit temperatures occur these old

85
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,720
insulated coveralls were worned by both

86
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,520
of my sons when they were back on the

87
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,160
Farm but that's been 25 years ago I'm

88
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,840
pretty sure they won't fit either one of

89
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,680
them now so we'll just use them for

90
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,199
insulation now that really cold

91
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,880
weather's here I have to plug this

92
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,800
little feeding tractor in every morning

93
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,320
for an hour or two before it starts it

94
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,560
doesn't have glow plugs like my big

95
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,600
tractor so this helps it start a lot

96
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,600
easier on these cold

97
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:26,720
mornings winter used to be my favorite

98
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,120
season of the year on the farm I enjoy

99
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,759
feeding the cattle hay and watching the

100
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,000
the new baby be born I still like it but

101
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,560
the older I get the better I seem to

102
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,440
like spring and fall we're expecting a

103
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,800
big ice storm starting uh this afternoon

104
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:45,840
or tonight so the wind is out of the

105
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,880
East I'm going to spread this bail out

106
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,160
on the west side of this Timber so it's

107
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,639
a little bit warmer for them and then I

108
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,280
got to go up to the pond and check out

109
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,080
where I'm going to have to chop ice I

110
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,280
don't know since we've cleaned the pond

111
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,840
out so I got to take a look at it and

112
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,960
see what where I'm going to chop ice cuz

113
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,720
we're going to need to chop ice either

114
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,280
tomorrow morning or the morning after

115
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,280
Winter's

116
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,880
here you can tell a lot about what kind

117
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:17,400
of weather is in store by observing

118
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,319
livestock and as hungry as these cattle

119
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,560
seem today I believe that we're in for

120
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,120
falling weather and I'm not looking

121
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,120
forward to

122
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:32,840
it but if the cattle and the weather

123
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,639
forecasters are right at least it does

124
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,800
give me a chance today to get some of

125
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,240
the things set up for the Colder Weather

126
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,080
with the bail rings and Waters and

127
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,000
things like

128
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:45,919
that with this freezing rain and snow

129
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,360
coming I wanted to get the bail rings

130
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,599
out and get them set up because probably

131
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,599
if it gets really bad we'll have to put

132
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:56,160
some hay in the bail Rings instead of

133
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:56,160
unrolling it

134
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:05,360
got to find a place where it's going to

135
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:07,120
be deep enough to chop ice and the cows

136
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,440
look like they're used to coming here

137
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:13,360
but that doesn't

138
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,360
look very deep

139
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,840
there I think that'll work right here

140
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,840
though

141
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,759
maybe today before the storm arrives I'm

142
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,800
trying to unroll hay in places that'll

143
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:37,840
maybe be sheltered from the winter

144
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,919
weather a little bit the blowing uh wind

145
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,400
and snow and ice that we're expected to

146
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,759
get try to put the hay along these tree

147
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,400
lines and maybe protect it from the

148
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:51,660
weather a little bit more well Lou and I

149
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:54,889
both agree it's time to call it a day

150
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,889
