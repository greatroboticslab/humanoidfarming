  "text": "not tall enough for for this work for kids [Music] are you doing [Music] [Music] we're joined in that barrel [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] you're such a smuggle ahead our friends Jenner says hi he says you guys take away the attention from hi friends it's Jen at sunshine farm I just went outside I visited the animals even though it's super cold outside it made me feel a lot more at peace and it reminded me why we moved here in the first place so I wanted to tell you the story of how we were able to buy our farm at the ages of 22 and Chris who was 23 at the time we've had so many people come to our house and think I'm the daughter of somebody who lives here they'll say where are your mom and dad not here very California I've had somebody say you look too young to live here I had someone asked me did you inherit the farm and it's really interesting because I wish they would just ask me how are you able to buy a farm at such a young age because that's a question I can answer so I wanted to answer that for you today just like talking about our debt free journey this is a very personal journey and it's going to look very different depending on your circumstances which we all have such different circumstances but I want to encourage you that if you have a dream that you can try to make it happen and that there are in many ways things you can do now to start preparing for that dream to become a reality so in 2015 Chris and I had just gotten married and we purchased a little home in the city of Rochester the home was really cute it was a perfect size for us had a lot of character but it wasn't a very urban environment so we were very limited in what we could do in terms of homesteading we did start a little 4 by 6 raised bed and we grew a couple tomato plants a couple pepper plants and maybe a cucumber plant but I wasn't interested in gardening at that point the only thing I was really interested in was having my own horse around that time I started horseback riding again a local farm that actually isn't too far from where we are now and I just found that that experience was so peaceful for me and I felt like I found myself when I was on a horse near a so we had only been in our house for about eight or nine months when we started talking about the possibility of moving to a farm I have been experiencing some weird health issues that caused a lot of digestive problems nerve issues and muscle aches and pains headaches and just general depression and anxiety about what was going on with my body I started learning that the only way in my body was responding to healing was through my diet and through adopting a really heavy plant-based diet with a lot of natural foods fresh foods and really avoiding things like oils alcohol high levels of sugars and the biggest trigger for me I found out was bread I learned at that time that I actually have an intolerance to bread and wheat products so I unfortunately have to adopt a gluten-free diet as I was experiencing a lot of health issues I thought what are we waiting for life is so short I could have been diagnosed with something much more serious and I don't want to waste another minute dreaming instead of trying to find a way to make our dreams a reality I felt like we could do it now the reason I thought it was a possibility is because when we bought our first little house in the city we actually only knew that Chris would be working at the time he had a job lined up I wasn't sure what I was going to do next so we knew we could afford that little house on one income once I started working a full-time job even though I wasn't making a lot of money we were able to save almost my entire salary and put that towards what we used as a down payment and closing costs for our farm while we didn't get anything really back from our small house in the city just because we only lived there for a short period of time we were able to save really well because we were only living according to that one income that we had planned for so as our income grew and the money coming in grew we didn't up our cost of living we kept it the same and even we're tight in many instances so that we could save really well for this firm now I know a lot of people our age will spend their extra income on things like travel and going out to eat but I've always been a very frugal person I don't like to spend money and I really wanted my dream to come true so I was very determined to save well to save hard to make it possible now we were able to do this because we lived in a house where the mortgage and taxes was under $800 a month it was pretty low cost of living where we were because of that low cost of living and that unexpected extra income that allowed us to save a lot really in a short period of time to be able to move where we are now where we are now is more than double what we were paying when we are in that little house in the city it's a lot more expensive we're able to live out our dream here and to us it's worth it and over time through our debt free journey and as our incomes grow we will do the same thing we did when we lived in our previous home and we'll keep our expenses as close as possible to what they are now and even lower them where we can so that way we can pay off more of our debt quicker and and be able to experience that financial freedom it wasn't just saving for a year to move here there's that whole history of what allowed us to be able to buy our first home right after we got married in the first place I've actually saved my entire time through college and even some of my high school graduation money to be able to do something with the money I didn't really know what I was going to use it for but I I kept saving it wasn't until we got engaged and Chris and I were looking at rental properties that we just decided hey why can't we just buy a house why not we haven't old kind of this is what your life should look like you should rent an apartment you should save you should buy a house in a starter neighborhood I just didn't like that idea I don't like living according to an expectation just because it's an expectation for me if something's possible and it's what we want I'd like to try to find a way to make it happen at first my told Chris I wanted to move to a farm he was very skeptical he did not think we could afford it and he was concerned that I was dreaming a little too big a little too soon and that's fair but he let me dream and eventually my dream became his dream and he was willing to look a big reason we were able to buy this property it dropped down in price significantly before we even looked at it so we knew it was in our price range and then the second thing was the sellers were willing to contribute to the closing costs which they call seller concessions we had more flexibility in what we could put down and that enabled us to have some will for an emergency fund so we weren't completely housebroke I will say we did not put a lot down we only put 5% down on this house which is what allowed us to buy this farm I'm in our early 20s it takes a long time to save a good amount of money and while we could have lived in the city for a few more years and saved better I just felt like I didn't want to spend my years waiting for a dream to become realized we decided that we could financially do it and it meant we didn't have as much equity in our home right away but it was worth it to us to be able to start this dream early on what this means for us is that we don't have the flexibility to leave our jobs our cost of living with this farm is more expensive than we're able to take on with one income but we love love it here and we both enjoy our jobs somebody asked me how we learn to save well and my biggest tip would be just to really cut any extra expenses as you can and the second thing would be as your income increases keep your cost of living the same so that you can save anything extra that's coming in and then you'll end up with a lot more than you expected someone also asked what we do for a living that allows us to do this Chris is an energy engineer I work at a local university where I do project coordination both of our jobs are not high high earning positions we're not you know taking in a ton of money each month but we do have stable careers that we were able to get into because we went to four-year undergraduate institutions there are three more questions I wanted to answer in this video that my Instagram followers sent me the first one someone asked what our first project was here at the farm and that was adding chickens we bought a chicken coop and Chris built a chicken run and we added the chickens about at the same time we did add our miniature horse Justin and a couple months later we added TJ our Paint Horse I talked about this more in the video titled two years the farm and I will link this at the end another question someone asked is how much space we actually have we have 12 and a half acres here about six to seven acres our pasture a few acres our woods and then the rest is like front yard side yard and things like that someone else asked if we make sell stuff or find another way to bring an income for a farm no not at the moment and we're not making anything from the farm other than maybe four dollars here and there for free-range organic eggs but that's obviously not going to make a dent in the mortgage all of our income right now is coming from our two full-time jobs we do have Airbnb in our guest bedroom where we rent out our room and a bathroom which is right near the room on the weekends this is more popular in the summertime but I'm actually going to be having a photographer renting out the space this weekend so that brings in just a little over a hundred dollars every weekend that somebody rents it although we don't have it 50 weekend's out of the year we probably only have like 10 to 15 each year and you do have to take into account the cost of cleaning and we feed them breakfast so there are some other factors that go in there in that equation as well we do possibly have dreams of finding an old Airstream trailer renovate evading it and renting that out full-time I'm here on the property maybe building a cabin or doing something like that but those are lofty dreams and not in the media future another thing we took into consideration when buying a farm property was we didn't need a huge house our house is only 1700s square feet we weren't looking for something huge and that will really change what you can afford on top of that we were lucky with the timing of the market and what was available in this place had dropped significantly in price and so we did get a little bit lucky the house also hasn't been fully remodeled or anything like that we were willing to put some sweat equity into the home and make things our own we actually preferred that and that also allowed us to be able to buy this place my husband just got home what contribute to the conversation I'll ask you some questions and see what he has to say so that's the story of how we were able to buy our farm in our early 20s and I hope that can be helpful to you if you're dreaming of buying a farm and you're thinking it's so far off the future you can't even imagine being able to do it soon I do realize there are some situations in both of our lives that have given us a step-up tour making this dream come true and I don't want to ignore those but we also did have to make a lot of steps towards that on our own and those things are what allowed us to pursue this dream and also just being able to sacrifice other things like travel going out to eat a lot or fancy clothing we do make those sacrifices so we can live this farm life that I've always wanted and that Chris now really enjoys [Music] what did you think when I first told you I wanted to look at farm properties I was definitely confused and hesitant I think the confusion was because we had only been in our previous house for about a year and a half and then the hesitation is just my own natural reaction to any big idea or change it takes me a long time to come around do those things and to fully evaluate them and be comfortable with them so anytime I hear a big idea or a piece of news it's always throws me off a little bit how has this experience of living on a homestead made you more willing to live against the grain I think the wealth of opportunities and new things that we are somewhat forced to try but somewhat also we just want to try it out here that's kind of reshaped my worldview a little bit I think the so I think getting used to trying new things continuously it grows my comfort zone I don't know if I can point exactly to how things that my environment has changed but I know through this experience I have been much more willing to embrace adventures and great new experiences new projects I think is a confidence within me that's grown exponentially then from what it was previously that's kind of come that comes about in my confidence in my abilities to do the projects that we need together on the farm to build the structures and shelters to do the renovations in the house to take care of the animals and to venture out and get new animals we have a head before I'd say that my confidence is probably just growing a lot in the past two years that we lived here what are three things that helped us be able to purchase a farm in early 20s I think willingness to both the norm you saw that from the very beginning when we got married right out of college we also looked to purchase a house right away so I think we kind of have that mindset engrained into who we are and who we are as a couple and I think that was probably the biggest instigator to allowing us to make this jump I think really excuse me next day so by the second thing that helped us out the most was being able to save a lot when the first Hospital inning in so the first place we purchased it was not a very expensive house at least compared to you know the general market with across the country that allowed us to really save up a lot of our income and that just the short span over there a year and a half save up a lot of the income that both Jen and I were earning at the time and I don't know if we had a really clear goal or plan and how we were doing that it was just somewhat arbitrary and we knew that we were bringing in more than we actually needed to spend and so we were able to put a lot of it under the savings account and so as a result of that we were able to take that savings and jump into a new farm purchase just about a year after we got married and purchased the first house what is your favorite part about living on a farm my favorite part is the freedom that it brings about the freedom to make decisions to try new things to embrace what you want and to the freedom to buck the trends above the norms that society and our culture really tries to put on us and enforce us think the farm in that freedom it gives us a lot of flexibility and it allows us to explore a lot of things and there's something about that freedom that I think opens up our our lifestyle opens up our enjoyment of our lives just increases our satisfaction of our lives and of our marriage and the future as well raising kids I have a t-shirt on - who inspired so hot first fire of 2019 guys [Music] [Music] sorry the billeting got so crummy and now it's like all yellow we'll work on that but the last thing I wanted to say is that neither Chris nor I had any experience of farming going into this we had never had chickens we didn't have families that had farms I had ridden horses but I'd never owned a horse and cared for a horse we had never had goats we didn't have a lot of experience working with a barn or really any big renovation projects so a lot of this has been learning as we go and thanks to YouTube Google and some other great resources it hasn't been that bad so if you're dreaming of doing this but you feel like you wouldn't even know where to start we'd love to answer questions and help guide you in that process reaches reach out send us an email comment below and we'd love to connect with you thank you guys for watching this video we hope you enjoyed hearing a little bit about
