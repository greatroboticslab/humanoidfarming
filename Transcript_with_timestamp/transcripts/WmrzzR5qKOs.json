this year the warehouse 300 feet long and\nwith a capacity of more than 40,000 bushels was recently built to\naccommodate the increasing volume when I met you a moment ago I knew you were\nhere to find out the house why of hybrid car and how and why issues will put more\nmoney in your pocket but before we see what has been done with hybrid corn\nlet's take a look at a field of open pollinated corn\nI think you'll recognize maybe we can refresh your memory about the false and\nthe flaws of open pollinated torn anywhere in the Corn Belt fields of open\npollinated corn greet the eye this one isn't a bad feel in fact it's pretty\ngood but it won't bear close inspection garstin Thomas have thousands of\nvisitors every fall to insist upon seeing the difference between open\npollinated corns and pioneer hi-bred corn no worse than the average field yet\nthere's a decided lack of stiffness here which is notably present in the hybrid\nfield your to visit later you will observe a general lack of stiffness and\nstyle looks like the cows have been in the corn there's an appearance of sagginess due\nmostly to fall in stocks stocks that break before the ears mature cause\nchappy and rotten ears not sound corn and not conducive to large yields the stocks upon which these ears were\nproduced went down early with resultant rottenness of the ear limber stocks are\neasily blown down that are difficult to pick either by hand or by machine\nwhen the wind is accompanied by rain the fallen stock attempts to come up again\nand in so doing forms a gooseneck another reason for stocks falling is a\npoor weak root system a typical fault of open pollinated corn later you will\ncontrast this root with the heavy pioneer hi-bred root the lack of\nuniformity in plaintive ears of open pollinated form slows down picking\nmaterially for this reason corn picking contests are practically always held in\nhigh bred fields where the contestants show to the greatest advantage the\nuneven position of ears seen here does not permit rapid or efficient Huskie\nanother fault of open pollinated corn is the fact that the ears themselves drop\noff so easily on windy days a mechanical corn picker can't pick up\nthese ears a human corn pickers doesn't like to after the corn picker has been through\nthe open-pollinated field the job of picking up volunteers yet remains this\nextra task is wholly unnecessary in the pioneer hi-bred fields which you'll soon\nsee 10% of the corn was left on the ground too much to leave but a lot of\nwork to get and here's what you finally do get on you know form size shape and\nquality reason for the lack of uniformity and figure in the field that\nwe've just looked at is that you don't know which pollen grains pollinated each\nseparate pound in other words you don't know who the daddy was no one would be\nso foolish as to try to improve livestock without selecting the finest\nsire the we didn't you get a prize-winning bull or a good boar is\nbecause some breeder has selected his grandparents with the greatest of care\nnow let's take a look at a field of Pioneer hybrid corn where we do know the\nfather from the grandfather in fact we know all of the ancestry for ten\ngenerations back the cloud gets larger you know what they say about building a\nbetter mousetrap this is daily routine during harvest time at the garstin\nThomas plant in Coon Rapids where visitors are welcome seeing is believing\nhere's an example of what plan Deere hybrid seed corn will do for you there's an ear on every stock the ears\nare at a uniform height and the stops are standing up stiff straight and\nstrong and the ears will bear plenty of inspection to again the uniformity of\nheight is extremely noticeable product of two adjacent hills three emphasizes\nthe uniformity of the ears for size type and quality they're a noonday meal for\nany horse pioneer produces corn of real quality it's good feed and it markets at\ntop prices what all of you who've marveled at 100 bushels per acre yields\nyou're now seeing 110 bushels to the acre what do you think of this\nneighborhood of healthy ears called the gold coast by one visitor 110 bushels to\nthe acre means eighty eight hundred pounds of ear corn it takes sturdy stops\nto hold up this kind of a crop how beautifully they stand we can even see\nangle wise or crosswise through the corn field take a look down that aisle a\npathway to prosperity and what's more the ears don't fall off\nwhen the wind blows remember how easily they fill in the\nother fields smoke that one in your pipe mr. corn can't stand up without a root\nsystem either go ahead pull it out it can be done but it takes plenty of help these roots go down where the plants\ngrooving Morse your arms they oughta produce coins they've had\nplenty of opportunity to absorb a lot of nourishment from the soil and they did\nproduce a lot of corn roots tell a lot of the story of pioneer hi-bred corn\nwhich one of these two roots do you think has the best chance to get down\nwhere the moisture in plant food are which one will hold the stock the\nstraightest a pioneer hi-bred root is four times as large the mechanical\nquantico also gets a real chance to do a good job in hybrid corn sooner or later\nall farmers will be using the corn thicker the heavy root system sturdy\nstraight stops and strong shanks of Pioneer hybrids are well adapted to\nmechanical for kicking this is corn raising reduced to a science in a few\nminutes that wagon will be back full of corn from four rows seventy rods long when picking corn by hands or\nmechanically how convenient it is to find the ear at a uniform height on\nevery stop there aren't two inches difference in the height of ears just to\nshow that these individual hills aren't unusual for this pioneer field\nlet's pick three consecutive hills how uniform they are in height found nicely\nthey break out and what fun to pick these golden ears\nand man what a profit three adjacent Hills nine big fine quality ears harder\nto hold them to husk over here the convict has already made one round 70\nrods long and here's the tape hold on there old boy over then we can't\nblame you at that they'd never believe you're back home if you didn't have some\ncorn to back it up and over in the corner of the field the loaded wagons\nare done the coin elevated on the waiting trucks and headed for the\nprocessing plant in one day three men with a corn picker have picked two\nthousand bushels from 19 acres of land and loaded it onto the trucks again we\nrepeat barn-raising reduced to a science and so to town it goes while we spring\nalong behind let's glance at the field that was\npicked with the sturdy straight pollen rows left standing the corn from these\npollen rows is never used for seed but is later picked and fed you",
