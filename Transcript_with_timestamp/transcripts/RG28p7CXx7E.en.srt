1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,280
Good day everyone. We're just going to

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:08,920
have a bit of a general clean up around

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:11,440
here on this chilly, wet autumn

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:14,719
day. Well, it's not, is it? It's quite

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,240
warm, actually. Blue skies, no rain.

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,400
It's still time to get some of the

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,080
plants cleaned up a bit, some of the

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,039
plants out cuz their crops have

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,320
finished, and some new ones in. So, what

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,240
are we going to do today? We're going to

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,080
clean up the mint. We're going to get

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,160
rid of our eggplant which is past it

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,360
used by date and replace it with

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,600
carrots. And the reason for that I shall

15
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:38,440
explain. Now mint goes a bit funny. This

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,360
is actually apple mint I think from

17
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:44,399
memory that I grew from seed. We're just

18
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,399
going to cut all the dead stuff

19
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,680
off. Doesn't need a new basket at some

20
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:56,239
point. You can tell if it's apple mint

21
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,719
by the smell.

22
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:01,039
Zapple mint. Going to take every dead

23
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,039
bit

24
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:13,280
off. And if you look

25
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,119
here, we've got some lovely new growth.

26
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,119
So, this should come good, ready for

27
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,400
next summer when we'll have some more

28
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,479
apple mint. But I will put it in a new

29
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,080
basket. These aren't very good.

30
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,560
they start to collapse and all the water

31
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,000
comes out. We got the same sort of issue

32
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,799
with our strawberries. So, we'll just

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,840
cut some of the dead stuff off

34
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,079
there. I'll cut some of this dead stuff

35
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,000
off,

36
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:39,759
too. Get around the other side later.

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,680
But we still got some living things on

38
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:47,240
there, but we need to just trim it back

39
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,240
for the cold weather.

40
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,119
There we go. Not looking healthy, but he

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,920
should come back. We pulled out our

42
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:05,520
eggplant from this bed here. As I

43
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,920
mentioned, there's something about

44
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,720
putting things in this eggplant bed.

45
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,599
Eggplant is quite a hungry feeder. So,

46
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,319
there's not going to be a lot of

47
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,400
nutrients in this in this bed. And it's

48
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,000
quite sandy. Not a lot of organic matter

49
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,920
either.

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,840
But guess what? That's great for

51
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,040
carrots. So, I'm going to nip out and

52
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,280
grab some more carrot seeds. We're going

53
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,800
to just make a little bit of carrots up

54
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,040
here. Probably just some fairly standard

55
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,080
ones or the rainbow ones if they've got

56
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,080
them. And hopefully couple months time

57
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,959
we'll have lots more fresh carrots. Got

58
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,959
a few up the back, but need more. This

59
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,000
one here I think I need to clean out as

60
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,000
well cuz I don't think there's anything

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,400
growing in it. Used to have cucumbers.

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,560
Still got the garlic chives, but that's

63
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,840
about it. Uh, so what I'm thinking is

64
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,760
I'll build that up just a fraction with

65
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,239
some piggy past and we'll put some

66
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,080
beetroot in that one. And I've got an

67
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,640
empty pot over here which I'm going to

68
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,440
put one of my new trees in. So hang

69
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,720
about and we'll see how we get that lot

70
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:05,760
done. So what I've got from Dy's nursery

71
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,800
um cuz I just wanted to try it. Is a

72
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,120
black pepper tree. Not quite sure how

73
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,480
big this is. There we go. Gets to 2 to 5

74
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,599
meters but by being in a pot we should

75
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,560
be able to keep it down to a couple of

76
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,440
meters. It's

77
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,200
self-pollinating. The reason I wanted to

78
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,360
try pepper is I used to spend a lot of

79
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,040
time in Sri Lanka working.

80
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,760
And the pepper they grow there is

81
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,840
absolutely superb. It is very different

82
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,920
to what we buy locally if you're just

83
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,959
buying the cheap peppercorns. And I want

84
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:38,360
to see if growing my own will be any

85
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,720
good. So, he's going to go over in that

86
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,640
pot. We're going to clean this fell out

87
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,159
except for our garlic chives. Might grab

88
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,120
some of the seeds though. So, we're

89
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,720
going to put some beetroot in there, not

90
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:51,080
carrots. And I've just got some fairly

91
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:55,480
generic beetroot. There's a Detroit from

92
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:58,879
Elden. Uh more Detroit from Happy Valley

93
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,480
Seeds. Globe beetroot. More elder

94
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,120
beetroot. So, we'll just put some in

95
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,159
there. We'll plant them fairly closely

96
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,159
together uh and get them out as we need

97
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:11,560
them. get some baby beets and let some

98
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,920
of the others uh grow to full size for

99
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,959
pickling. All right, let's get that one

100
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,440
cleaned up. So, this is my garlic chive,

101
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,799
and I'm just going to grab a few seeds,

102
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,320
which I'll probably just give away cuz I

103
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,960
don't use that many garlic chives, and

104
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,840
this one will be good for what we need.

105
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,479
I'm ashamed to waste

106
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:34,120
them. So, we just rub those

107
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:34,120
off. There's a stink bug.

108
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,160
Just blow the light seed casings

109
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:52,000
off. And here we

110
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:54,400
have more garlic chive seeds than we

111
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,400
will ever

112
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:01,280
need. Let's go and put them away. We'll

113
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,280
come back and clear out that

114
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:08,199
bed. Okay. Okay. So, we're going to pop

115
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:12,240
this out. Use that for my

116
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:12,240
cucumbers. Said never throw anything

117
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,000
away. We got our piggy past, which is

118
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:22,680
the wonderful stuff. Put a really good

119
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,680
whack of it in there. Like so.

120
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,120
We're going to dig that

121
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:38,400
through. That is going to give lots of

122
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:41,039
organic matter to our beach fruit. What

123
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,240
I'll also do, I'll get some earthworm

124
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,240
casting since I've got so many of

125
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:51,800
them. Maybe we'll get some earthworms

126
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,800
active in here, too.

127
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:56,720
a

128
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,840
bulletproof a bulletproof garlic chise.

129
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,800
Yeah, I'll just get a bit of earthworm

130
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:03,479
castings. I actually might put some of

131
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:07,759
this where the carrots are going as

132
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:07,759
well, just to get some earthworms in

133
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,680
there. So, that's

134
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:17,199
plenty. Eggshells and all kinds of

135
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:20,280
goodies in there. Lots of volunteer

136
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:23,600
plants. So, probably from tomatoes

137
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:25,639
and capsicum and things that have been

138
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,520
composted in

139
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:29,520
there. That won't do any

140
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:36,000
harm. All right, that's nicely mixed in.

141
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,400
And what we're going to do, as I said,

142
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,400
we're going to

143
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,400
over

144
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:49,360
so and we'll thin them out when we need

145
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,520
them. Have some baby beads.

146
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,520
I

147
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,160
like how old that one

148
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:07,880
is. We might not use it. Do some for the

149
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,880
Aldi Detroit be

150
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,160
I said definitely over

151
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:39,440
[Music]

152
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,440
sewing. All

153
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,639
right, just about to cover them

154
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:51,599
up. We'll give them a water

155
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,599
in there. Some of my baby

156
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:57,280
earthworms.

157
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,759
Okay, that done. Let's get over the back

158
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,800
and get our pepper tree

159
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:04,199
in. This had my star fruit in it. Seed

160
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,639
that I grew from

161
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:12,240
seed. And as you can

162
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:14,879
see, it didn't make it. Oh well, we'll

163
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:18,599
try again. Let's dig in there. See what

164
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:22,400
we've got. We need to mon it as

165
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:22,400
well. That's not looking too

166
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,479
bad. All

167
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,919
right, dig that

168
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:45,200
through. Lovely stuff. It's piggy

169
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:45,200
post. All right, nice deep hole for

170
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:55,760
him. Come on. That's good

171
00:08:53,399 --> 00:09:00,519
boy. Don't want to disturb the roots too

172
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,519
much. So, we just pop him in.

173
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,120
We'll get some mulch and mulch it as

174
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:18,800
well. There we go. Need a bigger

175
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:21,080
steak. And another one. So, I'm going to

176
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,519
get something to tie him

177
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:27,560
up. All right. Need another one for over

178
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:30,519
there. Little bit of this nice soft

179
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:34,320
tie. Should hold him

180
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:34,320
there. That'll keep them

181
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:39,519
going. There we go. And we'll just let

182
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,120
them grow up there. Nip them off when

183
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:45,120
they get about six or seven feet

184
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:47,360
tall. 6 ft tall. They won't be able to

185
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:51,560
reach and try and turn it into a bit of

186
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:53,839
a bush. All right. It's clear up

187
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,600
here. All right. As we're tidying up a

188
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,120
little bit here, I'm not sure my

189
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,000
strawberries here have actually made it

190
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,480
through. So, I'm going to a little bit

191
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,040
of pe off in

192
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,040
these just over the

193
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:10,680
top. And that was a spearmint that

194
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:13,440
certainly didn't might come back next

195
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,880
year. We'll leave it and see. In the

196
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,160
meantime, I'm going to put some of my

197
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,680
various basil in here. Now, the basil,

198
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,760
even if we don't use it, will give a

199
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,680
really nice aroma around here and

200
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,920
attract some bees. So, generally just a

201
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:33,680
good thing to put

202
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:33,680
in. Right, I'm going to loosen that up a

203
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:43,600
bit. We'll pop

204
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,440
some cinnamon basil in here. Again,

205
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,839
using

206
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,839
my little bottom

207
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:52,839
press. Isn't that cute? I really like

208
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,839
those.

209
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,050
Pop a couple in

210
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:00,050
[Music]

211
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:06,720
here. Still hoping my strawberries will

212
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,959
come back in summer, but if they don't,

213
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,959
they

214
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:16,720
don't. One last thing I'll show

215
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:19,800
you. Bruce is no longer a growhouse at

216
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,800
the moment.

217
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:30,079
Bruce is full of mushrooms. So, I've got

218
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,000
up the top here, there's blue syggies in

219
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,959
buckets. It's my humidifier that I

220
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,399
bought. Down here, we've got some king

221
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,839
oyster that I'm not sure is going to

222
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,839
grow cuz that's from very old grain

223
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,079
spawn I got before Christmas, but I'm

224
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,079
giving it a bit of time. See if it does.

225
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,079
More blue veggies and leftovers just in

226
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:49,600
a small bag. So, this is the environment

227
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:52,079
I'm growing mushrooms in now. It has

228
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:55,519
heat mats there for when we need them,

229
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:57,360
but humidifier is the main thing. And

230
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,800
now that it's meant to be cooling down,

231
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,640
we might be able to grow mushrooms

232
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:06,640
again. Well, there we go. Just a little

233
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,640
bit of a cleanup, little bit of

234
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:11,440
planting, watering those beetroot seeds

235
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:18,600
in about ready for

236
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:21,040
carrots. water my pepper tree

237
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,639
in. So, what are you up to this autumn

238
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,079
if you're in the southern hemisphere?

239
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:28,560
What are you up to in spring if you're

240
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:30,639
not? Let me know in the comments. We got

241
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,440
lots more to do out here. Give you an

242
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:36,360
update later on. Enjoy life. I'll catch

243
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:40,040
you out here. Blue

244
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:44,160
skies. Nothing but blue

245
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,160
skies. Oh, I see.
