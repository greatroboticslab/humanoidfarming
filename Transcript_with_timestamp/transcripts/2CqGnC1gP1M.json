  "text": "[Applause] [Music] this particular lecture is going to be about subsistence strategies and now while this is a part of the economic system we're talking about it separately because because it conditions virtually every other social institution it's incredibly influential hopefully by the end of this lecture you'll understand why and particularly by the end of the quarter that will be totally clear to you there are four types of subsistance strategies there's foraging pastoralism horiculture and intensive agriculture we're going to break them down and look at them one by one fore is basically Hunting Fishing and Gathering so 85% of the food for foragers comes from resources that are available in nature for 90% of human history people were foragers today we only have about a quar of a million people forgers make their own tools now in anthropology we kind of refer to this as simple technology that's not a qualitative statement we're not trying to say that making your tools by hand is a bad thing it's just that there's not complex Machinery with all these various parts and so forth that you have to use to actually make the tools the reason for production is that we're going to share the resources in addition to using them for ourselves so it's a very communal mindset groups are egalitarian and what we mean by this in anthropology is not that everybody's totally equal when we do see any kind of status as a ranking in egalitarian societies it's usually based on age but egalitarian in an anthropological sense means that each individual has access to resources that they need to survive and additionally everybody's going to have the skills that they need to survive we see relatively small communities and that's so they don't take away or reduce all of the resources in a particular area Hunter hunters and gatherers foragers are highly mobile you will occasionally see foraging societies that are relatively sedentary or they stay in one place for long periods of time but the resources have to be incredibly rich for them to stay in one place for a long period of time we see high infant mortality and again this is because of the mobility Factor we have overlapping gender roles and what we mean here is that the division of labor often falls out by gender but again everybody has those skills they need to survive so if we have a group where men are predominantly the hunters women can also hunt if need be men can gather women can gather everybody can make tools everybody can make the appropriate clothing for their culture and the appropriate shelters so again it gets back to that equalitarian nature where everybody has the skills that they need to survive high degree of sustainability hunters and gatherers or again foragers could really go on for very very long periods of time if they're left alone unfortunately what's happening in the modern world world is that they're being relegated to Marginal areas so it's much much harder for them to survive so high but it is a high degree of sustainability we're going to use the Kung as an example and the Kung live in the Kalahari Desert they don't have a big migratory territory um vegetation is scattered um but they do move around to wherever they can find resources they use about a 100 species of animals with 50 of which they eat and they use over 150 species of plants where they eat over a 100 now if we look at the Kalahari Desert we just don't see a lot of plants but the Kung who live in it on a daily basis can really differentiate between different kinds of plants their favorite food is the m mongongo nut and it's very high in protein so in the times when they can't get a lot of meat that particular nut really serves them well the Kung eat their way out of areas so what we're talking about here that they eat all of the food they like first then they eat their less desirable food and once that's done then they leave so that the resources have time to regenerate so they're mobile when resources get low or sometimes they move seasonally so in dry season we see large camps of 20 to 40 people and they gather around permanent water sources so makes sense in the dry season in the rainy season we see much smaller camps maybe two to three families and they're scattered all over the landscape more resources around so they don't need to be bunched up together again High degree of mobility in foraging societies we see a low number of possessions because if you're Mo on the move a lot you don't want to haul a bunch of stuff around and again limited population growth division of labor in the Kong everybody gathers everybody hunts food is shared with all of the members of the group if there are any possessions those are shared among the group and there's very very little inequality the Kong reckon their kin relations on both sides which in anthropology we refer to as a bilateral system and when we get to family marriage and kinship we're going to go into that in more detail um one of the things about the Kung they do have contact with the quote modern world unquote so they're very quick to incorporate new technology and most of their contact with the more modern world comes with contact with agriculturalist um governmental officials and also Traders so that's basically a foraging Society",
