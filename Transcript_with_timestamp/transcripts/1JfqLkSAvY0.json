  "text": "[Music] watering your garden is one of the most basic tasks for a school gardener it can also be one of the most complicated and time-consuming tasks as well drip irrigation is a great watering system because it is more water efficient and time efficient than hand watering we talked to Sean from the governor's Island teaching garden to learn more about how to install a drip irrigation system all right so the drip irrigation system is it's pretty simple it has about five different parts to it and together what they'll do is allow you to irrigate your garden without having n water you'll save your time healthier for your plants it'll make you the envy of the school gardening community this kit that we have here a very simple one and it just has five parts to it there's a filter there's a pressure regulator there's an adapter there's a mainline and then there's the drip tape the first part of your drip irrigation system is your filter the filter either attaches to a garden hose or it attaches to a spigot the water coming out of your hose or out of your spigot probably has a little bit of sediment in it so what the filter does is it catches that fit that sediment has a little filter in there and it prevents it from going further down the system if that sediment continues into the drip irrigation it could block the emitters the next part of our drip irrigation kit is a pressure regulator it attaches to the filter and what the pressure regulator does is it ensures that there's not too much pressure in the rest of the drip irrigation system the next part of our system is the adapter it attaches to the pressure regulator it allows the pressure regulator in the filter to attach to the mainline attaching the adapter to the mainline it's pretty simple you just unscrew it press the main line and [Music] spirit back on what that does is make sure it's on they really tell you the next part of our system is the main line the main line doesn't have any emitters on it so the main line doesn't release any water it brings it to the garden bed that you want to water in a way you could think of it as kind of a hose the main line attaches to the drip tape and the drip tape has emitters on it this style of drip tape has emitters every 12 inches but but you can buy drip tape with emitters every six inches or every 18 inches attaching the drip tape to the mainline is very simple each kit has a different way of doing it but the kit we're using today it involves two steps first you want to punch a hole in the main line so I have this funny little tool what I do is I just press it into the main line make a hole you want to be careful that you don't press so hard that you punch a hole through the other side all right then you take this funny-looking connector piece and you insert it into the hole alright and then you take your drip tape and you attach it into the funny connector piece close it up that's on there tight not going anywhere and what that does is water will come through the mainline go through this connector piece into the drip tape and then the drip tape has emitters every six or twelve or eighteen inches and that water then will drip into your garden at the end of each piece of drip line you're gonna want to close off the end so different systems have different ways of doing that some systems will have you fold the end down and put a rubber band over it the system we're using today has you taken in piece just fit it into the end there and then you lock it shut you're also going to want to close off the end of your mainline so you take another a different type of in piece with this kit press it in you mock it and then this kid actually has a cap that goes on the end now your system is totally closed it's easy to adapt this setup if you need to have multiple main lines for example if you have garden beds on different sides of the spigot what you do is after the pressure regulator you can add a splitter piece the splitter piece screws in to the pressure regulator once your splitter is screwed in you can then add two different mainline pieces you attach the first and the second mainline pieces with the adapters in the kit you can direct your main lines around your burden and build out your system from there you can use a tee piece or an elbow piece to guide your mainline throughout your garden for example if you have sharp corners or if you want to irrigate multiple consecutive garden beds drip tape can be installed in rows or drilled in to the side of your garden bed your drip tape can be placed in a circle around the plants in your garden bed look online or at your nearest garden supply store to research the best drip irrigation kit for your garden [Music] you",
