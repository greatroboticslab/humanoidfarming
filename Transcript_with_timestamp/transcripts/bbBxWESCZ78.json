  "text": "[Music] right we're here at the hubmer family farm in blue arth County just south of Mano the hubmer is participate in the USDA conservation stewardship program which promotes sustainable farming practices they produce non-GMO crops which they feed to their birkshire Hogs and their Freer range chickens I'm Joel Jones with spnn and in this episode of Market we're going to find out what sustainable farming practices mean to the land the crops and the livestock hey Roger hello first we're going to look at our new building that we just put up this spring right on many years in the making this is a truck she takes to the farmers market nice big freezer got everything all indexed where the location of all the meat and everything is right now this is running 5 below zero in there so it's cold I guess so come on in these are the chickens here that we raise different sausages all brand new components so we're pretty happy should last for a long time looks pretty state-of-the-art I mean you're taking your fresh product and it's coming straight from the butcher into here and then we're getting it at the St Paul Farmers Market how about you show us some of the crops outside sure well we were losing quite a lot of money just selling pigs on the open market so we switched to the direct marketing this is so much more rewarding to sell to customers that can really appreciate the product that you have so Roger what is this Ridge tilling that you keep talking about well Ridge tilling is a type of tillage we use we don't use the mboard plow chisel plow field culator all we do is is we come in here I planted these soybeans I actually planted these soybeans right into standing residue if you can see here right here is where the old cornrow was a year ago and I planted it right into there well you look at all this residue now what's wrong with that residue why do we have to get rid of that residue and plow it under no need to run a big 300 horsepower tractor to to bury a residue I got it right there on top hols down the weeds keeps the moisture in which is real important in during this drought season here and eliminates erosion too because as the raindrops hit it it doesn't uh wash the soil away this ground this ground is so soft and mellow and uh we got it's full of earthworms in here they do all the ariation for me makes it very porous and absorbent for water I experimented with it the first year I did it the beans that I had on ridges yielded four bushel better than the conventionally uh raised beans does it take more expensive equipment less less less equipment here's here's my Ridge steel cator right here this is an Orman cator and uh here's our cator shovels that is kind of sunk in the ground and as you go through it it it cuts the weeds off plus as the dirts coming these ridges ridgers here throw the dirt across and that's that healing effect that I was telling you about and this this cter here cuts through that that trash residue as is going through there so it doesn't plug up these things here nobody's Cates anymore with all the Roundup chemicals that are available so I found this for basically the cost of scrap iron I paid $1,500 for this machine new I bet you it would be 25 to 30,000 so do you have to fertilize as much because of the way you're doing the ridge till no that's another nice thing about it too because we do what you call strip till or banding fertilizer we're going to come in there this fall and we're going to put our strip of fertilizer right where the corn is going to be planted next year and so that root is going to be right in the fertilizer instead of broadcasting it over the top and we can get by with about 50% of the fertilizer that way I also laid on a cover crop you can see some of this this was part of my cover crop this is vetch I planted rye and vet I spread a bunch of rye and vetch seed out here and then this spring I killed it it and planted these beans right into it and I don't think these beans look too bad considering we're going through one of the worst droughts we've ever been in good deal now this here this is our uh manure storage right here this is some of the manure that we scrape out of those gutters in there and it goes down the gutter and it comes out that tube there and now when we get our soybean crop off of here this will all go back in there so if the way I figure it out if I feed 150 bushels the corn to the Hogs that much manure goes back on the ground so whatever we take off the ground we put back on the ground farmers are the original recyclers Right comes out of the field goes into the bin goes through the Hogs goes into the pit goes back in the field that's a that's a recycling that's what we do so to get to where you are today it seems like you've had to do a lot of adapting and evolving yeah it's something new every day just dreaming things up uh um up in the yard I got a picture of the farm the way it used to look when it was first built in 1920 no trees no nothing and uh this was originally what it is and we've added to it in the last 92 years looks like you've maintained the foundation of the family farm but you've added so much more to it and involved and we really appreciate you letting us come out here and giving us an inside view of your land stewardship thank you so much Roger oh you're welcome [Music] what",
