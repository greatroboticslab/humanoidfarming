  "text": "[Music] okaywe I want to thank Sarah for giving us the grant to do this project a little bit of a spoiler alert a lot of it wasn't really successful but the whole thing is meant to be a learning experience right education is you know the last word in ser so this has been an education for us so Rebecca and I were on her family land she's a fourth generation farmer we're located in North Kansas City about 45 minutes this is our farm down there in the left corner we hit that's where our house is we have a barn with our packing room our certified kitchen we have a greenhouse passive solar we have one high tunnel we have two movable chicken coops we have a irrigation pond there with solar panels so this is kind of some of the details we met on a CSA farm back in 2001 Rebecca wanted to come back to her family farm and to you know improve it and to keep it from just becoming another lot of houses and so the CSA was really the model for us at our peak we were up around 100 close to 150 members for 31 weeks we have about five acres five and a half that's actually able to be cultivated over about a twenty acre area that we grow on this is some of our vegetables you know we have a diversified operation which is really nice model you know was been talking diversity is always good and for us you know we get to eat a diverse diet because we're growing all these things our CSA models participatory our members come out and they help with the harvest we have what's called a core group they help to manage the CSA that's the model of the farm where we met and it's just a great way to get oh you know the host of generations even from one family to come out and participate in agriculture this is our certified kitchen that we had built and right after it was completed 2016 we decided to kind of diversify our farming operations and to have a firm a team that's so that would mean we need to grow a lot of brassicas so we wanted to look at different ways to raise the brassicas without having to do a lot of mulching we're in our it's like our second year of of fermenting we like to say we have a kitchen without a stove in there it was a good model you know it's a low-energy type of value-added product you chop everything at room temperature the fermenting happens at room temperature and then you store the product back in the cooler until you need to jar it so we already have a cooler and we only we didn't need to have a stove or heat stuff up and we're on the shelves on a a handful of retail outlets in Kansas City area as well as selling to our members in a farmers market so our fertility plan everybody that's talking about soil it's gonna be pretty much the same thing and and like Jeff was saying you really need commitment so we make sure we feed the soil a diverse and balanced meal we try to amend every bet each year with some type of cover crop or we buy compost mineral Edition we now have two Lane flocks of about 7080 hens and they we fence in the yard fifty by a hundred feet you know we can leave them in an area for about two months and moving them around the farm so we can fertilize a good acre of land just with our our hens and we do like I said a lot of cover cropping you know we this is like our Sudan grass and cow peas or crota larrya so we have a flail mower normally what we would do is we would grow it we chop it down we have it's called a spade er it kind of digs that digs it in it helps it doesn't create the hard pan that like a tiller will so we call this our chewing step as we've been doing more and more farming we're trying to do this less you know not use the Spade or just to tilt stuff in but to mainly use it as a way to incorporate cover crops we incorporate them we also do a lot of hey this is compost from a company called Missouri organics they're local Kansas City company that's been growing and we were able to get truckloads of compost sometimes we'll use a you know a dry bag fertilizer we use for trel it's kind of handy at times if you want to add some fertility to a bed and it's kind of been out of the rotation or you haven't been able to time things properly and then here's our our hens we really like it when we can raise a cover crop and put the hens in and have them to eat the cover crop or we run them through our high tunnel in the spring after we're done with our extended season of the previous fall and spring they've been a great way to improve the fertility and the high tunnel you know they provide a lot of phosphorus don't the things you learn then realize what it is is that they don't really process phosphorus sowing the phosphorus and the feed kind of goes through them and it's where we are that's one of them are limiting nutrients is the phosphorus and so this has been our our results just using our farming practices as you can see I've been farming for 16 years I used to be an environmental engineer I used to do a lot of environmental sampling and analysis and treatment system design and monitoring so around 2004 I believe it was I decided well I should maybe plot our soil organic matter and it's been really instructive it shows that it bounced around between 2 and 3 percent for a long time and it actually kind of went down and then after 2008 it's it's been trending up and one of the things we're trying to do in promoting our CSA and promoting art ferments is to talk about that how the value that's in that and I think next door they're talking about how to quantify that value and I think that's important so for the cover crop project the idea was rather than mulching as you saw doing on our brassicas we were able to we've been able to raise cover crops historically raise cover crops roll it down and and plant into that so we were going to do that for cabbage cauliflower and broccoli and then we also have tomatoes that we wanted to do so we started out in 2014 actually 2013 is when we started by raising our crops the rive edge we dr. Ron Morris from Virginia Tech he was our Technical Assistant and so he helped us kind of helped us build the no-till planting aid and he gave us some advice so that's just a flail mower where we turned off the blades you know it's got a big heavy roller on it we're able to roll down the cover crops so this was like step 1 everything looked like it's gonna be perfect it rolled down really well was a real good mixer Ryan betch we were really happy the vet came back but you know that was fine we didn't care too much we mowed it down did that a couple times and it kind of disappeared and but then the weeds started so bindweed was a big issue where we were doing this turns out we had a heavy fine weed problem we had some other areas where we were doing it you know we're all in the grassland area in the middle of you know June July every seed of grass is going to start to come up no matter what and so in talking to dr. Morris you know we said you really need a stale seed bed if you're gonna do this you know his work was down at Virginia Tech kind of up in the mountains and it's really a whole different soil growing season and what's favored so all this was happening but we're thinking oh this is a test we need to kind of see what we can do so first thing we did is we took our farm throughout there and we weeded and kept track and I think it took you know eight hours worth of work just to do like this 40 foot stretch of two beds so you know got that on the record it's like okay hand weeding isn't gonna work and then we tried organic herbicides we're not certified organic but we follow NOP and we tried two different types of basically kind of you know citric acid type insecticide but all it does it just burns off the top growth that did nothing to stop the growth so we kind of had to abandon that we tried it again we'll talk about other attempts but basically you know we can get good stands to cover crops and they're easily rolled and crimped with the flail mower the the weed pressure and June and July it was significant so our cover crops are rolled down like the maybe the last week of May or so somewhere in there that's kind of typical from where we are we're not going to plan our brassicas we don't start them in the greenhouse until the first second week of June so that whole time period that rolled down is just sitting there and that's when all this weed pressure comes up I'll show you though what times where it's hard to do and like I said the weeding and the organic herbicides really weren't a solution so the next step was this no-till planting aid so you roll it down any ideas you can just cut furrows in the rolled down cover crop and then we were going to bring our transplant or through and have it spaced at that same two foot spacing and plant so at the beginning I thought all we had this whole piece of equipment laying around from what I can tell it all be we'll just be able to kind of see redo this well doctor Moore said those Coulter's were way too small once I put that toolbar on our tractor I realized it was a diamond pattern instead of a square pattern and I had bought a square clamp and so there were all sorts of you know just farm hack complications I hooked it all up to kind of see how it might look and the Coulter was so big that it wasn't long enough so we had to do we did an extension to put the fertilizer shoe on and then that still wasn't good enough so then we ended up putting a getting another piece of steel that extended the length of it so we could separate all those and so in the end we got it built and it worked well see it's a little tilt II there we got an old tractor but it would drag through and it would cut the furrow you'd have to watch about stuff kind of get snagged you know we kind of rigged that up so there'd be some things we would trim it up trim off to keep from snagging and you can kind of see there it the shovel went in there the fertilizer knife they cut a nice furrow so if we were going to come through with transplants we would have been able to do that so the no-till planting aid farm hacking was fine rather than buying a new one but if I had to do it again we'd probably go to equipment supplier and and try and fabricate it from new pieces of equipment it was really a great tool we may use it in the future too if there's a really wet period and we can't get in somewhere and we don't want to do any serious tilling we could always kind of maybe drag that through to create a planting row we held a couple feet field days - it was tough - time doing the roller crimping with our field days but we're able to to show some equipment at the same time that we were having our field days so 2015 was a seriously wet year so I know if you can read all this but from from May 5th until July 20th we had 35 inches of rain over 74 days and so it was just consistent I mean it was really bad that was the year I decided I was gonna start collecting records so I was kind of glad I did that it really showed this that's a year's worth the rain for us we even had a hailstorm one point through there right there in strawberry season and they just Rebecca said it looks like little fairy punches on the strawberries so kind of destroyed that you know we were trying to to still do things you know probably shouldn't have this is an example of this area had been I don't think we even really had a chance to roll it down or I might have tried rolling that down and it was just a mess so talk to Joan is like okay this year we're you know we're extending the whole project and that was fine so 2015 was kind of off the books another part of it was the cedar evaluation we were just gonna buy a regular grain drill you know it's one of those things everybody so you can buy them they're all over the place and I went looking over and over over again so we have like six foot beds six foot wide beds and you know I really wanted like you know get eight rows in that six foot eight nine rows and have something that's designed to put grain seed in the ground and just could not find anything anywhere used that size so we decided to do was to buy some vegetables Cedars and so these are for coal you know Planet jr. vegetable Cedars bought a new tool bar hook that up the idea was well we'll do like two passes and that'll be our cover crop so what we also do and normally we've always done in the past is to use a broadcast seeder and then come through with a Harrow we would mix our cover crops ahead of time and knock you late the legumes and then add the grain mix it up and then just spread it all together just one thing is an aside you know talking about sticking with game plans Jeff was and improving we have a Seine on our farm which is from a dr. Deming who was a quality engineer and proved constantly and forever so we're always doing that and was at a conference the PFI conference and you're talking about with cover crops having a more diverse mix you know if you have up to 8 see different seeds you may actually be able to plant and have stuff to even come up in the grout in a drought just the that diversity creates this communication that we still haven't learned about that makes the whole grow better so we like doing a mix of cover crop seeds you know it's pretty much legumes and grain Harrow it in so with the grass seed there with the the vegetable Cedars at first I was looking at putting just an individual like that's a vet seed and one hopper and then something else in the other then I'd have to calibrate them all because the vegetable planters don't say you know vet seed and in the end I decided to mix them so we could just okay everything's at hole 32 and and that's a good mix for for all this that's a little crooked but you can see we've pulled it across and you know we'd get decent I kind of wanted a little few more rows and stuff grew halfway decent and then later I went and just decided to ship them all the one side and go up and back because they were kind of going on top of each other they weren't quite staggering the way I want and with cover crops you know it's difficult to sometimes get them in at the same time you've kind of stale seed bedded so that was one of the big things that we need to work on more and more so this is Sudan grass and cow peas we did a couple as part of the study was to compare these two seeding methods and you know weigh the cover crop and see which works better so broadcast seeding versus the cold so in June that was more with a spring cover crop I believe would have been like oats and peas the the cedar did better 13 percent but then the the when it was done in the summer we actually better with the broadcast and I think the reason for that is because part of the broadcast seeding is a harrowing to put the seeds into the ground so depending on your timing of one you were able to get in there and cultivate that kind of last Harrow I think helped with keeping the weed pressure down so we haven't used the coal anymore but we got a new full-time farmer somebody's worked with us before and so we may go back to trying to use the tractor to do more of our seating because a consistent cover crop is is one of the things that we try to work with like last year didn't rain at all and if we didn't maybe he had better seed to soil contact somehow we might have had better germination of our cover crops there's just some more pictures of the cover crops so this was one where it worked well you can see that's cow peas and Sudan grass so it's something to still consider you may have other pieces of equipment that you can seed your cover crops with on your farm so makes a conclusions you can use a vegetable cedar I would blend seeds and just have one seed hole or whatever your equipment uses I couldn't quite get everything evenly spaced and then the harrowing isn't necessarily a bad thing to do so then in 2016 we tried it again and you can see what came up was mainly vets you know we we seeded this in the fall of 2015 and for some reason we've had this happen before the ride doesn't come up that well but the vet does but we still worked with it and rolled stuff down that's the flail mower we are able to get that as part of the project it's really nice to have a it's a good quality Alamo and we had some of the same problems with buying weed so it was kind of abandon it these are the same conclusions as the other one and then we just still had a lot of rain issues so one of the other things we were trying our no-till for tomatoes so with our CSA we raised Tomatoes and then we like to have a second planting just because the first one kind of dies off and doesn't do as well so we always have we have some summer heat set tomatoes that we use Bella roses a variety they're a caged tomato also a determinate so we don't have to do all the stringing you can raise them plant them put a cage around it and you know necessarily forget them but it there they take less care and they're more like a grocery store type tomato but if you leave them on the vine long enough and let them ripen you know using organic growing methods and improving your soil they do have some some good flavor and texture so the so that whole area had Ryan betch and so we rolled rolled stuff down and on one bed for the tomatoes and then the other one we tilled the cover crop in like we would normally do we tried to do that ahead of time and let it rest and then we came through and we planted our Tomatoes everything's at two foot spacing I think somewhere in here I see I think we had close to 50 Tomatoes per row and so the one on the Left we we get a lot of hay we're able to get hay from other farmland that Rebecca's hormones her family owns hey mulch and then on the right we did I believe somewhere in there at some point do a little bit of extra mulching but that's the role down cover crops so you can see that the mulch ones on the left they're a little more robust than the ones on the right and over time you know we didn't do a lot of weeding on the ones on the right we did some just to keep him away from the plants but the idea was to try and have it be a minimal care system and you can see that the ones that were in the cover crop that was turned under did better they they had nice fruit set and so here's the data so with the hay mulch we had almost three times the amount of tomatoes that we were able to harvest so their old print crops you know they help keep the weeds down during the early growth stage everything kind of got established pretty well but the baited and hay mulch beds gave us three times a year and you know thought with us is that maybe in a more mature no-till system that you might get better nutrient uptake but we feel that by by spading in you know all that veg and everything and kind of getting more of a mixing of the nutrients we're able to get more nutrients released and that's part of the reason why we got higher yield and so here's some costs that were associated with the project so the no-till planting aid you know doing kind of the farm hack and the likes cost us about eleven hundred bucks imagine if you did it from scratch it might be you know closer to two thousand dollars and then we got a use flail mower and then we had to we had about four thousand dollars figured in for the cedar and I thought I'd be able to find a used grain drill but we couldn't so that's what that took and that was all brand-new equipment and yeah I think that got plenty of time here for questions then that's pretty much it so you have some questions the question is how much horsepower it took to pull the no-till planting aid so that tractor that we were using that's Rebecca's grandfather's tractor it's a farm all 504 and it has about 45 horse and it so you know at least probably 20 horsepower per per Coulter and fertilizer shoe because it did you know you could definitely feel some drag on it but I don't know what the limits were so question was will we use a sweep to maybe undercut all the mulch and no we hadn't really thought about that I think the idea of the rolling down is that everything's kind of all attached and so we didn't really look at that we've been using sweeps more and more on the farm to reduce our tillage like we'll have our chickens run through an area and there will be next to nothing there but you can't quite plant so we will try and use a sweep just to break up the first inch so it's kind of more of a shallow tillage and then I don't know if I have a picture of it here so we have a Alice this was another field day in allis-chalmers G tractor it's a 1948 model tractor and there was another Sarah project long time ago Ron Colson in New York he electrified it so we have 48 volts on that tractor it's basically a golf cart size engine and we use that all the time you can see those are that's a cultivator on it right now the the G is belly-mounted implements so you can see what's going on one of the other things we do a lot with it as we use discs on this a lot so we have a tool bar that goes right out to the edge of where the wheels are and they're discs and so we'll drive along and it will basically make a raised bed now we have a lot of heavy soils we have less soil but then clay and glacial till not far underneath so when we get those heavy rains if we don't have our beds shaped all that water will just smear everything over but if the beds are shaped well water will at least run down the gutters and stay in the gutters and we'll have some nice fluffy soil on top so we are like I said we're moving as much as we can towards a more reduced tillage and mainly using our tillage to incorporate cover crop yeah we moved it to different areas yeah you know the one year with all the water some of the areas we were trying we weren't even able to do that with but yeah we have friends in Kansas City other farmers that do no-till and they have a lot of a lot of luck but they've actually gone to hogs right now to kind of go across their land because they have a perennial weed pressure so no-till doesn't have that issue but if you're able to build up you know more of the mycorrhizal fungi in the soil there may be a lot of the benefit to really doing as little disturbance as possible what was the planting death depth in the cedar with the those earth ways they pretty much just have this like shoe that hangs down and we didn't really adjust it too much as long as it would kind of cut an opening and then be able to drop the seed down the chute and then it has a little follower that that covers it up so yeah you know it probably wasn't much more than an inch to an inch and a half you know because it's a vegetable cedar so you're really not going too deep coal planet jr. yeah uh-huh yeah well you know we've kind of seen to that you know those they're not no-till cedar they don't really drill seed and so I may act different if we if you were doing an area that had been faded not too long ago you know so dependent on the the the soil condition what had previously happened question was what it's our cropping system so yeah we had 150 members CSA at this time to full-time apprentices and sometimes we have other farm help too and so we were farming close to five acres and with that every year we would try and like when the broccoli came out of production in the spring make sure we put down cover crops of a summer cover crop and then right now we scaled back so we're only growing about two to two and a half acres and in 2017 we cook took what we call sabbatical year we cut our CSA in half it's only every other week so we could concentrate on our fermenting business our business model the idea is to get back to the point where we're making the same amount of income half of its the CSA and then half of it is the ferments and we spend a lot of 2017 trying to stay all seed bed a lot of our beds so we had some areas we left them open and then we'd go through with like a sweep cultivator and and try and knock down the weeds just as they were we're starting and then depending on the time of year so our spring will plant either oats or barley with with field peas in the summer it tends to be sorghum Sudan grass with crota larrya or cow peas and then in the overwintering we do the ryebeck but then sometimes we also do oats and peas near the end of summer to have a cover crop that we can maybe turn in before winter so one thing we do just because we're vegetable farmers and you kind of a prepared bed in the spring to plant in will do a certain amount of cover cropping in the fall and then turn that under kind of as late as we can maybe the first week of October or spring and or fall cover cropping and so to actually be won't have anything planted in it over the summer or over the winter but then all that free stalling makes it like a perfect soil to plant in in the spring we got to see beets and carrots or do different things so and as you can see our organic matter has gone up so we feel that it shows that it's a it's a productive system as far as the soil and I say we try and turn it under right before winter so biological activity starts but a lot of that biomass is still in there so that it gets released a little bit more in the spring and summer yeah so you know it's it's a little inexact but it was just something more kind of a good-faith effort to demonstrate that our soil organic matter is going up so it's whatever samples we take in a year we have two different fields if you went back to like the first picture so the fields on the left over here there's what we call our home field they they tend to be drier in the spring and then we we call this our the pond field so we've gotten to the point where we're going back and forth now with soil samples and so that's kind of what the data is is just whatever we had for that year well you know we're growing for our ferments and for the CSA and because I had one thing that I'd like to try a little bit different with the cover crops is a more diverse mix you know it'll still be like a grain and a legume but maybe we'll do four types of seeds or five and I'm kind of looking more into that so they will do the croud alaria and the cow peas along with sorghum sand and grass and find some other warm season grain that might work and have like four or five different seeds that were planting at a time and just keep trying different things and with the chickens you know I said we we've gone more and more to as much reduced tillage as we can the chickens have really helped because they basically do a lot of tilling and so we can get in there and just shape beds and maybe just till the top inch so the more we can do that the better sunhemp yeah yeah yeah it's nice it grows really well you know hot and dry as long as you can get it to germinate question is whether we sell it market so we sell our ferments at market our vegetables we could only grow enough vegetables for our CSA based on what we know our membership is so if we have a good year they might get more of something we can also have excess we have what's called a bulk list so we're we have a small farm central anybody familiar with that it's an online system it's kind of made for CSA farms so we use that system people can sign up online they can keep track of their own account so you're not like trying to keep track or double entering information that people send you and then they also have a place where you can kind of sell online so if we have extra lettuce we can just put that up and send out an email it's like if you want extra lettuce buy it online and we'll deliver it to your CSA distribution and then there's an organic farmers market in Kansas City called Brookside farmers market and so we go there every other week to sell the ferments so we're 45 minutes from kind of downtown Kansas City which is really a really good distance for us being a participatory CSA you know a family is going to come out to do their work requirement farm work you know it's a little Drive in the country they're not driving two hours so you know we're lucky that were peri-urban as they say we have the farms one pickup site we have two locations in the city that we drop off at we have what we call a core group that manages the CSA and then a most of the core group members are distribution captains and so if there's a distribution site there's like five people that instead of coming out to the farm to work they will rotate and go to the distribution site and we'll go drop off crates they set it all up they break it down and make sure everything works well and then when we come back the next week we take the empty crates and deliver the fresh produce so it's nice for us we just drive into town then you you know work in other errands and stuff and with the ferments it'll allow us to maybe do some drop-offs there so it helps make it efficient for us to to drive in it's been pretty good we're normally 75% or more we'd our renewals going on right now and we only opened it up to the last year's members to start with and we have 100 we're going for 100 members this year and I think Rebecca said we're up to you know 65 or so already so I think we'll be on track for that and since we went to every other week people have actually liked that has helped us as farmers we got this whole extra week where we can kind of concentrate on farming more we've worked it out so the harvesting isn't that big of an issue we have a Wednesday drop-off as our first for the week and a Monday is the last for that distribution week so there's a handful of days in there that we can kind of plan stuff we have a 12 by 24 inch cooler that we built as part of our fermenting project so that helps to we can store a lot of stuff [Music]",
