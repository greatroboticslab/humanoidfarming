  "text": "[Music] [Applause] hello learners welcome to our environmental science in a secondary course of an RS in our previous program we have already discussed about modern agriculture which includes process of processing food feed - an agriculture vation of the certain plants and raising of domesticated animal so today there is a great demand to promote sustainable agriculture there is less than twenty one concept of sustainable agriculture of module six first level development MLM cook tacos cognitive involved in science welcome to you in this program look at the figure as we know that primitive humans discovered agriculture about 12,000 years ago primitive hunters and gatherers move to pace near rivers once humans knew that watering plant is necessary to grow plants look at the left side figure hunting and godrick primitive humans learn to become farmers such human settlements begin forming gradually more human settled away from rivers and water they're going crops with water from wells to bills and other means of withdrawing groundwater however result of farming depending largely on rains during monsoon right side figure shows a farmer playing rain God now come to the objective of the program are relate changing human needs with overuse of environment need for enhancing quality of environment define sustainable agriculture and justify its need describe concept and methods of sustainable agriculture explain about organic farming and its benefits describe the methods of preparing one we composed explained bio fertilizer and they are used in agriculture explain integrated pest management and Jean GMOs and its related issues now come to humanist and over you know environment human population are growing rapidly throughout the world almost half of the population live in densely populated urban areas rural population migrate to open areas in search of job food housing and a better lifestyle and also impact on agriculture as well as environment now come to the need for enhanced quality of environment this huge population puts a tremendous pressure on resources the high rate of consumption of resources and highways rate as expansion of cities Copeland's forests wetland and wild habitat destroy so there is a great need to improve the situation so that humans can enjoy a quality environment we do deserve a healthy environment to survive and lead a good life now come to the advent of modern agriculture after world war ii food and fiber were raised by new technology thus begin modern agriculture use of new machines and implements for agriculture use of fertilizers and pesticides expansion of irrigation facilities result in enough food for fast-growing population now come to the impact of modern agriculture on environment population increased more food needed more farm used agriculture grow more food but many adverse effects on environment and unemployment of farm labourers come to the impact on environment deforestation to get land for agriculture top soil depletion soil pollution another one groundwater contamination polluted water unemployment of farm laborers migrating from villages to cities resulting in urbanization and its problems next slide shows different tools and implements and expansion of irrigation facilities now come to the sustainable agriculture to saw through gun of last two decades remote not modern agriculture but sustained culture to save the environment for future generations next question arises what is sustainable agriculture and sustainable agriculture for whom sustainable agriculture or systemic farming attempts to produce sufficient food exhausting soil fertility and damaging environment it is to be least toxic komlin and least energy intensive in operation and get maintain productivity and profitability grow sufficient food and retain soil quality for many subsequent generation to grow food now how does sustainable agriculture achieve so answer is it can be achieved by various ways that is protect and preserve environmental quality use natural resources judiciously decrease dependence on non-renewable energy resources provide consumers with affordable high-quality foodstuff support profitable agriculture production enhance quality of life of farmers and rural population last for many generations now come to the methods of sustainable agriculture that will be mixed cropping or diverse coughing crop rotation multiple cropping while planning these approaches one has to be kept in mind local geography and topography nature and condition of soil so local climate and local inputs and farmers goal now we will discuss objectives of sustainable agriculture cultivation practices to increase biological and economic stability selection of improved varieties to suit the need soil management by proper method of tillage many farmers in India and other developing countries follow the traditional practices of mixed cropping or diverse cropping and crop rotation first ability mixed cropping or diverse copying is an old practices India in this method two or more crops are grown on the same piece of land and at the same time this removes the insecurities of total crop failure when more than one crop is grown at least one pill survived if not all of the two crops grown together one is a long duration crop and other a short duration cob nutrients required by the two crops is different time of maturity is different generally leguminous crop is grown with a main crop so nitrogen gets fixed and there is no need for fertilizer it saves costs other plants for mixed cropping can be Polly varietal punctuation that is several varieties of same crop grown together now next is intercropping different crops that is banach leguminous crop which fixes nitrogen other carbohydrate crop which uses soil nitrogen plants maturing at different times are grown together needs different so less inputs needed natural predators control pace so new pesticides needed compared to monoculture yield per hectare much more now what is monoculture it is a cultivation of single crop on large scale which gives large eat but for a short period of time it is expensive as lots of fertilizers and pesticides are needed so not only monoculture is economically unsound but also environmentally harmful next is crop rotation growing different crops in succession regularly in the same field result control insects and diseases increase soil fertility decreases soil erosion monoculture of high yield single crop exhaust totally one certain minerals yield remain utilization this result in nutrient imbalance of the soil and increases certain pastes and diseases sewing a leguminous crop as a rotational crop is very useful because legumes enhance nitrogen label in the soil due to their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen reduces that need for chemical nitrogen fertilizer thereby cutting the cost and saving the soil from the harmful effects of using high yielding varieties along with the application of large amount of fertilizers pesticides and water it is possible to grow two or sometimes three different crops in succession on the same length with inner ear is known as multiple cropping this practice can go on for some time but the length can not maintain high eat in a long run crop rotation takes in two among the factors first leguminous crops should be clone after non leguminous crop crop requires less water should be clone after one that requires more water third crops requiring less meat meal should be shown after one that require more menus important crop patterns of propagation as shown in this slide first green gram wheat and move second round net weight and move third order sugarcane beet and more food paddy beet and move mixed cropping when coupled with livestock rearing has many advantages some land area can be used or crop of grown on one label and steeper slope if pasture and leguminous forages crops are rotated soil quality is enhanced livestock menu makes while for time in case of rainfall at least livestock provided milk takes marketing of multiple products easy cushions for farmers against price fluctuation farm labor gets utilized more effectively now come to the soil management a healthy soil is a key component of sustainable agriculture that is healthy soil along with water and nutrient produces healthy crop plants that are less susceptible to pests and diseases accordingly soil must be protected and nurtured to ensure long-term productivity and stability methods of protection include using cover crops shampoos reducing tillage conserving soil moisture by dead mulches this increases water hold capacity of the soil significant improvement in crop production has been achieved by using the conventional method of selection and plant breeding now objectives of varietal improvement improvement are development of high yielding varieties of crop plants food crops develop for better and higher nutritional quality like protein quality in pulses making quality in wheat preserving quality in fruits and vegetables soil quality in oil seed producing plants developmental of crop varieties resistance to disease and paste improving varieties for resistance against heat cold frost draught and water logging now come to the bio fertilizer and its uses in agriculture while fertilizer are substitutes for chemical fertilizers such as NPK they are used in reduces energy expenditure required to manufacture fertilizers they do not cause pollution microorganisms like bacteria algae and fungi fix atmospheric nitrogen debt can be solubilized phosphorus decomposed organic material or oxidized sulfur in soil enhance growth and yield of crops improve soil fertility some of the important types of biofertilizers which can be considered for agro based industries are Rhizobium as ito bacterium zola blue-green algae etcetera first Rhizobium it is a symbiotic bacteria and form do not use in leguminous plants and live there they can fix atmospheric nitrogen up to 200 kilo gram nitrogen per hectare per year surplus nitrogen remains in soil and enhanced soil quality next is Agito bacteria these are aerobic fix living nitrogen fixing bacteria grow around foods of cereals and fixed nitrogen reduce growth promoting hormones which helps in enhancing growth and yield of plants next is a spiral um aerobic fix living nitrogen fixing bacteria associate symbiotic bacteria live on wood surface of host plant and increase crop yield supplying growth hormones and vitamins commonly used in commercial inoculation next is blue gill algae no stock and anabaena are common blue green algae or cyanobacteria free living and photosynthetic they fixed nitrogen use in flooded rice fields as nitrogen biofertilizers next is a Zola it is a water fun inside which grows nitrogen fixing VG anabaena ozuna and nabina combine is used as fertilizer in all over the world it grows in summer makes is phosphorous solubilizing biofertilizers phosphorus is needed for plant root also for not dual formation Rhizobium certain microbes solubilize phosphorus and make it available for plants to absorb now we will discuss my cruiser fungi that occur on roots of forest trees and crop plants in soil low in available nutrients there is an increased absorption of nutrients by plants infected by mike rizzo the fungus has the ability to dissolve and absorb phosphorus that plant roots cannot readily absorb now come to the organic farming and its benefit organic matter is bought living organisms are made of hence organic farming in agriculture relying on crop rotation crop residue animal menu like you in menu organic waste and biofertilizers mechanical control cultivation mineral bearing crops biological pest and weed control in other parts organic farming does not use any chemicals or artificial substance for agriculture agricultural product for organic farming are green dairy products poultry products cotton and jute fibres flowers etc thus organic farming creates a sustainable lifestyle for generations to come now come to the method of organic farming nourishing microbes in soil to provide its nutrients soil organic matter gives the soil good structure and water holding capacity organic farmers grow these microbes and add compost and biological based soil nutrients so that plants grown in organic farm our disease and pest resistant organic farmers use crop rotation to in ditch soil continuously and keep up a paste prefer specific crops to keep pests away predators are used meeting is disrupted and tress and barriers are used now come to the benefits of organic farming it can be learnt easily by farmer reduce production cost as expensive fertilizers and pesticides not used did you say soil erosion up to 50% increase crop eat fivefold in lowland organic farms can support wildlife as the animal can roam in pastures and grace entire ecosystem along with groundwater is improved varies benefits as the cattle are fed organic field and grazes on organic fields these kettles are more healthy and kept tasty milk soil remains healthy with living microbes that provide the soil with micronutrients soil gets inexhaustible nutrients for many generations of crops roll in the organic field quality of products enhanced as they are free from harmful chemicals artificial flavors colors and preservatives now come to the advantages of intense farming and organic formula in short advantage of intensive farming are bigger eats from land available fewer Parker's native use of hormone increases meat production large numbers of animals kept in ideal conditions produced a sleeper fewer blemishes on crops and organic farming soil structure is better less harmful to environment no harmful chemicals healthier more birds insects and animals lead happier lives now come to the Burma compost Burma compost can be prepared at the back yard of your home in one corner to your school field or may be public park which will produce manure as well as clean up the environment from garbage accumulation when we composting efficient lyric cycles organic waste crop residues and agro industrial waste art forms and microbes includes bacteria and fungi together turn organic waste into useful organic menu now we would like to talk about augering materials that can be required for vermicompost it can be agricultural residue dry organic waste waste vegetable so we have been residues weeds sugarcane tress city culture residue from silk production animal menus dairy and poultry bills waste food industry waste municipal solid waste biogas large veggies from sugar cane factories now come to the steps in making public compost will not purchase bombs from your wormy compost Minh prepare the bomb bedding motion the bedding add a handful of soil to be to the bedding add the bombs to the vermicompost win at food scripts - bin to the win remove the warmth when the compost is done harvest a bomb we composed replace the bedding and reintroduced the bombs now next is integrated pest management farmers develop a control program that includes cultivation biological and chemical methods applied in proper sequence with and with the proper timing the aim of IPM is not a eradicate the base population completely but to keep the crop damage to economically tolerable level farmers monitored the field and when they find the paste label to be high enough they first used biological methods and cultivation practices to control and then use small amounts of insecticides mostly insecticides derived from plant as last resort biological controls include natural predator parasites and pathogens of the paste are used examples are first based on two combi plant called red spider mite is controlled by using a predatory mite that fed on red spider mite second set red food in California heavily damaged by a scale insects which were controlled by Australian ladybird which are Aveda insects mealy bug paste of cassava plant were controlled by parasitoid wasp which was its initial enemy hormones are used that disturb the insects normal life cycle thereby preventing it from reaching maturity and reproducing and multiplying now come to the biotechnology in agriculture modern agriculture you assured in Green Revolution with hybrid seeds fertilizers pesticides and improvement in agriculture practices genetic engineering our recombinant DNA technology brought in second Green Revolution with genetically modified GM crops or transgenic crops on GMOs transgenic crops have been produced with the following aims crop resistance to herbicides crop resistance to insects and diseases atmospheric nitrogen fixation by cereal crops tolerance to high salt soil and to flooding in crops rot resistance in crop improving nutritional quality of crops prolonging shelf life of fruits and vegetables so some important examples of transgenics or GMOs are bt cotton produced by incorporating batesian with encodes for BT toxins in the cotton plant the plant becomes insect resistance and this gene has been incorporated in brinjal corn potato tomato tobacco Osetra making them insect resistance such plants can reduce our dependence on chemical pesticides which will save us money and our environment Golden Rice our transgenic with enhanced with I mean a content producing nutritionally rich rice to save many lives salt and what tolerance genes have been incorporated in rice so that BT rice in China shows higher yield and health and a huge reduction in pesticides used such rice can be grown on saline soil Nexus by slowing down and controlling ripening in tomato by introducing a bacterial genes that prevents a higher information thus delaying ripening such tomatoes are easy to handle during transportation and remains on the shelf for a long time cold image to crop plants can be minimized by introducing genes for antifreeze proteins found in the blood of Arctic fishes frost restrains Tomatoes has been produced by introducing genes for antifreeze proteins from polar fish living in ice water one biotechnology can help to make intensive agriculture less damaging to environment as well as help the country to spend less money on fertilizers pesticides and herbicides now come to benefits and controversies on g---men GM products first men will take benefits for crops enhance taste and quality reduced maturation time increased nutrients field and stress tolerance improved resistance to disease paste and herbicides new products and growing techniques benefits for animals increases since productivity hardness and feed efficiency better yield of meat eggs and milk improved animal health and diagnostic methods for environment friendly bio herbicides and bio insecticides conservation of soil water and energy bio processing for forestry products better ritual waste management more efficient processing benefits for society increased food security for growing populations now come to the controversies for safety potential human health impact that means electrons transfer of antibiotic resistance markers unknown effects potential environment in fact that is unintended transfer of transistor cross pollination unknown effects on other of organisms and loss of flora and fauna biodiversity next xsn intellectual property domination of bulk food production by a few companies increasing dependence on industrialized nations by developing countries biopiracy that is foreign exploitation of natural resources now next is ethics violation of natural organisms intrinsic values tampering with nature by mixing genes among species objections to transferring animal genes in plants and vice versa stress for enemy labeling not mandated in some countries for example United States mixing GM crops with non-gm confounds labeling attempts for society new advances may be skewed to interest off rich countries before we wrap up we would like to recap the main points that is what you have learnt sustainable agriculture systems are those that are least toxic and least energy consuming yet maintain productivity and profitability agricultural practices like crop rotation intercropping polyculture and proper soil management with mulches and cover crops to maintain soil moisture are integral part of sustainable agriculture bio fertilizer are the plant nutrients for of biological origin like algae bacteria fungi which have no harmful effect on soil and environment organic farming is a type of agriculture which avoids synthetic inorganic fertilizers pesticides growth regulators and livestock feed additives organically grow and feed food products are free from harmful chemicals or typical flavors and preservation reiatives vermicompost can be prepared at the back yard of your home in one corner of your school field or maybe in public park which will produce many or as well as clean up the environment from garbage accumulation integrated pest management is a grand idea to control pests and diseases this increases production takes the environment from pollution and harmful effect of pesticides and save money which is usually spent on buying pesticides biotechnology technique is used to produce plants by gene transfer which can be a direct answer to grow plants resistance to diseases paste told in to coal taught and flooding etcetera one can design a plan to suit this condition dear learners this is all about lesson 21 concept of sustainable agriculture we will I came to meet you with a new program of environmental science thank you",
