  "text": "today i am going to demonstrate a simple way to attach drip tape to a header pipe and to plug the end of the drip tape the first thing that you will want to do to attach the lathe flat to the header pipe is attach the drip tape to the fitting twisting the fitting to the right will tighten it so that it won't come off when you turn the water on then take a phillips head screwdriver and punch a hole in the lay flat header we are doing this part with the water on it makes it easier to punch the hole but you will get wet be careful to use a screwdriver with a head that is slightly smaller than the fitting so that it doesn't leak around the fitting then push the fitting into the hole you should be able to hear or feel a pop when the fitting slides into the hole with the water on it will flow through the tape and out the other end if you haven't plugged it yet to plug the tape make sure the water is cut off cut off a 1 to 2 inch piece from the end fold the tape over twice then inhale so that it will easily slip inside the piece you have cut off now your drip tape is ready to go to sure it stays in place turn the water on and get all the kinks out so the water is flowing to the end of the drip tape and you have your place where you want it then take a regular garden hose and place soil every foot or so on top of the drip tape to weigh it down so that it won't get displaced by high wind be careful not to hit the tape with the hole you'll be able to apply water directly to the plant without getting the plant or fruit whip this is a great way to conserve water reduce plant disease spread and reduce food safety risk we hope this video was very useful please check out our video series to learn all the steps in installing a simple irrigation system on a small phone thank you you",
