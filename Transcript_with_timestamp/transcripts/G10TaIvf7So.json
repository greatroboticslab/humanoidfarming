competing definitions of what methods constitute good agricultural practice there are several broadly accepted schemes that producers can adhere to topic food and agricultural organization of the United Nations gap the Food and Agricultural organization of the United Nations FAO uses good agricultural practice as a collection of principles to apply for unfarmed production and post-production processes resulting in safe and healthy food and non-food agricultural products while taking into account economical social and environmental sustainability gaps may be applied to a wide range of farming systems and at different scales they are applied through sustainable agricultural methods economically and efficiently produced sufficient food security safe food safety and nutritious food food quality gaps require maintaining a common database on integrated production techniques for each of the major agro ecological area C eco region thus to collect analyze and disseminate information of good practices in relevant geographical contexts topic United States Department of Agriculture gap GHP program the United States Department of Agriculture agricultural marketing service currently operates an audit certification program to verify that farms use good agricultural practice and/or good handling practice this is a voluntary program typically utilized by growers and Packers to satisfy contractual requirements with retail and food service buyers the program was implemented in 2002 after the New Jersey Department of Agriculture petitioned USDA amps to implement an audit based program to verify conformance to the 1998 Food and Drug Administration publication entitled guide to minimize microbial food safety hazards for fresh fruits and vegetables the program has been updated several times since 2002 and includes additional certification programs such as commodity specific audit programs for mushrooms tomatoes leafy greens and cantaloupes in 2009 usda amps participated in the gapps harmonization initiative which harmonized 14 of the major North American GAAP audit standards which in 2011 resulted in the release and implementation of the produce gaps harmonized food safety standard topic smallholder productivity demand for agricultural crops is expected to double as the world's population reaches 9.1 billion by 2050 increasing the quantity and quality of food in response to growing demand will require increased agricultural good agricultural practices often in combination with effective input use are one of the best ways to increase smallholder productivity many agribusinesses are building sustainable supply chains to increase production and improve quality topic soil reducing erosion by wind and water through hedging and ditching application of fertilizers at appropriate moments and in adequate doses ie when the plant needs the fertilizer to avoid runoff see nitrogen balance method maintaining or restoring soil organic content by manure application use of grazing crop rotation reduce soil compaction issues by avoiding using heavy mechanical devices maintain soil structure by limiting heavy tillage practices in situ Greenman uring by growing pulse crops like cow pee horse gram Sun hemp etc topic water practice scheduled irrigation with monitoring of plant needs and soil water reserve status to avoid water loss by drainage prevent soil salinization by limiting water input to needs and recycling water whenever possible avoid crops with high water requirements in a low availability region avoid drainage and fertilizer runoff maintain permanent soil covering in particular in winter to avoid nitrogen runoff manage carefully water table by limiting heavy output of water restore or maintain wetlands sea marshlands provide
