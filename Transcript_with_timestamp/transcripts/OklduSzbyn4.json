  "text": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey what's up everybody I'm Chef Mikey welcome back to Chef's Harvest Farm I'm sitting in my raised bed garden today and today I'm going to be planting these zucchini plants and marold plants over in this raised bed I'm going to plant these Direct through this mulch but the cool thing about this mulch is that this mulch was grown here and the roots are still attached feeding the microbiology in the soil while at the same time mulching the soil to protect it from the Sun and in this video I'm going to show you how to grow your own mulch using cover crops in your raised bed garden let's go do it first [Music] just got my five gallon bucket of uh peas and oats cover crop here and I'm just going to broadcast it right on top of the soil the oats are going to grow straight up and then the peas climb up the oats you know it's just going to be like a four or 5 foot tall big mass of cover crop it's been about 3 months since I seated the raised garden beds over here and so so today I'm going to terminate them so this bed's peas and oats right here which is what you watched me do and then this bed got planted to some mustard cover crops and the peas and oats I'm going to crimp them down so they'll stay like a mulch on top of the raised bed and then I'm just going to plant directly into the terminated cover crop and to do that with the peas and oats because I want it as mulch on top I'm just going to like crimp it using this it's like a tomato stick I'm just going to step on it and then I'm going to tarp the whole area and leave it tarp for like 2 weeks and then it's all going to be dead when we come back [Music] okay so the next step I'm going to water it in pretty good and then I'm just going to pull the silage tarps over so it's super important that if you're not familiar with this process they're using the right tarp it's not just like a tarp from Home Depot they're UV treated tarp so I'm not super concerned about um like micr Plastics ending up in the soil or anything because these tarps are made in designed to be sitting out in the sun but so yeah make sure you use the correct tarp you could also use greenhouse plastic and other than those two materials I wouldn't use anything else and so I'm going to water it in first and then pull the tarps back cuz the tarps are way more effective when it's wet underneath so I'm going to tarp this whole area including all this area where the fence is kind of a problem area where I have to mow and I have to move it every time I'm just going to tarp this try to kill this grass and possibly just fill it all in with wood [Music] chip all right so it's been exactly two weeks since we laid the tarp down over the raised bed cover crop so I'm going to pull it off and we'll see what it looks like all right y'all so you can kind of see what it looks like when I move the tarp over it's like completely dead and the mulch is just right on top of the raised bed garden so now I'm going to like clean up the whole area I'm going to take my little flame weer here it just hooks up it's just a torch that hooks up to a propane tank I'm just going to like kill all the little weeds that are around in the area I'm going to hit it with my weed eater first and I'm going to Flame weed it off and then I'm just going to like fill in the whole area with wood chips [Music] so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to pull this mulch aside it's like pretty thick and I'm just going to like make myself a little hole and then I'm just going to put a little handful of compost in the hole just to make sure that the plant has like all the nutrition in there it needs and then I'm going to take my zucchini plant bury him in the hole and then I just move the mulch kind of back and that's it so this raised bed was actually cover cro to mustard which I use to like suppress soilborne pathogens they suppress like pathogenic nematodes soil born diseases and pathogens like uh you know tomato bite things like that so I'm just going to plant these molds into this bed really just like attract pollinators to my garden and everything I don't really need them to produce me any sort of income it's mostly just for my wife and I [Music] [Music]",
