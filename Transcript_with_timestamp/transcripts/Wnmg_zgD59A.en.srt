it's a pleasure meeting you and i have

56
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,560
the reason why i came to see you today

57
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,200
is like i realized that you're doing

58
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,519
something new something different i'm

59
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,920
trying to um inspire so many young

60
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,319
africans to invest in africa with little

61
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,959
amount of money and that's what's led me

62
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:59,120
to your house so this is where you live

63
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,800
yes this is where i live this is my

64
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,280
backyard and you can see i have fresh

65
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,519
fish coming right from my backyard

66
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,800
you're doing everything at your backyard

67
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,239
this is my backyard and this is the

68
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,640
concept we want to develop because

69
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,720
because of urbanization a lot of people

70
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,280
are moving to cities and they don't have

71
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,760
huge tracts of land to put up ponds

72
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,800
so we are trying to encourage urban

73
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,560
aquaculture in your backyards

74
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,959
you know what i know when it comes to

75
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,519
fish farming the ones that i've visited

76
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,840
i mean it's huge it can take the whole

77
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,400
area yes but you're just doing it right

78
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,440
at your backyard yes yes yes and this

79
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,920
this is biofloc technology now what you

80
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,239
see them doing in huge ponds i'll

81
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,840
explain to you in a huge pond okay if it

82
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,360
is unmanaged

83
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,959
from an acre of a land and a pond on an

84
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,440
acre of land when you have not managed

85
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:52,720
your pond you can get around six to

86
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:55,200
eight tons of fish from that one acre

87
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,599
with my technology if you put it on one

88
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,360
acre you will get more than 70 tons of

89
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,200
fish

90
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,280
that is the difference you said my

91
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,360
technology i mean this technology is not

92
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,439
my technology this this technology was

93
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,560
actually developed in the us and in

94
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,000
israel

95
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,439
way back in the 1990s okay and it is

96
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
used a lot

97
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,320
in in other countries especially in asia

98
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,079
where whereby they need to bring down

99
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,759
the cost of production because

100
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,800
everything is very highly competitive so

101
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,160
they need to bring down the cost of

102
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,040
production so they use a lot of this

103
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,960
technology okay to produce more at a

104
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,199
lower cost

105
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,120
you know what um we are in ghana yeah

106
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,360
before you take us to go and see what

107
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,960
you're doing you're in ghana right now

108
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,720
but you said you're born in kenya 10th

109
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,320
generation what brought you to ghana

110
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,759
then uh i came to ghana initially i used

111
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,400
to work for a bank

112
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,680
and then i i stopped that and i started

113
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,160
my own

114
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,000
manufacturing of tarpaulin okay

115
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,520
so we manufacture the topology one of

116
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,600
the products we manufacture is the

117
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,800
topolin tanks for the fish you

118
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,560
manufacture right here yes we

119
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,360
manufacture in ghana

120
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,840
we we produced them in ghana oh yes and

121
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,840
then after that pollen we decided to so

122
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,280
when i had the tarpaulin and i saw that

123
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,800
there is a need to bring in this

124
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,039
technology and because i was trained

125
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,039
also in this technology in india okay in

126
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,199
biofloc i decided to now try and

127
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,080
introduce this technology using our

128
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,479
tanks

129
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,039
you can also do cement tanks but those

130
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,479
are a bit more expensive this is cheaper

131
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,400
and we want to try and bring down the

132
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,080
cost of production as much as possible i

133
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,080
am here because

134
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,759
so many africans that watch me

135
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,160
especially the young ones are saying

136
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,160
that it's so expensive to invest in

137
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,560
africa how much do you think it will

138
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,400
cost us to i mean invest in this type of

139
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,000
technology okay for this type of

140
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,520
technology for example this is a three

141
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,320
meter diameter tank because i don't have

142
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,199
a lot of space but the basic commercial

143
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,280
size

144
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,600
is a four meter diameter tank which can

145
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,520
take ten thousand liters of water

146
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,440
whoa yeah so that ten thousand liters of

147
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,960
water can give you around uh 300 to 500

148
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,880
kilos of fish

149
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,080
now depending on how you are harvesting

150
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:06,000
if you are harvesting at say 300 grams

151
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,360
you are talking of 1 600 tilapia from a

152
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,199
four meter diameter tank from your

153
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,199
backyard can we just go and check it out

154
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,240
i don't know if you're willing to train

155
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,280
people for me because that's the reason

156
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,840
why i'm here

157
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,600
um how do we reach out to interns if

158
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,600
somebody wants consultation or want to

159
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,199
know how to okay i'm doing this in their

160
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:38,199
backyard yeah we we have a website uh

161
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,199
www.bioflocaafrica.com

162
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,400
so you can reach us through the website

163
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,560
our contacts and everything is there all

164
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,880
the details are there so we have four

165
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,120
four uh services and products one is the

166
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,319
training so we'll be training people on

167
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:55,280
this technology and uh in sub-saharan

168
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,360
africa we would be the first trainers of

169
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,440
this technology there are farms there's

170
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,280
one in malawi and one being set up in

171
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,280
south africa but those are big scale

172
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,039
they are not for small-scale farmers

173
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:09,759
so we would be the first

174
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:12,160
africans to train africans in africa

175
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,759
i love that the fact that he's stressing

176
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,000
on africa

177
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,759
for africans that's awesome you know

178
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,360
what i just want to ask you a question

179
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,120
you've lived in africa all your life

180
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,560
born and raised in here

181
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,160
what is that one thing that if you had a

182
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,080
chance to change up in africa you would

183
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,240
change what was that one thing

184
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,199
it is these technologies that we need in

185
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,560
africa

186
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,080
and the people who have these

187
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,120
technologies are not very happy to give

188
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,039
them to us

189
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,639
they want us to go for technologies like

190
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,000
ras which is the recirculating

191
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,000
aquaculture system which is very

192
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,080
expensive it's a white elephant so it's

193
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,039
an expensive system to implement

194
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,880
and also a very expensive system to run

195
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,800
now when i'm talking of ras i'm talking

196
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,639
about the proper areas where you have

197
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,240
your bio filters you have mechanical

198
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,520
filters you have ue

199
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,360
all those techniques

200
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,960
sophisticated technologies i'm not

201
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,639
talking about the technology where we

202
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,240
take buckets and we put pebbles and we

203
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,319
put some ceramic stones and we say that

204
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,080
is rs i'm not talking of that res i'm

205
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,919
talking of the proper areas that is a

206
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,520
very expensive system and that is what

207
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,919
people want us to use because that is a

208
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,000
white and it is not going to work unless

209
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,360
you are doing very high value fish

210
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,440
because the cost of running that

211
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,879
technology will not pay you when you

212
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,120
harvest your fish so these are the kind

213
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:22,080
of technologies that we need to bring to

214
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,879
africa for africans to benefit from and

215
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,680
that is my objective so this it's it's

216
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,800
it's profitable and sustainable

217
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,599
what is your name once again my name is

218
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,519
and like i said i'm i'm a kenyan

219
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,640
based here in ghana for the last few

220
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,399
years

221
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,200
just to give you a bit of perspective

222
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,120
about the the technologies okay so on

223
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,279
one side of the spectrum we have the

224
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,120
pond technology okay where you dig a

225
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,720
pond and you leave your fish in that you

226
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,680
will get around five to six tons per

227
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,560
acre

228
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,279
on the extreme side we have the ras

229
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,120
system recirculating aquaculture system

230
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,760
there you can get 50 plus kilos per

231
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,320
cubic meter of water but the cost of

232
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,279
implementing that technology is huge

233
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,560
and is not really for anybody on a small

234
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,880
scale to do

235
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,800
this technology can give you around 30

236
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,560
to 50 kilos depending on your level of

237
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,959
expertise and your training

238
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,279
okay at a fraction of the cost

239
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,640
of doing an ras system and people can

240
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,000
put this in their backyard this you can

241
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,320
even put inside your room because

242
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,200
there's absolutely no smell as you can

243
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,800
see

244
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,680
one of the other benefits of this system

245
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,200
again is you see because uh the protein

246
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,080
is being generated in the system the

247
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,240
microbial protein we recommend even that

248
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,160
you use low protein feed

249
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,560
now low protein feed what does that do

250
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,480
it reduces the cost of feed so when

251
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,160
people start taking this technology up

252
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,959
and the feed producers start producing

253
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:47,519
the low protein cost fear feed

254
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,440
the cost of feed will come down

255
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,839
so in addition to you saving on the

256
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,519
amount of feed you are also saving on

257
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,440
that type of feed because the protein

258
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,440
content has reduced

259
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,519
what that also does for the environment

260
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,320
is because we get a lot of the protein

261
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,399
from the oceans we are taking a lot of

262
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,440
the fish from the oceans to convert into

263
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,720
fish feed

264
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,640
as fish meal

265
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,160
so we will now reduce that pressure on

266
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,560
the environment

267
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,040
and use that fish for humans and then in

268
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,640
this technology we reduce our our

269
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,800
consumption of

270
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,720
fish protein the last benefit that i

271
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,320
want to talk about is the

272
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,480
health benefit you see this is organic

273
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,480
fish when you eat organic things you

274
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,839
become healthy so now if you look at the

275
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,839
macro level

276
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,839
when people stop falling sick the

277
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,880
pressure on our health systems will also

278
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,279
reduce

279
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,800
so it has a macro benefit also in

280
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,079
addition to the micro for the small

281
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,440
people

282
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,399
if you look at the economic benefits

283
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,160
those are huge imagine if everybody has

284
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,000
or maybe a thousand people in ghana have

285
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,160
this tank in their backyard and you're

286
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,920
producing a ton of fish every every six

287
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,720
months or five months

288
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,160
ghana imports 250 million dollars worth

289
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,839
of fish

290
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,959
now we can shift that balance in our

291
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,560
favor

292
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,680
instead of importing we can now even

293
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,120
become exporters of organic fish

294
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,560
you understand so that is one benefit

295
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,760
another benefit is if you put this in

296
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,839
the schools

297
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,560
the children can benefit from good

298
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,560
quality protein on one hand on the other

299
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,760
hand you see this is a very scientific

300
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,160
technology

301
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,240
so what they learn in science

302
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,240
they will apply it straight into this

303
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,720
on a practical level and those children

304
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,480
can then become aquapreneurs when they

305
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,000
leave school they don't need to really

306
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,279
pursue

307
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,360
other courses they can go into

308
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,200
aquaculture so we can grow that another

309
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,279
area we can look at is even the prisons

310
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,519
for example we can train the inmates in

311
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,680
this technology so by the time they come

312
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,680
back to join society they are already

313
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,760
skilled and they have ready jobs waiting

314
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,440
for them you see if i if i take you to

315
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,279
kenya for example this this is what i

316
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,320
call an appropriate technology for

317
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,079
africa

318
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,760
if you look at kenya for example we

319
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,920
started appropriate technology in

320
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,240
agriculture as the greenhouse in the

321
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,640
1960s so today

322
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,600
kenya exports a lot of horticultural

323
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,519
products

324
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,440
as well as flowers is one of the leading

325
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,279
flower exporters in the world because we

326
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,440
started then and if you look at the

327
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,040
agronomists across the world and

328
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,040
particularly in africa they come from

329
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:12,399
kenya why because they built the

330
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:14,000
expertise over the years now ghana with

331
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,079
me here and with this technology and we

332
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,560
have that unique advantage that we can

333
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:21,040
train our people so that by the time the

334
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,800
other countries try and catch up with us

335
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,040
we have a pool of experts who we can

336
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,959
then export to the other countries

337
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,279
so that is an advantage we have and this

338
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,279
technology is the technology of the

339
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,480
future it's the blue revolution in

340
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,399
aquaculture

341
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,800
and this is what people should adopt if

342
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,040
they want to get profitable output and

343
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,880
this this can be used for any fish if it

344
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,560
can work for tilapia

345
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,120
you can use this for catfish with your

346
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,120
eyes closed

347
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,480
i don't know since we've been mentioning

348
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,959
so many advantages what are the

349
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,240
disadvantage of using this method okay

350
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,600
there are no i wouldn't call them

351
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,680
disadvantages because there are no

352
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,959
disadvantages they are only challenges

353
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,560
there are small challenges like every

354
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,920
system has a challenge

355
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,360
the first and the most important

356
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,480
challenge of this technology is the

357
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,200
training

358
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,880
training is extremely important

359
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,320
you have to be properly trained to be

360
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,320
able because all this is based on

361
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,160
scientific principles and you have to

362
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,000
understand the scientific principles

363
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,920
before you can manage the water so

364
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,560
training is the most important thing

365
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,560
second challenge is that it needs some

366
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,920
preparation time so you don't just fill

367
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,839
your water and bring fish and you put

368
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,440
them inside it will not work so there is

369
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,880
a preparation time you have to prepare

370
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,320
the water you have to prepare the fish

371
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,800
and then you can start and once you do

372
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,040
that your mortality is almost zero you

373
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,519
should not get any mortality

374
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,680
so that is one of the the the challenges

375
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,000
another challenge is electricity you

376
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,000
must have constant electricity if

377
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,920
especially you are doing tilapia even

378
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,519
for catfish if you are doing catfish the

379
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,200
system still needs aeration because you

380
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,639
want to keep it an

381
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,760
aerobic environment you don't want

382
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,480
anaerobic

383
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,040
uh

384
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,639
status this car cannot use solar it can

385
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,639
use solar it can use any form of

386
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,720
electricity but you have to have

387
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,560
electricity and a backup so when when

388
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,880
lights go off you have to have your

389
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,199
backup taking off

390
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,160
okay but is it expensive to go for the

391
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,079
training

392
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,399
no training is not very expensive it's

393
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:14,240
not expensive in that

394
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,079
is the most important thing so you you

395
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,600
can decide to go for this invest a lot

396
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,360
of money and a lot of people have done

397
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,279
that because they are trying to save

398
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,199
that training cost

399
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,720
so they invest a lot of money without

400
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,320
going for training and then they end up

401
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,000
failing so losing a lot of money you see

402
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,040
training also once you go for the

403
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,639
training and you understand the

404
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,240
technology you will be able to know

405
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,240
whether really that technology is for

406
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,760
you or not for you because it needs some

407
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,760
dedication you have to be able to check

408
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,240
the parameters manage the parameters it

409
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,680
takes a bit of your time say 10 minutes

410
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,279
every morning you need to spend on the

411
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,199
time and and you are fine you're good to

412
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,199
go so training is the most important

413
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:49,199
without training you you will not be

414
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,720
able to do this and then and then this

415
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,560
this technology you see with these tanks

416
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,399
because we make them ourselves we can

417
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,240
make any size for you so if you want a

418
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,639
five meter diameter tank you want 10

419
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,720
meters 20 meters whatever size you want

420
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,920
we can make it for you in this now after

421
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,000
this we are going to bring another

422
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,519
technology for ponds

423
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,880
this is for tanks that is for ponds so

424
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,959
where you have a pond and you already

425
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,440
have and with that technology you will

426
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,959
be able to increase your production by

427
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,240
five to thirty times what you're

428
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,839
currently doing

429
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,279
so that technology will we will bring it

430
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,199
we will introduce it

431
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,199
later so i'm gonna put a website link

432
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:24,000
for you guys to um check it out if you

433
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:26,959
want to um enroll for the training and

434
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,959
um yeah it's it's more affordable and go

435
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:31,279
learn it and start this wherever you are

436
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:34,240
like i said this year i'm teaching you

437
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:36,160
how to fish i mean the easiest way to

438
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,000
fish with a little amount of money thank

439
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,600
you so much for watching uh it's still

440
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,120
your favorite village by mr ghana baby

441
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,120
and i'm gonna see you in the next one
