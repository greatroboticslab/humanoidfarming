1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,279
generically named computer assistant

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:11,599
what is the current temperature right

3
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:11,599
now it's 96 degrees fahrenheit

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,240
hey it's rob and i'm a sucker for

5
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,279
punishment so i am

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,520
out here in the backyard i have

7
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,359
uh received my hopefully last shipment

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,039
of plants other than one which is coming

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,199
as a replacement for one that died in

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,679
the last shipment

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,800
i want to try and repot these and get

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,279
them stuck out front

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,279
i've got

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:42,840
seven seven jalapenos

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:46,879
and then four more reapers

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,120
some uh trinidad scorpions

17
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,719
and some ghost peppers uh i do have some

18
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,440
ghost peppers already i mean these are

19
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,760
these are not exotics by any means

20
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,960
they're

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,079
uh they're hot peppers but uh i wanna

22
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,000
try and

23
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:05,280
put them in pots and i got some new pots

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,400
that i want to try are these i think

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:12,080
these are the

26
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:14,000
two gallon uh

27
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,640
yeah it's hard to tell and it says 105

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,960
st so you know i'd say it's a it's a 105

29
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,960
st

30
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,880
i have no idea what that means but these

31
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,799
might just be the one gallon

32
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,000
i am not entirely sure but i think they

33
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,479
are big enough for

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,560
maintaining the root system of a pretty

35
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,880
healthily growing pepper plant

36
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,280
and i'm gonna try uh you know this is my

37
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,400
first time really doing a large pepper

38
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:42,320
grow in pots so

39
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,320
we'll see how it works out

40
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,799
this is my soil mixing system i have a

41
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,840
concrete mixture that i put the

42
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,280
dirt and whatever else in and

43
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,040
i mix it around for a while make sure

44
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,079
that it's pretty thoroughly mixed up

45
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,560
and then i can dump it in the weed

46
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:59,520
barrel the wheelbarrow

47
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:08,240
and put it into the pots i know that

48
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:11,369
sounds exciting doesn't it

49
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,369
[Applause]

50
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,760
that's enough for a pretty decent start

51
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,599
on these pots

52
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,360
i don't want to take all the soil out of

53
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,920
this because i might have more

54
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,200
that i'm going to be doing but i just uh

55
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,080
when i'm done with it i'll end up

56
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,720
putting it back in here until i can get

57
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,200
a large

58
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,400
you know five gallon pail to be able to

59
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,800
store it in one it's got a nice

60
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,840
convenient lid

61
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,680
that isn't cracked i made that mistake

62
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,519
what i want to do with these is fill

63
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,440
them up to within about four inches of

64
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:51,040
the top maybe a little bit

65
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:54,239
deeper than that

66
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,239
good couple shovelfuls

67
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,560
give it a nice bottom

68
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,959
a little bit more

69
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,280
i'm going to pack this down just a

70
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,599
little bit not a lot

71
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,800
uh to give it a base for the plants to

72
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:19,840
sit on so i'm going to

73
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:19,840
do this with the first eight

74
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,640
already some little plants growing in

75
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,640
here

76
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,840
this is the easiest way i've found of

77
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,280
doing transplants into pots

78
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,200
first of all we take the plant that we

79
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,760
are transplanting

80
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,280
uh these are i got from bonnie plants

81
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,080
which are pretty good

82
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,560
you want to break up the soil a little

83
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,959
bit

84
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,959
tease the roots out get them so that

85
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,959
they're

86
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,400
you know kind of running around in the

87
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,879
in the

88
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:03,200
soil a little bit looser and then just

89
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:05,519
pile in dirt around the outside

90
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,040
it's so much easier than trying to dig a

91
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,480
hole

92
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,680
in what was you know in soil that you

93
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,760
put in a pot

94
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,680
i like to fill these not quite up to the

95
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,479
top

96
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,639
and make a sort of a moat a little

97
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:24,080
depressive moat around

98
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,960
the roots like that keeping the stem

99
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,400
and the edges up it helps to you know

100
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,440
slice the water in a little bit

101
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,240
although it's not that important and of

102
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,840
course

103
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,560
keep the steaks in so that i know what

104
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,800
the what the peppers are

105
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:43,840
because until they start sprouting

106
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,840
peppers it's really difficult to tell

107
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,280
sometimes they don't want to come out

108
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,240
very well oh look at the roots on this

109
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,040
one

110
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,040
that's lovely

111
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,720
and by doing this you're going to do

112
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,880
some damage to the roots but

113
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,880
they will grow back very well

114
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,199
i like to keep these pots uh that the

115
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,960
plants came in because

116
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,400
they're still in pretty good shape and i

117
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,320
can use these for

118
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:18,000
sprouting seeds for next year

119
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,600
i am going to need to get more soil

120
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,840
because i still have 15 more of these to

121
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,840
go 16 if you include the one that's

122
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,840
coming

123
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,960
all right this is what i've got so far

124
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,960
for plants and pots

125
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,720
get these growing in here

126
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,400
now there is one thing that i don't

127
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,919
really like about well a couple things i

128
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,199
don't particularly like i do have some

129
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,560
growing in

130
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,000
in these which have had surprisingly

131
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,199
good results over the past

132
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
few years it's kind of amazing that they

133
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,199
don't need

134
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,080
nearly as much soil as you think they do

135
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,080
although these go down into the dirt i

136
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:08,319
mean they they grow roots

137
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:12,479
down into the soil so they get plenty uh

138
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,479
but these guys i have to weed

139
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,800
and that's okay it's not a lot but you

140
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,240
know

141
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,479
it's enough of a pain in the butt

142
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,160
because i do have

143
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,160
a lot of a lot of pots growing here

144
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,720
and then of course there is the uh the

145
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,759
in-ground garden

146
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:35,360
now i'm using this uh this house wrap

147
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,479
as oh look at the ants i am using this

148
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,919
house wrap as

149
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:43,039
a weed block and it's

150
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:45,039
more weatherproof than the normal weed

151
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:49,199
block that you see over there

152
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:50,479
but it really cuts down on the weeding

153
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,599
uh there's some stuff that will grow

154
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,599
under there creeping charlie in

155
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:56,160
particular but

156
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,440
uh you know i've got quite a few plants

157
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,400
in here

158
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,880
and they are doing quite okay now one of

159
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,360
the nice things is i set up this

160
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,720
water irrigation system with the soaker

161
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,639
hoses

162
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,520
and that has done remarkably well in

163
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,120
keeping these guys watered

164
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,360
right now i've got it i think dialed

165
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,479
into about

166
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,199
30 minutes once a day and

167
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,639
there are four zones and they all run at

168
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,360
different times so it's not over

169
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,680
saturating

170
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,120
all the soil at one time it's kind of

171
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,560
spreading the love

172
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,319
i am going to have to do some more

173
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,960
weeding in the

174
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,800
you know on the periphery and some of

175
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,919
that but

176
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,199
uh this is i'm not sure what i'm going

177
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,360
to do with this yet

178
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,520
uh ideally this would go into the

179
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,039
territory of

180
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,319
a whole house air conditioner but

181
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,720
that's probably not going to happen

182
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:54,160
anytime soon so i might

183
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,000
end up moving creating a mulch pile back

184
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,639
here a compost pile

185
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,479
because right now these are my compost

186
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,520
bins

187
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:06,000
uh it's all leaves

188
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,520
and organic material i mean the tea bags

189
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,759
are

190
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,280
tea bags are all biodegradable so they

191
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,479
will eventually

192
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,440
degrade down the little metal staples in

193
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,240
there are steel

194
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,759
and they will degrade into iron which is

195
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,120
actually fairly good for plants

196
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,680
it's not in huge huge levels so it's not

197
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,840
going to be

198
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,840
toxic at all

199
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,159
these guys these tall boys are something

200
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,039
else

201
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,599
i got these from frostbed peppers and he

202
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,719
grew them

203
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:42,399
he started them really early

204
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:44,159
i think around uh super bowl weekend i

205
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,160
think is when he said he started him

206
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,200
so they got a pretty good head start and

207
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,040
uh

208
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,480
they seem to be doing okay i was a

209
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,160
little worried that they might have some

210
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,399
issues because they're so tall

211
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,600
but they seem to be standing up for

212
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,959
themselves pretty well

213
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,240
yeah i know there's traffic noise

214
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,440
there's not much i can do about it

215
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,440
because there are cars on the road

216
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,120
i've got 15 more 16 technically

217
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,279
to put in pots i'm not going to do it

218
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,720
today because i am out of soil

219
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,839
to put in the pots i'm going to have to

220
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,279
go to the hardware store tomorrow

221
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,200
they're closed already

222
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,920
it's a little later in the evening so

223
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,360
you know a little cooler which is nice

224
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,080
but i'm going to try and do those

225
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:25,440
tomorrow weather permitting and see

226
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,120
if i can get all of them planted

227
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,440
one of the nice things about growing in

228
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,200
pots is that as the plants grow bigger i

229
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,800
can move them

230
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,480
and i can give them more space and i can

231
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,640
rotate them around in different areas so

232
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,200
that they can get more or less sun

233
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,200
as needed uh i don't know this is my

234
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,720
first year doing anything quite this big

235
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,399
so we're gonna give it a shot and see

236
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,640
how it goes

237
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,600
anyway uh i'm gonna do the other ones

238
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,000
tomorrow i'm not going to do them

239
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,800
tonight

240
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,200
because it's still pretty freaking hot

241
00:09:52,800 --> 00:10:00,720
and i'm tired

242
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,720
i'll see you guys next time peace
