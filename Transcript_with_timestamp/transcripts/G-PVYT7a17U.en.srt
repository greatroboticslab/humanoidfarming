00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,640
hi my name is penny adler and i am a

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,560
soap artisan on the 444 farm where we

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,760
have goats that we use to make in our

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,840
soap and i started with bar soap and

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,880
and ventured into a little bit of liquid

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,800
soap but found out my love is cream soap

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,960
and that is what i applied for the grant

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,960
for

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,040
i made cream soap and i had a failure

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,200
where it separated and at that point i

11
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,680
wanted i didn't know what caused the

12
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,440
failure and so part of this grant was to

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,800
figure out how

14
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,640
to

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,920
to reduce my risk of that happening

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,640
happening again

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,680
so the grant is for

18
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,680
creating sound

19
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:01,440
or good manufacturing practices

20
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,199
they're not any rules they're legislated

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,600
to us they're just some manufacturing

22
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,920
practices that a um

23
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,840
a manufacturer will follow and that

24
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,799
allows the customer to feel comfortable

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,479
that they're getting a good and

26
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,479
consistent product every time

27
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,799
so the cream soaps is different from bar

28
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,119
soaps and it's different from liquid

29
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:26,320
soaps it's kind of a combination that it

30
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:29,600
uses lye that each of them uses but what

31
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:33,119
it does is it adds a super cream and

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:36,479
my these cream soaps will be in a

33
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,600
jar instead of a bar or instead of a

34
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,960
pump

35
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,920
and

36
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,600
the the

37
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,520
cream soaps have a lather that just

38
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,759
i compare the lather to somewhere

39
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,159
between like a pudding and whipped cream

40
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,119
it is just this wonderful luscious

41
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,560
lather it's not real bubbly it's creamy

42
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,079
and it's just

43
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,320
it makes you feel good during the whole

44
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,799
experience of using it and it just is

45
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,799
fabulous

46
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,959
i in the past i've done some what they

47
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,280
call product testing at the at the point

48
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,360
of manufacturing which basically says

49
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,280
that at the point that i was done making

50
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,959
the product that it was free from

51
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,840
bacteria

52
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,480
this grant is going to allow me to do

53
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,280
challenge product challenge testing and

54
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,800
that

55
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,400
basically says

56
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,080
you've added a preservative is that

57
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,640
preservative the right preservative is

58
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,160
it going to do its job and so it will

59
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,440
actually they will

60
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,120
try and make the product fail

61
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,239
by adding different

62
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,239
bacterias or whatever to it and that

63
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,640
product testing is five hundred dollars

64
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,440
a piece and so that was just a huge

65
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,599
thing in order to do as much product

66
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:53,239
challenge testing as i wanted to do that

67
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,239
it'll help with that

68
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,239
you
