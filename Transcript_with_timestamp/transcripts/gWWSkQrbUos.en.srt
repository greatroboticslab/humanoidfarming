00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,500
straw input is a useful practice that

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,839
can improve soil fertility and crop

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,360
yields while simultaneously helping to

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:12,179
reduce greenhouse gas emissions

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,920
however if not done properly it can lead

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:18,960
to excessive emissions of greenhouse

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:20,880
gases such as CO2 CH4 and n2o

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,859
a recent study has shown that the

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,600
optimal combination of straw input and

10
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,760
management practices can help to reduce

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,560
these emissions while still providing

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,779
benefits to Farmers

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,180
this includes low straw input rates

14
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:36,300
straw mulching application of straw with

15
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:39,360
a high c n ratio long-term straw input

16
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,280
and no tillage combined with straw input

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,140
these measures have been found to be

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,600
effective at reducing greenhouse gas

19
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,520
emissions without sacrificing crop yield

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,739
or soil quality
