00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,960
Greetings, my rantians. Hope you all are

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,160
doing well today and welcome back to

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,000
another episode of Ano 1800. I am very,

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,960
very excited today because we're going

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,600
to be starting on a whole new set of

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:28,000
islands and these are given to us by

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,400
none other than Mr. major himself, the

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,239
banner designer for the Imperium. And I

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,399
am so excited to get these going. But

11
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:35,680
before we do all the, you know, talking

12
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,280
about the lore and all that stuff, I

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,800
just want to mention if you did happen

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,559
to come across the channel now and you

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,160
do like what we're doing here, by all

16
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,600
means, feel free go and check out the

17
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,360
channel, see if there's something that

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,200
interests you. And if you are definitely

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,039
interested, want to stick around, we'd

20
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,000
love to have you. The Imperium grows

21
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,239
very rapidly every single day, and it's

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,800
one click away if you decide to do so.

23
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,440
But now I want to get into the lore

24
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,640
behind the kingdom of

25
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,559
Sappin. The Kingdom of Sappin was

26
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,640
Lacarona's biggest ally in the border

27
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,880
regions. One of its islands being

28
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,360
directly annexed by Lacarona following a

29
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,040
succession crisis in the kingdom. As

30
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,360
such, the kingdom is made up of a bulk

31
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,000
of Lacarona infrastructure and fighting

32
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,560
capability. The Kingdom of Sapin was

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,040
also behind the Imperium's only defeat

34
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,400
in the border region conflict as they

35
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:27,680
successfully defended their land and

36
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,560
were able to ensure that Lacarona's

37
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,200
vanguard forces were able to flee back

38
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,720
into safety. Following the ceasefire,

39
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,880
the Kingdom of Sappin was stripped of

40
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,600
its capital and the aisle of Belffort

41
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,000
was given to the Imperium as collateral.

42
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,240
Although the queen has accepted Rantian

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,439
help, her people and especially the

44
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:51,040
nobility remain very divided as to the

45
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:53,119
current balance of power and some of

46
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,240
them straight up opposing Rantian

47
00:01:53,119 --> 00:02:00,040
intervention in the region. However, our

48
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:03,200
goal is to win the hearts of the Sepini

49
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:05,600
people. We did have to do what was

50
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,640
necessary in order to win the war. That

51
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,680
that much is clear. But I did not want

52
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,560
it to be at the expense of nations that

53
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,920
were pulled into it. This nation in

54
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,720
particular, of whom was extremely

55
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:24,879
strong, has a very long history and is

56
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:28,000
even deeprooted with La Corona itself.

57
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,480
Our goal is La Corona. Our goal is not

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,239
to destroy any nation that aligns with

59
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,000
them because we don't know whether

60
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,040
they've been in any which way, shape, or

61
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,519
form coerced into doing so. And that is

62
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,000
why we are here today. Why we are going

63
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,319
to work to restore the kingdom of Sappin

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,560
to the best of our ability and improve

65
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:50,239
our relations with this incredible

66
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,560
kingdom. Naturally, we're going to face

67
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,480
our own challenges. That is for certain.

68
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,360
We don't have access directly to

69
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,080
Imperium supply lines. But we will make

70
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,840
sure that our fellow Rantium

71
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,840
protectorates in the region help us with

72
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,519
the restoration of not only the first

73
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,920
island that we're working on being the

74
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,400
island of Remo, which I'm hopefully I'm

75
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,720
saying that correctly, but also for

76
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,599
other islands that are based with the

77
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,319
kingdom of Sappin itself. And there are

78
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:21,360
a couple of little checkpoints and

79
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:23,599
missions and quests that we have to do.

80
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,239
Mainly the objectives part is the most

81
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,959
important for me. So now getting out of

82
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:32,000
the role play for a second. What Mr.

83
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,599
Major has done is has essentially when

84
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,519
we broach when he broached the subject

85
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,799
to me way back he was telling me that

86
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,959
there were certain bits

87
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:42,879
of tasks that he would think is really

88
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,400
the best way of going about winning the

89
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,280
hearts of the Sapini people. And I

90
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,519
really like that because it, you know,

91
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,040
obviously builds upon the lore and the

92
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,440
reason why we're doing this cuz I mean

93
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,400
in the grand scheme of

94
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:58,799
things, would the Imperium 100% want to

95
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,680
restore a nation that did fight it even

96
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,920
though we didn't see them as a true

97
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,239
target? Not particularly, because that

98
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,159
is our time and our resources. But we

99
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,640
want to make sure that the world is

100
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,439
shifting in our favor and we're going to

101
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,519
do this to the best of our ability. So

102
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,799
the main objectives here are to place

103
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,160
the training post in the middle of the

104
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:21,519
imp placement which is going to be right

105
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,840
over here. Every house and service must

106
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,240
be built on the water which means

107
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,080
something kind of similar to what we did

108
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,840
over here with Imperial Albahan which

109
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,720
they were very very impressed about that

110
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,040
we were able to rebuild this nation over

111
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,720
down here. Uh this also goes into

112
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,080
specific skins which I won't go over

113
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,080
here. We'll just talk about them when we

114
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,479
get to them. We need to have a

115
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,400
population of 500 farmers and 500

116
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,320
workers with specific skins for those

117
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,240
ones, which we will see in a moment.

118
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,000
Have every mine and pits running with

119
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,880
electricity. That should be simple for

120
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,040
us to do. Place at least one dream spire

121
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,560
in a statue of Lady Morning Star on the

122
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,400
island. Totally fine. No NWCU

123
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,759
infrastructure allowed. Sorry, Shadow.

124
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,120
That's that's literally right here. I

125
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,120
can't do anything about that, man. You

126
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,680
You have to fix this. I I I can't help

127
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,680
you out with that, buddy. and no market

128
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,759
stands allowed. So the little guys that

129
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,840
we have just as a little reminder for

130
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,520
everybody, the ones that we have like

131
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,440
right over here. So without further ado,

132
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,600
let's get to work because there is a lot

133
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,080
of stuff that we have to do and it is

134
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,639
going to be a doozy of a build. So first

135
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,880
and foremost, I do have a bunch of

136
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,000
images that Mr. Major has provided to me

137
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,759
in order to make sure that this works

138
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,160
properly. And I very much appreciate not

139
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,400
only the time but the willingness to do

140
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,160
so, right? It's really important. And

141
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,759
what I've done in the meantime is bring

142
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,039
over a whole bunch of resources so we

143
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,800
don't have to worry about it. Your

144
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,960
leadership hopefully we'll see that

145
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,639
happen here very quickly. So the very

146
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,479
first thing that we want to do is we

147
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,400
want to try to pre-plan everything. And

148
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:56,080
every airship that you see here, minus

149
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,840
this one, this is for another uh another

150
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,080
settlement that's still based with the

151
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,840
Kingdom of Sappin itself. These three

152
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,800
plus the ship that's bringing a whole

153
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:08,639
bunch of resources over from New Albian

154
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:11,600
are part of this island and only

155
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,800
designated for this island. So, the very

156
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,120
first thing I'm going to be doing is

157
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,479
building up this oil refinery and

158
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,960
shutting it off because there's no

159
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,960
reason for it to work. If this thing

160
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,000
wants to be any louder, I'm not entirely

161
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:26,800
certain. But we are going to also get

162
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,960
the main roads built up. And we're going

163
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,759
to start it off by bringing it up to

164
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,880
like somewhere

165
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:34,720
here. And this is going to be real

166
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,639
important what's coming up. It's It's

167
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,560
really crucial. It's really crucial.

168
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,360
We're going to be going over here to the

169
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,120
Ranty Imperium ornaments. And now I have

170
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:48,840
to find It's this one.

171
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:52,160
Awesome. The other base going banner and

172
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:54,800
banner. So pretty. So pretty. Love to

173
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,039
see it. It's awesome. So, in the very

174
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,840
middle, we are going to be putting an

175
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,680
administration building for land owners.

176
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,919
And we're going to have to increase the

177
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,240
population size here quite a bit in

178
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,120
order for this to really work. But, this

179
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,960
is going to be the first place for

180
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,080
it. I think this is not a bad spot.

181
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,919
Actually, you know what? Let's bring it

182
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,840
a little bit further up. I'm just trying

183
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,319
to see what would be the best placement

184
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,880
because there is a little hill right

185
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,599
over here. So, I think if we put this

186
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:26,720
thing like maybe right here, it would be

187
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:29,199
kind of okayish. Maybe. No, I I changed

188
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,440
my mind. I changed my mind. It needs to

189
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,840
be built on the

190
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:35,840
road. What the

191
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:38,479
heck? Oh, that was weird. It had to It

192
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,479
had to fix itself up for a second. So,

193
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:44,319
we'll put this one right over here. I

194
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:46,880
can't follow the diagram exactly as is

195
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,880
cuz we I did not know that there was a

196
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,400
freaking hill over here. But what I'm

197
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,039
going to do is because the road actually

198
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,280
does go down to here. I'm just going to

199
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:59,039
bend it and bring it down. So at least

200
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:01,039
we have our foundation set right here. I

201
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,520
think there will be indeed. Look at

202
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,360
this. Look at what the game makes me do.

203
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,720
There's one way to go through here with

204
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,720
the train tracks. And we want to get

205
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,520
that sorted so we at least get some oil

206
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,919
going right now. And I'm trying to see

207
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,479
as far as where the oil should go. It

208
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,639
should be right over on this side. So,

209
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:21,440
let's go ahead and get the oil harbor

210
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:25,120
situated as well. And I'm going to build

211
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:27,120
it right here along with its oil stores

212
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,479
cuz I mean this is going to be important

213
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,080
considering what we're going to be doing

214
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:34,959
here. Oh crap. Did Okay, it's even. It's

215
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,039
even. God bless. Awesome.

216
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:40,399
All right. So, that's the next step.

217
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:43,200
Then, we want to connect up the train

218
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:46,399
tracks with the oil refinery, which is

219
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:50,080
back here. And we're going to go ahead

220
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:52,080
and do the typical tactic of having the

221
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,640
parallel tracks, but they're going to

222
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,640
have to go in a particular way. Not

223
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,120
necessarily straight on. I don't think

224
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:03,440
it's possible, but we can try it. Uh,

225
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,800
let's go from back here, maybe.

226
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,959
Is this still connected? Yeah, I think

227
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:10,360
it is. Still is. All right, there we go.

228
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:14,120
Let's go from about

229
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:16,800
here. Might be a little bit too

230
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,279
much. I lied. We're going to go from

231
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,680
over

232
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:22,600
here. And I will try to bend it up just

233
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,959
so we

234
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,959
can bring it right past the

235
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,440
administration building because that is

236
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,519
kind of the plan

237
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,720
here. And I'm going to get rid of this

238
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,399
one.

239
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,040
What did did it do anything over here?

240
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,080
Oh, they're not connected. What the

241
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:42,160
hell? All right, now they're connected.

242
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:44,480
Great. And I'm going to leave one row in

243
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,320
between that's open like this and just

244
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,880
keep

245
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:50,880
it. Let's bring it to about here. And

246
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,800
then from here down, it didn't want to

247
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,920
connect here either. For some reason

248
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,640
today, it just does not want to

249
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,120
cooperate with me. And then in here,

250
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,839
we're going to connect it up with the

251
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,360
second side. make it look a little bit

252
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,560
easier in that

253
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,959
regard. And we're going to bring it all

254
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,279
the way down to here, which it doesn't

255
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,440
exactly line up, but it's still fine.

256
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,200
We're going to do it anyway. And we're

257
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,360
going to do the same with this. Now, the

258
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,880
island of Remor, hopefully I'm saying I

259
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,680
don't want to say it the American way.

260
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:24,800
The Remor I I will I'll say it, I guess,

261
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:28,160
in that way for now. Remor is meant to

262
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,959
be a bread basket region for the kingdom

263
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,560
of Sappin. So, naturally getting this

264
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,480
place built up and if we can get some

265
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,279
really decent trade relations going

266
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,120
here, that would be fantastic cuz I mean

267
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,800
what we're planning here is going to be

268
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,440
pretty substantial. Now, I have to

269
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,360
unfortunately do this, which is to link

270
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,480
up a couple of these tracks together.

271
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,600
Otherwise, it's going to give me that

272
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:52,079
horrid, oh yeah, parallel tracks. Yeah,

273
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,640
have fun with that, champ. Go ahead and

274
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,720
link this one up and then this one up.

275
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,120
And that should be pretty good. So, what

276
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,959
we're going to do is start this up and

277
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,079
that's going to be 1 second

278
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:06,399
oil. That's wonderful. And the cool

279
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,800
thing is when we actually colonized this

280
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,120
island, we were able to get the I think

281
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,320
it was

282
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,160
unifier. Yeah, I think it was unifier.

283
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,480
Yeah. So, plus 100 island workforce for

284
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,959
this. So, regardless of whether we had

285
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,880
any workers here at all, this is still

286
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,279
going to work out just fine. And I think

287
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,440
just based off of the uh the vibe that

288
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,760
I'm getting, we should go with the uh

289
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,160
steampunk type skins. So, let's go with

290
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,240
the Steam Liner. And that's the only

291
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,320
ones that we will see here. Now, what I

292
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,560
want to do is start getting to work on

293
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,200
the main harbor area, which is going to

294
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,920
be absolutely crucial. And I also do

295
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,320
have a little bit of

296
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:46,880
a bit of diagrams I can pull from if in

297
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,800
order to do so. I really love it that

298
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,440
you guys are are doing this. I really

299
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:54,720
do.

300
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:56,399
So, it may not be exactly how it's set

301
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,640
over here, but we're going to do our

302
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,640
best cuz the big Betty areas, we'll have

303
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,399
to go over. And where the hell are even

304
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,720
the big betties? Right over here.

305
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,240
Monster guns. Well, we're going to need

306
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,639
some soldiers over here in order for

307
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,680
that to work. But this is meant for one,

308
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,279
and this is meant for the other. So,

309
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,720
those are going to be the two spots

310
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:19,839
there. And then more island storage

311
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,440
capacity is going to be right next to it

312
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,360
over here. And I'm going to do the same.

313
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,240
I'm just going to bring it down to make

314
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,959
it even with this one. I think it'll be

315
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,880
even. Let's see. I could potentially

316
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,399
even put it in front, but I want to make

317
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,880
sure I follow the diagrams to the best

318
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,639
of my

319
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:39,519
ability. There we go. I think that's

320
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,680
pretty good for now. And just in order

321
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,480
to make this spot look nice, we can

322
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,240
either try to put another pier or

323
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,360
another depot right behind it. But in

324
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,360
this case, it's not going to fit

325
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,240
properly. So, I'm just going to do this.

326
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:55,000
And I'm going to cover this up with some

327
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,279
of the keys over here. Should be

328
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,360
okay. But this spot is just different

329
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:02,000
because the the way that the shoreline

330
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,320
is is a little bit wonky. So, we have

331
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,320
those and we're going to get some more

332
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,320
depots

333
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:12,279
going specifically to have them face

334
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:14,720
inward a little bit like

335
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:17,360
this. So, the ships should be able to

336
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,680
come into the main harbor area. And even

337
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,399
in this particular situation, we can

338
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,240
have some more. There are spaces in

339
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,399
order to have some additional depots.

340
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,920
Like there there can be one there. I

341
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,680
think if I position this a little bit

342
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,000
different, we can have one there, too.

343
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,240
But I think on over on this side, I will

344
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,240
just fill this out with keystreetss. And

345
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,000
then later on, this is a really cool

346
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,680
thing. Every time someone has a

347
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,680
suggestion and they're watching the

348
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,600
videos, they message me later on and

349
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:47,040
they talk about it. So then I'll know

350
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,120
what to do later on and fix the areas

351
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,079
that they want to have fixed. That's

352
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,800
really, really cool. Along with that, we

353
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:57,600
are going to go ahead and get the

354
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,120
fisheries built up. So, the fisheries. I

355
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,399
think what I'm going to do actually is

356
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:05,519
just hug the road

357
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:07,360
along the depot and the key over here.

358
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,279
My mouse wants to work. That's a whole

359
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,560
different story in and of itself. And

360
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:15,720
bring it out a little bit over to about

361
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:20,160
here. Going to do the same on the other

362
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:22,279
side. Uh, that does look fantastic over

363
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,639
there. I don't like it when it

364
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:26,720
swaps. H was going to swap at some

365
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,600
point, isn't it? Unless I fix it right

366
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,680
now. I guess I can do that. Let's see

367
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,320
how far it goes. We'll bring it to about

368
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,320
here.

369
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:40,320
Okay. And we'll bring this over to about

370
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:44,240
here. And the cool thing is because the

371
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:48,000
kingdom of Sappin has ties to La Corona

372
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:50,880
through marriage and just the longevity

373
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,760
of their whole, you know, relationships

374
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:56,639
and whatnot. They have some valuable

375
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,800
intel that they can provide to us. We

376
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:02,160
need that intel in order to get to the

377
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:04,240
new world. That's Lacarona's base

378
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,000
territory. We have to make sure we get

379
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,079
this information. And that's another

380
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,360
reason why we have to be on their good

381
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:13,560
graces. Let's go ahead and build up some

382
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,320
of the initial fisheries right over

383
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:18,800
here. So, we'll have three fisheries and

384
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,120
then another depot area which is going

385
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,880
to be right about here. And it's

386
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,240
literally going to be mirrored on the

387
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:28,160
other side as well. So like right there.

388
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,399
Uh are any of these the old town skins?

389
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:34,279
Shoot. That's brings you in, master. Uh

390
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:37,199
you need to change. You need to be this

391
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:39,760
one until we get some people actually

392
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:42,320
here. I'm probably going to stop the

393
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,600
production of like these two to follow

394
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,480
because we just don't have enough

395
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,160
people. So stop you nap in the hay and

396
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,680
stop this one. That actually looks very

397
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:53,120
cool to start off. That's for

398
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:55,839
certain. And then there's a couple more

399
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:59,839
fisheries over on this side. So, we'll

400
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:01,600
have one over here and one over here.

401
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,279
The airship is coming back. Love to see

402
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,240
it. Just trying to make sure that it

403
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:11,120
doesn't swap its skin on me. This one.

404
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,120
Ah, there it is. And this one. Pretty

405
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:16,240
cool. Go ahead and bring that down to

406
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,920
here. And bring this one down to here.

407
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,680
Pause you. Pause you. I'm not doing the

408
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,839
shift tactic because some of them can

409
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,800
work and that's fine. We don't need all

410
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:27,519
of them to be functioning at the moment.

411
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:29,839
So along with that, we have enough room

412
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:32,240
for more than likely ships to get in

413
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,920
here when they want to trade out because

414
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,560
not all of the goods that are going to

415
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,560
be sent out from this island are only

416
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,920
going to be via airships. And each one

417
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:45,120
of them have been named specifically by

418
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,959
Mr. Major. So I went ahead and did that

419
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,920
as well. I can't get the one all the way

420
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:52,240
back. There we go. The Venti is meant

421
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,600
for another island. I just I built five

422
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,440
just because I need to have something

423
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,199
that's fast and I didn't want to use the

424
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,199
other ones just yet until I know exactly

425
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:01,839
what to do with them. So, what we have

426
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:03,519
to do now is we need to get the harbor

427
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:06,000
area actually built up with a whole

428
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:08,760
bunch of people. And where in the heck

429
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,199
is the harbor city? There it is.

430
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,120
Awesome. What we're going to do is we're

431
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,360
going to start off with some base farmer

432
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,039
residences. And I think this is going to

433
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,520
look pretty nice. Hopefully, it'll work

434
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,919
out for

435
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:25,319
us. There's our first people over here.

436
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:28,559
I'm going to go ahead and get the

437
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:29,559
streets put up. Life is so so. All

438
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,480
right, hold

439
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:35,039
up. Now, now this is going to freak me

440
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,760
out cuz I can't put these. Where is the

441
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:39,840
marketplace? There it is. Here's the

442
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:44,320
marketplace. And we are going to swap it

443
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:47,679
to the ornate market. There we go.

444
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:50,240
That's what we like to see. Right. Right

445
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:53,679
now, I have to make sure that I get the

446
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,760
brick housings, which is this one. And

447
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,880
we're going to swap all of their skins

448
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,919
to the brick

449
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,440
housing. I think I'm going to do some

450
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,799
beautifification work from time to time,

451
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,039
like over in these little bits and

452
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:07,120
pieces over here. But we have to provide

453
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:09,760
them with all their services. So, like

454
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,600
we have the morning at sea, and that's

455
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,840
going to be pretty important. Oh, what

456
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,200
the heck is this? You like Oh, no.

457
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,320
That's for tourism. We We don't care

458
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,000
about that one. Oh, there are power

459
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,760
plants here. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

460
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,120
So, that that kind of works. I had no

461
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:26,640
idea that was even here. Cool. Uh the

462
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:29,320
only issue is do the farmer schools

463
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:32,559
actually have

464
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:35,520
a one at sea? Oh, they do. Awesome.

465
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:37,080
Great. Love to see it. Let's put this

466
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,120
right over

467
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:43,000
here. And we're going to get some more

468
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,000
of these homes built up.

469
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:48,000
kind of hold them right

470
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:52,640
there. And then we should probably put I

471
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,039
have to figure out where the heck. You

472
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:58,320
know what? Let me just take this and put

473
00:18:55,039 --> 00:19:00,480
it where the docklands is and city

474
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,240
institutions probably where the paved

475
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,240
streets are just so I can get to them

476
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,760
very

477
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,280
quickly because now we should be able to

478
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,280
get every single one of these fisheries

479
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,960
online. That's really important. I think

480
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:16,720
what I will also do is potentially start

481
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,720
bringing in some work clothes or having

482
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,559
them mint being made over here is

483
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,520
something that wasn't necessarily

484
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:25,039
discussed quite yet, but I feel just to

485
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,120
air on the side of caution, which I

486
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:29,840
normally do, uh, I'm going to bring them

487
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,600
in from another source, and that will

488
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,400
allow us to see the harbor area actually

489
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:36,720
at work. So, there's this ship, right?

490
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,240
And let's see where's a place that has a

491
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,640
whole bunch of work clothes that they

492
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,720
don't need. Maybe Sier has them. Yep,

493
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,880
that seems to be a decent amount. How

494
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:48,240
about we

495
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:51,200
take three instead of the max over to

496
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:54,400
the island here, which does indeed have

497
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,080
its own section right here. But I will

498
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,080
probably change its name to make it a

499
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,039
little bit

500
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,799
better. All right, what else you all

501
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:04,240
want? So, they're getting their fish in.

502
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:06,160
That's wonderful. Uh, let's see. I think

503
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,960
the water the water is going to have to

504
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:11,520
be something that's built on land. So

505
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,039
temporarily an explosion in one of your

506
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:18,480
factories. Oh, sweet

507
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:21,600
Jesus. Hey, this is great. You know what

508
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:24,559
this building is right next to it? Let

509
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:27,760
me let me just show you. It's great.

510
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:32,720
It's an effing fire station and that

511
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:35,159
happens. No one better tell me that this

512
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,159
is anything besides my

513
00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:38,159
luck.

514
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:44,080
Guaranteed. Guaranteed. I I will I will

515
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:47,919
die on this hill. It is my luck. It

516
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:49,679
is not the game 100%. Cuz I I'm telling

517
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,520
you that is the best that I could

518
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,080
possibly build and I put it right next

519
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,400
to the refinery specifically for them

520
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,480
blowing up. But you know it it just did.

521
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,720
It legitimately just did. I can't do

522
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,480
anything else about it. You reached a

523
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,400
new milestone. All right. Where's the

524
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,679
water? Clean water pump. We're going to

525
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:10,080
put the clean water pump right about I

526
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,840
think maybe about here. Please don't

527
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,320
leave your

528
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,480
And then the administration is only

529
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,880
going to pose a little bit of a problem

530
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,200
because the landowners are meant to be

531
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,799
like right

532
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:25,120
here and we don't have enough to provide

533
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:27,919
to them quite yet in order for the

534
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,520
radius to expand. So, let's see what

535
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,080
other stuff. Okay, so the morning at

536
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:35,360
sea. We're going to have to build that

537
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:39,440
in a moment. I think I'll put this one

538
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:42,400
like maybe it's actually really cool.

539
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:45,080
Put this one like right about here. How

540
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:48,320
far does the radius

541
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:50,080
go? Oh, I mean it goes pretty far. Yeah,

542
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,559
that's nice. Should be getting the water

543
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:56,080
in relatively soon. And we're getting

544
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:58,240
the work clothes in. So, that's lovely.

545
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,799
get a couple more farmers here. So, we

546
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,720
have to get up to 500 farmers and we

547
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:05,280
also need to get up to 500 workers in

548
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,600
order to get the farms rebuilt and all

549
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,360
that good stuff and make it look really

550
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,919
nice. I think what I'm going to do is

551
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,840
I'm just going to copy this, but then

552
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:17,039
I'm going to tilt it on its side and

553
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:21,039
bring it like right here. And the next

554
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:22,480
one we can probably like H what can we

555
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,720
put in the middle there? Well, we can

556
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,640
pull these guys and put them over here.

557
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:30,000
This market should reach all the way

558
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:33,159
back there. But we can also have our

559
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,880
city institutions being the harbor

560
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:39,559
police. We can have the old town pub

561
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:43,720
skin or the old world pub skin, excuse

562
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:46,640
me. And then we are going to have a

563
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:50,280
church, which the church I don't know if

564
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:53,440
I can swap it over on this side

565
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:54,720
to the other skins that I have. Well,

566
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,200
actually, you know what? I feel like

567
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,360
this would work.

568
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,039
I feel like this fits their vibe, but I

569
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,520
I I could be wrong. I'll more than

570
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:06,760
likely check it to see what's going on.

571
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:09,039
Uh Harbor Hospital is going to be

572
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:11,520
crucial. I think I probably would want

573
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:14,159
to put this over here then cuz it's

574
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:16,159
right in the middle as opposed to the

575
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,080
other one. Right. Yeah, this is going to

576
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:21,559
be a better spot for it. So, we'll put

577
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:23,679
the harbor hospital right over

578
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:25,679
here. And we're going to get a road

579
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,039
that's going to connect these guys cuz

580
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,360
over in the middle here, we're going to

581
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:31,840
do some work in a moment. And then the

582
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:34,760
police station needs to I think I put

583
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:38,320
the police station like right behind the

584
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:40,159
harbor. Uh what is this thing called?

585
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,919
Marketplace right there. I need to

586
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:45,280
change their skins. That's really

587
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:48,320
important. Change all their skins to the

588
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:50,880
brick ones. Very pretty. And we now have

589
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:53,280
200. And well, I mean, labor pool is

590
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,520
definitely going up, but I'm kind of not

591
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,280
counting the fact that When do we start

592
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,520
again?

593
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,880
Oh, yeah. They They need a warehouse.

594
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:04,120
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's That's the

595
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:06,679
thing. Where is the harbor

596
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:10,880
warehouse? Where' that

597
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:13,440
be? Not in here. I probably have passed

598
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,200
it multiple times before. That's

599
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,640
definitely not it. Wait, wait, wait,

600
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,720
wait. Big brain idea. New Albian has it.

601
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,960
It's right over here. I'm going to yink

602
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,760
it. I'm going to bring it right over

603
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,000
here cuz we're going to have to probably

604
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,799
position it. Yeah, let's let's position

605
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,600
one like right here next to the depot or

606
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:36,760
right behind it. This one over here.

607
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:39,840
We're going to have to put it maybe

608
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:41,120
here. That works. So long as I can get

609
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,960
to it, you know, that's the most

610
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,720
important

611
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:47,440
thing. And let's get some of these and

612
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:50,320
fill this out. Going to fill this out

613
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,120
and this side now too along with this

614
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,960
and

615
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:58,640
this. So our total amount of farmers

616
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:00,880
here right now are 386 rising land lush

617
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,120
and green. We're going to get some of

618
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,679
the horses now. And the horses stables

619
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,720
are going to be right over

620
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:08,600
here. And we're going to be expanding

621
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,440
upon this for sure.

622
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:13,039
So do bear this in mind. It's definitely

623
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,799
a work in progress. We don't have the

624
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:17,600
grain here yet, but we're going to be

625
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:19,360
working on that soon cuz all of this

626
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,440
island has been mapped out already. Let

627
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:25,320
me see the steampunk skin on

628
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:27,919
this. Oh, that's so

629
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:29,760
cool. That's awesome. If only all the

630
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:32,400
cars would have had the steampunk skin

631
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:34,320
with it as well. Okay, now is that

632
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,679
enough horses for them right now? Yeah,

633
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,520
it is. So, we're bringing in the

634
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:39,679
clothes. We're already producing like 20

635
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,440
fish over here. That's in That's insane.

636
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,600
You can even probably swap these out

637
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,840
later if we decide to get one of those

638
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,919
uh ridiculously powerful power plants

639
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,919
going here. Oh, that would be insane.

640
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:52,960
Oh, you know what we need? It's really

641
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:55,039
important. And I didn't even put this

642
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,720
thing down at all. Let's put down a fire

643
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,720
station. Yeah, we'll put it on this

644
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,640
side,

645
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,840
though. Makes it look a little bit

646
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:05,120
nicer. And then getting into

647
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:07,039
beautifification stuff. We're going to

648
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:09,120
have to utilize the Docklands one here

649
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:12,000
quite a bit. I'm just going to swap it

650
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:15,520
out with this Regal Standard. I know it

651
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,919
sounds like heresy, but I need the I

652
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,000
need the

653
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:22,559
stuff. Put that there. Can we fit in

654
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,559
some seating areas? No, but we can

655
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:29,520
probably put in like a

656
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:31,440
lamp. Uh, that's too large. Just fill

657
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,840
that out then. I'm happy that I don't

658
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,840
see the crates.

659
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:41,039
Okay, let's put one seating there. We'll

660
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,039
put another one of these over

661
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:50,320
here. Let's do this. Let's get a lamp

662
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,880
post there. A lamp post here. Where's a

663
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:55,440
little bit of a key? Let's grab that and

664
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,440
pull this. Actually, just do the middle.

665
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:00,039
There we go. Because on the sides, we

666
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:03,360
can probably just put down some like

667
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:06,880
trees like so.

668
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:08,279
And we'll get little spot to sit and

669
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,520
another spot to

670
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:14,120
sit. Three

671
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:17,960
entry. Very nice. Very pretty. Looking

672
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:21,440
cool. I think what we can do as well is

673
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:24,880
also build a couple of these homes

674
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:29,600
around here, too. The kingdom of Sapun

675
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:31,679
appreciates order. Order and uniformity.

676
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,720
So, I'm trying to do my best to make

677
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,480
sure that's actually

678
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:38,559
happening. Uh, that's the wrong one. We

679
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,559
have

680
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:46,400
to There we go. That's going to solve

681
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,559
that problem right there. Grabbing a

682
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:51,919
couple more homes. I'm going to put them

683
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:53,679
right about here and change their skins

684
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,799
immediately. So, what are we looking at

685
00:27:53,679 --> 00:28:00,000
here? We're at

686
00:27:55,799 --> 00:28:02,320
625 rising. Very cool. Very cool indeed.

687
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,120
So, we have our first little side right

688
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:07,200
over there situated and we're going to

689
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,320
need a lot of people here that are going

690
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,840
to be working like no tomorrow

691
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:13,840
guaranteed. So, bring in a whole bunch

692
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,559
of their other goods and services such

693
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,880
as like I don't know the sausages, the

694
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,640
bread, all that stuff. We we will do

695
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,080
this, but the only thing that we need to

696
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,399
do first is because this is a bread

697
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:27,440
basket region, we need to start working

698
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:30,640
on the farm fields. Now, in the very

699
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:32,960
middle, right, this area is designated

700
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,640
for the vegetable farms that are around

701
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:38,399
the administration building

702
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:42,159
because these vegetable farms will

703
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:44,080
become ridiculously powerful. And we do

704
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,080
have like pretty much every other one

705
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,760
that we can utilize over here. Actually,

706
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,760
we do. We have the potatoes, we have the

707
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:52,640
vegetables, we have grain, all that good

708
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:55,600
stuff. So, if we can probably work on

709
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,600
the administration a little bit, then we

710
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,440
can have probably have like total island

711
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,440
coverage if we get some land owners in

712
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,120
good spots, right? But this is too far

713
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,080
away, so that's not going to help them

714
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:08,559
out at all. But for the time being,

715
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:11,200
we're going to start off with the

716
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:14,279
vegetable farms. And vegetable farms are

717
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,720
going to start up from like probably

718
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:19,440
here. Actually, you know what? We're

719
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,960
going to get a small warehouse built up

720
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,960
first. Actually, this is a warehouse,

721
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:26,159
isn't it? I think that is a warehouse.

722
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,480
Yeah, it is. I totally forgot. So, let's

723
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:31,919
get the vegetable farm. I'll get one

724
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,080
started in a basic place like maybe

725
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,840
right over

726
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:39,039
here. We have the fertilizer silo. We

727
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:41,039
also have the plow barn, which I think

728
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:42,799
we're going to need some tools in order

729
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,320
to activate, right? Is it tools or is it

730
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:46,600
just Yeah. Yeah. So, we're going to have

731
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,279
to bring in some tools as

732
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:52,120
well. And then the fertilizer silo,

733
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:55,919
which is going to be right behind

734
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:57,720
it. Pretty cool. It's going to increase

735
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,919
the farm field

736
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,840
size. So, I'm just going to finish them

737
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:04,039
out with a shift tactic just to make it

738
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,960
look really

739
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:10,960
cool. Uh, we'll do the same over on this

740
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:13,360
side. Then get this one to here and get

741
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,600
these two built up. Man, I love being

742
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,159
able to pre-plan stuff, but holy hell, I

743
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:21,039
went out of freaking timber. Ain't that

744
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:24,360
fantastic? Love to see it. Love to see

745
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:27,559
it. And I thought I was doing so well

746
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:29,880
already. So, so well. Okay, that's now

747
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:34,320
10. No, that's

748
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:36,720
92. Let's get them over here. 96. So, we

749
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:40,799
have already satisfied one condition

750
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:43,279
being the farmer workforce limit. But

751
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:44,720
now we have to work on the workers and

752
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:47,520
getting some more of the farm fields

753
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,760
built up. It's already starting to look

754
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:52,080
very pretty. Uh the reason why we ran

755
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,600
out of a whole bunch of the uh timber is

756
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,000
because well I mean building all of

757
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:58,159
these is going to take a bunch. But uh

758
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,640
getting these ones too is also going to

759
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:03,919
be a fair amount. I'm I'm bringing in

760
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:06,559
one additional resource to the region.

761
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:09,120
And uh you see how the fertilizer barn

762
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:11,120
or fertilizer silo is actually working.

763
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,760
Yeah, it is because I've been also

764
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:17,600
bringing over some dunk from uh new

765
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:19,240
Albian. Yeah. Yeah, it was necessary.

766
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,520
Okay, it's definitely

767
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:24,399
necessary. Can we build this one? No, we

768
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,399
need actually to have

769
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:29,120
them. Let's see. I guess I could

770
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:32,799
pre-plan where the other ones are going

771
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:34,559
to be to start off. Let's grab this and

772
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:37,320
put it over here. I'm going to just put

773
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:40,760
it in blueprint mode for

774
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:43,919
now. And we'll get

775
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:46,720
there the barn. And we'll also get this

776
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:48,880
one over here. And then do the exact

777
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,760
same thing we did on the other side.

778
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,279
Right over here. I want to see if I can

779
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,279
No, I don't want to copy it. I kind of

780
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:57,200
want to mix it up from time to time. You

781
00:31:55,279 --> 00:32:00,320
know, it shouldn't all look the exact

782
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,919
same. That's my opinion when it comes to

783
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,720
farm fields because even if you go and

784
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:06,880
see the real things, right? They're not

785
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,559
all looking the exact same. They all

786
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,039
have different layouts based off of the

787
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:13,519
land. And I really want to try to stick

788
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:15,000
to that. So, let's get this road all the

789
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:18,279
way over to

790
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:23,039
here. And we'll extend it like

791
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:24,120
this and get the fields positioned

792
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:28,559
around

793
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:32,440
it. Kind of just tuck it in.

794
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:34,320
Is that Max? Oh my god, that was

795
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:36,559
awesome. That's going to look really

796
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,799
nice. We should have a spot for an

797
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:41,519
Imperial Trade Union here as well. Where

798
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:43,919
is that other airship? You know, it's

799
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:46,240
has the funniest uh clipping issue over

800
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:48,720
in New Albian. Is it there right now?

801
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,960
Look, look at this. It's all the way in

802
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,840
the freaking

803
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:55,240
building. It's hilarious. I love it. You

804
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,600
love to see

805
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,960
it. All right. Can we fast forward this

806
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,799
so we can actually, you know, get what

807
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,919
we need over there? Where's the ship? I

808
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:04,640
thought there was a ship hitting over

809
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:07,679
here. There is one. Where it is? Where?

810
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:09,519
Where it be? Oh, there you are.

811
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,760
Hi. You're just chugging away, aren't

812
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,279
you? Well, we are going to fast forward

813
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,679
this so we can hopefully get that

814
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:17,679
airship over here too in order to

815
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,720
continue our build cuz it's going to

816
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:22,640
really suck if we just cannot continue

817
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:24,880
without any timber. You know, I guess I

818
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,039
can do this. I can probably set another

819
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:30,480
one of the airships for the time being

820
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:32,799
to bring some over. Lift achieved. Let's

821
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,240
open a trade route menu. Uh we'll take

822
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,840
it from New Albian because this is the

823
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:39,039
place that has the most timber right

824
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:42,320
now. So just bring a whole bunch over

825
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:44,679
right over to here. Nice. Hey mouse, you

826
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,559
want to work? That'd be really

827
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:50,679
fantastic. How fast this thing's

828
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:50,679
zooming. Jesus Christ.

829
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,840
I'm going to fast forward some more

830
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,320
because I want to see this ship. It has

831
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:59,120
to go all the way through this. And I

832
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:02,240
think it's possible. It has the same

833
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:04,320
size as the one that Alvahan has for the

834
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,919
most part. So, I think not the ship

835
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,399
itself, but the main harbor area

836
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,399
entrance,

837
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:15,159
etc. And the airship is coming in at the

838
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:17,520
same time. That's actually a really cool

839
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:19,119
scene. Oh, dude. This guy's actually

840
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,879
looking at it at the same time. It's

841
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:22,359
actually coming in.

842
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:25,359
That was perfect

843
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:25,359
timing.

844
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:33,359
Awesome. All right, moment of

845
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:35,359
truth. Can you go in? Yep. Awesome.

846
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:36,879
You're You're going to crash into a

847
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:40,760
whole bunch of farming vessels or

848
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:44,079
fishing vessels, but nevertheless, it

849
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:46,879
worked all the way to the back. Okay, so

850
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:49,760
what's the deal here? The horses are

851
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:52,679
probably not enough then. No, they are.

852
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:55,359
They are indeed enough at least for the

853
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:57,760
one. And now we have some more timber in

854
00:34:55,359 --> 00:35:00,160
here. So the more we build these, the

855
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:03,119
more we're going to actually have to get

856
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:05,480
with the horses and whatnot. So the

857
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:08,400
administration is going to go all the

858
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:10,560
way. Even if we don't change it up for

859
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,079
the most part, it's going to be this

860
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,720
radius.

861
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:17,040
But we can have some of the regular

862
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,560
wheat fields over and grain fields over

863
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,520
in the back, which I'm not opposed to

864
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:23,760
doing in the slightest. So, I'm going to

865
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:26,280
extend this road. I'm going to bring it

866
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,240
somewhere to like right

867
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:30,040
here. And first thing we're going to

868
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,680
have to do is going to put down a

869
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,880
warehouse. Going to be the most

870
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,599
important thing. It's going to be the

871
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,400
centerpiece of this whole spot. And then

872
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:41,440
head over to the uh workers, right? And

873
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,760
we need to find the bread. There it is.

874
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:47,200
So, the grain farm grain farm is going

875
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:48,480
to be utilizing the steam motors and all

876
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,920
that good stuff, which is going to

877
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:54,000
require us to build a fuel depot here in

878
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:57,440
a moment. So, let's go ahead and put

879
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:01,079
this one down. We put our love into

880
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:05,440
this. I know you do, sweaty. I know you

881
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:07,920
do. And then the tractor barn we can put

882
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,640
down immediately. I think I'll put it on

883
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,560
this

884
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:14,880
side. Let's have like one little piece.

885
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,880
And we do indeed have enough steam

886
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,400
motors here to last a lifetime. So, I'm

887
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,320
going to put both of these into the

888
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,280
stockpile and then move the venty

889
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,280
probably over to

890
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:28,800
here. Let's go ahead and build that up.

891
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,359
Fields might help. Okay, woman. All

892
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,640
right, hold on. Hold

893
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:35,359
on. Actually, get a lot more fields than

894
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:38,320
what I anticipated originally.

895
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:40,000
like that's 135 as opposed to what it

896
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:43,200
normally is base game which is in the

897
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,760
200s for this. But let's go ahead and

898
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,599
get the fuel station underway. Now, this

899
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,440
is going to require us to have some

900
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:52,320
workers, which we will go ahead and

901
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,560
upgrade in a moment. And we can go ahead

902
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,599
and put the fuel station, which is going

903
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,960
to have a pretty decent

904
00:36:56,599 --> 00:37:01,040
radius. Yeah, so far it's like getting

905
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,440
everywhere. So, go ahead and put this

906
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:06,400
thing like right over here. I think this

907
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:08,800
is a nice spot for it.

908
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:11,520
And now we need 75 workers. So, we can't

909
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,800
have you guys doing anything right now.

910
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,280
We're going to go ahead and upgrade a

911
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:18,079
couple of these guys hopefully soon. Uh,

912
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:20,800
the horses. Horses again. Okay, hold on.

913
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:23,200
Well, I'm bringing in some of the rain

914
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,839
now. So, let's get a horse training

915
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:28,640
ground set up for them. And then we're

916
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:31,800
going to build a whole second set right

917
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:34,160
next to it. That's going to look very

918
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:36,480
pretty. And you are already getting

919
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:40,160
overloaded. So, let's go ahead and put

920
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,880
down a small warehouse right here on the

921
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:44,960
other side of the administration

922
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:48,240
building. I think we should also have

923
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:50,720
like the occasional police office and or

924
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:52,160
police station and fire station, which

925
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,119
over here we're going to be prioritizing

926
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:56,720
the

927
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:58,800
volunteers. We have a volunteer fire

928
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,960
department right over there. We'll also

929
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,480
have a volunteer one conveniently

930
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,119
positioned right over here. when I get

931
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,400
more timber in. So dumb that I'm

932
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,760
constantly having this issue. Where's

933
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,440
the other one? Are you bringing the

934
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,760
timber? Okay, you don't need to wait.

935
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:15,040
Just Just go. Just go.

936
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:17,760
Shoot. No, you don't need to go back.

937
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:21,640
You don't need Okay. All right. Go.

938
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,640
Zoom. Thank you.

939
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:28,400
They take forever to load and unload

940
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:30,320
naturally. I I get it.

941
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,760
Let's bring that airship over here as

942
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,320
quickly as possible because I don't

943
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,839
really want to slow down this build

944
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:37,680
whatsoever. I need to get workers out

945
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:39,760
here as quickly as possible and I need

946
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,800
that fuel station working now. So, how

947
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:45,760
much oil do we even have in the oil

948
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:48,400
harbor? Oh, just a casual 850 already.

949
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:51,119
This thing is ridiculous. Okay, 1 second

950
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,960
oil is crazy. And I don't even have the

951
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,800
silo built up, which I don't even think

952
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,560
it would do anything for us unless it

953
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,560
provides extra goods every couple

954
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,079
cycles, but that's entirely up for

955
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,240
debate. I've never used it before, so

956
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:05,920
I'm not entirely certain. Ready to fly.

957
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:07,440
Great. Oh, wrong button. Can you deliver

958
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,800
all of that, please? It's probably not

959
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,320
even going to be all of it. Oh, no, it

960
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,960
is all of it. Awesome. 93 timber is just

961
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:17,440
perfect. So, build

962
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:20,000
this and let's get some of these guys

963
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,920
upgraded. This is where we started off

964
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,560
at. So, I'm going to bring these guys

965
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,560
in. A new milestone.

966
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,760
And then followed by these guys. How

967
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:31,280
much do we have

968
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:33,520
now? Well, we haven't provided them with

969
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,880
other things. We We can get them up kind

970
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,599
of close to the school, but that needs

971
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:40,000
750 of them. I need to maintain the

972
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:41,599
happy balance or start working on this

973
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,280
side, which is totally possible. There's

974
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:44,520
even more room over here, too, if I

975
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,440
really want

976
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:53,599
to get these guys upgraded. That brings

977
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:56,160
them up to 430 59. How about this? Wow.

978
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:58,000
Okay. Well, we got the workers to a a

979
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,400
good state, but we completely screwed

980
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,720
the farmers from getting that condition.

981
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,440
We can we can just get a whole another

982
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:08,480
set built

983
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:10,520
up. There we go. Easy peasy. And we'll

984
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:14,560
get two more over here.

985
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:16,400
Nice. Let's change their skins out so

986
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,400
they're at the right ones. So now we

987
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,800
have both of those initial conditions,

988
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:24,720
objectives, what have you, completed,

989
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:27,280
being 500 farmers and 500 workers on the

990
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:29,200
island, which is fantastic. And now I

991
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,359
can get this thing. Please stop. All

992
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:33,200
right, everyone. Back to it. Great.

993
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:35,680
Let's get to work. Let's get some more

994
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:38,200
of these fields operational cuz it's

995
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:40,880
going to be very, very

996
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:46,480
crucial. Got the next one over here.

997
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:46,480
We're going to build it up like this.

998
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:51,920
Okay, the tractor barn. It's going to be

999
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:55,280
looking really awesome once we have the

1000
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,280
all the tractors running over

1001
00:40:56,119 --> 00:40:59,640
here. Yeah, let's tuck it in like that.

1002
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:03,359
That's pretty

1003
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:05,920
cool. That's the next one. Uh would be a

1004
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:08,240
good measure to upgrade or update this

1005
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:11,839
one like maybe twice. Oh, we're getting

1006
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:14,480
the fuel in here. Awesome.

1007
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:16,640
We'll have a lot of wheat fields, that's

1008
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,640
for

1009
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:22,000
sure. Get this one here. Actually, you

1010
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,560
know what I'm going to do? I'm going to

1011
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:29,040
position a couple of them.

1012
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:30,480
Three like this. And then just taking a

1013
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,760
look see at the drawing here because

1014
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:36,119
there's a whole

1015
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:40,680
bunch. Don't want that skin for this

1016
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:40,680
one. At least for now.

1017
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:46,760
And then we'll have the roads kind of go

1018
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:49,560
in between each

1019
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:53,040
one. Make it look a little bit more

1020
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:55,000
natural. There we go. Uh get a little

1021
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:59,560
overhang on that

1022
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:01,880
one. Same for you. Uh you know what? Do

1023
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:04,400
this to like

1024
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:06,079
there. Imagine if this farmer pisses

1025
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:10,160
this farmer's family off. They will

1026
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:14,400
never be able to provide their harvest.

1027
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:16,079
Oh man, that's where my brain goes to.

1028
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,560
It's not like, "Oh, look, beautiful

1029
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:20,240
fields, beautiful farmers. Love to see

1030
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,920
it." No, it's going to be like, "Hey,

1031
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:25,119
you want to you want to piss him off?

1032
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,119
You're not getting your yield

1033
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:32,880
out. All right, let's build these fields

1034
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:34,640
to make it look all nice and pretty. Uh,

1035
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,640
you know what? Here's this is what we're

1036
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,760
going to do. I'm going to get rid of

1037
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:41,599
this stuff in the

1038
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:44,160
back. Let's fill out this spot so it

1039
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:46,480
looks really nice. And then drag it as

1040
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:50,040
much as we can there. This one on the

1041
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:54,240
other hand is going to go along the

1042
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:56,800
road. Link up there and then fill out

1043
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:58,920
this spot as much as possible and bring

1044
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:03,960
it further forward.

1045
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:03,960
Nice. The same over here.

1046
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,960
See what we can

1047
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:13,040
do. Yeah. Okay, that's a little bit

1048
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:15,760
better. I I like what it turned into,

1049
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,760
not what it was

1050
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:19,520
before. Very

1051
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:26,960
pretty. Oh, you know what? Interesting

1052
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,760
opportunity. We can probably even get a

1053
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:31,680
road going straight

1054
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:35,160
through like to about here to continue

1055
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:37,839
building some more fields over on this

1056
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:39,520
side. We should have enough fuel coming

1057
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:42,040
from this thing to power all these.

1058
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,920
Dude, this is going to be

1059
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:46,800
ridiculous. How much are we even

1060
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:50,240
processing right now? I I dare say it's

1061
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:53,040
a bunch. 18 so far and we're consuming

1062
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:55,200
one for our um our horses. But this is

1063
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:57,440
because not all of them still have fuel

1064
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,440
to

1065
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:02,000
them. This guy back here is going to be

1066
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
probably my favorite because uh well,

1067
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,599
quite frankly, it's in one of the nicest

1068
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,760
spots. I always like building these

1069
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:09,680
farms right up against cliffsides like

1070
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,440
this. I didn't think that we would only

1071
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,920
be having these these farm fields this

1072
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,960
small. Let me go ahead and do this. I

1073
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:21,240
will put one over

1074
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:21,240
here and another one right there.

1075
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:26,640
And you know, when it comes to 1800, I

1076
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:30,680
really do enjoy building farm fields.

1077
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:33,599
For some reason, it's very relaxing to

1078
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:35,440
me. So, naturally, when Mr. Major was

1079
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:39,960
talking about, you know, having a bread

1080
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:42,720
basket region, I was very, very excited

1081
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:45,680
already. And I know that Delta's also

1082
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:49,680
proposed a bread basket for New Albian,

1083
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:53,400
which I'm also very excited about.

1084
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:56,800
Get these about here and right

1085
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:58,880
there. Gorgeous, dude. It's gorgeous up

1086
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:01,280
here. Still more room. And I'm going to

1087
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,280
exploit

1088
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:08,880
it. Let's do this from here down to

1089
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:12,240
about here. We're going to get another

1090
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:14,319
warehouse and plop it down cuz I can

1091
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:16,640
already see that horrid icon that I

1092
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:18,480
absolutely despise and I don't want it

1093
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,960
to mess around with it too too much

1094
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,760
more. This this fuel station is in a

1095
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:25,760
prime location. It's prime. I can

1096
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:28,000
actually here I'll do this. Wa, that's a

1097
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,760
lot. Okay, let's upgrade it to maximum.

1098
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,440
We also have this guy. We'll upgrade

1099
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,280
that a little bit. I'm seeing my bricks

1100
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,359
go down, but then I also have these two

1101
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,599
airships in reserve, so I will use them

1102
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:43,839
if I need to.

1103
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:43,839
Uh, let's get this guy like right about

1104
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:50,160
here and this

1105
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:53,359
here. There's also a reason why I'm

1106
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:55,680
starting off with the the rain fields

1107
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:57,400
and that is because I know New Albian is

1108
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:00,720
having issues with

1109
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:03,079
um the bread supply and naturally having

1110
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:07,680
all of these built up is going to be

1111
00:46:03,079 --> 00:46:07,680
fantastic to get some over there.

1112
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:14,319
This is going to look kind of

1113
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:16,880
cool. Get the road over to this and

1114
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:16,880
we'll have the

1115
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:26,240
overhang. I think I might use the shift

1116
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:29,400
tactic here in the event that I Oh,

1117
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:31,480
maybe I don't. That's

1118
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:34,400
pretty.

1119
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:37,119
Yeah, that's ridiculous.

1120
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,960
Look at that, man. You want to talk

1121
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:40,800
about like probably the best

1122
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:44,400
advertisement for the Bright Harvest

1123
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:46,079
DLC? Here it is. This is This is what

1124
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:49,680
you want. This is what you get from it.

1125
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:53,280
And I tell you, it is hands down the

1126
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:55,760
best DLC of this game. You cannot change

1127
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:59,520
my mind. One can argue that New World

1128
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:03,359
Rising was very, very good. Okay, you

1129
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:05,680
have a point. But when it comes to this,

1130
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:07,599
this is just so ridiculously powerful.

1131
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:09,839
Bright Harvest will work from the very

1132
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:11,440
beginning of the game when you start out

1133
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:13,440
the very end, even if you forget about

1134
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:15,920
it. That's what makes it so cool. And

1135
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:18,560
not only that, it has ridiculously

1136
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:20,319
awesome ornaments, too, which you can

1137
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:22,960
utilize for farming settlements such as

1138
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:24,480
this. Anyway, so I'm I don't know why

1139
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,520
I'm doing a walking advertisement, but

1140
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:29,520
that that there there it is.

1141
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:32,160
All right, let's get the fuel into these

1142
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:35,480
guys. Now, I do want to kind of move on

1143
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:38,160
to another spot if I

1144
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:41,440
can. Oh, I see what the issue was over

1145
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:44,000
here. I Hold on. 186 bricks. I'm going

1146
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:47,760
to make this a double road again because

1147
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:50,720
there's going to be a airport later on

1148
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:55,119
built up here. So, I want to make sure

1149
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:57,119
that I get that spot linked up by a road

1150
00:47:55,119 --> 00:48:00,000
at least from right now. And it's going

1151
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:01,839
to be a long straight one over to this

1152
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,240
spot where the other two airships are

1153
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:04,240
just big

1154
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:09,839
chilling. Let's see. There's also meant

1155
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:11,119
to be a little village up here, which

1156
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:12,560
I'm not sure if I'm going to be building

1157
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:14,800
in this particular episode. We're going

1158
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:17,040
to be working on this island for a good

1159
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:19,440
couple of episodes, so let's bear that

1160
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:21,359
in mind as well. Let's see what it looks

1161
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,830
like with this skin. Oh, I kind of like

1162
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:24,520
this one a little bit more. I think it

1163
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:27,559
[Applause]

1164
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:30,880
works. Totally forgot about

1165
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:31,960
it. Swap that around. Let's get this

1166
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:35,280
one,

1167
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:35,280
too. Very

1168
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:45,599
pretty. I'll keep that one as

1169
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:48,400
is. And this one. Swap it out. Uh, do it

1170
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:51,839
this way. Yeah, that look nicer. Oh, I'm

1171
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:54,040
always busy, duck. The field 10.

1172
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:57,200
Still don't have any fuel into this

1173
00:48:54,040 --> 00:49:00,119
one or that one. Probably because

1174
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:02,960
they're still processing. Or are they

1175
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:05,040
delivering? Uh, missing goods. Still not

1176
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,760
there. You also don't have it. I can

1177
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:10,839
potentially build another road down

1178
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:13,680
here. Let's probably go ahead and do

1179
00:49:10,839 --> 00:49:15,079
that. Build into the farm fields. Yeah,

1180
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:18,960
that's really

1181
00:49:15,079 --> 00:49:18,960
pretty. Really pretty.

1182
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:25,839
I think I will extend this one with the

1183
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:27,720
shift tactic just to make it look very

1184
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:31,119
pretty over

1185
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:34,480
here. It's lowkey a beautifification

1186
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:36,839
episode for me. So, I hope you all don't

1187
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:39,680
mind. I get a little

1188
00:49:36,839 --> 00:49:41,720
bit too much with these farm fields from

1189
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:44,559
time to

1190
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:47,599
time. Uh, not all the way. How about

1191
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:50,640
like maybe to about here? Yeah. And

1192
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:52,760
there we go. Looks a lot nicer. So now

1193
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:54,480
they're getting the fuel

1194
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:55,839
hopefully. I think it should be

1195
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,319
delivering. Yeah. So we just need the

1196
00:49:55,839 --> 00:50:01,520
road connection up into this spot.

1197
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:03,920
Really nice. Really nice indeed. How

1198
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:07,280
much are we making now? I'm I'm going to

1199
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:09,440
lose it, aren't I? 45. Oh, we can do so

1200
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,760
much better. We can do so much better

1201
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:15,800
than this. It's insane. Oh, this one

1202
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,800
doesn't even have the fuel still.

1203
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:21,680
Really crazy thing about this too is

1204
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:24,400
fuel stations, they're going to require

1205
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:27,280
or they'll process the fuel at 15

1206
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:30,400
seconds a pop, right? But then the

1207
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:32,480
tractor barns process it at 5 minutes.

1208
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:36,079
So you're going to have one fuel station

1209
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:37,520
work for quite some time actually. So,

1210
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:40,319
don't ever be worried about the fact

1211
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:43,760
that you're running out cuz guaranteed

1212
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:45,839
you won't you won't if you have like one

1213
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:47,400
maybe two like let's look at the

1214
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:50,800
production right

1215
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:54,240
now. Yeah. So, like one right now is

1216
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:57,280
doing just fine for all those. Maybe you

1217
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:59,359
want a little bit more, but in the grand

1218
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,440
scheme of things, this should just work

1219
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:03,839
all all the time. It doesn't have to be

1220
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:06,960
micromanaged too too much. That's the

1221
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:08,559
beauty of this DLC.

1222
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:11,280
Yeah, that one maxed out. We need some

1223
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:12,480
more bricks. So, I'm going to Skies are

1224
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,880
clear. Which what are you bringing?

1225
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:16,800
You're bringing in the timber. Uh where

1226
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,280
are you at? Are you stuck? Wait, not

1227
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:21,440
there. Are you in here? Yeah. Ready to

1228
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:23,880
fly. You're just uh nestled in there.

1229
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:27,280
How about you get out and

1230
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:29,440
then press play? Airborne and ready to

1231
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,720
go. So, you can get over to the island

1232
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,000
very quickly. No, you don't have to head

1233
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,040
back. No, no, no, no. You're good.

1234
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,559
You're good. You're good. You can go.

1235
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:38,720
You can go. Thank you. Thank you very

1236
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:40,240
much. Really appreciate it. We don't

1237
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:42,480
need you to just be big chilling over

1238
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:43,599
here. We need the stuff over there now.

1239
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:46,400
There's a lot of bricks over here. I

1240
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:49,920
should probably bring another airship.

1241
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:52,000
You go over here. Actually, no, not you.

1242
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:54,720
Well, you're already on the way. And

1243
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,800
you're meant for this island anyway. So,

1244
00:51:54,720 --> 00:52:01,040
head on over. I think what I'd like to

1245
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:04,359
do is have a Imperial Trade Union

1246
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:07,440
position somewhere in

1247
00:52:04,359 --> 00:52:11,559
here. Maybe we can have it be like a

1248
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:14,160
administration type office over

1249
00:52:11,559 --> 00:52:16,000
here, which is going to later on like

1250
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:18,480
out of character. It's going to boost

1251
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:21,520
these farm fields by a ton if I get the

1252
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:23,920
right items into them. And some of those

1253
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:26,240
items actually do increase the amount of

1254
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:30,880
the farm fields and the yields provided

1255
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:30,880
from them. So that can work very well

1256
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:35,559
indeed. Have this set up over here. And

1257
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:38,400
then as far

1258
00:52:35,559 --> 00:52:42,040
as banners are concerned, we're going to

1259
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:47,400
have their own banners. Banner and

1260
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:51,680
banner. Awesome. That's sick. I need

1261
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:51,680
more. I need more of these.

1262
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:58,720
Nice day for it. Yeah, it is. Hell yeah,

1263
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:01,440
it is. I love building farm fields.

1264
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:04,960
I have to use just regular dirt path for

1265
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,960
now until the bricks

1266
00:53:09,559 --> 00:53:12,880
arrive. Very

1267
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:20,599
cool. I think one more over on this side

1268
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,599
will do.

1269
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:26,640
Uh, you know what? Hold on. While I like

1270
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:28,880
the placement, I think this would look a

1271
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,880
little bit

1272
00:53:34,839 --> 00:53:42,720
nicer. And then in here, shift tactic.

1273
00:53:39,319 --> 00:53:45,200
Sure. Hell yeah, dude. That's hands down

1274
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:47,839
one of the best areas I've ever made for

1275
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:50,400
grain farming. And this I I hate to say

1276
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:52,559
it, Patrick, it rivals Constantinople. I

1277
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:55,680
I I'm sorry. I got to say it. It really

1278
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:58,880
does. Ready to fly.

1279
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,880
Uh you can cut in

1280
00:54:01,559 --> 00:54:07,359
line. You can deliver all of this and

1281
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:09,720
even some of that and then you can fly

1282
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:11,920
away. No boost to that.

1283
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:13,920
Nice. A lot of work done. done. I mean,

1284
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:16,559
we got the basic infrastructure stuff

1285
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:19,119
done. And this being a huge freaking

1286
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:21,599
bread basket is going to be even better.

1287
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:24,079
So, with that local administration

1288
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:25,480
already set up, too, let's go ahead and

1289
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:28,559
pave the

1290
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:30,800
roads. And we can either continue. I

1291
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:32,640
spent a lot of time in today's episode

1292
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,559
working on these farm fields in

1293
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:36,800
particular, and they're not done yet.

1294
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:38,960
They can go all the way over to here.

1295
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:40,800
That's what the plan is. Actually, th

1296
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:43,119
this area is going to be even more

1297
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:45,599
insane. But now I'm kind of keen on

1298
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:47,920
trying to find some specialists to help

1299
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:50,559
us out with making these look even and

1300
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:54,200
act even better because right now, I

1301
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:56,640
mean, 20 seconds for some grain is just

1302
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:57,559
ridiculous. Go ahead and upgrade this

1303
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:01,599
one

1304
00:54:57,559 --> 00:55:04,000
once and then we can try to either a

1305
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:05,920
expand upon the vegetable farms, which

1306
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:09,880
we can do. I guess that's definitely an

1307
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:12,880
idea. And I'm going to do that one, I

1308
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:15,520
suppose. Uh, let's put you like right

1309
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,520
here,

1310
00:55:17,079 --> 00:55:25,599
please. Oh, interesting idea. Hold on.

1311
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:28,680
Interesting idea. Wait a tick. Have the

1312
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:32,559
the people celebrate your leadership.

1313
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:35,280
Barn right there. We can have the

1314
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:37,200
fertilizer be right here. You can have a

1315
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:41,200
couple like a little patch right there

1316
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:41,200
in the front. That'll look kind of

1317
00:55:43,319 --> 00:55:51,040
pretty. And then bring it all the way to

1318
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:51,040
there. Very cool. The building size is

1319
00:55:55,079 --> 00:55:59,520
ginormous. Build the road straight to

1320
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:02,799
it. And we'll do something like this.

1321
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:05,119
And I have a idea. Wait, wait, wait,

1322
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:05,880
wait, wait a minute. Hold on. I got a

1323
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:08,520
better

1324
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:12,640
idea. Put this one

1325
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:12,640
here. Put this one

1326
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:16,880
here.

1327
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:24,599
Nice. Now the island became a little bit

1328
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:30,000
less attractive. But now I have to do

1329
00:56:24,599 --> 00:56:32,480
this. Do I? I may not need to.

1330
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:36,880
This one is full yield. This one is full

1331
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:40,000
yield. A farm with no field.

1332
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:43,240
Uh, you know what? Head down the slope.

1333
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:45,599
Yeah, head down the slope. I have an

1334
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:47,520
interesting idea to pull here. Did that

1335
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:50,559
screw with this one? Yeah, it did. Okay,

1336
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:53,559
hold up. I'll fix it. No, no, no. Damn

1337
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:53,559
it.

1338
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:03,920
or

1339
00:56:59,079 --> 00:57:08,160
this. But this one right here. Okay. Not

1340
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:08,160
get rid of its farm fields like right

1341
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:13,839
here. This one on the other hand, it's

1342
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:17,680
going to be kind of weird its

1343
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:20,880
positioning. So, let me get rid of that

1344
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:22,359
one piece and put that here. One Piece.

1345
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:26,079
Great anime, by the

1346
00:57:22,359 --> 00:57:29,720
way. And this one.

1347
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:31,880
Ooh. Wait, wait, wait,

1348
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:34,079
wait. This

1349
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:36,960
too. Bring him a little bit further in

1350
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:41,319
the front. There we go.

1351
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:41,319
You need a warehouse. You do.

1352
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:48,119
And then from here, we can bring the

1353
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:51,720
road straight up to

1354
00:57:48,119 --> 00:57:55,200
them. Nice. Fill that

1355
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:57,599
out. Fill all this.

1356
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:59,960
I don't think it's possible regardless

1357
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:04,400
of whatever I do.

1358
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:07,200
65. Yeah. Yeah, that kind of sucks.

1359
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:08,480
Okay, I have to get rid of this one.

1360
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,839
That was unfortunate. If that would have

1361
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:11,760
worked, it would have been fantastic.

1362
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:13,760
But and I could probably toy around with

1363
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:15,760
it a little bit more and see what

1364
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:18,240
happens. But in the grand scheme of

1365
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:21,200
things, I'm just going to do the shift

1366
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:24,760
tactic and get this whole spot to have

1367
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:24,760
vegetable farms.

1368
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:30,480
Which then I will get rid of this one

1369
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:30,480
cuz I know there's plenty over

1370
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:39,520
here. Very nice. Very nice

1371
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:41,599
indeed. Very profitable, very powerful

1372
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:43,200
farming settlement already. How much

1373
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:46,119
vegetables are we bringing out from here

1374
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:48,280
now? Cuz you know we need to make

1375
00:58:46,119 --> 00:58:50,880
sandwiches. We are at

1376
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:54,880
40. Very nice. Okay, that's a lot of

1377
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:57,359
horses there too. 56 grain. Okay. Yeah,

1378
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:59,280
that's uh that's pretty substantial.

1379
00:58:57,359 --> 00:59:02,680
That's pretty substantial indeed. We

1380
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:06,799
could probably start exporting the grain

1381
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:10,480
out. And through that grain export, we

1382
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:12,720
can start up like potentially having

1383
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:14,319
some of the flower mills cuz look, these

1384
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:16,319
guys are working right now. It's not

1385
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:19,599
going to be here for the whole time.

1386
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:21,680
Yeah. See, we're almost out of flour.

1387
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:24,720
Uh, can we get the electrical flower

1388
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:27,359
mill going? This is going to be really

1389
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:27,359
good if it'll

1390
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:35,280
work. Going to mess with this, but

1391
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:38,400
whatever. Yeah, we have a ton of grain

1392
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:40,799
over in here. So, I need to talk to Mr.

1393
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:43,119
Major and Delta to see if there are any

1394
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:45,839
trade agreements currently going on just

1395
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:48,000
for myself to be like fully up to speed

1396
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:50,480
on this. Cuz the great thing about our

1397
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:52,079
community is when we have ideas and

1398
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:54,720
they're bouncing between people, sky's

1399
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:57,280
the limit. It's really awesome. I'm just

1400
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:58,559
not told all of them. So later on I

1401
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:00,000
they're like, "Oh yeah, we have this

1402
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:02,079
agreement." I'm like, "Great. Awesome.

1403
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,720
So now I can do this for you, etc.,

1404
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:06,480
etc." That's what I like. So if you guys

1405
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:08,480
do have ideas and you guys are talking

1406
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:09,920
about like trade agreements and such,

1407
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:11,599
please let me know because I want to

1408
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:13,680
definitely be in the loop with all of

1409
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:15,440
that. Thank you very much. Really

1410
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:18,079
appreciate it. getting a lot of

1411
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:21,040
vegetables out here. And there's still

1412
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:22,720
even more room to make more of these. I

1413
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:25,200
think just my favorite spot right now is

1414
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:27,440
going to be right over here until this

1415
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:29,200
whole spot in the front is going to have

1416
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:30,680
a bunch of vineyards. You know what? For

1417
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:33,440
the hell of it, I'm building one

1418
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:36,720
already. I have to do it. I'm going to

1419
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:38,200
do it. Actually, one vineyard at least.

1420
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:43,839
I have

1421
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:45,680
to put this one like right about here, I

1422
01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:49,920
think. base off of. No, wait. I'll pull

1423
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:49,920
it back a little bit more. Bring it

1424
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:55,400
here. We'll have a road go across. Link

1425
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:59,720
it

1426
01:00:55,400 --> 01:01:01,760
up. Going to have to have a warehouse,

1427
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:02,599
too. And we can put the warehouse right

1428
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:05,640
there, I

1429
01:01:02,599 --> 01:01:10,920
guess. Tractor

1430
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:10,920
barn. 192 fields. Let's go.

1431
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:20,720
and up to the Nope, I can't do this. My

1432
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:20,720
bad. Cuz I have to have roads go through

1433
01:01:24,839 --> 01:01:32,559
here. Really cool. And then this skin,

1434
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:34,400
it's just chef's kiss, man. It's

1435
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:36,799
awesome.

1436
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:38,400
So once this place also has its fuel,

1437
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:42,640
we're going to be getting a whole bunch

1438
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:45,200
of lovely, fantastic grapes from here.

1439
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:48,079
The administration, it probably is in

1440
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:50,640
the nicest spot along with the banners

1441
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:52,880
for this island. It's awesome. It's

1442
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:55,280
powerful. It's going to be ridiculous

1443
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:56,720
when it starts exporting its goods out.

1444
01:01:55,280 --> 01:02:00,280
What did you bring? A whole bunch of

1445
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:02,799
bricks. God bless you. Awesome.

1446
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:05,839
950. Yeah, I love seeing a maxed out

1447
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:07,520
brick over here. I think uh no, Albahan

1448
01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:08,880
does not have it. Alahhan's almost maxed

1449
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,559
on everything else except for the

1450
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:12,880
bricks, which is not receiving any

1451
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:15,280
anymore. Uh unless there are more

1452
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:17,040
explosions, that is, which I do hope is

1453
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:19,040
not the case. But it wouldn't be a

1454
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:20,799
Rantis episode without an explosion,

1455
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:22,799
right? An explosion, random fire. I'm

1456
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:24,720
jinxing myself. I should probably do my

1457
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:26,559
outro now because that's really

1458
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:28,319
important, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1459
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:29,760
Absolutely. So, we got a lot of work

1460
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:32,640
done in the grand scheme of things. We

1461
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:35,040
got the population sorted. We got the

1462
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:38,400
administration going. We have the

1463
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:41,040
vegetable farms and a bulk of the wheat

1464
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:42,559
or the grain farms also built up. So,

1465
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:43,920
we're going to be building a whole bunch

1466
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:46,880
more of those. We're going to work on

1467
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:48,960
the small village up there in the top in

1468
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:51,599
the next episode along with getting more

1469
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:53,760
of these farm fields built up over on

1470
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:55,839
the right hand side of the island before

1471
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:58,559
we head over to the left hand side to

1472
01:02:55,839 --> 01:03:01,839
get some more of the like for example

1473
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:04,240
hops, potatoes, all that good stuff. So

1474
01:03:01,839 --> 01:03:06,960
we can export and get the bread basket

1475
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:09,440
of the kingdom of Sappin back to what it

1476
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:11,280
used to be and improve our relations

1477
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:13,920
with them, which is extremely important

1478
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:15,760
to me. We have to do so. I don't want to

1479
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:18,240
have Mndde with any of the people in the

1480
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:19,319
border regions anymore. As the new

1481
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:22,559
regional

1482
01:03:19,319 --> 01:03:24,720
power, we have to do it and I'm glad to

1483
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:26,079
do it. So, until next time, my friends,

1484
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:27,359
thank you so much. Please consider like,

1489
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:36,000
really awesome build set. I'm so excited

1490
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:39,960
for it, and I hope you are, too. Have a

1491
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,960
great rest of your day, my Rantians.
