Another view of the panels with our amazing view. And there's the ocean. So this is my basic setup. This is 7 kilow inverter. I have my 10 kW battery lithium. Another one 10 kow battery lithium. So basically 20 kilow. Another interesting fact, we collect rain water from our flat roof that goes directly",
