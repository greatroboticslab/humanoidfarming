1
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,860
wind breaks and shelterbelts have many

2
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:18,869
benefits

3
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,580
traditionally shelterbelts have been

4
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:23,330
established for stocked shelter during

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,330
extreme weather

6
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:28,890
following the 2015 primary fire we heard

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,960
from our land holders and farmers have

8
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,880
shelter up to native vegetation impacted

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,860
on fire behavior and wind patterns

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,790
across the odd late rains and lower mid

11
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:40,170
north on the day of the fire here we we

12
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:43,770
decided to stay and defend the home

13
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:46,440
probably right up to the house so since

14
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:50,220
the fire we've actually started to to

15
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,740
regen and replant I had a look around

16
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:55,590
them and and really started to study the

17
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:58,290
trees that actually survived and then I

18
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:01,050
asked the question why did they survive

19
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:02,730
and everything else didn't but I'd

20
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,489
really like you oughta ask questions

21
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:07,860
it's designed around shelterbelts but a

22
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:11,430
lot of your plantings may be for shade

23
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:15,990
for making you feel better for your

24
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:18,259
gardens for reefs or or natural bush so

25
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:22,200
just ask today we're going to discuss

26
00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:24,719
the most important issues about shelter

27
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,229
belt planting and in reality that's good

28
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:30,210
planning and think about your property

29
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:32,729
as a whole and what do you want to

30
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:36,420
achieve into the future shelter belts

31
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:38,460
have many benefits they can provide

32
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,670
biodiversity they can provide fantastic

33
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:44,520
bird habitat they can Harbor insects

34
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:47,609
that will attack the pests in your crops

35
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,770
you'll get higher wall growths from

36
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:51,899
sheltered sheep dairy cows have

37
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,359
definitely shown an increase in milk

38
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:57,409
production if they're not so cold crops

39
00:01:54,359 --> 00:02:00,119
will increase near the shelter belts and

40
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:02,939
you decrease the evaporation across the

41
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:05,310
paddock the shelter belts decrease the

42
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:07,909
wind speeds and therefore your erosion

43
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,909
reduces

44
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:14,950
total votes should be placed at right

45
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,959
angles to the prevailing winds make sure

46
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:18,849
that you don't have too many gaps you

47
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,069
can get wind tunneling you can get

48
00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:24,069
increase velocities so if you can't

49
00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:27,130
place a gate at the end of a windbreak

50
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:28,530
you may need to redesign the ends of

51
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:32,560
those wind breaks to decrease that

52
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:35,739
impact of the tunneling wind if you have

53
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,230
a solid wall of trees it acts like a

54
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:40,269
brick wall the wind will hit it go up

55
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:42,489
over the top and cause turbulence on the

56
00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:44,140
other side so that becomes a bigger

57
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:46,500
problem than what you had before you had

58
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:49,330
the trees if you're going to have a very

59
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,950
simple shelter belt you need to be

60
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:53,620
permeable or the wind needs to go

61
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:56,560
through it so that decreases the speed

62
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:58,569
of the wind and less turbulence all the

63
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,940
way through the composition of a

64
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:03,010
shoulder belt should include small

65
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,140
shrubs on the outside rows slowly

66
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:09,090
building up to the largest tree row in

67
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:09,090
the center five rows wide

68
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:18,510
the species that you would be planting

69
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:20,250
usually local species that have the

70
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:22,319
right form for the position in the

71
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:26,310
shelter belt it could be you clipped or

72
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:28,500
a sea oak and a various perm abilities

73
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:33,510
but in general the outside rows and a

74
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:36,930
closely planted bushy shrubs this one's

75
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:39,659
a KC pendulum and I got about 15 trees

76
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,579
that I specifically went in God if you

77
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:44,129
can't use local species you can't get

78
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:47,040
enough height look for a plant that will

79
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:47,790
do the job but won't become a weed the

80
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,579
dry land

81
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:52,590
tea tree or the Melaleuca prevented fire

82
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:53,730
in and around our farm and our farm

83
00:03:52,590 --> 00:04:00,000
buildings and another in another

84
00:03:53,730 --> 00:04:02,180
location at least a year Allah hair do

85
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,099
you need to look at ripping your land

86
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:08,549
starting your week control and ordering

87
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:12,150
your plants ripping means that you can

88
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:14,459
get good subsoil moisture and a lot of

89
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:16,769
root development once you've planted

90
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:19,889
your trees you need to make sure that

91
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:21,750
you have air pockets taken out of that

92
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:25,169
rip line so that's why it's important to

93
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:27,090
have a year ahead in this region and the

94
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:30,690
agricultural areas of South Australia

95
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:33,120
it's really beneficial to plant before

96
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:37,560
the break of the season in April or

97
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:40,380
autumn the reason is that the soil still

98
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:43,320
warm and you can water before the break

99
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:45,810
and those trees will get roots into the

100
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:48,419
ground and get established before it

101
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:49,800
gets too cold to grow that means that

102
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:51,930
when it starts to dry out in the

103
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,870
following summer they're less needy of

104
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:56,760
water and so the planting and this

105
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:59,370
planting was the first planting after

106
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:03,510
the fire winning on irrigation in about

107
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:04,949
February last year plants came from the

108
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,570
Barossa Bush gardens and so the

109
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:09,900
prosperous garden supplied all of the

110
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:11,820
plants from here shelterbelts are a big

111
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:15,120
investment on a property but there are

112
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:17,190
wonderful compromise for planting they

113
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,889
provide so many benefits for the

114
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:22,979
property the habitat for animals and

115
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:25,470
birds and reptiles it's well worth

116
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:26,700
looking at putting in shelterbelts

117
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:29,370
you'll be better off in your bank

118
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:32,490
balance and the environment will be

119
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:35,610
better off in the long run in 2016 and

120
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:37,650
2017 land holders were given free native

121
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:39,360
plants tree guards and stakes to help

122
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:41,790
rebuild native vegetation across the

123
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,060
fire scar okay Chris what was your aim

124
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:46,440
was it to get height through here yeah

125
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,390
I'm trying to get a bit of height in

126
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,960
here particularly with like with this

127
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:53,700
sort of that's a commercial interest we

128
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,950
have a red gum type quite a tall tree

129
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:58,980
quite a big bit of structure coming off

130
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:00,860
the edges and there's a mix between that

131
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:04,740
and the saya she act that I've got here

132
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,880
and a pendulum which is a nice sort of

133
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,290
taller tree here

134
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,020
what I'm really just trying to get that

135
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:13,500
sort of structure in there in the actual

136
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:16,710
windbreak and help that develop and

137
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:18,840
using your Melaleuca as a really good

138
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:21,390
wind barrier which you saw was

139
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,240
successful in the fire yeah interfering

140
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:26,190
the flow to fire certainly the Melaleuca

141
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,320
that once it rubs up formed a quite a

142
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:29,730
nice break in other areas so we're

143
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,680
pretty keen to sort of see that clunk

144
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:33,510
and come back in hopefully we never see

145
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,890
another Pinery but we just want to make

146
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:36,270
sure that if we are planning and

147
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:39,030
planting trees we're planning and

148
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:40,169
planning for the next potential event if

149
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,160
you would like to learn more about

150
