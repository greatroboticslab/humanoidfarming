Just when I thought spring had arrived

for good, we woke up to a blanket of

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,000
snow. The kind that doesn't stay long,

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,320
from the beginning of the April, I

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,120
started working at our local garden

15
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,000
center. Again, it's a small place full

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,800
of green life, soil, and that quiet hum

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,879
of people who love plants. It's still

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,680
early in the season, and the mornings

19
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,360
are cool, sometimes even frosty. But

20
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,320
there's something special about watching

21
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:03,039
the place come back to life. Most of the

22
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,080
work is simple. Moving plants, sweeping

23
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:08,640
gravel, tiding displays. It's physical

24
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,360
in the best way. Your hands stay busy,

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,520
but your mind gets to breathe. There's a

26
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,759
quiet written to it. Birds hung in the

27
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,720
background. The smell of soil and wood.

28
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,200
A little green signs of life all around.

29
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,080
I learn something new every day here.

About plants, yes, but also about

31
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,360
patience, presence, and the pace of

32
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:34,950

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,200

64
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,840
to the city. We've been wanting to plant

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:42,080

cleaning supplies I was running low on,

We've been dreaming about planting this

There's something so grounding about

115
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,720
planting trees. They ask you to think

116
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,840
long term to believe in the years ahead.

117
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,000
It's a quiet kind of hope. We spaced

118
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,720
them carefully, gave them deep holes,

119
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,520
and tucked them in with fresh soil, a

120
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,080
lot of water, a pat on the root ball,

121
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,880
and they were home. They don't look like

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,440
much yet, but that's the magic of it.

You plant something small, and with time

124
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,840

189
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:09,600
alone just like that. I'm back to being

190
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:12,720
sober. We'll leave it all inside cuz

191
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,279
this way will never be over. You leave

192
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:20,200
alone just like that. You're back to

193
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:20,200
being sober. you feel it.

194
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,399
There's something about pansies that

195
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:28,160
feels like a gentle invitation to

196
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:30,320
spring. They're small but bold, braving

197
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,200
the last chills of the season with their

198
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,040
little faces turned up towards the sun.

199
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,360
They're one of the first flowers I

200
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,760
always reach for this time of year.

201
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,000
Hardy enough to handle a surprise frost,

202
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,959
yet bright enough to bring real color

203
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,120
back into the garden. I love tucking

204
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,360
them into containers by the front door

205
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,079
or slipping them into bare spots in the

206
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,800
garden beds. It's such a simple way to

207
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:58,240
live up a space and remind yourself,

208
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:01,279
yes, the gold days are ending. They come

209
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:04,560
in so many shades, deep purples, soft

210
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:06,720
yellows, gentle whites, and somehow they

211
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,920
always look like they're smiling. A

212
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:12,079
little joy blooming early. For me, they

213
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,160
mark the true beginning of spring. Not

214
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:17,240
when the calendar says so, but when

215
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:20,000
there's color in the dirt

216
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:22,519
again. Pansies are such a cheerful

217
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,200
little things, but they do have their

218
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:28,000
preferences. They love cool spring air

219
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,959
and can handle short frosts, even down

220
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,760
to around minus 5. It's part of what

221
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,920
makes them such a good early bloomer.

222
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,920
They like a drink about once a week,

223
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,639
depending on the weather, but not too

224
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,800
much. Their roots don't like to sit in

225
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,480
soggy

226
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:47,120
soil. A little plant food every other

227
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,200
week can help them bloom their best. And

228
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,839
if you pinch off the spent flowers,

229
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,320
they'll keep making

230
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:57,920
more. Their happiness in sunny or partly

231
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:00,160
sp sunny spots with well draining soil.

232
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,880
But when the heat of summer rolls in,

233
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:06,079
they start to fade. The muggy air is

234
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:08,480
just too much for them. So, for now,

235
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:11,279
while the days are still mild, I let

236
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,810
them shine. A short but beautiful

237
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:29,880
season. That's part of their

238
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:34,959
[Music]

239
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:37,040
charm. It gets me almost every time.

240
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,839
In the midst of

241
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:43,240
[Music]

242
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:46,519
summer, watching it in full

243
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:50,320
bloom always makes me

244
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:50,320
wonder when we

245
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,639
were when we

246
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:57,560
[Music]

247
00:14:55,639 --> 00:15:00,279
were just

248
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:04,030
kid one as

249
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:05,880
fall. We held our dreams within our

250
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:11,760
[Music]

251
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:11,760
hands. It happens every time. I wonder

252
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:22,440
how. But I can see my life so clearly

253
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:26,839
[Music]

254
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:32,160
now. Dared ourselves away from

255
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:35,320
home. Further out each passing day.

256
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:38,920
Gravel road towards the

257
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:42,639
sea. I blink and I remember

258
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,639
you. You and

259
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,959
me. You and

260
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:56,440
[Music]

261
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:56,440
me. It happens every time. I wonder how.

262
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:02,330
[Music]

263
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:05,459
But I can see my life so clearly

264
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:05,459
[Music]

265
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,519
now. I only miss you when I close my

266
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:16,240
eyes. It's amazing how much can sift in

267
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:18,720
just a week. The snow melts, the soil

268
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,440
softens, and suddenly your hands are in

269
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:24,480
the dirt, your eyes on the horizon. This

270
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:27,839
season is waking up slowly, and so am I.

271
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:30,639
One planted tree, one flower at a time.

272
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:33,680
There's still more to come. More seeds,

273
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:36,720
more soil, more simple choice. But for

274
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:39,560
now, this feels like enough. These early

275
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:42,320
spring days are full of motion, but not

276
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:45,279
rush. Growth is happening everywhere

277
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:48,000
slowly. Surely, and I'm learning to move

278
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:50,240
with it. Thanks for spending some time

279
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,400
with me in the garden. See you again

280
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:55,620
soon in part two.

281
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,230
[Music]

282
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:00,350
[Laughter]

283
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:00,350
