00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:17,439
[Music]

2
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,359
yeah hello my name is aim doberan I'm

3
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:21,960
the deputy director general for research

4
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:24,160
of the international rice Research

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,800
Institute or Erie and the gentleman

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:30,599
besides me here is Lee wild he's the

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:33,040
head of our experimental station and

8
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,920
what we want to do with you in the next

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:39,440
few months is actually learn how to grow

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,960
a crop of rice not just any crop of rice

11
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,360
we want to do it in the best possible

12
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,879
manner we can think of you now we are

13
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,199
scientists so we do a lot of research

14
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,920
and we believe that we know a lot about

15
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:53,399
rice and how to grow it in different

16
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,079
parts of the world and we have lots of

17
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,879
recommendations for farmers and

18
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,199
extension workers we often call them

19
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:03,039
best management practices you can find

20
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:05,799
them on on the internet on our knowledge

21
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:09,280
bank and extension materials in books

22
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:12,159
and scientific papers but what we really

23
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,280
really want to do is try to practice

24
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,640
what we preach because often we as

25
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,320
scientist may come up with uh things

26
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,400
that you know don't really work in

27
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,479
practice or sometimes you wonder why

28
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,360
aren't people using them so that's why

29
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:29,920
Lee and I have decided well why don't we

30
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,360
do it ourselves as much as we can do our

31
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,880
ourselves because some of the things we

32
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,770
may not be really qualified to do but

33
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:39,819
we'll try okay we will we will be

34
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:39,819
[Music]

35
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,759
qualified well this is day one of the

36
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,680
great challenge so and our first job

37
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:54,920
today is to level the field now Lee why

38
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,600
is leveling the field so important and

39
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,960
how do we do

40
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:02,840
this for wet seed rice you're dealing

41
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:06,360
with a with a Seedling that is 2 days

42
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:08,239
old young and very fragile and there's

43
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,440
the two most important criteria you've

44
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,760
got to meet early are water control and

45
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,920
weed control and in some ways they're

46
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,760
one and the

47
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,800
same so by leveling you can ensure that

48
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,800
each each seedling has a consistent

49
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,280
amount of water or a consistent lack of

50
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,280
water depending on what you're trying to

51
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,560
achieve at the

52
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,160
time so we really think leveling the

53
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,080
field is the very first and most

54
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,280
important step probably to get a good

55
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,720
crop established particularly if it's

56
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,599
wet seated dries as we want to do in our

57
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:43,239
agom challenge this

58
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:45,120
year yes we're targeting a high yield

59
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:46,800
and for a high yield we need a good

60
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,440
establishment density we need a good

61
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,640
number of plants in the field so we need

62
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,959
a good survival of and and uh growing of

63
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,239
the the seeds that we we will put out

64
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,840
with the drum seeder in 2 days time and

65
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,680
leveling is definitely the found

66
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,879
Foundation upon which a good high yield

67
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,879
is

68
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,440
built when you grow rice of course as a

69
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,840
farmer you have to choose a variety to

70
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,239
grow so we have chose in a variety

71
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,680
called n RC

72
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:24,959
222 or in the Philippines it's also

73
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,440
called locally TU beun 18 but it is

74
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,959
actually an eerie variety so it has also

75
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,840
the Eerie designation IR r

76
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,000
i54 now why did we choose this it can

77
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,239
yield with good management easily six

78
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,840
seven maybe even more tons per heor and

79
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:45,360
it is a relatively new variety we play a

80
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,239
lot of emphasis on this because more

81
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,120
recently released varieties are better

82
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:52,560
adapted to the current climate and they

83
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,159
can therefore have better adaptation to

84
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,799
the yield potential situation the

85
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:59,959
environment that we have nowadays this

86
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:02,239
variety was released in 2010 and that

87
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:04,079
just that factor using a more recent

88
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,120
variety can often give a yeld advantage

89
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:09,439
of 5 to 10% well we began with certified

90
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,200
seed now this seed has been germination

91
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,879
germination tested and it tested it

92
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:17,519
greater than

93
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:21,680
90% uh it was soaked uh put in water 36

94
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:23,919
36 hours ago and then drained about 16

95
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,040
or 17 hours ago and incubated for that

96
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:29,440
length of time it's it's got a short uh

97
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,080
route and even on some it's got a short

98
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,080
uh shoot

99
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:42,320
already so this is about

100
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,000
ideal for for using a drum cater that

101
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,400
we'll we'll touch on shortly the rout

102
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,280
and shoot could be a little bit longer

103
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,240
and it' still be okay so we've got a few

104
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:58,160
hours to spare which might be helpful

105
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:58,160
yeah um and the seed is is uh ready

106
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,680
what are we going to do

107
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,280
Lee I suspect the conclusion is we're

108
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,840
not going to drum

109
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:16,919
suit um this is the depth of our

110
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:20,400
mud so as such the the wheels of the

111
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:23,440
drum seeder sink too far into the mud

112
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,240
and hence the the metering units sit on

113
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,840
the mud and fail to function as metering

114
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:31,960
units do we do the a few a few met out

115
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,919
ahead once you okay just control control

116
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,160
just little little little little little

117
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:40,160
FES like like this you want to you do

118
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,160
like that yeah

119
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:47,639
see okay Lee on a scale 1 to 10 uh what

120
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,240
do you think we've accomplished in terms

121
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:51,800
of spreading our seed uniformally I

122
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,120
think when we started the field we were

123
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,240
barely five but overall I think I'd give

124
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,800
us a seven or an eight the uniformity is

125
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,680
quite good uh we're aiming for a plant

126
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,199
density of 50 plants a square meter and

127
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,000
there's plenty of seeds in the field

128
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,199
spread uniformly to achieve just that we

129
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,599
can lose a few seeds and we'll still be

130
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:13,199
t i i I had a lot of trouble initially I

131
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:15,240
was I think looking too much on the

132
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,400
ground trying to sprinkle seed in little

133
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,840
patches you know and but later I think I

134
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,039
got the swing you know like the broad

135
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,400
swing looking straight ahead walking and

136
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:27,080
through I'm I'm quite hopeful that I

137
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:31,120
improved over time but uh we'll see in

138
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,120
the week I guess what emerges

139
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:44,560
what we have here is an area that's

140
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,560
that's representative of the the higher

141
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,639
areas of the fields the areas that were

142
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,280
that were well drained so this probably

143
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:55,039
represents 50 to 60% of the

144
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:57,080
field the the drainage was good the

145
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:00,120
access to oxygen for the developing seed

146
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:02,639
has been good it's germinated quickly

147
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,919
and strongly it's got uh a green shoot

148
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,840
very quickly and its third Leaf is

149
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:12,440
already appearing this is

150
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:15,199
uh wet direct seeding as it should be

151
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:18,199
done these plants are

152
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,520
happy now what we have here is an area

153
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:22,400
that's representative of the the

154
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,919
intermediate Zone shall I say when we

155
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,680
seated it was too wet it was a little

156
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:29,080
bit too wet and gradually during the

157
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,800
week it gradually dried out but it was

158
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,440
still wetter than we'd like it to be and

159
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,039
you can see the seedlings are much

160
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,639
smaller they've had to fight for

161
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:41,400
survival for much of the week but they

162
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,919
are establishing and they'll be okay

163
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:46,240
even though they're slow The

164
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:49,080
Establishment density is lower but

165
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:53,400
overall it's an acceptable

166
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:55,639
result so the seedlings were

167
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,240
unhappy but now they're

168
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:01,599
okay what we have here is an area

169
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:05,479
representative of are of complete

170
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:08,280
failure the area areas like this may be

171
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:11,800
five somewhere between 5 and 10% of the

172
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:13,319
field stayed wet all week they've only

173
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,759
just become

174
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:17,840
dry uh that was too long for the rice

175
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,759
plants so here we have an area that's

176
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,520
completely devoid of rice seedlings all

177
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,520
the rice seeds have

178
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:32,719
died so what we have is an uneven feel

179
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:34,599
fi a non-uniform field the drier areas

180
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,159
have grown really well the intermediate

181
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:38,560
areas have grown okay they'll be okay

182
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:42,279
but the wetter

183
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:44,120
areas uh have been complete failures so

184
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:47,320
5 to 10% of the field we're going to

185
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:50,360
recede to give it that second chance

186
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:52,160
true uh being seated almost a week later

187
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,320
will mean it matures a little later but

188
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,519
rice does have a habit of catching up by

189
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,440
the time you get to flowering and

190
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,600
harvest so I'm not that

191
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,240
concerned I think in hindsight we were

192
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,680
seduced by technology we looked to the

193
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:08,680
laser leveling laser guided ler

194
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,760
equipment when in hindsight I think the

195
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,800
small equipment the the equipment

196
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:16,200
invented here in the Philippines would

197
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,480
have given us a More Level field so um

198
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,279
don't always assume the high-tech path

199
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,680
is the most effective one so we're

200
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,839
reating small areas just the wetter

201
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,640
areas the the drier areas where the rice

202
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:31,519
is okay that soil is now too dry it

203
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,560
won't uh seed successfully the rice

204
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,800
Roots won't penetrate the soil so

205
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,600
there's no point putting seed there

206
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,120
anyway we're focusing purely on those

207
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,640
small very wet areas with no rice in

208
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,640
them at

209
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:52,600
all now I'm also thinking over here

210
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:57,720
looking around here there's an area with

211
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:59,839
a rat fence over to our to my left and

212
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,560
now that that can be good because

213
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,000
if you do have a rat problem last year

214
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,959
there was a rat problem just here it's

215
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,680
good to have what we call a trap crop

216
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:11,279
where you plant an area early about 2 to

217
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:14,120
3 weeks early and then have traps with

218
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,839
multile capture traps entrances right

219
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:19,760
there so the rats are go in but can't

220
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:22,920
get back out again particularly after

221
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,959
the fellow period the rats there's big

222
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,880
disturbance during the fellow period And

223
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,839
The Working of the soil so the rats then

224
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,880
get move out of get moved to the edges

225
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:34,160
and they agregate and that's the best

226
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,839
time to manage them how we have here

227
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:40,320
trappy the rat and trappy is is used

228
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:42,160
often when I talk to Farmers and we will

229
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,720
show that they will enter into the Trap

230
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,240
here and he'll Force his way through and

231
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,720
rats yeah trap is big but see how they

232
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:52,600
sort of crunch down and rats can do that

233
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:54,480
as well the only thing that limits a rat

234
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,000
they they can disate their shoulder

235
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,680
shoulders what it's the width of their

236
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
head which indicates as the how big the

237
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,959
the hole is that can get in and with a

238
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,279
mouse you push a finger in a mouse can

239
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:08,480
get into a hole with a rat it's more

240
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:11,680
sort of a probably a large thumb so it's

241
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,519
usually about 12 mm if you got a hole

242
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,360
bigger than that then the rats can get

243
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,200
through and so often you know you don't

244
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,959
need a very big opening here the rats

245
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,680
will force their way through what do we

246
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,200
know about birds and their interactions

247
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,079
with suited R here in the Philippines

248
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,000
and elsewhere in Asia often it's it's

249
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:32,399
using of what you've got here the flags

250
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,399
to just caus a bit of of disturbance not

251
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,440
I have seen not far from here where they

252
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,600
have a little like a little windmill a

253
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,279
little ratchet on it making a noise and

254
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,360
that's suppos to keep the birds away as

255
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:45,560
well so it's it's looking at at noise as

256
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,560
a

257
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:58,519
deterrent we came up after many years of

258
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,240
research with tools that farmers and

259
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:02,079
extension brokers can use and I'm going

260
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:06,279
to use one of these tools here so what I

261
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:10,200
have here is a small tablet computer it

262
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:11,279
runs the Android system and we have on

263
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,880
this little

264
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:17,120
tablet uh an application or app as

265
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,760
they're called nowadays uh that we

266
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,360
released uh last year for farmers in the

267
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,639
Philippines as a first example it's

268
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,680
called nutrient manager rice or

269
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:29,320
sometimes also nutrient manager

270
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,519
mobile and it's very simple to use it's

271
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:34,120
all touch screen here as you can see if

272
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,839
you don't have a Android smartphone like

273
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,920
this you can also use it through a

274
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,880
normal phone and call a toll-free number

275
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:44,720
in the Philippines and all it does it's

276
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:47,760
asking you 12 13 14 questions about your

277
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:51,880
field so after I've done all this voila

278
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,880
comes out a fertilizer recommendation

279
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,849
[Music]

280
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:11,000
this is a horrible

281
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:18,549
[Music]

282
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,120
S one of the first issues with water

283
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,600
management is wet seated rice currently

284
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:34,480
is really sensitive to water if you have

285
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:36,320
too much water the the seeds die and uh

286
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,440
so that's why you need really good

287
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,720
leveling and secondly it's why we really

288
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,880
need to get anob germination tolerance

289
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:48,839
into rice seeds so that the technology

290
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:51,320
is less difficult and and less risky for

291
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:53,279
Farmers so this field was lucky after it

292
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,000
was established there was where a few

293
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,800
showers of rain which kept it going

294
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,399
nicely I don't think it's been irrigated

295
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:02,800
yet but I could just of flying fer and

296
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,399
so the ideal thing next will be to

297
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:09,079
irrigate to wash the fertilizer into the

298
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:11,399
soil uh one way to reduce the amount of

299
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:13,240
irrigation water we apply to rice is to

300
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:16,399
do what we call alternate wetting and

301
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:18,639
drying so this means we flood the field

302
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:21,360
then we let the water disappear we let

303
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,560
the surface dry down and then we re

304
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,519
irrigate

305
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,440
again and that anybody can do alternate

306
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,800
wetting and drying but the question is

307
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,279
how do you do it safely so that that you

308
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,240
don't lose any yield because rice is so

309
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:36,680
sensitive to Too Much

310
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,160
drying so over the years ER has done a

311
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:42,079
lot of research and and they've found

312
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:45,399
that if we let at the soil dry down

313
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:48,759
below about 10 or 15 kilop pascals uh

314
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:52,040
soil soil water tension at about 15 cm

315
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:54,519
below the soil surface the rice suffers

316
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,199
but 10 or 15 killer pascals probably

317
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:58,240
doesn't mean anything to you and it

318
00:14:56,199 --> 00:15:00,320
doesn't mean anything to Farmers some

319
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,720
really nice work with this really simple

320
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,839
field water tube which just shows you

321
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:09,880
where the water table is you could pull

322
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:13,120
it out I think yeah I'm P out can yeah

323
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,880
yeah 15 cm from the bottom so you should

324
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,800
push it into the mark you go a little

325
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,120
bit further it doesn't matter okay how

326
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,440
often do we think I need to come out and

327
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,839
check

328
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:25,800
the well it depends on the weather for a

329
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:30,959
start and uh it's but at least once a

330
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,959
week right tce once a week yeah

331
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:42,570
[Applause]

332
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,730
[Music]

333
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,680
now today we're measuring the plant

334
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,360
density in the field the plants have

335
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,639
started to tiller so it's getting a

336
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,680
little bit difficult to count but it's

337
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:04,360
still

338
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:07,040
okay I'm using a 0.1 squ M or 1/10 of a

339
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:09,240
square m ring manufactured from some

340
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,800
garden hose I stole from my

341
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:14,120
wife uh throw the ring at random

342
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,680
preferably over your shoulder that

343
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,160
guarantees fairly random and it's

344
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,560
several locations so you get it

345
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,680
representative of the

346
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:28,199
field and the results we got uh averaged

347
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:30,120
about 13 plants per per ring or 130

348
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:32,639
plants per square met but the lowest was

349
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:35,800
one plant per ring and the highest was

350
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:38,519
32 so there's a lot of variation but I

351
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,519
still think we're

352
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:49,800
okay uh Pinar do we need to worry about

353
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:53,839
insect at this early stage do we need to

354
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:56,440
spray no why not at this stage the the

355
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,720
insect damage is can be completely

356
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:00,040
compensated for by the plant so normally

357
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,440
the things you get at the early stage

358
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,680
are things like Leaf

359
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,280
folder little bit of leaf folder and wh

360
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,480
maggot wh maggot actually is the biggest

361
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:11,480
problem this time of year but as the

362
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,760
plant grows it just it just disappears

363
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,720
because the plant as the leaves get

364
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:17,360
thicker the maggots can't actually eat

365
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,400
the leaf but you know I I keep woring I

366
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,559
see things on the leav like this here

367
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,120
and know some chewed on it this is a wh

368
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:26,439
maggot that's a wh maget in there

369
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:29,559
nothing to worry about no problem no

370
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:33,720
problem it is yeah in fact this is even

371
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:35,440
light it's not even uh you know a normal

372
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,080
infestation of world

373
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,679
magget what is this here there's a some

374
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:44,039
egg M on it here whatever yeah these are

375
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:47,440
these are probably some sort of paracoid

376
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:50,559
that has sorts of wasp cocoon and these

377
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:53,240
are beneficial again so it's good news

378
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:55,600
uh these will fly off there about 40 of

379
00:17:53,240 --> 00:18:00,360
them there so they'll fly off then and

380
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:03,760
parasitize things like Leaf folder um

381
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:05,520
larve or um other caterpillars so

382
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:09,200
they're again a beneficial

383
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:11,440
insect fin bar I saw already saw a few

384
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,799
lady Beatles is what I would call them

385
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,919
are they are they playing much of a role

386
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,360
at this early St they're also very

387
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:19,840
important they're also feeding on on the

388
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:23,600
natural of the the herbivore insights so

389
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:26,200
they eat eggs mainly um also good uh

390
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,159
predators of apids and also the

391
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,720
dragonfly there's a lot of dragonfly

392
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:31,360
flying around one of the things when you

393
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,480
think about insects and rice you have to

394
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,679
remember that in the water another

395
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,679
problem generated by rice is mosquitoes

396
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:42,159
and the dragonfly Lara live in the water

397
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:44,799
they have a very big uh strong jaw and

398
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:46,640
they pre on the dragon on the uh

399
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:49,000
mosquito larae so they're keeping your

400
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,840
mosquitoes down so really there's a

401
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,679
whole ecosystem here functioning to keep

402
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,200
everything in order I mean one really

403
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,559
has to look hard to see all these things

404
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,840
I see a little spider web here and which

405
00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:01,360
some some little insects are caught in

406
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,640
there what are those these are those

407
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,559
 that are flying around these are

408
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:08,520
the decomposer so they're again

409
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:10,840
uh beneficial and spiders are very

410
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:14,360
important uh predators of things like

411
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:15,880
plant oppers mainly plant Hoppers so but

412
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,520
but you know when I look around I see

413
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:20,360
lots of crits here know insects of all

414
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:23,600
kinds of little things flying or

415
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:25,039
crawling or so is that one of the

416
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,559
reasons that some Farmers think they

417
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,360
have to spray because they see all these

418
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,240
insects but a lot of people don't

419
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,000
understand what they these insects are

420
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:33,080
doing so a lot of people when they see

421
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,320
these swarms of midges for example that

422
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:37,960
are decomposing the the material they

423
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,400
think it's a PL and they'll spray uh the

424
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,159
same with the wh maget one of the

425
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:44,520
biggest problems with world maget is

426
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:46,480
that it it induces Farmers to spray but

427
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:49,430
we never see any yield reduction the

428
00:19:46,480 --> 00:20:00,240
same with um uh Leaf folder

429
00:19:49,430 --> 00:20:02,840
[Music]

430
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,919
now our crop is finally starting to

431
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,960
exert itself it's within a week of

432
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:08,480
Maximum tillering so it's it's growing

433
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,440
quite strongly now and a lot of those

434
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,960
gaps that we've had to live with for

435
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,000
several weeks are finally starting to

436
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:16,240
fill in so we're feeling

437
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,919
better uh this week we're going to take

438
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,000
the opportunity to talk about uh what I

439
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:23,000
would call the biotic influences on the

440
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:28,360
crop and making an assessment of it so

441
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:30,240
that's how uh animals plants funguses

442
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,559
invol viruses how how they're

443
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,320
interacting with the crop both

444
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:38,400
beneficial and not beneficial I have

445
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:41,679
with me here Nancy Castillo who uh who

446
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,840
is a specialist in assessing uh rice

447
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,280
crops for for the biotic influences and

448
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,720
the level of injury that's coming from

449
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:50,919
it and Nancy and I will will step

450
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:55,000
through the process of assessing the

451
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:59,039
rice crop for insects for um for weeds

452
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:03,520
for and for dis diseases both from

453
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:05,200
viruses and funguses so uh in we go so

454
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,600
next week what we intend to do is that

455
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:11,600
we will be collecting data on injuries

456
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:15,840
caused by animal pest animal pest uh uh

457
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:17,919
refer to insect pest snails and rats and

458
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,080
then we will be also assessing injuries

459
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,760
caused by

460
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:24,520
diseases um viral disease bacterial

461
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:28,159
diseases and um

462
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:30,919
um fungal diseases and then we will be

463
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:34,200
also uh assessing uh injuries caused by

464
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:36,440
weeds since this is direct seeded rice

465
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:39,600
so we have here a quadrant what we call

466
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:43,240
as a We call we we consider some kind of

467
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:46,840
a magic weapon so this is equivalent to

468
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:50,880
one heel and transplanted rice so

469
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:55,640
we we would actually be sampling um for

470
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:58,799
for diseases and in and uh and uh insect

471
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:01,039
injuries we will be using um 10

472
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:04,480
quadrants we be sampling from 10

473
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:07,840
quadrants and then we would be also uh

474
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:10,120
taking uh um we will be sampling weeds

475
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:13,039
from three areas each area would be

476
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:15,640
about 1 M by 1 M so we would be

477
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:18,080
assessing weeds relative to the height

478
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:19,880
of the canopy and we will be recording

479
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,279
the type of weeds that we will find so

480
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:25,559
we have a sweep net yes this is a sweep

481
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:28,039
net we use this for uh counting the

482
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:29,480
flying insects in this case mainly Green

483
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:32,640
Leaf HPP

484
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:35,880
ERS uh Green Leaf Hopper is the vector

485
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:39,320
of tongro for the topping method we have

486
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:42,279
this small a pan here with water it has

487
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:45,880
a little detergent and we use it for

488
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:48,080
counting sucking insects like uh plant

489
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:51,640
Hoppers white back plant Hoppers Brown

490
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:53,080
plant Hoppers and in other in in the

491
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:57,720
surveys we do in other parts of the

492
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:59,159
Philippines we also catch rice bugs okay

493
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,960
okay um

494
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:04,799
black bugs rather so so with these these

495
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:07,080
magic weapons next week when the crop

496
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:09,600
reaches the stage of Maximum tillering

497
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:12,480
yeah you'll make an assessment uh

498
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:15,039
according to our yeah our data sheet and

499
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,799
then again uh in the reproductive stage

500
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,919
in in the grain filling and mature

501
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,279
mature stage uh we'll make another

502
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:24,480
assessment that should give us a good

503
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:27,440
idea of what biological things have done

504
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:30,440
uh both for and against our our rice

505
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
crop

506
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:44,480
yeah it's now about 45 days after sewing

507
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:46,640
so as you can see uh the crop starts

508
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:51,080
elongating so we have hit pretty much

509
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:54,720
the the end of the tillering and um it's

510
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,720
now time

511
00:23:55,159 --> 00:24:01,600
for the crop to develop more biomass so

512
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:05,320
you can see it's got a quite a few nice

513
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:09,240
looking tillers here in this place and

514
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:11,960
stem starts allocating now so we're

515
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:13,799
coming then gradually closer to what

516
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,760
will then be the next stage pacle

517
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:18,360
initiation when they uh the next thing

518
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:21,279
that we we also did today like we said

519
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:24,120
last week already ny's team just uh went

520
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:27,240
through around here and they just did an

521
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:30,440
assessment of all the uh different kinds

522
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:34,360
of crop damage might have had so

523
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:36,120
diseases insects weeds Even Rats so

524
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:38,279
we'll see what they have found out but

525
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:41,480
they went across the whole field and

526
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:44,039
stopped at about 30 locations and assess

527
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:46,360
what what we've got there so that'll be

528
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:48,600
interesting information and a bit more

529
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,159
objective than what we saw ourselves

530
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,799
sometimes we are getting biased by

531
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,720
thinking okay we've got this problem and

532
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:55,679
this problem this problem but they've

533
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:59,000
done it in a very systematic Manner and

534
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:01,960
we will see uh what they have

535
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,960
so but when you just sort of look around

536
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:07,039
uh the whole field here so from the

537
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,960
distance uh it starts looking actually

538
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:13,840
quite Okay so we've got a pretty good uh

539
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:15,640
dense uh green canopy building up so if

540
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,919
we can supports us now with enough

541
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,480
nutrients and good water management and

542
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,799
we don't run into more best problems we

543
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,799
should be okay

544
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:47,519
[Music]

545
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:55,080
60 days after sewing so the crop is uh

546
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:58,000
moving into heading stage you can see

547
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,679
it's getting quite tall so what I'm

548
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,159
doing here today is I'm going to check

549
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,679
whether we need a little bit more

550
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:05,440
nitrogen so just looking at it I have

551
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,120
the feeling that there are some places

552
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,600
where it gets a little bit yellowish and

553
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,640
we know that right now we need a lot of

554
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:13,520
nitrogen because the picles are formed

555
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:16,200
and we want to make sure that there's no

556
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:18,399
limitation of that important nutrient so

557
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:21,279
the tool that I'm using for this is this

558
00:26:18,399 --> 00:26:24,440
uh Leaf color Shard which has four

559
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:26,640
different shades of green and uh it

560
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:29,039
should guide me whether I need an extra

561
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,039
little bit of nitrogen or not so what

562
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,799
I'm basically doing is I'm walking

563
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:36,159
through the field and I've been taking

564
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:38,960
about 15 20 readings at different places

565
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:42,880
and whenever I hit the spot I'll

566
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:44,600
basically take a leaf the uppermost Leaf

567
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,880
I'll put it on the chart in the middle

568
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:50,039
of the leaf and I find the green shade

569
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:52,120
that matches the color of the leaf uh

570
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:56,039
best so this one here is matching

571
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:57,480
perfectly the shade number three and

572
00:26:56,039 --> 00:27:00,000
that basically tells us that we're

573
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,399
getting a little a bit low already yeah

574
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,880
but I have to take of course many

575
00:27:01,399 --> 00:27:05,080
readings because there's some

576
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,080
variability in the

577
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:10,240
Lea and I've done this now so I've just

578
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,600
finished this uh and I've concluded that

579
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,880
on average my Leaf color chart reading

580
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:18,360
is actually less than three so it's

581
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:20,840
between 2.5 and three in many cases so

582
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:24,559
that's why I've decided to put on an

583
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:26,799
extra amount of about 25 kg of nitrogen

584
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:29,120
as Ura at this stage and that should

585
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:32,399
probably complete our whole fertilizer

586
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:35,000
application regime other than that at

587
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:37,399
this stake of the crop there is really

588
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,240
nothing we can do at this point I saw

589
00:27:37,399 --> 00:27:42,279
some Wheats coming up here and there uh

590
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,399
no insect damage really that I'm worried

591
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:47,559
about right now so our decision to not

592
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:50,679
spray any insecticide so far seems to

593
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:52,880
work out and the rest now we need to

594
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:54,320
wait and hope for more sunshin so that

595
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,690
hopefully we'll still get some kind of

596
00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:04,399
decent yeld

597
00:27:55,690 --> 00:28:06,840
[Music]

598
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:09,519
so we start with a visual estimate of of

599
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:11,200
how ready the crop is and we we we first

600
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:12,840
look at the the proportion of yellow

601
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,799
grains the proportion of straw yellow

602
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:18,159
grains now Martin has suggested an ideal

603
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:19,880
amount for Harvest would be 80% yellow

604
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,519
now in front of me here we always have a

605
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:23,760
issue as to whether it's representative

606
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:27,200
or not it's

607
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:30,880
probably 50 to 60% yellow something of

608
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:33,279
that order it's not not quite ready

609
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:36,760
yet now a more objective and

610
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:38,960
professional way to assess how uh how

611
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:41,640
ready the crop is will be to measure its

612
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,679
moisture content yep and this is one way

613
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:45,880
to do that this is a moist meter So-Cal

614
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,679
moist meter it measures the resistance

615
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,720
of the crop which is uh basically

616
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:52,279
dependent on the moisture content and

617
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:55,320
you have a small sample tray so you take

618
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:58,720
a a sample from a panicle at least at

619
00:28:55,320 --> 00:29:01,960
80% of the of the grains should be STW

620
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,919
yellow that basically says 80% of one

621
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:06,840
panicker getting representative is

622
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:09,679
always a challenge there's no a

623
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:11,679
challenge so so uh you take a small

624
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,480
sample like this fill it in there and

625
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:16,519
then uh what you do with this instrument

626
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:20,559
basically you crush it oops can I give

627
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:22,880
you this it you turn the knob and crush

628
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:25,200
it turn it all the way to the end and

629
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,799
then uh you measure the resistance and

630
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,840
that gets translated in the reading of

631
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:31,399
the moisture content and it this case

632
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:33,519
it's 21.6% now what we're going to do is

633
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:35,640
mix The Greener one I've I've I've

634
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:37,039
harvested and because this is a very

635
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,760
small sample it's not really

636
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:42,039
representative neither for small plot

637
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,519
nor for the field so what you have to do

638
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:46,039
is you have to in one location you

639
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:48,320
should to different at least three

640
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:48,320
different

641
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:53,320
measurements so now in this sample for

642
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:55,960
example you have a lot more green grains

643
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:59,640
than in the previous one so the reading

644
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,640
should be a lot higher

645
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:09,919
27.9% and you would take at least three

646
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,399
samples and then you have a button here

647
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,960
where you can average the readings and

648
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:15,320
then you get the average reading for

649
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,080
that uh location and then what you have

650
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:19,120
to do is basically also measure in a

651
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:21,279
representative way in the field because

652
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,519
the the crop doesn't mature evenly

653
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,000
everywhere in the

654
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:26,960
field so Le is just getting a sample

655
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,840
from another location doing my best to

656
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,840
stay on my feet trying to find a green

657
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:34,059
[Music]

658
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:42,399
one it's probably semi

659
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:44,880
respectable yeah so there's still a lot

660
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:47,120
of straw particles in there not very

661
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,200
well thresh um what you want to have is

662
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,880
only grains in

663
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,760
there and it should be basically just

664
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:56,960
one layer of grains or a little bit more

665
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,960
than that

666
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,399
so we crush it

667
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:06,080
again take our

668
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:09,000
reading

669
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,440
27.7 and we can't do an average because

670
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,840
I just did that and we only have one

671
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:15,000
more reading in the

672
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:17,919
moment so it's well and truly above 24

673
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,600
might be 27 28 29 something like that

674
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:22,679
yeah in there we measured around up to

675
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:26,320
30% so so I think it's probably around

676
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:28,440
28 29 we're facing the final tricky

677
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:31,200
decision to irrigate

678
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:33,679
or not to irrigate that is the question

679
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:39,639
so we're considering how moist the soil

680
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:42,159
is now how moist is the soil now moist

681
00:31:39,639 --> 00:31:44,960
right we're considering what the

682
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:48,480
weather's like what's the weather like

683
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:50,760
hot dry and we're considering how long

684
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,960
we'd expect until we Harvest and our

685
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:56,919
consensus is about

686
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:59,159
10 days to 2 weeks something of that

687
00:31:56,919 --> 00:32:01,679
range it'll be close to 2 weeks time

688
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:05,360
before you're back to do the

689
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:08,559
D so we need this to last to to finish

690
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:13,000
properly I think it needs the two

691
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:14,679
weeks but it's moist it's heavy clay and

692
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,320
we do want our combine to stay on the

693
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:19,600
ground not to explore the

694
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:23,000
underground I

695
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,000
vote keep it

696
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:28,080
dry yeah I would have if it was an

697
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,600
experiment and I knew that we would be

698
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:33,679
doing hand harvesting I would put on

699
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:35,320
another irrigation just for safety but

700
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:37,760
we need to figure out that we have to

701
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:39,720
come in with a combine and so the

702
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:42,440
carrying capacity of that soil will be

703
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:44,080
the deciding factor and we can't delay

704
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:47,720
Harvest because we see some lodging

705
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:50,960
coming in so I go with the majority vote

706
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:52,960
yeah I agree so no more irrigation let's

707
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,039
see but I pray for a little bit of rain

708
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,399
tonight

709
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:58,679
maybe well on racing pattern I think

710
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:00,799
you'll probably have that have that wish

711
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:03,760
granted so there we have it we won't

712
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:05,840
irrigate again and we'll it'll be in

713
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:09,440
approximately 2 weeks we'll come back

714
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,440
and harvest about my

715
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:20,919
second yeah I was on a trip last week

716
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,639
and then Lee sent me a note that we had

717
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:25,200
70% lodging to when I came back uh

718
00:33:23,639 --> 00:33:27,159
yesterday afternoon the first thing I

719
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,679
did was rush out to the field and then

720
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:32,240
this is what I saw that's a lot more

721
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:34,080
than 70% so it's basically a complete

722
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,559
mess now

723
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,600
lodging uh I guess I can be many reasons

724
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:41,039
for this but probably the primary reason

725
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:43,399
is uh we've had a broadcast Zone crop

726
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:45,600
which is not anchored very deep in the

727
00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:49,440
in the saw we

728
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:52,000
had unnecessary rain now I would say

729
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,440
unnecessary rain and you can see it's

730
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,000
all lodging in One Direction here so we

731
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:58,760
must have had some wind too I don't

732
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,720
think we had too much nitrogen although

733
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:04,000
that obviously sometimes contributes too

734
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:06,720
so what we're going to do now Lee we're

735
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,639
going to harvest it so as I explained in

736
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,040
in an earlier clip there's one one

737
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:13,800
crucial Advantage if we if we take this

738
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,960
section of crop here it's

739
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:19,320
lodged but there's still some air space

740
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:21,480
under the crop there's 3 or 4 in of of

741
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:24,440
air space under there and that's a

742
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:26,000
crucial difference the combine the

743
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:28,359
combine won't have too much trouble as

744
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,639
long as we're careful

745
00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:33,440
um if it gets flatter than that then we

746
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:35,440
are in real trouble and that's that's

747
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:38,919
the concern ideally we probably should

748
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,599
wait one more day but there's already

749
00:34:38,919 --> 00:34:42,000
threatening looking clouds over there so

750
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:43,679
I think it might be time to act before

751
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,720
it gets any worse yeah and we had

752
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,639
another rain yesterday afternoon so I'm

753
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:52,399
getting nervous too it is still quite

754
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:54,200
wet underneath here but uh as long as we

755
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:57,040
get through with the combine and pull it

756
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:59,280
up well I think we have no choice let's

757
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,160
try it

758
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,640
the whole yeah I think we need to get a

759
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:06,079
initial cut yeah yeah initial cut and

760
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:07,280
then after that you could do yeah you

761
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:11,079
could have

762
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:15,480
some operation it is easy did you just

763
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:15,480
you just POS I know I

764
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:27,599
know yeah so that's that's nice not

765
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:27,599
perfect but nice

766
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:41,010
I had a lot of trouble going that

767
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:41,010
[Music]

768
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,240
way we've harvested the rice now we're

769
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:00,720
at the business end

770
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:04,040
where we Mill the rice into a product to

771
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:05,599
eat so uh the first thing that happened

772
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:07,599
after we harvested the rice is we took

773
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:11,119
it to dry it it was at a moisture

774
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:13,319
content of about 21% from memory and we

775
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:15,839
took it and dried it in a flatbed dryer

776
00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:18,440
down to a moisture of about 14% so

777
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:20,280
Mountain's going to uh measure the

778
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:22,400
moisture content of a sample before our

779
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:26,040
eyes and hopefully it's what our climate

780
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:29,520
is yeah so I can't actually measure the

781
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:31,839
sample uh that that has been in the mill

782
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:34,520
because uh it's already mil but I have

783
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:36,280
another sample here and uh the ideal

784
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:37,640
moisture content for for Milling is

785
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:40,839
between 13 and

786
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:42,319
14% and uh so the first step would

787
00:36:40,839 --> 00:36:44,200
basically be to measure the moisture

788
00:36:42,319 --> 00:36:46,599
content and this is an example for a

789
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:48,480
moisture meter the Eerie moisture meter

790
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:50,839
you you put a small sample of grains in

791
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,839
there and then you crush them and then

792
00:36:50,839 --> 00:36:55,680
by measuring the resistance it gives you

793
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:57,400
the moer content and this uh basically

794
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,880
tells you that the the sample that we

795
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,920
have is still too wet we couldn't use

796
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:03,280
that for Milling so that's more than 16%

797
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:05,680
it's more more than 14% than in this

798
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,839
case and and uh basically this would

799
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:10,040
also tell us if it's right for Milling

800
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:12,800
between 12 and 14% or whether it's right

801
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:15,440
for seeds what happens if you Mill it

802
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,720
when it's wetter than 14% if you Mill it

803
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,440
wet then the grain is very soft and and

804
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:22,920
we get a lot of damage in the in the

805
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:25,040
Rice Mill by uh basically the the

806
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,839
machines are crashing crushing the

807
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:29,720
grains and and so you're Milling would

808
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,599
be a lot lower and what if it's too dry

809
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:33,440
if it's too dry then it's too brittle

810
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:35,760
and again you get uh because of

811
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,520
mechanical stress you get more cracking

812
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,800
uh because it's so brittle and again you

813
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:42,720
get more more losses okay okay and for

814
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,760
the drying there are different options

815
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,920
uh the this grain was dried in the

816
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:49,440
flatbed dryer uh and but the flatbed

817
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,680
dryers are very simple technology that

818
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,079
can be locally produced and produces

819
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,920
reasonably good quality but then there

820
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:58,000
also more sophisticated dryers like we

821
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,720
have one over there which is a so-called

822
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,240
recirculating batch dryer which allows

823
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:05,040
us to produce really the optimum quality

824
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:07,000
of of the Patty before we do the Milling

825
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:09,200
after the the grain has been

826
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,079
dried uh to the appropriate moisture

827
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,280
content it's it's then delivered to the

828
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:15,319
mill and the first stage is the

829
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,800
dehulling where we have two rubber

830
00:38:15,319 --> 00:38:18,760
rollers set at a a very close clearance

831
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,640
to each

832
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:23,400
other and one roller is traveling just a

833
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:26,319
little bit slower than the other roller

834
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:28,400
and that that abrasion motion that that

835
00:38:26,319 --> 00:38:31,720
pins motion

836
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:34,440
removes the husk from the rice it then

837
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:38,480
goes on to a gravity table which then in

838
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:42,319
a in a horizontal reciprocating motion

839
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:46,400
uh it's on a slight angle and that

840
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:48,880
successfully removes the the held rice

841
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:51,000
the H brown rice from the rice that was

842
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,800
not successfully helded and the rice

843
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,000
that was not successfully H goes back to

844
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:58,319
be DEH

845
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,800
again after that it goes through three

846
00:38:58,319 --> 00:39:03,520
stages of

847
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:06,440
polishing an abrasion stone

848
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:08,160
polisher a friction polisher and then

849
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:10,720
you also have a choice of a Mist

850
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,880
polisher if you want that final shall I

851
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:16,119
call it

852
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:18,440
Sheen uh for a really quality uh quality

853
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:21,000
high quality product that really looks

854
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:23,240
as desirable as it tastes and there's

855
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,400
one final process after the polishing

856
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:28,440
process it's then it's then graded for

857
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:30,319
size both through a rotary sifter

858
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:33,359
and through a length greater and that

859
00:39:30,319 --> 00:39:36,079
separates the whole rice from the broken

860
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:37,920
rice the final stage in a sophisticated

861
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:40,280
Rice Mill is the color sort which is an

862
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:43,440
ingenious piece of technology that that

863
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:46,560
runs uh streams of of of milled rice

864
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:48,160
grain in a in a single grain stream uh

865
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:50,280
there's there's sensors that sense the

866
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,520
color of individual grains and if the

867
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:54,400
color does not is not white enough

868
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,760
basically that could be from poor

869
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,400
Milling it could be because it's a

870
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,839
foreign object like a stone there's

871
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:04,200
nothing as much fun as a stone in your

872
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:06,599
rice uh a a short sharp jet of

873
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:10,560
compressed air will remove the Grain and

874
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:12,839
so the those that final high standard

875
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:15,680
sorting processes is quite a common

876
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:17,160
process in in high standard rice meals

877
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:20,560
and then hence you have the finished

878
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:23,800
product uh whole grain WellMed rice with

879
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:26,319
a known quantity of brokens in it and

880
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:28,400
that's really the objective of the whole

881
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:31,439
process

882
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,439
[Music]

883
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:39,720
the good news is we made a profit that's

884
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:43,359
good not a huge profit but a

885
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:46,440
profit so we grew 5.24 tons to the

886
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:48,440
hectare of rice and we valued it at 14

887
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:50,160
pasos per kilogram here in the

888
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,920
Philippines which is equivalent to about

889
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:56,440
30 us cents or

890
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:58,440
$300 per ton of Patty rice in summary I

891
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:01,800
have these figures are particularly

892
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:06,680
visible to the film we earned $440 from

893
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:09,240
the field we spent $350 growing it so we

894
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:11,200
made according to this

895
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:13,760
$84 in

896
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:15,359
profit which at least pice for the

897
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,079
coffee we're drinking and a fair bit

898
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:21,040
more well that's for the field but uh if

899
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:22,520
we extrapolate this to a whole Hector

900
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:26,160
which is what a normal farmer would

901
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:27,800
probably have so that's a net profit of

902
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,440
335

903
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:34,480
per

904
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:36,240
Hector so is that a normal profit is

905
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:39,599
that what a farmer would be happy I

906
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:42,800
think it's uh um

907
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:45,520
probably quite common particularly if

908
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:50,040
you have deep well irrigation to and

909
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:53,319
pumping cost to cover yeah if you are an

910
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:56,480
irrigated Farmer in the Philippines who

911
00:41:53,319 --> 00:41:58,800
um has access to Canal water of

912
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,800
irrigation scheme steam water the

913
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,720
typical profit is probably more like

914
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:07,240
$500 per Hector and that's what I

915
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:09,839
remember measuring once so we are below

916
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:11,920
that but that's primarily really the

917
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:15,160
reason um is because of the high

918
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,640
irrigation cost which probably explains

919
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:19,960
as you look across the rice growing

920
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:22,000
world that dry season rice is generally

921
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:25,559
confined to those locations where water

922
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:29,079
is easy and cheap to access yeah it has

923
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:31,599
to do exactly that yeah good I think

924
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:33,839
that wraps it up um we've not become

925
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:36,440
rich at least we haven't lost money I

926
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:40,040
think we've learned a lot yeah we have

927
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:44,359
so we'll promise to do better next time

928
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:44,359
right Cheers Cheers
