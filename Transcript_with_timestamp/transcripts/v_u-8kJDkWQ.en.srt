2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:10,080
globally they are almost 2.1 billion

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:14,690
small ruminant as the Pertamina

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:18,449
is affecting 76 country globally and

5
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:24,330
more than a three-person modern

6
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:29,340
education of the 2.1 billion small

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:31,320
ruminant are in this 76 countries we

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,290
have to make sure that four infected

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,570
country we through the surveillance we

10
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:39,559
try to identify why did where the

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:42,239
disease when we know where the diseases

12
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:44,280
wisdom the vaccination in that area to

13
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,210
make sure that we reduce the incidence

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:51,480
of the disease so TOA eradication then

15
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:53,460
for country neighboring the infected

16
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,280
countries we have to make sure that we

17
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,980
undertake the surveillance or doing the

18
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,379
zone tample offer area where we'll be

19
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,809
doing the vaccinations and then for

20
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:06,299
infected country we try to for three

21
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:09,330
countries we try to assist them to be

22
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:11,700
recognized fear of the disease today

23
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,950
they are almost 53 country who are

24
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,920
already free of the disease now the

25
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:20,850
program will be targeting the 76 country

26
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,830
and then other at-risk countries and we

27
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,729
hope that implementing the varsity of

28
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:29,369
vaccination civilians awareness and

29
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:31,979
partnership with all the stakeholders we

30
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:36,810
are able to eradicate the disease by

31
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:39,900
2030 the vaccine is cheaper one dose of

32
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:42,299
vaccine is less than 10 cents to

33
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,630
vaccinate one animal is less than 50

34
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:50,520
cents the course of one chip and God is

35
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:55,020
around $100 you invest you protect with

36
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:58,310
half dollar but you gain $100 in hurt

37
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:01,259
animal but globally we try to do the

38
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:08,869
cost-benefit analysis and when you

39
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:11,280
invest $1 the return is 33.8 around $34

40
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:12,840
therefore the impact is really very high

41
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,530
but when the disease end

42
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:21,060
in one flock almost 80% of the flock

43
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:24,270
will die therefore the impact and if in

44
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:27,780
developing countries small ruminant is

45
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:31,650
the property of women therefore is

46
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:35,970
really major issue if a man lost his 80

47
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:41,040
over 100 animals she will not be able to

48
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:43,860
sell the animals and to have meat milk

49
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:47,959
would litter and feeble

50
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:50,790
she will not have milk for children

51
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:54,560
there for malnutrition therefore the

52
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:57,150
impact is really very high for

53
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,660
developing countries this the reason why

54
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:02,610
FAO and O I decided to tag that disease

55
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:05,720
for eradication for global eradication

56
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:09,600
we hope that we'll be able to achieve

57
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:13,470
the cost for the first phase first five

58
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:15,540
phase of the program is around 1 billion

59
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:18,480
but reaching that with less than 3

60
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:21,930
billion we are able to eradicate the

61
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:25,140
disease but to the cost the losses a

62
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:28,350
year of this disease due to this disease

63
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:31,829
has been estimated to be between 1.5 and

64
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:34,410
2 billion a year but if we invest 3

65
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:36,620
billion globally we eradicate the

66
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,620
disease
