1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
something that we did a couple of years

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:06,839
ago to try to improve the traction on

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,460
these R4 tires was grooving them all

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:10,260
right so I bought a grooving tool off of

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,400
Amazon I think it was around 100 bucks

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,019
give or take

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,480
and you heat it up and you basically

8
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:17,880
it's got a little metal knife and you're

9
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,500
just pushing through and cutting out

10
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,900
little grooves it gives all these extra

11
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,720
edges on here to get extra traction and

12
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,820
slippery surfaces and mud just off-road

13
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,099
applications and so the downside of

14
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,019
these R4 tires is they just

15
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:32,520
they're not great on Traction in a lot

16
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:34,140
of areas and basically it can be an

17
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,700
expensive Endeavor to completely replace

18
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,980
all of your tires with a different tread

19
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,840
pattern so for around 100 bucks give or

20
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,640
take whatever that tool is you can

21
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,700
enhance your traction on the existing

22
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,600
tires that you have and for me in the

23
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,920
last

24
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,539
year and a half or two years whatever

25
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,559
it's been I have definitely noticed an

26
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:50,820
improvement

27
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:52,559
a lot of other folks have been doing

28
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,700
this too so maybe ask around in the

29
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,140
forums and see what they think as well

30
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,640
so if you want to find the tool we use

31
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,020
we do have a link to it in our Amazon

32
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,320
store you can find that through our

33
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,320
