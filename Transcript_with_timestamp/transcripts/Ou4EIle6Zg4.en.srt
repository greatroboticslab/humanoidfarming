00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,240
[Music]

2
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:47,640
so it's one of my favorite if not my

3
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,719
favorite time of year right now on the

4
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,960
farm which is

5
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:55,399
September because we're

6
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,840
harvesting pretty much everything is is

7
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:01,239
full production right now we're

8
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,239
harvesting tomatoes cucumbers

9
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,840
the

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,600
whole arsenal of vegetables are being

11
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:12,600
harvested which of course I love and I

12
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:16,040
love eating it uh but we're also

13
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,360
planting for the winter and the well

14
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,799
actually fall planting is pretty much

15
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,840
done we're planting for the winter right

16
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,040
now in green houses and it's a time

17
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,960
where even though we're doing all that

18
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,560
harvesting the the actual like energy of

19
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,840
the farm is slowing down a lot it's

20
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,640
relax it's more relaxing than it is in

21
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,560
the

22
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:39,320
spring all the pressure is mostly

23
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,560
gone um all we got left is just to fill

24
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,960
in whatever space is left on the farm

25
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:47,040
with winter crops that will mature by

26
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:49,759
November 7th in my

27
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,600
climate and uh that's what I'm doing

28
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,159
right now is I'm planting

29
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,039
kale that will hopefully be mature by

30
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,079
November 7th and we'll Harvest it

31
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:01,840
December January

32
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,840
February somewhere in there

33
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,640
and

34
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,800
um what I'm talking about is winter

35
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,160
farming or winter harvesting whatever

36
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,280
you want to call it there's a lot of

37
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,800
different terms out there but I'm

38
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:18,040
obsessed with it

39
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:20,920
because I love what I do I love growing

40
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:23,920
vegetables I'm obsessed with it and I

41
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:25,560
love eating all of this stuff and I

42
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,959
don't want it to end in the winter time

43
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,000
so winter farming when I first heard

44
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:32,680
about it and I first heard about Elliot

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,400
Coleman and what he's doing CU he's a

46
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,800
guy who kind of brought this to America

47
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,680
at

48
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,840
least um I was just obsessed I watched

49
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:47,120
every video I could possibly find about

50
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:50,440
winter farming and um he's pretty big

51
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,120
deal because he took a lot of European

52
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,959
techniques and brought him to America

53
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,840
where it's a lot colder um you know he's

54
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:01,080
growing in Maine which is really similar

55
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,959
climate to here uh in Wyoming in I'm

56
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,720
sure they get down to5 -20 almost every

57
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:09,840
winter Fahrenheit by the way and we get

58
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:13,159
down to that cold last year we got down

59
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,239
to30 and he made it possible to do this

60
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:17,799
stuff in green houses like what I'm

61
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:21,720
doing right now

62
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:23,080
and it's kind of a revolutionary Concept

63
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,560
in my opinion

64
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,799
because it means there's a possibility

65
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,319
of having freshh local food all year

66
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,920
round even in ridiculously cold climates

67
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:35,640
like ours and in a really short growing

68
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,200
season like ours I'm pretty sure Elliot

69
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,480
Coleman is a zone five uh I'm pretty

70
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,879
sure they're where they're at is a zone

71
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:45,720
five or something close to that and

72
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:48,480
we're in a basically zone five zone four

73
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,959
whatever a lot of that is kind of just a

74
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,400
a guideline each climate has its own

75
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,560
little nuances

76
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:01,040
but I'm obsessed with this winter

77
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:04,239
farming stuff and um

78
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,760
because the vegetables taste better A

79
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,959
lot of what we grow in the summertime is

80
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,360
actually the same stuff we grow in the

81
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,680
winter because

82
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:16,320
Wyoming uh heat loving crops don't do as

83
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:18,400
well so stuff like kale carrots cilantro

84
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,239
parsley all that stuff we grow a lot

85
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,080
more of it in the summertime because

86
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:25,880
it's still really cold here in the

87
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:27,479
summertime and so it's it's fun for me

88
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,320
to do this because it's just like the

89
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:32,639
last little job of the season

90
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,639
other than harvesting and then once this

91
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,240
is done all we got to do is Harvest

92
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,600
whatever we want whenever we want

93
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,800
somewhere between November 7th and

94
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,240
February 4th which is What's called the

95
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,919
prapan period and that's the time where

96
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,960
daylight is less than 10 hours and

97
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:51,880
plants don't really grow at all um you

98
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,680
know you're got to have to Google winter

99
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,360
farming Elliot Coleman to learn a lot

100
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,880
more about that but because I can't

101
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:01,080
explain all that in this video but in my

102
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:04,479
climate that's that's the date of less

103
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,840
than 10 hours of daylight and uh if you

104
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,800
figure that out in your climate you

105
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,280
could do all this stuff too and there's

106
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,479
a whole winter planting calendar which

107
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,759
I'll put a link to that in the

108
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:15,560
description too just in case you happen

109
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,639
to have a greenhouse and you want to try

110
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,280
some of this because there's still time

111
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:20,639
in most climates to plant a whole bunch

112
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,560
of the stuff I'm going to talk about in

113
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,800
this video probably not kale I'm

114
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,960
actually kind of risking it right now by

115
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,639
doing this this late but I'm going to

116
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,039
try but uh there's whole bunch of stuff

117
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,000
you can

118
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:36,479
grow to be mature by November and then

119
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,199
eat it all winter and if you're in the

120
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,199
South it's just going to be a hell of a

121
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:42,440
lot easier for you than what I'm doing

122
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:43,560
here um I think if you're in like South

123
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,680
Carolina you could probably grow

124
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,360
broccoli through the winter and stuff

125
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,840
you know we have an extreme climate here

126
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,880
so we have to be pretty picky about what

127
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:54,400
we grow but there's still a good 10 10

128
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,680
crops I could eat fresh in

129
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,240
January and I'm just obsessed with that

130
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,680
I think it's such a game changer that I

131
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,800
I want to see more people doing it and

132
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,000
that's why I'm making this video I want

133
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,960
to talk about it and uh if you find any

134
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,360
of that interesting keep watching I'm

135
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,199
going to share a couple tips that you

136
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,360
could do if you have a greenhouse of

137
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:13,599
some kind or even if you don't and I'm

138
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,440
going to go over the crops that we're

139
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:19,880
planting right now to harvest in January

140
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:23,880
so stay tuned

141
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,880
and enjoy

142
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:40,840
so this is my personal favorite winter

143
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:44,120
crop it's called claytonia or miners

144
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:47,440
lettuce it's this really weird

145
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:49,280
looking salad green that actually grows

146
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:54,120
in the mountains right around here in

147
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:57,400
Wyoming in the Rocky Mountains Colorado

148
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,560
Montana I've had ranchers come to my

149
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,120
booth in the winter time and ab

150
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,360
absolutely recognize this plant cuz

151
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,639
they've seen it in the mountains when

152
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:08,000
they're taking horses and cattle up

153
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:11,919
there and it's delicious it's super

154
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,520
weird uh it looks like I'm sure I'll do

155
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:17,520
videos later on when this is mature

156
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:20,240
because this is already too late to seed

157
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,560
more of this so we got plants in Paper

158
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,440
Pot trays that we'll transplant into

159
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,800
ground later on

160
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:32,199
but it's one of my favorites because it

161
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:36,280
tastes delicious and it is unbelievably

162
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:40,280
tough this stuff went through -30 last

163
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:44,000
year without batting an eyelash nothing

164
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:46,080
happened to it it was fine um it's a

165
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,400
little tricky to grow uh it's hard to

166
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,280
get it to germinate real thick um so I

167
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,159
kind of germinate it like I germinate

168
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,520
carrots which means I pay attention to

169
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:57,879
it a lot the first week that it's seated

170
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,159
in the ground and then this year I'm

171
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:02,319
trying it in Paper Pot trays

172
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:03,840
so I have extra just in case the stuff

173
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:07,360
in the ground doesn't germinate well and

174
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:10,199
I could just plant these plants um but

175
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,759
it's so good it tastes like lettuce a

176
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:16,400
lot like lettuce and like um maybe like

177
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,840
a sunflower choot combined or something

178
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,199
um but it's so cold hearty that's why it

179
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,680
grows in the mountains around here it

180
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:27,319
gets really cold in the mountains and

181
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:30,639
it's just awesome um we're going to grow

182
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:32,479
three or four beds of it this year uh

183
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,279
just because it's so popular and it

184
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,200
works as like a lettuce in the winter

185
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:38,599
time cuz real lettuce is a lot harder to

186
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,719
do in the winter I'm going to try some

187
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:44,839
real lettuce but it's tougher I've had a

188
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:48,120
lot more problems with it but claytonia

189
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:49,720
is a awesome one you buy one seed packet

190
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,320
it'll last you a couple years because

191
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:55,959
the seeds are ridiculously small um and

192
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:58,680
they uh it is kind of expensive but it's

193
00:08:55,959 --> 00:09:01,720
awesome um just because of it's as tough

194
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:04,680
as spinach if not more and gives you

195
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:07,120
tons of salad um we'll be doing lots of

196
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,920
videos about it later on this year

197
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,000
showing you the harvesting process and

198
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:13,399
everything but miner's lettuce is a

199
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,959
you've got to grow it if you have a

200
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:17,240
greenhouse of any kind just throw some

201
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:20,120
seeds in the ground if you're Le if

202
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,600
you're like a zone six or lower than me

203
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,760
you probably still plant it right now

204
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:28,880
for a couple more weeks but um this one

205
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:31,720
was seated uh like a week ago about 10

206
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:36,120
days ago so that's like September 1st

207
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:37,399
for me um it's September 12th now so

208
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,959
probably a little too late for most

209
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:41,519
people

210
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,800
but still worth looking into you could

211
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:48,279
probably plant it into October in some

212
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:50,079
CL in most climates south of here but

213
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:53,640
awesome one to

214
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:55,079
do so this is parsley uh I've already

215
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:58,279
talked about it a bunch in my other

216
00:09:55,079 --> 00:10:00,600
videos but we grow a lot of parsley here

217
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:03,720
and the reason is is it's ridiculously

218
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:06,480
cold hearty grows really well in cold

219
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:09,920
temperatures which we have a lot of here

220
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,640
so I've had parsley in my greenh

221
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,680
houses for the past three years and it

222
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,880
almost always survives perfectly through

223
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,440
the winter

224
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:23,320
um and what I mean by survive is it's

225
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:25,800
like if it's -30 I'm going to want to

226
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:27,920
harvest all of this before that because

227
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:30,120
it will get pretty damaged in unheated

228
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,279
Greenhouse like this

229
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:35,800
but it'll still survive and it'll grow

230
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:37,959
back really thick in March and April so

231
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:41,079
you get tons of harvests up until that

232
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:42,600
really big cold snap and then it goes

233
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:45,440
dormant for a little while and then it

234
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,000
comes back like crazy once we get more

235
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,800
than 10 hours of daylight again in

236
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
February so parsley's a bombproof one

237
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:55,560
it's more bombproof than cilantro my

238
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:00,279
experience and it tastes really sweet

239
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:01,800
and delicious so I love it

240
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:03,040
I mean I've talked about it a lot

241
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,440
already on this channel I don't want to

242
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,079
go over it again and again and again but

243
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,480
there's a reason why we plant it all the

244
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:11,040
time because it takes a long time to

245
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,760
grow a lot of people don't have it in

246
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:17,480
their Gardens reliably and it just turns

247
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:20,959
into this big bush of delicious

248
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:23,040
Herby goodness so that's

249
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,519
parsley all right so here's a crop

250
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,079
you're going to hear me talk about a

251
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:29,480
million times on this channel I already

252
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:31,600
have talked about it a million times and

253
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,639
that is

254
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:38,160
spinach number one winter

255
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:40,279
crop plant it it goes through ne30 no

256
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,680
problem it tastes ridiculously

257
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:45,760
sweet once it gets

258
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:49,040
cold and we'll get two or three cuts out

259
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:52,040
of this one bed we have nine beds this

260
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:55,720
year in the far on the farm that we'll

261
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:58,240
be harvesting from uh so far six are

262
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,959
planted we started planting this a week

263
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:04,160
ago now about 10 days ago this spinach

264
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:08,000
is about 10 days old and it'll be huge

265
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:12,320
by November just big plants this will

266
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,040
just be a carpet of spinach and it's a

267
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,040
bombproof one you got to do it if you're

268
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:20,800
winter growing no matter where you are

269
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:22,720
just got to do it um and you know it's

270
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,199
relatively easy once you start getting

271
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,920
colder nighttime temperatures it

272
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:30,160
germinates no problem we don't have to

273
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:33,600
worry about it too much and uh

274
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:37,160
just amazing so uh this

275
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:40,480
one it's the number one you got to do in

276
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:43,560
the winter time um can't lose with

277
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,440
spinach so definitely try spinach so on

278
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:48,279
either side of me are

279
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:51,160
carrots they were planted around August

280
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:52,880
1st in my climate that's the day that I

281
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,160
got to get all my winter carrots planted

282
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,639
or else it's pretty much not going to be

283
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:59,720
enough time in the growing season to get

284
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:02,399
them big enough by November but these

285
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,519
are going to be perfect this is the best

286
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,720
batch I've had so far in my farming

287
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:10,160
career we've got

288
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:14,920
six beds of winter carrots in these two

289
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:17,120
caterpillar tunnels and um this is like

290
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,760
for my booth in the winter time this is

291
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,399
what brings people back every week is

292
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:23,279
winter carrots call them candy carrots

293
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:25,920
they taste like they're sugar injected

294
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:28,519
into them because they are unbelievably

295
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,199
sweet um and I think part of that is the

296
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:32,920
variety we're growing but they just get

297
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:35,240
sweeter and sweeter as the winter

298
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,600
comes and uh once you get good at

299
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,880
growing carrots which I'm going to talk

300
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,760
about a lot on this channel because I

301
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,560
think

302
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,120
it's easiest way to fill your fridge

303
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:48,279
root seller whatever you got to store

304
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:50,759
food um by growing a garden but um once

305
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:53,079
you can grow carrots well you could do

306
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:54,759
this no problem because it's the same

307
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:56,279
technique is growing them in the summer

308
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:57,759
it's just getting the timing right and

309
00:13:56,279 --> 00:14:00,720
growing them under a little bit of pro

310
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:02,920
protection so carrots are a must got to

311
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,120
do carrots so the last one I'm GNA talk

312
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:07,199
about is kale which is what I was

313
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,000
planting at the beginning of this video

314
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:12,880
and it's getting watered in right now

315
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,759
and I'm getting watered in too uh so I'm

316
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:18,160
going to make this quick but kale is a

317
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:20,800
real good one too it's bombproof

318
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:23,279
um not quite as bombproof as like

319
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:28,120
spinach and clonia I found that it gets

320
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:29,880
pretty wacky like past -2 it's pretty

321
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,759
rough and when it girl back it usually

322
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,759
goes to seed in March and April but I

323
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:36,120
always try it cuz sometimes you have a

324
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:38,560
mild winter and you might get a really

325
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,399
nice Harvest through January or whatever

326
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,800
and this is literally just the same kale

327
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,839
I grow outside it's called winter boore

328
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,160
I've tried the special winter kale

329
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:48,000
before and I don't really think it

330
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:51,079
tastes that good um

331
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,759
personally and it just gets kind of

332
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:54,279
weird but I'll probably try it again

333
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:57,720
eventually because I think part of that

334
00:14:54,279 --> 00:15:00,399
just my soil is still getting good but

335
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,880
kale um we planted this like Late July

336
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:06,560
we seeded it J Late July and these

337
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:09,600
plants are not super healthy that's cuz

338
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,839
my Nursery is not so good yet but um I'm

339
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,320
pretty sure this will work uh something

340
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,959
we'll we'll Harvest something by

341
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:18,759
November um but uh yeah you got to try

342
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,360
kale too that's a really easy one if you

343
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:22,880
get it growing big enough you could no

344
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,519
matter what you could Harvest it into

345
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:30,600
December in a greenhouse no problem so

346
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:34,480
gotta try kale so if you want to do this

347
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:36,600
and you want to eat fresh vegetables in

348
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,240
January it really helps to have a

349
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,800
greenhouse of some kind

350
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:44,120
and there's ways to do it with a cold

351
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:47,920
frame uh depending on your climate it

352
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:50,839
works for sure but um a greenhouse in my

353
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:53,079
opinion is the easiest because um you

354
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:55,040
can just fit a lot more in the green

355
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:57,560
housee you know a Cold Frame you're

356
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,240
going to have you know a 4x4 little

357
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,759
section and you're going to eat that all

358
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:04,680
up by in like a week you know the one

359
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,160
thing about winter growing or harvesting

360
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,360
is you need a lot of space because

361
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:11,160
nothing is growing so if you want to

362
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:14,519
actually eat spinach all winter you need

363
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:17,680
a lot of it in a protected environment

364
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:20,120
so a little Greenhouse like what I have

365
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,079
behind me um these are called

366
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,519
caterpillar tunnels by farmer friend

367
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:26,360
I'll leave a link to them in the

368
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:29,720
description um these are so

369
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:31,199
cheap uh compared to to a high tunnel

370
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,040
which is what I grow a lot of my stuff

371
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:37,560
in these are so cheap and easy to put up

372
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:39,079
any Homesteader could do it um and it's

373
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,920
just a couple thousand dollars or

374
00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:43,639
something as opposed

375
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:46,480
to a lot more money and a lot more time

376
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:48,880
to build a high tunnel um a real high

377
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,319
tunnel you know takes a 100 hours or

378
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,440
something to build and that depends on

379
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:54,480
which size you want it doesn't

380
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,720
necessarily take a 100 hours but in my

381
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,399
opinion it's a lot more effort and a lot

382
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,600
more stressful to build than one of

383
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,120
these things

384
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:05,039
um you know these things I have them in

385
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:07,439
the 100t by 16t lengths there's two of

386
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,319
them on the farm but I'm a farm so I

387
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,439
need it as big as possible but you could

388
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:14,720
get them as small as 25 foot and 14 foot

389
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:18,160
wide you can put that up in a weekend

390
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,760
and um they ship it to you in a kit you

391
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,360
don't have to really do any thinking

392
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,520
they do all of the they have the um how

393
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,480
to

394
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:30,320
assemble uh packet in the packaging and

395
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:33,240
it's really easy to put together it is

396
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:36,400
these took me about 10 hours to put

397
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:38,480
together and that's the same amount of

398
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,840
greenhouse space that I have in high

399
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:45,679
tunnels which took me literally 250

400
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:47,760
hours to build two high tunnels so just

401
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,480
that's the tradeoff you're getting with

402
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:53,120
these um they're not as windproof for

403
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,080
sure uh I'm going to have to beef mine

404
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:59,280
up a little bit to survive our wind here

405
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:01,960
in Wyoming but um if I was Homestead

406
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,840
which I'm not because I have a farm um I

407
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,360
would build these things and you could

408
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,080
do all your summer growing in here you

409
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:10,760
could grow your summer cucumbers and

410
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:13,240
tomatoes and stuff in here really easily

411
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,840
and then you could grow winter stuff um

412
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:18,559
and have a whole bunch just for your

413
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:21,039
family and uh there's all sorts of fun

414
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,840
little additions you can make to them on

415
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,600
their website I just went with the bear

416
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:28,880
bones because this is sort of like

417
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,400
a uh low-end Greenhouse for me on my

418
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,720
Farm I'm going to be building a lot more

419
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:36,320
fancy ones coming up here but um I I

420
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,919
love these things for how cheap they are

421
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,240
and um you could do everything I'm

422
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:43,520
talking about in this video in one of

423
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:45,840
these I've already done it through one

424
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:50,320
winter and it worked fine I would just

425
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:53,520
say definitely Orient them east to west

426
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,159
because the sunlight and you make sure

427
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:59,919
you get sun in the winter wherever you

428
00:18:55,159 --> 00:19:02,240
put them because I oriented these uh

429
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:05,440
north south and they don't get as warm

430
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:07,200
nearly as warm um there's probably a 101

431
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,960
15 degree difference in warmth when the

432
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,840
sun does come out in the winter that

433
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,880
matters a lot for how well the

434
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:15,480
vegetables grow um and I found that

435
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,159
everything in here grows a lot slower

436
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,799
because I oriented that way and I think

437
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:21,799
that's why um so you want to orient him

438
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:23,960
East West so you get a lot more sun in

439
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:25,679
the winter time but other than that you

440
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,440
could do everything I said in this video

441
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,440
you just need some Frost covers to

442
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:33,039
protect protect them when it gets -20 or

443
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:34,520
whatever but um I've gone over that a

444
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,679
little bit in the videos but the whole

445
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:38,679
concept with Elliot Coleman style of

446
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:42,840
winter growing is you get the crops

447
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:45,320
mature by the last 10hour day and then

448
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:47,559
you cover them with one layer of white

449
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,000
row cover which you could get in a lot

450
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:52,240
of different places you get the lightest

451
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,799
layer of row cover um and that usually

452
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,480
will do the trick for most of these

453
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:58,000
crops you know if you get down to

454
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,120
negative really seriously below zero

455
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,400
you're probably going to want a couple

456
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:04,200
layers of that row cover just because

457
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:07,520
the more protection you have the more

458
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,840
the crops are going to do well and then

459
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,799
in my climate usually there's only a

460
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,919
couple weeks of that cold and then you

461
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:17,720
can take the extra layers off and you're

462
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:19,440
pretty good um you know it's not there's

463
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,880
going to be a learning curve with this

464
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,360
that's why I'm making this video is I

465
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,720
want to see more people doing it um and

466
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,120
I don't think there is that many people

467
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,159
doing it um

468
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:33,799
but there is a way to do it and uh the

469
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:35,480
more you experience growing like this um

470
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:37,240
the more I think you'll enjoy it and

471
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:41,440
you'll learn how to do it better I'm

472
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:43,480
still learning a lot um so but these

473
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,080
caterpillar tunnels are very cheap easy

474
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,520
to put together I highly recommend you

475
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:49,400
do that um if you already have a

476
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,720
greenhouse it should be pretty easy for

477
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,240
you to do all the things I'm talking

478
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,159
about you just got to buy the right

479
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,840
seeds and stuff and I didn't even talk

480
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,679
about nearly all the winter crops in

481
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:01,360
this video um because we're still still

482
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:03,480
going to be planting a few more like um

483
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:07,000
Tokyo bana which is a really fast

484
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:09,240
growing brass that's a good one I only

485
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,640
talked about the really easy ones in

486
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:15,760
this video that are tough um good

487
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:17,440
beginner crops and uh but all you need

488
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,919
is a greenhouse a little bit of

489
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,679
protection inside and you can do this

490
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:22,760
stuff so give it a shot if you have a

491
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:26,760
greenhouse if not buy one of

492
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:29,679
these so if you want to set up a garden

493
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:32,080
in your backyard that can grow all the

494
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:36,039
crops I talked about in this video

495
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:38,480
without having to weed or really put a

496
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:39,760
whole lot of effort in every week I

497
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,400
highly recommend you check out my

498
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,919
gardening course at the link in the

499
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,520
description I go over everything you

500
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:48,520
need to know from setting up your garden

501
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:53,200
in a no dig style where you don't have

502
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:55,760
to do weeding like I do on the farm and

503
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,720
plant spacing crop planting

504
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,320
watering everything you need to know

505
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,480
from seed to Heart on pretty much all

506
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,840
the crops I grow here on the

507
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,440
farm which is sort of the foundational

508
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,799
skills you need to do all the winter

509
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,120
stuff that I talked about in this

510
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:14,520
video highly recommend you check it out

511
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:17,200
it's gardening 101 at the link in the

512
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:20,039
description and start thinking about

513
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,600
growing a garden right now because it

514
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:23,440
takes a little bit of planning to do

515
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,440
really well next year because I know

516
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,039
we're at the end of our growing season

517
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,440
but if you had a hard growing season and

518
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:31,640
you tried

519
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,960
gardening and it didn't work out for you

520
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:36,919
you got a bunch of weeds this method of

521
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:42,320
growing is for you because all it takes

522
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:44,640
is uh few short days of hard work to set

523
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:47,480
up and then you just pretty much plant

524
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,600
and seed on schedule and then forget

525
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,400
about it and come Harvest when you need

526
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,440
to eat that's pretty much as simple as

527
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,559
it is once you get it all set up so

528
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,159
highly recommend you check that out if
