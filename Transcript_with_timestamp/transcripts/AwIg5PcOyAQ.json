  "text": "everyone this is Ross in today's video we're gonna be doing a nice little potato harvest for you guys what's nice about harvesting potatoes now it's Jill its July 20th we've actually been having a really crazy crazy heatwave here in Pennsylvania is that I want to focus on my fall vegetables so one crop comes out and another crop goes in and this is kind of really the time to be thinking about this stuff so if you're in my area this is really when you need to get something in the ground otherwise you know it's gonna get too cold the daylight hours are gonna really shorten and you're not gonna reach that maturity on different things that need a longer season you know things like Brussels sprouts as an example or even maybe things like broccoli it could be quite difficult for you to get things like that or cabbages so what I'm doing here is I'm actually gonna be taking all these potatoes out we're gonna do the harvest we're gonna clear this out and then I'm gonna throw over top of this compost and then I'm gonna direct seed into this bed and then we're gonna throw a row cover over top of it and the reason for the row cover here I want to show you this it's a good example is that it really helps with white fly or other insects any pests that are coming in here and potentially attacking our brassicas or other annuals that we put in it's really important because in order to grow brassicas at this time of the year first off you need a heat tolerant brassicas today the heat index is over a hundred right so if it's really really warm outside you need something that's gonna not bolt but also because it's so warm there's certain insects around that are not normally around in the fall or in the spring so there's something called white fly at least where I live and it comes in here and really decimates a lot of the larger brassicas if it really can proliferate and it also really affects the seedlings if you direct seed some stuff it gets those really young seedlings and you're kind of really off to a horrible start because if you're damaging those first few leaves on a seedling it really puts that seedling far behind so it's important I think to really have this row cover on here so again we're gonna clear this whole thing out we're gonna stick to mostly in this video just the potato harvest we can talk about the variety here as we go along and then we're gonna cover this again with compost create ourselves a nice little no dig bed even though we're digging in this right now and then we can really start thinking about either direct seeding now or actually adding in some different things like maybe some garlic we can plant some garlic in here we can plant some potatoes in here you know we can plant onions as well so it's all really up in the air but I want to get some certain things in the ground now get the row cover on and I think this is a nice little transition from one crop to the other so let me put you guys down right now and then we can kind of get into this potato harvest so what I've been using actually is this this betting fork I want to show you guys this now I just got this at the store and I probably could have found something maybe a little cheaper and a little better but this is really nice for picking up material like hay and and mulch and and wood chips so I got it mostly for that but it's pretty good for getting these potatoes out of the ground which I didn't really expect them to be that deep as they are but it seems like they are and I got to get something in the ground that's not gonna hopefully decimate too much of the potatoes not gonna damage the potatoes it's not gonna we're gonna be able to get into the ground it's really hard soil right here this was not soil that I amended this was not soil that I really have taken care of at all this is this was grass you know four or five months ago and underneath it is this really heavy clay so getting through this has been definitely a challenge you can see here's the remnants of the potato we planted this is a variety by the way called German butterball and it is supposed to be the tastiest potato there is it's supposed to be even tastier than Yukon Gold so what I'm doing is that we're gonna do a nice little taste test I think later on I don't have any Yukon Gold to compare but we will know for sure based off of what potatoes tasted like last year let's pull this one up this harvest doesn't look this one doesn't look too bad this one looks a bit better than the other one some much larger potatoes here that's good to see oh they're nice and what's nice about growing your own potatoes guys one you can choose the variety okay I mean that's that should be obvious to us all there's better varieties in every single thing that we grow but also they're really soft buttery creamy potatoes with a skin that isn't hard it hasn't been cured yet the skins really really smooth so this is a really good eating potato you know that's really what it's all about is getting a higher quality product then we can get at the store and if we can't then what's the point in my opinion now you can get these potatoes like this you know you can get them those really small potatoes at the store they're usually like multicolored they have like a blue one a red one a yellow one so that exists but yeah they're really expensive and you can just get yourself some seed potatoes and it's probably more worth it at least so far we're gonna really find out from this harvest to see if it is indeed worth it but this may take me quite a bit of time to get through this entire harvest and I don't really have the battery for it so let's see here's some of the potatoes from that particular plant as I get in by the way deeper into the bed they're gonna be more potatoes that's just gonna be a fact because the potatoes on the edge of the bed didn't perform well because of our lawn guys and yeah you're probably shaking your head long guys but they really do more damage then they really hurt more than they help from my opinion I'm gonna bring you guys over now to a different planting we had done some in compost but what we had done has really stuck the potato just on the top of the soil like this and then cover that with so much straw and that was it that's all we did you can see actually this potato's quite green so that's not good this may be something we have to plant rather than eat but uh let me take you guys over here instead of putting some of these guys on our hard clay I put some in compost and I did the same method where it's just directly on top of this however in fact I Madden even need this fork because of how loose the soil is right here so the soil should be looser more nutritious etc etc everything should be better ok well I still I'm gonna need it because we pulled up the plant but that's all we got and maybe we could have waited a bit longer with some of these alright here's some decent potatoes most of them are like right on the surface of the compost you can get in here with your hands this is not bad at all so you can see the difference here you know look at this nice soil compared to the other soil that I was dealing with so I'm just digging around in here seeing if there's anything else in here and I bet you there is but I don't know if I have the most time to come in here and just start messing around with that hi everyone so I want to show you guys the harvest now we're really like a few days after what we did and kind of what we talked about earlier in the video is getting this whole thing set up you know the way we want it so that we can direct seed some brassicas in here so what we did is just very simple we took out all the potatoes really gave this a nice little bed prep took out all the mulch all that straw all the tops the potatoes we put that underneath some of these grapevines here then also we stuck it over here in a pile for now because what we're gonna do is take a lot of woodchips a lot of mulch and we're gonna put down some cardboard first underneath these apple trees clear out a lot of these weeds man we had just have so many weeds in here it's been an area that I've neglected all spring all summer and these apple trees need it they need more MIDI more assistance some of these guys don't look really that great they're on dwarf fruit stalks they just don't grow very quickly I think they have weak root systems some of them have been more susceptible to things like aphids and other different things and to be honest with you I don't really want to grow many things underneath these trees I think they're very shallow rooted so we'll put down a lot of mulch put down a lot of organic material and that's gonna break down in the compost over time and we're gonna have healthier apple trees because of it but unfortunately it's gonna take a few years for that to happen but you can see this is all really planned well and came out well like this is really nice soil we've down the just natural soil conditioner I love this stuff this is great for growing anything guys it's half compost and the other half is a pine bark and that stuff really helps break down I think it gives a nice little breakdown of nutrients a bit more over time whereas you do have some pieces now which if the soil is broken down enough which sometimes it's not but in most cases it is is that it is broken down enough to really give a good result in the first year that you use the soil so for me it's a great for seeding into it holds lots of water it looks a bit dry on the surface but underneath it is completely wet and then later today because we've already seated this I've seeded a whole bunch of different brassicas some carrots different things like that it's gonna rain about an inch and a half this is gonna germinate so well I have this other really about sixty seventy percent of the bed I haven't put anything in yet so we're gonna think about what we can do inside start some things indoors and then also think about kind of what I want to do with garlic next year maybe onions next year even potatoes next year I'm kind of debating here's our little potato harvest by the way and it really is a bit little I mean it's it's deathly more potatoes than what I started out with but not many of them are that big this one's actually green right here but the green ones and the larger ones I'm just gonna replant them probably somewhere and grow some potatoes next year probably in a better location this area doesn't get a whole lot of light also this is not really the biggest area I mean I started out with probably around 8 pounds of potatoes I ordered 10 but I probably only used about eight and this is a three foot but maybe I don't know ten foot or twelve foot something like that if it gets about twelve or fourteen feet long then you've got some areas in here underneath the grapevines which really don't get a whole lot of light I mean the fact that I was able to get this amount of potatoes this is definitely if I had a guess I would say it's probably close to 15 pounds maybe 20 pounds so we maybe doubled what we originally put into this but to be honest with you it's probably not the best success and I have to attribute that probably due to the fact that this bed there's probably some potatoes by the way still in here that are gonna come up as volunteers next year but I have a feeling that was largely due to the fact that we probably should have put down some nice compost first some well draining soil nutritious soil yeah that's gonna hold a lot of water and then bury the potato just just enough you know we don't have to bury it too deep and then throw over even more strong than we did I think the technique in what I did was a lot less work than what some people do with their potatoes I mean potatoes are so easy in general you literally just put them in the ground and forget about them come back 90 120 days later and you dig them up I mean it's so so simple there's no care involved at all at least where I live I mean you may have some pests you may have to water them where you guys live but for me I did nothing so for me you know a completely carefree crop I think it was worth it but would I do this again for the amount of space that these took up probably not it's gonna largely depend on how good these potatoes are and we talked about the German butterball and how good German butter balls supposed to be supposed to be better than Yukon Gold like we said earlier in this video when I filmed this a couple days ago we'll see and also we'll see you know when I talked about the skin is that these are probably not going to be the best baked potato but they are gonna be the best for cooking for frying them up in the pan they're gonna be incredible you know we could even make probably really good ships out of them I really recommend guys for those of you don't know what Old Bay is invest in some Old Bay okay get yourself some potatoes slice them up real nice and thin cover them with some old bay a little bit of olive oil put them in the oven for a really short time you don't even have the temperature to hot I think maybe I don't know the exact temperature but I'm gonna say 300 350 something like that and then put them in there for about 10 minutes see how they come out they should start browning a bit you want them really crispy you don't want them burnt take them out you can even sprinkle some more old bay on at that point oh my god they're so good so that's kind of it for this video guys the last thing I want to mention is that we did talk about I think this covering here and maybe a different video maybe we did it in this potato video I'm not sure but this is really important for this time of the year especially for what we've seated a bunch of brassicas not necessarily the carrots but we want to protect these young seedlings from insects some insects you can't really even see them so it's really important I think to get this this mesh on and you know whatever else that I it that it is that I put in this bed is certainly excuse me certainly going to be covered with mesh I have another mesh covering that I have used on another bed earlier in the year and we're gonna put this down here on this one because these seedlings guys if I get you a nice closer look you know here's some of the Brassica seedlings right in here and they already got some holes in them they've got some damage on them some white little marks there that is from the white fly so certainly on a large variety of these you know crops that you guys grow they're gonna have some insect pressure largely some of them you can't even most of them you can't even see so you know I think it's a really good idea but that is kind of the video here guys I hope you enjoyed this little harvest of the potatoes yeah I mean seriously very easy to grow again I have to depend on how good they are and you know how much space I have next year I'd rather grow a lot more melons I think next year you know really let them sprawl along the ground some of the melons that I have over here doing decent but a lot of them have been killed off by the will and if I could grow them on the ground and cover them with mesh keep that cucumber beetle out it's gonna be a phenomenal phenomenal crop of melons so you know growing them vertically I think really works but you have to be on top of surround and keeping that cucumber beetle away it just can get a bit tricky here unless you're growing them in a greenhouse so anyway guys I want to thank you all for watching this one if you enjoyed it you know give us a nice little thumbs up subscribe check us out on Facebook Instagram and Twitter check out the website as well we are changing the website to a different host actually not a different host with a different name different domain so if you guys are already subscribed to the website you should continue to be subscribed but if you haven't already subscribed check out the blog it is gonna be something special really interesting trying to get a lot of traffic flowing into that direction and yeah we'll see you guys soon take care it will see it for tomorrow's video take care everyone",
