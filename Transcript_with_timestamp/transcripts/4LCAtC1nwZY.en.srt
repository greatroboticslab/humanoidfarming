1
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,840
a

2
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,240
signant just where he was

3
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,960
needed claiming back as night

4
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:38,480
just in

5
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,200
the nobody is Los

6
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:52,039
it faces Merchant

7
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:52,039
change but your face remain the

8
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:58,320
same will be

9
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,920
when we're finally sober they'll be

10
00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:12,159
gone the trees will Bloom the nights

11
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,159
will

12
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,600
melt we'll always remember how

13
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:54,399
so that was actually filmed about 3

14
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:57,240
weeks ago and yeah I'm trying to film

15
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,560
everything a little bit earlier so that

16
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:03,479
I can schedule a video and get a video

17
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,320
out every Friday so that's what I'm

18
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:10,759
aiming for hopefully that'll

19
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:13,120
happen yeah but uh since since all that

20
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:16,120
was filmed it's actually dried out here

21
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:20,080
a hell of a lot all the mats have dried

22
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,879
out including the path and I've moved

23
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,519
the electric fence that was all the way

24
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:27,400
down there so that they could have that

25
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:30,200
area and I've moved it over here so that

26
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:32,519
I can protect this bit of land here and

27
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,239
just let that grass recover a little bit

28
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:36,680
I don't think we're going to have to

29
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,920
lift the patio area I don't think those

30
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:42,120
mats are going to need releveling or

31
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:44,720
anything because they're fine but the

32
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:48,879
path yeah the path is a little bit

33
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:51,920
higgledy piggledy as you can see it all

34
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:54,360
sort of goes a little bit up at the

35
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,959
edges and down at other edges and it's

36
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,400
not very

37
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:00,720
flat so yeah I do think I'm going to

38
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,599
have to take that up

39
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:07,040
but what I'm going to show you first is

40
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:10,920
how Simon and Bruce fix the rails that

41
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:13,799
hope had broken on a main Paddock area

42
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,799
around the

43
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,879
Caravan that one's right

44
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,280
at that sh it straight up

45
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,680
does it

46
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:26,479
fit you know the idea of that hmer it's

47
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,199
called a pin hammer okay what you do is

48
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,479
you got a little Staple in between your

49
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:32,759
fingers see you can

50
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,800
hit in between your fingers without

51
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:36,360
bashing your fingers so you start it off

52
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,520
like that then you turn it around and

53
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:44,479
knock in did you bring your nail with

54
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:46,680
you staple can't get to there I staple

55
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:49,720
you got to give give me the stuff to use

56
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,720
I need the players as

57
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,120
well you're not going to bash my fingers

58
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,960
are you well I can't cuz you're using

59
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,639
that I don't know it depends how bad

60
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:04,919
your aim

61
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,919
is is your own really bad no

62
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,680
wait I like that one more go down here

63
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,960
like I did and you can hit it straight

64
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,960
on

65
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:22,800
then kneel down Crouch

66
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,919
down

67
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,800
brce you want me to start it and you can

68
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:31,280
finish it

69
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:33,840
off yeah I like that Watch How I do it

70
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,680
we I'm doing much different I'm pushing

71
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,160
up a little bit so come on you can

72
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,120
finish it off see if you can get it in

73
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:43,840
straight the rest of the

74
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,840
way get down a bit so you can your arms

75
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,880
Bel

76
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,240
yay go on try again

77
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,840
see I was getting lower and knocking it

78
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:12,000
upwards yeah but I'm small those easier

79
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,000
for you so why can I stand

80
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:23,039
up so you're still hitting downwards you

81
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:23,039
need to hit

82
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:30,880
upwards oh that'll do just knock it in

83
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:33,560
so it doesn't fall out it'll do the job

84
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,160
so they really did do a great job didn't

85
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,080
they and that's another thing tick off

86
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,840
that Hope Has dismantled that we've had

87
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,880
to fix do you know what if she didn't

88
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:47,560
break so many things then I reckon a lot

89
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:50,360
more would get done around here but well

90
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:54,639
that's the joy of having a heavy

91
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:57,879
cob another thing that Simon and ruce

92
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:00,560
was filled in the big holes at the side

93
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:04,560
of the stable that well they've been

94
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:07,240
there since we first got here and well

95
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,720
they needed filling in so they got on

96
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:15,560
with that too and this is how they did

97
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,560
it it's lap lch isn't it

98
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:27,360
no remember it can't remember what it's

99
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:30,360
called it is shiplap feather

100
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:34,319
shiplap shiplap

101
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:37,960
thick on that side thin on that side you

102
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:40,919
can see that and it is to replace this

103
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:44,599
section here that is

104
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:45,800
missing and this little square that's

105
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:48,159
just behind

106
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,759
Dream It's actually something that hope
