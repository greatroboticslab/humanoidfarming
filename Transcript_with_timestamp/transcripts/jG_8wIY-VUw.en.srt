00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:16,369
howdy friends welcome back to the

3
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:19,610
building of our homestead for the

4
00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:21,169
chicken coop I think I've decided it's

5
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:23,720
probably gonna be a chicken palace build

6
00:00:21,169 --> 00:00:26,869
today we'll focus on putting up the wire

7
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,970
mesh on the windows and the tops and I

8
00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:30,890
think if we work hard enough we could

9
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,700
probably get the siding up let's get

10
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:34,820
started come on

11
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,820
[Music]

12
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:40,700
so on this coop as you may have noticed

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:44,180
it's gonna be kind of an open design a

14
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:45,920
lot of little research I've done says

15
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,809
that the open coops are kind of work a

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,020
little bit better especially because we

17
00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:53,800
live in a very warm climate rarely do we

18
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:56,149
get freezing and if we do have you know

19
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,969
some freezing weather coming up we can

20
00:00:56,149 --> 00:01:02,570
just put some tarps over the front but

21
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:06,320
we are going to do wire mesh along the

22
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:07,820
top and the sides up in there the

23
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,840
research that I've been doing says that

24
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:11,810
ventilation is key

25
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:15,289
vanillite vanillite ventilate and the

26
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:17,720
more ventilation you have the drier it's

27
00:01:15,289 --> 00:01:21,319
gonna be and the healthier your chickens

28
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:24,289
will be I guess a moist damp chicken

29
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:28,069
area is not really very good we are

30
00:01:24,289 --> 00:01:29,630
going to put siding here just to keep

31
00:01:28,069 --> 00:01:31,880
any critters or anything that might want

32
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:36,020
to try and get in there give them a

33
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:38,509
harder time and then also the wall that

34
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:41,030
we built extends a little bit past the

35
00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:42,979
entry and that's going to be to kind of

36
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:44,360
help the wind from whipping in and

37
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:46,099
around just wanted to give you an

38
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,470
overview on why we're doing more of an

39
00:01:46,099 --> 00:01:53,090
open style instead of just a sealed in

40
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:58,119
tight type but yeah let's uh let's cut

41
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:58,119
some wire and get that up

42
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:29,270
[Music]

43
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:41,660
[Music]

44
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:33,030
[Music]

45
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:41,639
you got to be careful when you're

46
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:45,230
cutting the wire at an angle see if

47
00:03:41,639 --> 00:04:05,190
it'll focus those points are razor sharp

48
00:03:45,230 --> 00:04:07,739
needle sharp it got me already all right

49
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:11,099
finally we get to the sighting portion

50
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:14,790
of the chicken coop I went with concrete

51
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:16,470
sighting 4x8 sheet of hardy board is

52
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:18,150
what it's called around here grooved

53
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,760
it's cheaper that way for some reason

54
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:22,430
the advantages of running concrete

55
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,409
sighting is it's not going to rot like

56
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:27,330
wood siding one disadvantage though it

57
00:04:25,409 --> 00:04:31,260
doesn't have much shear value to it so

58
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:33,510
it's brittle so it's not going to it if

59
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:35,970
the building moves too much it does have

60
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:38,520
the chance of breaking so when we move

61
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:40,139
it which it's going to be moved I'm

62
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,349
gonna have to take a couple precautions

63
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:44,699
to make sure it doesn't break too easily

64
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:47,610
but like I said it's not gonna rot

65
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:49,400
especially up against the elements that

66
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:52,830
it's gonna have here with the chickens

67
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:55,110
and their business and stuff inside

68
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:58,440
there but it's comparable to a wood

69
00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:00,450
siding in cost but you got your

70
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,650
advantages either way so that's what I'm

71
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:03,900
gonna do it first

72
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,650
prep the wall for it to make it a little

73
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:08,310
bit easier

74
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:10,020
it is extremely heavy so yeah so I want

75
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:12,870
to have this sighting hanging down below

76
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:14,580
the floor so I made a mark below the

77
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:19,500
flooring an inch and a half and I'm

78
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:21,870
putting in this ledger board and it'll

79
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,970
hold the side I'm doing this alone and

80
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,919
that's really the easiest way to do it

81
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,270
by yourself even if you're using wood or

82
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,150
or other things like that

83
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:38,300
so I'll just put this on put a screw on

84
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:38,300
one side and then level that across I

85
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:12,889
guess another thing I should mention is

86
00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:12,889
it's really dusty

87
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:51,199

[Music]

92
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:30,810
so got the siding on the sides and then

93
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:32,310
the back before I finish up the back

94
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:35,640
upper part I wanted to show you what I

95
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:40,850
got going on here what I did is I had an

96
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:45,030
old above-ground pool that was holy and

97
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:47,460
wasn't really doing much pooling and I

98
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:50,280
cut cut a section off of it and put it

99
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:52,530
over the nesting boxes here and then

100
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:57,660
once I get the siding on I'm also gonna

101
00:07:52,530 --> 00:08:00,210
do the siting here we'll put a piece of

102
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:03,350
plywood over this and then with some

103
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:06,960
hinges but this should keep this area

104
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:09,750
dried off and looking fresh pretty much

105
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:13,160
all I did was just put some roofing

106
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:13,160
nails in right there

107
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:20,640
basically that's all it's doing and then

108
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:22,800
overlap my siding looks about three

109
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,770
inches and I'm not putting any nails

110
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,310
down here because I want to keep the

111
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:33,090
unholy yeah

112
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:34,950
all right so yeah also on the side we'll

113
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:39,210
put siding on that little section right

114
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:42,680
there and hopefully get some trim going

115
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:45,320
down and it'll cover up that gap there

116
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:48,880
yeah that's what's going on in the back

117
00:08:45,320 --> 00:09:02,549
time to get back and putting siding on
