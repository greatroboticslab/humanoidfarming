[Music]

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,280
i'm looking forward to following up here

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,240
with the first two presenters and sort

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,439
of bringing in

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,240
um just a kind of some practical

6
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,680
extension

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,039
uh perspectives to this i also want to

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,840
thank

9
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,199
my original co-author and co-presenter

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,039
of the first version of this

11
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,960
presentation

12
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,559
safely utilizing animal manures and

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,320
compost

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,680
on small produce farms and its

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,960
perspective

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,480
here from montana so

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,800
you know montana is known as cattle

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,760
country we're primarily a cow-calf state

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,960
but we do have some beef back grounding

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,440
and finishing

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,440
some dairies and some hog kafos so we do

22
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,719
have animal production systems where

23
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,160
manure

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,079
is collected um

25
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,160
but all counties in our state do have

26
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:06,159
sufficient conventional crop ground

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:09,600
relative to manure nutrients uh to

28
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,960
to agronomically utilize those resources

29
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,439
while we may have some high areas of

30
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,520
nutrient concentration within a county

31
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,200
within a region of the state this can

32
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,040
easily be remedied

33
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,040
with nearby export of those manure

34
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,560
nutrients

35
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,560
so where are they going well the top

36
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,119
bullet points here all the common places

37
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,320
that

38
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,759
you know many of us have worked with

39
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,920
management planning and nutrient

40
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,920
management planning and whatnot so just

41
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,960
moving manure and manure products to

42
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,240
conventional crop

43
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,640
and forage ground a lot of our nutrients

44
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,840
from manure in the state get processed

45
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,920
compost and go to reclamation projects

46
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,079
so usually some sort of mining

47
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,799
reclamation project

48
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,240
could go to organic row and or forage

49
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,159
crops

50
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,719
turf and green industries you know your

51
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,759
sod farms and nurseries and whatnot

52
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:02,640
uh utilize a fair amount of our

53
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,280
exported or manure nutrients exported

54
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,640
from

55
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,199
the site of origin and then finally

56
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,239
sort of the new and emerging opportunity

57
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,239
[Music]

58
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,599
driven by you know interest in local

59
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,440
food systems

60
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,120
across the country but in our montana

61
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,200
communities as well

62
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,319
that opens the opportunity to move

63
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,239
manure to small

64
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,239
produce farms and market gardens

65
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,480
this some images here sort of

66
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,000
demonstrate the

67
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:36,800
the use of those manure based

68
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,280
products and this is at our student-run

69
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,959
organic farm which is actually also a

70
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,280
retail farm

71
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,480
but in this image we see the importance

72
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,280
of bringing

73
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,959
manure in manure-based compost to

74
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,720
renovate soils

75
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,400
and then also provide for ongoing

76
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,760
fertility

77
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,800
so this compost here was

78
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,159
mostly beef manure from a research scale

79
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,239
but conventional

80
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:06,239
beef feeding facility and it's being

81
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,560
incorporated into soil under this

82
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,000
movable high tunnel

83
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,760
and a quick comment these high tunnels

84
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,120
are really important to us for vegetable

85
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,080
production

86
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,000
in montana uh you see this one day here

87
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,080
where they're working in the area and

88
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,239
then the image on the right

89
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,760
we see snow piled up from a late spring

90
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,159
snow storm so

91
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,080
these high tunnels make small veg small

92
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:31,680
scale vegetable production

93
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,480
possible in montana uh

94
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,400
we have noticed um social barriers

95
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,959
related to the exchange of nutrients

96
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,159
from the

97
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:43,519
animal ag industry to market gardens

98
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:46,319
um and that represents you know missed

99
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,400
market opportunities for

100
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,440
moving manure nutrients into another

101
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,200
sector or

102
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:56,480
helping better balance local

103
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,760
nutrient balance and such

104
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,920
and we're hoping to solve this just

105
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,439
through more facilitation and education

106
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,480
both by

107
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,200
extension and government agencies and a

108
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,280
lot of the

109
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,959
concern or the social barriers you know

110
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,720
it's just based around

111
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,319
well the important concern over food

112
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,319
safety

113
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,599
perhaps concern over herbicide residues

114
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,799
passing through the manure and the

115
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,519
compost

116
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:22,799
and then concerns over implications for

117
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,799
organic certification

118
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,360
and real quick i want to point out a

119
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,800
case study about a pretty interesting

120
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,919
unconventional

121
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,600
farm a mafia organic dairy primarily

122
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,240
raises dairy goats

123
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,120
and then they have their own cheese

124
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,240
plant

125
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:44,400
but in all of their waste management

126
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,919
cycles and whatnot they also have

127
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,560
other enterprises they have some

128
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,440
pastured pork and they have an organic

129
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,520
vegetable

130
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:56,479
enterprise so they manufacture

131
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,199
compost and it's mostly used for their

132
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,040
on-site

133
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,479
animal feed crops and that's a bunch of

134
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,520
organically certified

135
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:06,240
uh crop feed crop ground

136
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,199
they also use the the compost back into

137
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,400
their organic

138
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,800
vegetable enterprise and then they also

139
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,320
sometimes engage in occasional compost

140
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,919
sales

141
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,840
but they are moving these nutrients

142
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,039
through multiple enterprises on their

143
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,520
farm

144
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,600
everything is certified organic in this

145
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,639
case

146
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:30,400
and then the image shows some of their

147
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:32,000
compost working areas so the most raw

148
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,039
stuff here is in the foreground and

149
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,320
these uh bigger windrows

150
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,039
there's some curing piles and windrows

151
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,280
back here

152
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,240
a finishing screen and then there's

153
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,639
another storage

154
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,320
area not in that image where the

155
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:50,240
finished compost

156
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:54,400
is stored separate from all of the

157
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:56,639
raw and manure and compost working areas

158
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,080
um we've mentioned already the previous

159
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,840
two speakers brought forth

160
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,199
uh fisma and uh

161
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,240
don't need to speak too much about it

162
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,520
now or again i should say but just to

163
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,479
remind everybody that it does

164
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,160
focus on prevention of food safety

165
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,400
issues and though the rules are supposed

166
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,759
to be science and risk based

167
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,560
as we've heard just recently we

168
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,080
recognize that additional research

169
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,880
can provide further guidance and

170
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:26,880
understanding of the risks involved

171
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,880
and then potential policy adaptations

172
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:32,080
so on the practical advice side this is

173
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,759
what andrea

174
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,360
my colleague at montana department of

175
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,600
agriculture and the produce safety

176
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,280
program she likes to call it her musts

177
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,039
and shoulds lists

178
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,880
all right and this is really pulled from

179
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,759
the different rules and recommendations

180
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:49,520
but

181
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:52,560
um an operation a produce operation

182
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,639
under fisma must know must store and

183
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,199
convey manure and compost so that they

184
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,400
do not

185
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:01,039
impact or interact with

186
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,880
the produce covered by the rule food

187
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,919
contact surfaces and

188
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,880
processing areas areas

189
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:11,680
used for any other fisma or produce

190
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,840
safety rule covered activities

191
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,360
should not interfere with or interact

192
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,160
with water sources and water

193
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,479
distribution

194
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:23,360
systems you know we heard earlier how

195
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,599
irrigation water can be a potential

196
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,400
conduit for pathogens from manure

197
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:30,000
to produce and then any other soil

198
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,400
amendments you don't want the

199
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,599
raw manure or unfinished compost

200
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,240
products to

201
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:39,039
interact with or possibly contaminate

202
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,880
other soil amendments

203
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,720
should practices this is getting down

204
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,280
into little more details about how you

205
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,720
might accomplish those musts so you

206
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,879
should keep raw manure and finished

207
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,280
compost in separate areas

208
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,680
like i explained previously with the a

209
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,240
mafia dairy example

210
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,240
they have three different compost and

211
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,800
soil amendment working in storage

212
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,879
areas so you have that that gap in that

213
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,639
distance

214
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,160
you should designate specific equipment

215
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,280
and tools for dealing with soil

216
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,919
amendments

217
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,280
and uh you know raw versus treated

218
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,840
amendments

219
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,599
and then when you must have or need to

220
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,960
have shared equipment

221
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,879
then you should have a cleaning and

222
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,919
sanitation program

223
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,639
when that equipment moves from dealing

224
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,280
with a raw

225
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,160
type soil amendment to another purpose

226
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,879
on the farm

227
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:32,879
particularly anything that would be

228
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,879
closer contact with the actual produce

229
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,680
more should steps to prevent this

230
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:38,080
cross-contamination at the you know

231
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,440
small

232
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,360
farm level or any farm really

233
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,279
limit access and traffic around all the

234
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,720
soil amendment areas

235
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:51,360
that includes humans farm animals

236
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,320
nuisance animals and scavengers

237
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,320
equipment

238
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,240
any any sort of traffic or movement

239
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,000
around the farm you want to be

240
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:03,440
storing uh these place these materials

241
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,600
in such a way that uh regular traffic is

242
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,600
not going to cause

243
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,800
cross-contamination um and then just

244
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,839
like we would

245
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,320
manage manure and compost storage on any

246
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,040
size

247
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,640
operation you want to use best

248
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,920
management practices

249
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,839
um for pollution prevention around these

250
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,440
storage areas as well so appropriate

251
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,680
storm water management

252
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,600
runoff or leachate capture and

253
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,920
management if necessary

254
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,680
and these would all be you know best

255
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,240
management practices appropriate to the

256
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,680
climate

257
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:38,000
environment and other state and local

258
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,000
rules

259
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,760
usda good agricultural practice

260
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,080
standards also

261
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:49,519
overlap along with these

262
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,920
woods or shoulds shoulds and musts

263
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,839
that we talked about from fisma and some

264
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,630
of this is very similar once again

265
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,720
so looking at treated over non-treated

266
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:02,720
[Music]

267
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,320
soil amendments of manure origin

268
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,640
the right application timing and

269
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,279
considering the extending those harvest

270
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,480
intervals

271
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:13,279
that were discussed the 9120

272
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,920
the application method handling and

273
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,839
storage

274
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,600
we spoke about that just two slides ago

275
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,000
in more detail and then record keeping

276
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,720
about

277
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,640
the management of manure compost

278
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:27,760
composting processes

279
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:31,200
and all of the soil amendments used

280
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,880
as far as organic certification

281
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,880
there's some other you know best

282
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,000
practices or due diligence

283
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:41,920
we've already discussed 9120

284
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,120
with crops contacting the ground and

285
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,519
crops that may be above the ground

286
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,800
but also the issue that we've dealt with

287
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,440
a lot here in montana

288
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,720
as manures from animal agriculture have

289
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,079
moved into this small

290
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,240
produce sector um is the issue

291
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,279
of ag chemical residues in that manure

292
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,800
compost

293
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,480
and so this is just going to come down

294
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,240
to producer due diligence to make sure

295
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,750
that those types of residues are not

296
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,320
going to impact their production

297
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:12,079
[Music]

298
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,279
and then as always when we're talking

299
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:17,040
about an organically certified operation

300
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,800
you know you should work with an expert

301
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,000
certifier

302
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,120
as you communicate with farmers and make

303
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,959
sure anything they're

304
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:30,320
doing or adding is okay on the nop

305
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,320
list of approved products

306
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,680
so there are a variety of players here

307
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,440
in montana that are working with

308
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,959
producers

309
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,800
with the produce safety rule in the

310
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,200
national organic program that's really

311
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,200
led

312
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,720
in the state by montana department of

313
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,160
agriculture we have a state

314
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,240
certification program

315
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,079
there are other organic certifiers in

316
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,399
the state

317
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,200
but they play a large role in assisting

318
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,680
producers

319
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,120
and maintaining their certifications

320
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,240
while using

321
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,200
the types of products we're learning

322
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,360
about today

323
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,200
as far as regulatory education that also

324
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,240
happens from our montana department of

325
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,800
agriculture

326
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,880
as well as extension both in agriculture

327
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:12,079
and in foods and nutrition

328
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:14,000
and then trade organizations as well are

329
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:17,120
important conduits for education on this

330
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,120
topic to our growers

331
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,560
and then as far as just good

332
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,680
agricultural practices

333
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,279
and all around best management practices

334
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,880
a lot of the same folks are involved

335
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,760
there but also some of our producer

336
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,600
co-ops

337
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:35,040
are involved in educating producers

338
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:37,279
and helping manage all of this for

339
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,560
growers that may be a member of say this

340
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:42,320
example

341
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:44,720
co-op so in summary

342
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,959
manure and compost are valuable nutrient

343
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:50,320
inputs for small produce farms

344
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:52,000
they are not generally prohibited but we

345
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,120
rely on best practices

346
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,399
and rules to reduce the risk of some

347
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,760
sort of contamination

348
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,440
and a foodborne illness

349
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,880
and that just comes down to proper

350
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,000
management as discussed

351
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:08,639
today and in general everything we

352
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,279
talked about here the best practices and

353
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,160
um

354
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,600
you know these rules it focuses on

355
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,079
preventive measures

356
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,519
over widespread sampling and testing of

357
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,600
the food products

358
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,880
so this is an upfront preventive

359
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,480
management

360
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,800
you know set of recommendations and

361
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:28,240
programs that we've discussed here today

362
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,000
um instead of you know actual widespread

363
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:35,839
sampling and testing of

364
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,839
all the produce produced

365
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,760
you
