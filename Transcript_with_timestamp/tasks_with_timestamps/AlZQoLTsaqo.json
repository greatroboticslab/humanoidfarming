The main tasks include setting up and managing a high-tunnel system. This involves understanding the structure and components of the high-tunnel, such as installing a 10-32 foot wide, 6-mil film-covered structure (SUBTASK 1). To extend the growing season, selecting appropriate planting dates and rotating crops through the year is crucial (SUBTASK 2), ensuring timely harvests like early spring bell peppers and late fall cabbage. Fertility management involves preparing the soil with compost, manure, and possibly liquid fertilizers, following organic guidelines if desired (SUBTASK 3). Irrigation is critical, with advice to use drip systems and monitor soil moisture (SUBTASK 4). Pest management includes regular scouting, exclusion methods, and crop rotation to prevent disease and insect infestations (SUBTASK 5). Long-term maintenance involves inspecting the tunnel's structure, adjusting management practices, and potentially transitioning to organic certification (SUBTASKS 6-8). The key is to continuously adapt practices, especially for new growers, to maximize yield and profit (MAINTASK).",
