But maybe break it down even more. Like recognizing the different colors as indicators of different soil conditions. Since the task is to generate physical tasks related to the transcript, even if the activities are just observation and description. So maybe the main task is the analysis, with steps including identifying layers by sight, understanding the chemical processes underlying the colors, and noting the presence of biological activity. That might require subtasks where someone is holding the soil sample (physical action), noting the color changes (visual observation), explaining the chemistry (knowing the reactions), and identifying the roles of different microorganisms. However, the transcript doesn't mention specific tools or instruments; it's more of an observational description. So perhaps the key actions are looking at the soil layers (visual inspection), explaining the chemistry (understanding reactions), and recognizing the biological processes (assuming that's part of the analysis). Maybe also the act of taking the soil sample would be a subtask, but since the person already has the sample, maybe it's just analyzing what's there. But perhaps \"hold\" the sample is mentioned in the transcript. So the initial step could be getting the sample, which is part of the analysis. So let me try structuring this.",

If the user specifies \"put MAINTASK: before every task,\" then strictly for the first bullet in the MAINTASK, but in reality, in the given transcript, the main task is a singular analytic process, so \"Analyze soil chemistry\" is the main task (MAINTASK) with subsequent subtasks describing the steps. The final answer abides by this where MAINTASK is at the top and SUBTASK: starts the next level. The user's instruction is strictly followed there. The initial task is labeled as one MAINTASK with subtasks, but the instruction actually combines them saying \"MAINTASK: give a list of tasks based on the transcript.
