Subtasks touch on grazing, feed, additives, supplements, nutrition, health, breeding, emissions assessment, climate goals, and farmer support. ANSWERED AS A CLOZE: But how can we reduce enteric methane emissions from cattle? To manage these emissions, we must think about improving how we care for the animals. That starts with better grazing management. We need to let them eat the best grass possible, maybe even change the kind of grass they eat. Feeding them special supplements can also help; some researchers have found specific additives that reduce the methane their stomachs produce. Adding more forage to their diet is another idea, like hay or silage. We also need to make sure they're getting the right mix of food, balanced just right. For the animals themselves, we must take better care. Check on their health regularly and help them if they get sick. Selecting which animals to breed is key. By choosing the best ones\u2014one that are strong and disease-resistant\u2014maybe through selective breeding, we can create a better herd. As we improve their feeding, health, and genetics, their methane emissions will go down. Countries have different farming methods, so we have to figure out which solutions work best locally. Organizations like the FAO are helping by assessing these emissions and showing farmers how to adopt new technologies. If farmers can increase productivity without raising more animals, they save on resources and reduce their overall impact. By doing all these things, we can create sustainable farms that help both the planet and the people who depend on livestock. So the big answer here is that managing ruminant diets, improving their health and genetics, and assessing the impact all contribute to less methane and a greener planet. If we get this right, millions of farmers can thrive while protecting the environment.",
