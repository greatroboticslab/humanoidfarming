However, since promotion and engagement are also part of the activities mentioned, perhaps MAINTASK: Market the benefits of crop rotation; SUBTASK: Create educational content about crop rotation; SUBTASK: Encourage farmers to try crop rotation. Because the physical actions related to crop rotation, such as planting different crops each year, are part of the farming operations but the given transcript isn't focusing on those specific tasks. Instead, the transcript is more about discussing the concept and its benefits. Therefore, if this interpretation is correct, the transcript is more about knowledge dissemination rather than performing the physical task. Hence, the answer aligns with this.",
