Key subtasks include operating the laser-guided leveling attachment, positioning the transmitter and receiver, driving the tractor while adjusting attachment height, and verifying the result with a coach. Physical tasks focus on operating machinery and maintaining equipment settings. The conversation reinforces the significance of precise leveling for crop establishment and high yield. The video is relevant for tasks involving agricultural machinery operation and field preparation. Answer: MAINTASK: Level the field for wet-seeded rice. n**SUBTASK:** Understand the importance of water and weed control. n**SUBTASK:** Operate the laser-guided levelling attachment (position transmitter, receiver; drive tractor, maintain height, verify with coach). n**Answer:** MAINTASK: Level the field for wet-seeded rice. n- **Subtask 1:** Understand water and weed control importance. n- **Subtask 2:** Operate laser transmitter and receiver. n- **Subtask 3:** Drive tractor with levelling attachment, adjusting height. n- **Subtask 4:** Confirm leveling with coach.",
