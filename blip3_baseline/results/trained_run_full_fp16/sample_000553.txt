Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Provide numbered subtasks with concise justifications.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Water potted fig trees once a week during dry spells and every other week when the weather is humid.
2) Place the pot in direct sunlight for at least six hours daily to promote healthy growth.
3) Use a balanced fertilizer every two months from spring until fall.
4) Ensure the pot has adequate drainage holes to prevent waterlogging.
5) Choose a pot that is at least twice as wide as the fig tree's root ball for proper growth.
6) Rotate the pot every few weeks to ensure even growth on all sides.
7) Adjust watering frequency based on temperature and humidity levels in your area.
8) Apply a layer of mulch around the base of the plant to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
9) Prune the fig tree annually in late winter or early spring to maintain its shape and encourage new growth.
10) Consider repotting every two years as the plant grows larger to provide more space for roots.
