Task: How To Build a Raised Bed Garden
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Choose a location that receives at least six hours of sunlight daily for optimal plant growth.
2) Measure the area where you want to build your raised bed garden.
3) Decide on the size based on available space and desired planting area.
4) Gather materials such as wood, lumber, soil, rocks, and compost.
5) Construct the frame using wooden boards or other suitable materials.
6) Ensure the frame is at least 6 inches high for better drainage and accessibility.
7) Add layers of organic matter like straw or leaves between the soil and the frame for insulation.
8) Fill the raised bed with a mixture of topsoil, compost, and possibly perlite or vermiculite for improved drainage.
9) Smooth out the surface of the soil inside the raised bed for easy planting.
10) Plant seeds or seedlings according to their specific needs in terms of light, water, and nutrients.
11) Water the newly planted garden thoroughly to settle the soil and encourage root growth.
12) Monitor the plants regularly for signs of pests or diseases and take appropriate action if needed.
13) Maintain the garden by adding more compost or organic matter as needed throughout the growing season.
14) Harvest vegetables and flowers when they are ready, rotating crops to keep the soil healthy.
15) Prepare the raised bed for next year's planting by removing old plants and adding fresh soil or compost.
