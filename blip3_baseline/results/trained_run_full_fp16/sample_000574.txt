Task: Garlic and Onion Harvest -  Cold Climate Gardening
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Provide numbered subtasks with concise justifications.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Identify suitable cold climate varieties of garlic and onion that thrive in the local conditions.
2) Choose a location with well-draining soil and ample sunlight for optimal growth.
3) Prepare the soil by adding compost or organic matter to improve fertility and structure.
4) Plant garlic cloves in early spring when the ground has thawed but before the risk of frost passes.
5) Plant onion sets in late winter or early spring, ensuring they receive at least six hours of direct sunlight daily.
6) Space plants according to recommended guidelines to allow for proper air circulation and growth.
7) Water regularly during dry spells to maintain consistent moisture levels in the soil.
8) Mulch around plants to retain soil moisture and suppress weeds.
9) Monitor for pests and diseases, applying appropriate control measures as needed.
10) Harvest garlic bulbs when papery skins have dried on the tops, usually in late summer or early fall.
11) Dig up onions after the tops naturally die back, typically in mid-summer.
12) Cure harvested garlic and onions in a warm, dry place away from direct sunlight until the outer skin becomes papery and brittle.
13) Store cured garlic and onions in a cool, dark location until ready to use or preserve.
14) Rotate crops annually to prevent depletion of nutrients in the soil and reduce disease buildup.
15) Consider companion planting techniques to enhance plant health and deter pests naturally.
