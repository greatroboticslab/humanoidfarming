Task: Growing Corn Basics Time Lapse - 6 days
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Emphasize precision, sustainability, and error checks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Planting seeds in prepared soil begins the corn growing process.
2) Watering daily keeps young plants healthy and strong.
3) Sunlight exposure promotes photosynthesis for plant growth.
4) As days pass, seedlings emerge from the ground.
5) Leaves grow larger as plants reach towards sunlight.
6) Roots deepen their hold in the soil as cornstalks stretch taller.
7) Pollen is transferred to silks, initiating kernel formation.
8) Kernel development continues until mature ears form.
9) Harvest time arrives when kernels are fully plump and golden.
10) Processing begins immediately after harvest for best quality.
End.
