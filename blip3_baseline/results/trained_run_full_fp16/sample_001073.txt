Task: From Cane to Crystal: The Hidden Secrets of Sugar Production
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Begin by selecting high-quality sugar cane for optimal sugar production.
2) Harvest the sugar cane and transport it to a processing plant.
3) Crush the sugar cane to extract its juice through pressing or grinding.
4) Boil the extracted juice to remove water and concentrate the sugar content.
5) Add crystals of sugar to the boiling juice as it cools down.
6) Stir continuously during boiling to prevent crystallization on the sides of the pot.
7) Once the mixture reaches the desired consistency, filter out the remaining solids.
8) Allow the filtered liquid to cool naturally or use an evaporator to speed up cooling.
9) As the liquid cools, sugar crystals will form on the surface.
10) Remove the formed crystals from the liquid and allow them to dry completely.
11) Store the dried sugar crystals in a clean, dry place until ready for use.
12) This process reveals the intricate steps involved in transforming raw sugar cane into refined sugar crystals.
