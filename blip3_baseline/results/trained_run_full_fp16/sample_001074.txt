Task: How (Not) To Bale Hay : Busted Belts
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Provide numbered subtasks with concise justifications.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) First, ensure all baling equipment is in good working order before starting the task.
2) Place the hay bales on a flat surface that can support their weight without bending or breaking.
3) Secure each bale tightly with the baling twine, making sure not to over-tighten which could damage the bale.
4) Use belts to secure the bales together, leaving enough slack for easy handling and preventing compression.
5) Align the belts correctly around the bales, ensuring they are evenly spaced and tight but not pulling too hard on the twine.
6) Tighten the belts gradually, checking periodically to avoid damaging the bales or causing them to shift.
7) Once satisfied with the belt tension, secure the ends of the belts tightly to prevent them from slipping off during transport.
8) Finally, check all bales for proper baling and belt placement before moving them to storage or another location.
9) Always wear protective gear like gloves and safety glasses when handling baling equipment to prevent injuries.
10) After completing the task, clean up any spilled hay or debris from the work area.
