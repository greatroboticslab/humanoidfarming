Task: DIY watering automation system build #1
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Purchase necessary components including a soil moisture sensor, an Arduino board, a relay module, a water pump, and a battery pack.
2) Connect the soil moisture sensor to the Arduino board according to the manufacturer's instructions.
3) Program the Arduino board to turn on the relay when the moisture level drops below a set threshold.
4) Attach the relay output to the water pump control line.
5) Install the water pump in your garden or potted plant area.
6) Mount the soil moisture sensor in the soil where you want to automate watering.
7) Connect the battery pack to the Arduino board for power supply.
8) Test the system by simulating low soil moisture levels to ensure the water pump turns on as expected.
9) Place the entire setup in a suitable location outdoors or indoors near the plants.
10) Monitor the system regularly to adjust settings as needed based on weather conditions and plant needs.
11) Consider adding a user interface like a smartphone app for remote control if desired.
12) Ensure all connections are secure and there is no risk of electrical shock during installation.
