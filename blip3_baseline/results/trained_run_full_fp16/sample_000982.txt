------------------------------------------------------------
1) Start by selecting a sunny spot in your garden where the soil is well-draining and rich in organic matter.
2) Purchase seeds or seedlings from a reputable nursery to ensure you get healthy plants.
3) Prepare the soil by adding compost or well-rotted manure to improve fertility and structure.
4) Plant seeds indoors six to eight weeks before the last expected frost date or transplant seedlings outdoors after they have grown at least four inches tall.
5) Space plants about 18 to 24 inches apart to allow for proper air circulation and growth.
6) Water regularly, keeping the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged.
7) Mulch around the base of the plants to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
8) Support taller varieties with stakes or cages to prevent damage from heavy fruit weight.
9) Apply a balanced fertilizer every four to six weeks during the growing season to promote healthy growth.
10) Monitor for pests and diseases regularly, treating them promptly if necessary.
11) Harvest peppers when they reach their full color and size, which typically takes about 70 to 90 days from planting.
12) Store harvested peppers in a cool, dry place or freeze them for future use.
