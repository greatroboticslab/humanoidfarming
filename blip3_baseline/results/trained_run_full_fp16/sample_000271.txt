Task: THE ONLY TOOL YOU NEED FOR GRAVEL DRIVEWAY MAINTENANCE!
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Provide numbered subtasks with concise justifications.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Identify the type of gravel used in your driveway to choose appropriate maintenance tools.
2) Purchase a broom or leaf blower to remove loose debris and dirt from the driveway surface.
3) Get a rake to gather larger pieces of debris and debris that has settled deeper into the gravel bed.
4) Invest in a wheelbarrow for transporting gravel and other materials needed for filling gaps or adding new layers.
5) Acquire a shovel to dig out and replace damaged sections of the driveway if necessary.
6) Buy a squeegee or sponge to clean the edges of the driveway where water tends to pool.
7) Consider getting a vacuum cleaner to suck up stubborn dirt and grime that sticks to the gravel.
8) If you have a lot of gravel, a scoop or trowel can help distribute the material more evenly across the driveway.
9) For deep cleaning, a pressure washer can be used but ensure it's set to a low-pressure setting to avoid damaging the gravel.
10) Lastly, keep a bucket handy for mixing any necessary sealants or treatments before applying them to protect the driveway.
