Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Provide numbered subtasks with concise justifications.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Purchase or create a suitable container for your worm farm, ensuring it has adequate drainage and ventilation.
2) Add bedding material like shredded newspaper, cardboard, or coconut coir to provide a comfortable environment for worms.
3) Introduce red wiggler worms, which are ideal for vermicomposting, along with some soil and kitchen scraps as food sources.
4) Maintain a balanced diet of kitchen waste such as fruit peels, vegetable scraps, coffee grounds, and eggshells, avoiding meat products and dairy.
5) Keep the worm bin moist but not waterlogged, maintaining a consistent temperature between 60째F and 80째F (15째C and 27째C).
6) Turn the contents of the bin every few weeks to aerate the bedding and distribute nutrients evenly among the worms.
7) Harvest mature compost from the bottom of the bin when the top layer becomes dark and rich in organic matter.
8) Repeat the process by replenishing the worm population and adding new food scraps as needed.
9) Monitor the health of your worms regularly for signs of illness or stress, adjusting care as necessary.
10) Consider using a separate bin for new batches of worms to prevent contamination and ensure clean conditions for each cycle.
