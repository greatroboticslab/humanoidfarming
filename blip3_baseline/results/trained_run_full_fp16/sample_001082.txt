Task: Critical Making Mentorship - Gravity-fed Modular Irrigation Kit by Ira Emmanuel
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Identify key components needed for the gravity-fed modular irrigation kit.
2) Research existing designs to understand their strengths and weaknesses.
3) Sketch preliminary designs of the irrigation system's components.
4) Choose appropriate materials based on durability and cost-effectiveness.
5) Decide on the size and layout of the irrigation system for scalability.
6) Develop a detailed assembly guide for easy construction by users.
7) Create a user manual explaining how to install and maintain the system.
8) Test the irrigation system in various environments to ensure reliability.
9) Gather feedback from potential users to refine the design further.
10) Produce prototypes of the irrigation kit for testing and validation.
11) Collaborate with local communities to pilot the use of the irrigation system.
12) Document all processes and outcomes for future reference and improvement.
