Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Provide numbered subtasks with concise justifications.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Start by preparing the soil in your garden bed, ensuring it is loose and rich in organic matter.
2) Plant corn seeds about two inches deep and six inches apart in rows that are at least three feet apart.
3) Water the plants deeply once a week, adjusting frequency based on weather conditions.
4) Apply a balanced fertilizer every four weeks during the growing season to support healthy growth.
5) Monitor the plants regularly for signs of pests or diseases, such as chewed leaves or discoloration.
6) Remove weeds manually or use a hoe to keep the area around the corn free from competition for nutrients and water.
7) Support taller corn stalks with stakes or cages to prevent them from falling over due to wind or heavy rain.
8) Harvest ears when they reach full size and show signs of maturity, typically after 20-25 days from planting.
9) Rotate crops annually to avoid depleting soil nutrients and reduce pest and disease buildup.
10) Consider using natural methods like neem oil or diatomaceous earth to control common corn pests without harmful chemicals.
