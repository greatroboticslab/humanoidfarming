Task: Farming Documentary: Harvesting and Processing Billions of Tons of Sugarcane in the U S
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Emphasize precision, sustainability, and error checks.
------------------------------------------------------------
Harvesting sugarcane begins when farmers cut the stalks using large machines.
Farmers then transport the harvested sugarcane to processing plants via trucks.
At the processing plant, the sugarcane is unloaded and sorted by quality.
The sugarcane is washed to remove dirt and debris before being chopped into pieces.
Chopped sugarcane is fed into a mill where it is pressed to extract juice.
The extracted juice undergoes boiling to concentrate and remove impurities.
After boiling, the juice is cooled and crystals form on its surface.
Crystals are separated from the juice through a process called centrifugation.
The refined sugar is then dried and packaged for distribution.
Processed sugarcane waste is used as biofuel or composted for agricultural use.
Final step involves checking the quality of all processed products before they are shipped out.
