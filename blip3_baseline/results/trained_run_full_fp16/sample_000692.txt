Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
Bury weeds deep in the soil to prevent them from growing back.
Rake the area thoroughly to remove any remaining small weeds.
Apply a layer of mulch over the prepared soil to suppress new weed growth.
Water the newly prepared soil thoroughly to settle the mulch and seeds.
Wait at least two weeks before planting new seeds or seedlings.
Check regularly for new weeds and remove them as they appear.
Monitor the new plants closely for signs of pests or disease.
Adjust watering and fertilizing schedules according to the new plant's needs.
Prepare the soil again if necessary before replanting during the next season.
Inspect the garden weekly for any signs of pests or diseases affecting the new plants.
Trim dead or damaged leaves and stems from the new plants as needed.
Rotate crops annually to avoid depleting soil nutrients and reduce pest buildup.
Maintain a healthy balance of organic matter in the soil through composting or adding manure.
Encourage beneficial insects that prey on common garden pests naturally.
Use natural methods like neem oil or insecticidal soap instead of chemical pesticides when necessary.
Harvest vegetables and flowers promptly to encourage continued growth and production.
Remove spent blooms to promote more flowers and prevent seed production.
Inspect the garden for signs of nutrient deficiencies and adjust soil pH if needed.
Consider companion planting to deter pests and enhance plant health naturally.
Store seeds properly for future planting seasons after harvesting all crops.
Dispose of weeds and plant debris properly to prevent disease spread.
Plan the layout of future plantings
