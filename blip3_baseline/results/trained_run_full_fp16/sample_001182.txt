Task: Cotton Farming 2020
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Emphasize precision, sustainability, and error checks.
------------------------------------------------------------
Cotton farming in 2020 involves selecting suitable land for planting.
Farmers choose cotton varieties resistant to local pests and diseases.
They prepare the soil by plowing and adding organic matter enriching it.
Next, they sow seeds at proper depth ensuring adequate spacing between plants.
After sowing, farmers irrigate the fields regularly maintaining consistent moisture levels.
Weeding is done manually or mechanically removing unwanted vegetation.
Pest control measures include using natural predators and biological pesticides.
Disease management involves timely application of fungicides when necessary.
Farmers monitor crop growth closely looking for signs of stress or infestation.
As cotton matures, it is harvested by hand or machine depending on size.
After harvest, the cotton is sorted and graded according to quality standards.
Finally, processed cotton is sold to textile manufacturers or stored for future use.
End of task.
