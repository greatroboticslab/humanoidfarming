Task: System of Rice Intensification (SRI): Producing more with less
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Identify areas suitable for SRI practices based on local climate and soil conditions.
2) Plant rice seeds at a lower density to promote better root development.
3) Water plants deeply but infrequently to encourage strong root growth.
4) Monitor plant health closely for signs of stress or disease.
5) Harvest rice when grains reach full maturity for maximum yield.
6) Implement crop rotation and organic fertilizers to maintain soil fertility.
7) Use mulching techniques to retain moisture and control weeds effectively.
8) Train farmers in SRI methods through workshops and demonstrations.
9) Establish community networks to share knowledge and resources.
10) Evaluate the success of SRI practices annually to refine methods.
