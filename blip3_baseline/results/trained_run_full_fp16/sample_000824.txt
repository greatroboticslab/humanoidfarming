Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Gather all ingredients including goat's milk, olive oil, coconut oil, lye, distilled water, and essential oils.
2) Measure out 500 grams of goat's milk and pour it into a large mixing bowl.
3) In a separate container, mix 400 grams of olive oil and 100 grams of coconut oil until they are melted and combined.
4) Slowly add 250 grams of lye to the goat's milk while stirring continuously.
5) Once fully dissolved, slowly pour the goat's milk mixture into the melted oil mixture.
6) Continue stirring until the soap batter reaches trace stage.
7) Add essential oils for scent and pour the soap batter into molds.
8) Cover the molds with plastic wrap and let them sit undisturbed for 24 hours.
9) After 24 hours, unmold the soap and cut it into desired shapes.
10) Place the soap bars on a rack to dry for at least four weeks.
11) Once dried, apply a final cut and store the soap bars in a cool, dry place.
12) Test the soap's hardness after curing by pressing two bars together; if they don't stick, it's ready for use.
