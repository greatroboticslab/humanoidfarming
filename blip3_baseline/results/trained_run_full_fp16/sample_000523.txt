Task: Powerful Tractor Plowing the Field | Farming in Action  #Tractor #TractorPlowing #PlowingTheField
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) The powerful tractor approaches the field ready for work.
2) It starts moving forward slowly at first to assess the terrain.
3) Then, with increased speed, it begins plowing the soil deeply.
4) The blades of the tractor dig into the ground, creating furrows.
5) As it continues, the soil is lifted and turned over.
6) The process repeats across the entire field, leaving behind neat rows.
7) After completing one pass, the tractor turns around to start again.
8) This cycle of plowing is repeated until the field is fully prepared.
9) Once done, the field looks ready for planting seeds or crops.
10) The tractor then moves off, leaving behind a well-tended piece of land.
11) Farmers often follow up with other tasks like fertilizing or sowing seeds.
12) The day's work concludes as the tractor returns to its base or storage area.
