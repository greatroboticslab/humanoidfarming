Task: 8 Tips For Dry Climate Gardening Without Irrigation (Dust Mulch Wide Spacing Hugelpaths Etc.)
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Emphasize precision, sustainability, and error checks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Choose drought-resistant plants suitable for the local climate.
2) Apply a thin layer of organic mulch around plants to retain moisture.
3) Space plants widely to allow better air circulation and reduce water loss.
4) Use hugelkultur mounds to improve soil structure and retain moisture.
5) Water deeply but infrequently to encourage deep root growth.
6) Prune plants regularly to promote healthy growth and reduce water needs.
7) Mulch paths between plants to prevent evaporation and keep soil cool.
8) Consider using greywater or rainwater harvesting systems for supplemental irrigation.
