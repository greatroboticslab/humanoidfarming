Task: Welding Farming Equipment - NEW UNKNOWN TILLER + Kubota L2502
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Provide numbered subtasks with concise justifications.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Identify the specifications of the NEW UNKNOWN TILLER to determine appropriate welding techniques and materials.
2) Research Kubota L2502 specifications for compatibility and safety during welding processes.
3) Assess the structural integrity of the TILLER's components before beginning any welding work.
4) Prepare all necessary tools and equipment for safe and effective welding of the TILLER.
5) Ensure proper ventilation and safety gear are in place during the welding process.
6) Start welding from the base or frame of the TILLER, ensuring even heat distribution across the metal surface.
7) Use appropriate welding techniques based on the type of metal used in the TILLER's construction.
8) Monitor the welding process closely to avoid overheating or damaging the TILLER's components.
9) Apply filler material as needed to strengthen welds and ensure structural integrity.
10) Allow the welded areas to cool completely before inspecting them for any defects or weaknesses.
11) If necessary, sand down rough edges and smooth out surfaces to prepare for painting or further assembly.
12) Once satisfied with the welding quality, proceed with painting or attaching additional parts as required for the TILLER.
