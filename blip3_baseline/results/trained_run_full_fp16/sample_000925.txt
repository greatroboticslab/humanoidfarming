Task: Four fruiting trees for drought-prone gardens
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Identify areas prone to drought in the garden.
2) Choose drought-resistant fruiting tree species suitable for local climate.
3) Select trees that require minimal watering and can tolerate dry conditions.
4) Plant trees at least 6 feet apart to allow for air circulation and reduce water loss.
5) Mulch around trees to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
6) Apply organic matter like compost or well-rotted manure to improve soil structure.
7) Install drip irrigation system if necessary to deliver water directly to roots.
8) Monitor trees regularly for signs of stress or disease due to drought.
9) Consider companion planting strategies to enhance tree health and resilience.
10) Prepare soil before planting to ensure proper drainage and nutrient availability.
11) Water newly planted trees deeply but infrequently to encourage deep root growth.
12) Apply mulch immediately after planting to protect roots and conserve soil moisture.
13) Avoid overwatering as it can lead to root rot and other issues in drought-prone areas.
14) Use mulch to retain soil moisture and regulate temperature around tree roots.
15) Prune trees selectively to promote healthy growth and reduce water usage.
16) Apply slow-release fertilizers during growing season to support fruit production.
17) Keep an eye on weather forecasts to prepare for potential drought events.
18) Encourage natural pollinators like bees and butterflies to help with fruit set.
19) Harvest fruits promptly when ripe to prevent.
