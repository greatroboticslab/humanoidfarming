Task: Combine harvester in action
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) The combine harvester is loaded with grain crops ready for harvesting.
2) It starts moving forward at a steady pace across the field.
3) The cutting mechanism cuts through the stalks of the crops efficiently.
4) The threshing system separates the grains from the stalks.
5) The cleaned grains fall into the storage bin behind the machine.
6) As the machine moves on, the remaining stalks are left behind.
7) The process continues until the entire field has been harvested.
8) Once completed, the combine harvester is unloaded and prepared for next use.
9) Workers gather around to collect the harvested grains for processing or storage.
10) The field is now ready for subsequent farming activities or maintenance.
