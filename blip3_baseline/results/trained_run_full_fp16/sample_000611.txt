Task: Polydome Sustainable Agriculture System
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Provide numbered subtasks with concise justifications.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Identify key sustainable agriculture practices for implementation in the polydome system.
2) Design the polydome structure to maximize natural light and ventilation efficiency.
3) Select appropriate crops that thrive in controlled environments like the polydome.
4) Install hydroponic systems or other water-saving irrigation methods within the polydome.
5) Integrate renewable energy sources such as solar panels to power the polydome operations.
6) Implement pest control measures using biological methods rather than chemicals.
7) Monitor soil quality and nutrient levels regularly to maintain optimal growing conditions.
8) Establish a recycling system for water and organic waste to reduce environmental impact.
9) Develop a system for monitoring temperature, humidity, and light levels inside the polydome.
10) Train farmers on sustainable farming techniques and best practices for the polydome environment.
11) Plan for crop rotation and diversification to prevent soil depletion and pest buildup.
12) Set up a system for collecting data on plant growth, yield, and resource usage for analysis and improvement.
