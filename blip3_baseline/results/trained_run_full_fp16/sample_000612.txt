Task: Modern Agriculture Technology: How Billions of Peaches Are Harvested and Processed by US Farmers
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Billions of peaches are harvested using large mechanical harvesters that pick up the fruit from trees.
2) After harvesting, the peaches are sorted based on size, color, and ripeness to ensure quality.
3) Selected peaches are then processed through washing stations to remove any dirt or debris.
4) The peaches go through grading systems to determine their final market value.
5) Depending on the intended use, peaches may undergo further processing like canning, freezing, or juicing.
6) Once processed, the products are packaged in various containers for distribution to retailers and consumers.
7) Throughout this process, farmers monitor weather conditions and soil health to maintain optimal growing conditions for future crops.
