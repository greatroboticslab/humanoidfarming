Weeding Made Easy
- Year Round Mulch Garden
1) Choose a suitable mulch material like straw, wood chips, or shredded leaves to cover the soil surface.
2) Apply a layer of mulch at least 2 inches thick around plants to suppress weeds.
3) Regularly check and remove any weeds that emerge through the mulch.
4) Keep the mulch layer consistent by adding more as needed throughout the year.
5) Water deeply once a week to keep the mulch moist and prevent weed growth.
6) Rotate the placement of mulch each season to maintain its effectiveness against weeds.
7) Use hand tools or a hoe to carefully pull out weeds that penetrate the mulch.
8) Avoid walking on the mulched area to prevent compaction and encourage healthy plant growth.
9) Integrate compost or well-rotted manure into the mulch periodically for added nutrients.
10) Monitor the garden regularly for signs of pests or diseases, addressing them promptly to maintain overall health.
