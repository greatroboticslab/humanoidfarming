Task: Furrow Irrigation System - IV
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Assess soil moisture levels using sensors to determine when irrigation is needed.
2) Calculate water volume based on crop type and current soil conditions.
3) Program the furrow irrigation system to turn on at scheduled intervals.
4) Adjust nozzle pressure to ensure even water distribution along furrows.
5) Monitor system performance through real-time data collection and analysis.
6) Prepare for maintenance tasks such as cleaning filters and checking valve operation.
7) Train farmers on proper use of the new irrigation system for optimal results.
8) Implement backup plans in case of power outages or equipment failures.
9) Evaluate system efficiency after several growing seasons for potential improvements.
10) Document all findings and adjustments made during the implementation process.
