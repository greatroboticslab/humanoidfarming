Harvesting the Potatoes + Plans for Fall Veges
1) Begin harvesting potatoes when they reach full size, usually after about 100 days from planting.
2) Use a garden fork to carefully lift potatoes without damaging them.
3) Sort harvested potatoes by size and store larger ones in a cool, dry place.
4) Prepare soil for fall vegetables by adding compost or well-rotted manure.
5) Choose fall vegetables that thrive in cooler temperatures like kale, spinach, and carrots.
6) Plant seeds or seedlings of chosen fall vegetables according to their specific planting times.
7) Water newly planted fall vegetables regularly to help establish roots and encourage growth.
8) Mulch around plants to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
9) Monitor for pests and diseases, applying organic treatments if necessary.
10) Continue planning for future gardening seasons by noting which crops performed best this year.
