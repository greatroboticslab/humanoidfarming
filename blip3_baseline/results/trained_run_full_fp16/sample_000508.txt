Task: The chemicals released due to unsustainable agricultural practices and causing soil polluiton are
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Emphasize precision, sustainability, and error checks.
------------------------------------------------------------
The chemicals released due to unsustainable agricultural practices and causing soil pollution are.
1) Pesticides used excessively kill beneficial insects along with pests.
2) Fertilizers containing nitrogen and phosphorus leach into groundwater.
3) Herbicides like glyphosate harm microorganisms in the soil ecosystem.
4) Heavy metals from industrial runoff contaminate soil directly.
5) Organic matter decomposition slows down due to chemical interference.
6) Soil structure deteriorates leading to erosion and reduced fertility.
7) Plants absorb toxic substances, affecting their growth and health.
8) Wildlife exposed to contaminated soil suffer from poisoning or malnutrition.
9) Long-term use leads to irreversible damage to soil health and biodiversity.
10) Airborne pollutants from burning crop residues contribute to smog formation.
11) Runoff water carries these pollutants into nearby rivers and lakes.
12) This cycle continues unless sustainable farming methods are adopted.
