Task: What is Regenerative Agriculture?
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Emphasize precision, sustainability, and error checks.
------------------------------------------------------------
Regenerative agriculture involves practices that enhance soil health, biodiversity, and ecosystem services while producing food sustainably.
It aims to rebuild soil organic matter and restore degraded soil biodiversity for long-term profits.
This approach includes crop rotation, cover cropping, reduced tillage, and integrating livestock to improve nutrient cycling.
It also promotes the use of perennial crops and agroforestry systems to increase resilience against climate change.
Moreover, regenerative agriculture seeks to eliminate synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, relying instead on natural methods to maintain productivity.
Finally, it emphasizes fair treatment of workers and communities, ensuring social equity alongside environmental benefits.
