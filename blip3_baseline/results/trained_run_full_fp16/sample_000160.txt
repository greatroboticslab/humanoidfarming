Task: Modern Agriculture: How Millions of Onions Are Harvested and Processed
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Millions of onions are harvested using large mechanical harvesters that cut the plants at ground level.
2) The harvested onions are then transported to processing facilities where they are sorted.
3) Sorted onions are washed to remove dirt and debris before being dried in large drying rooms.
4) Dried onions are then peeled, sliced, or chopped depending on their final product.
5) Peeling, slicing, or chopping processes can be automated for efficiency and consistency.
6) After processing, onions are packaged in various sizes and types for distribution.
7) Some processed onions may undergo further refining steps like blanching or freezing before packaging.
8) Packaging materials include plastic bags, boxes, or bulk containers based on the onion's intended use.
9) Finally, processed onions are shipped to markets, grocery stores, restaurants, and food manufacturers worldwide.
10) This entire process ensures efficient and scalable production of onions for global consumption.
