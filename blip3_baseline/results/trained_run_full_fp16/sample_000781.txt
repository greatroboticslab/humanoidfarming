Task: Growing Potatoes Through the Year | Produce Made Simple
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
Plant seeds in early spring when soil temperatures reach at least 50 degrees Fahrenheit.
Choose a sunny spot for planting potatoes that receives at least six hours of direct sunlight daily.
Prepare the soil by adding compost or well-rotted manure to improve its fertility and structure.
Dig shallow trenches about 8 inches deep and space them about 12 inches apart.
Place seed potatoes in the trenches, eyes facing up, and cover them with soil.
Water the planted areas thoroughly after covering the seed potatoes.
Monitor the plants weekly for signs of pests or diseases and treat if necessary.
Apply mulch around the plants to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
Harvest small tubers as they develop throughout the growing season.
Allow the plants to die back naturally before harvesting the main crop.
Store harvested potatoes in a cool, dark place with good air circulation.
Rotate crops annually to prevent soil-borne diseases and maintain soil health.
Dispose of diseased plants and debris properly to reduce pest and disease pressure next year.
Maintain consistent watering practices to ensure steady growth and avoid water stress.
Inspect new seed potatoes for signs of rot or damage before planting them.
Regularly monitor the height of the plants and adjust the depth of the soil as needed.
Trim off any yellowing leaves from the plants to focus energy on producing more tubers.
Feed the plants with a balanced fertilizer every few weeks during the growing season.
Check for signs of potato beetle infestations and apply appropriate insecticides if necessary.
Prune the plants
