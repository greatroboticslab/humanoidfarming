Task: Lec 10: Problems arising due to modern agricultural practices #CH24SP #swayamprabha
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Provide numbered subtasks with concise justifications.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Modern agricultural practices lead to increased use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides.
2) This leads to soil degradation over time as nutrients are depleted.
3) Pesticides contaminate water sources harming aquatic life and human health.
4) Monoculture farming reduces biodiversity, making crops more susceptible to pests and diseases.
5) Overuse of groundwater for irrigation causes depletion and salinization issues.
6) Greenhouse gas emissions from farm machinery and livestock contribute to climate change.
7) Food miles increase due to long-distance transportation, raising environmental costs.
8) Genetic uniformity in crops makes them vulnerable to new diseases and pests.
9) Farmers face financial strain from high input costs while low prices affect profits.
10) Rural communities suffer from depopulation as young people migrate for better opportunities.
11) Soil erosion becomes more prevalent due to intensive farming methods.
12) Air pollution from burning fossil fuels for energy increases in agricultural areas.
13) Water scarcity exacerbates in regions relying heavily on agriculture.
14) Biodiversity loss impacts ecosystem services crucial for food production.
15) Climate variability affects crop yields unpredictably, increasing uncertainty.
16) Organic matter decreases in soils leading to lower fertility levels.
17) Energy consumption rises significantly in modern farming operations.
18) Nutrient runoff from farms pollutes nearby rivers and lakes severely.
19) Wildlife habitats shrink as farmland expands across landscapes.
20) Public trust in food safety declines due.
