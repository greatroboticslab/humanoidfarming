Task: Composting 101 - building your compost bin
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Choose a location for your compost bin that receives at least six hours of sunlight daily and is easily accessible for adding materials.
2) Select a container suitable for composting, such as a wooden box, plastic bin with a lid, or wire mesh enclosure.
3) Line the bottom of the container with twigs, leaves, or newspaper to improve drainage and prevent odors.
4) Add a layer of brown materials like dried leaves, straw, or shredded paper to provide carbon-rich material.
5) Follow with a layer of green materials like vegetable scraps, grass clippings, or coffee grounds for nitrogen-rich content.
6) Continue alternating layers of browns and greens until the container is full.
7) Water the compost pile lightly but consistently to maintain moisture levels similar to a damp sponge.
8) Turn the compost regularly using a pitchfork or shovel to mix the contents and speed up decomposition.
9) Cover the compost pile when not in use to retain heat and moisture and reduce pests and odors.
10) After about two months, you'll have finished compost ready for use in gardening or landscaping projects.
