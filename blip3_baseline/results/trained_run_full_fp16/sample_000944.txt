Task: How to Feed Your Worm Farm | Smash it Down & Add Some Browns!
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Provide numbered subtasks with concise justifications.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Start by gathering materials including worm castings, kitchen scraps, and shredded newspaper for the bedding.
2) Place the bedding in the bottom of your worm farm container ensuring it covers the entire base.
3) Add the kitchen scraps on top of the bedding layer, making sure they're evenly distributed.
4) Sprinkle a thin layer of worm castings over the kitchen scraps to provide nutrients for the worms.
5) Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you've filled the container about three-quarters full.
6) Cover the top layer with a breathable lid to keep pests out while allowing air circulation.
7) Water the bedding lightly but regularly to keep it moist without becoming soggy.
8) Rotate the contents of your worm farm every few weeks to ensure all layers receive equal amounts of oxygen and food.
9) Harvest the mature compost from the bottom of the bin when it's ready, usually after 2-3 months.
10) Dispose of the old bedding and start anew with fresh materials for your next feeding session.
