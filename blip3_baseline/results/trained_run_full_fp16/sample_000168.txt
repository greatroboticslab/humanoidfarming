Task: How to grow Popping Corn From Seed to Plant
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
Plant popcorn seeds in well-draining soil.
Water the seeds gently until the soil is moist but not soggy.
Place the pot or garden bed in a sunny spot for at least six hours daily.
Monitor for signs of growth after about two weeks.
Once sprouts appear, thin them out to allow each plant space to grow.
Fertilize the plants every few weeks with a balanced liquid fertilizer.
Continue watering regularly, keeping the soil consistently moist.
Support taller plants with stakes as they grow taller.
Harvest when the kernels are fully popped and the husks turn brown.
Store harvested corn in an airtight container away from direct sunlight.
Dispose of any diseased or damaged plants to prevent spreading illness.
