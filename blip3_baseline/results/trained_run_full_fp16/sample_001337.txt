Task: Small Farm Irrigation - Video 5 - Attaching and Plugging Drip Tape to a Lay Flat Header Pipe
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Provide numbered subtasks with concise justifications.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Begin by gathering all necessary tools including a lay flat header pipe, drip tape, and appropriate connectors.
2) Locate the starting point of the lay flat header pipe where it will connect to the main water source.
3) Attach one end of the drip tape to the lay flat header pipe using a suitable connector.
4) Ensure the connection is secure by tightening any necessary fittings or clamps.
5) Continue attaching the drip tape to the lay flat header pipe in a straight line, maintaining even spacing between each section.
6) Once the drip tape is fully attached, check for any leaks or kinks in the system.
7) Use a pressure regulator if needed to control water flow through the drip tape system.
8) Finally, plug the other end of the lay flat header pipe to prevent water from escaping before the irrigation begins.
9) Mark the starting and ending points of the drip tape system for easy identification during future maintenance.
10) Test the entire system for proper functioning before turning on the water supply.
