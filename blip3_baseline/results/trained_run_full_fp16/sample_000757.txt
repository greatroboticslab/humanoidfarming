Task: On-Farm Composting Fundamentals with Dr. Robert Rynk
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Provide numbered subtasks with concise justifications.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Identify suitable materials for composting on-farm including kitchen scraps, yard waste, and animal manure.
2) Create a designated area for composting that is well-drained and has good air circulation.
3) Mix equal parts of green materials like vegetable peels and brown materials like dried leaves to maintain balance.
4) Add water to the compost pile until it feels damp but not soggy.
5) Turn the compost regularly using a pitchfork or shovel to aerate and speed up decomposition.
6) Cover the compost pile with a tarp when weather is dry to retain moisture and heat.
7) Monitor temperature within the compost pile; ideal range should be between 130째F and 160째F (54째C to 71째C).
8) Allow the compost to mature for at least three months before using it as fertilizer.
9) Test the finished compost for its pH level and nutrient content before applying to plants.
10) Store excess compost in a covered container to prevent pests and odors.
