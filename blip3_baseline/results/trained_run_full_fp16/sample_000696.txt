Task: Growing Hibiscus Plants Indoors | Overwintering
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Choose a suitable indoor location with bright, indirect sunlight for your hibiscus plant.
2) Water the plant when the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch, avoiding wetting the foliage.
3) Provide consistent temperatures between 65°F and 75°F during winter months.
4) Use a well-draining potting mix rich in organic matter to support root health.
5) Apply a balanced liquid fertilizer every four weeks from spring through fall.
6) Prune dead or diseased branches to encourage healthy growth and prevent pest infestations.
7) Monitor for signs of pests like spider mites or aphids, treating them promptly if found.
8) Increase humidity around the plant by placing a tray of water near it or using a humidifier.
9) Rotate the pot periodically to ensure all sides receive equal light exposure.
10) Prepare the plant for overwintering by reducing watering frequency slightly as temperatures drop.
11) Move the plant to a cooler room or outside in a sheltered area if possible.
12) Cover the plant with a frost cloth or move it indoors if temperatures dip below freezing.
13) Check the plant regularly for any signs of stress or damage during the overwintering period.
14) Once spring arrives, gradually reintroduce the plant to outdoor conditions over several weeks.
15) Transplant the plant back outdoors in a sunny spot once all danger of frost has passed.
16) Resume normal care practices.
