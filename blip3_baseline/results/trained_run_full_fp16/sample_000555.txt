Identify different types of sprinklers used in irrigation systems.
Determine whether they are wet or dry system based on water supply method.
Classify sprinklers as rotor or spray type depending on their movement pattern.
Categorize rotor sprinklers as fixed or rotating based on installation.
List spray sprinklers as fixed or oscillating based on water distribution pattern.
Note that some sprinklers can operate both as rotor and spray types.
Verify if any sprinkler operates under both wet and dry conditions.
Confirm if there are any specialized sprinklers for specific applications like drought-resistant zones.
Ensure all identified types cover various landscape sizes and watering needs.
Summarize the findings in a concise list of sprinkler types for reference.
Validate that the list includes at least one example from each category identified.
