Task: Transplanting Tomatoes
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Choose healthy tomato seedlings from a nursery or your garden.
2) Water the seedlings thoroughly before transplanting to keep their roots moist.
3) Select a sunny spot in your garden that receives at least six hours of direct sunlight daily.
4) Dig holes slightly larger than the root ball of each seedling.
5) Place each seedling in a hole and fill it with soil, gently pressing down around the base.
6) Water the transplanted tomatoes immediately after planting to settle the soil.
7) Space tomato plants about 18 to 24 inches apart for proper air circulation.
8) Mulch around the plants to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
9) Monitor for pests and diseases regularly, applying appropriate treatments as needed.
10) Support taller plants with stakes or cages to prevent damage from heavy fruit.
11) Apply balanced fertilizer every four weeks during the growing season.
12) Harvest tomatoes when they reach full color and firmness, usually about 60 days after planting.
