Task: Bluetongue virus of ruminants
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Provide numbered subtasks with concise justifications.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Bluetongue virus infects ruminant animals like sheep and cattle through insect vectors such as midges.
2) After infection, the virus replicates in the host's blood cells and spreads throughout the body via the bloodstream.
3) Symptoms include fever, swelling of the face and neck, and bluish discoloration of the tongue in affected animals.
4) The virus can also cause reproductive issues leading to abortions or stillbirths in pregnant females.
5) Control measures include using insect repellents on animals, vaccinating them against the virus, and reducing exposure to infected insects.
6) Surveillance programs monitor for outbreaks to prevent widespread transmission among livestock populations.
7) Research continues on developing more effective vaccines and treatments for bluetongue disease in ruminants.
