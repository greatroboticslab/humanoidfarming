Task: Starting Sweet Corn seeds indoors
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Purchase sweet corn seeds from a local nursery or online retailer.
2) Prepare seed starting trays or small pots filled with moistened potting soil.
3) Plant one seed per pot at a depth of about one inch deep.
4) Cover the seeds lightly with a thin layer of soil and water them gently.
5) Place the seed trays in a warm location away from direct sunlight.
6) Maintain consistent moisture levels by watering when the top inch of soil feels dry.
7) Once sprouts appear, move the seedlings to a sunny window or under grow lights.
8) Transplant the seedlings outdoors after all danger of frost has passed, spacing them about 18 inches apart.
9) Water deeply but infrequently to encourage strong root growth.
10) Monitor for pests and diseases, applying organic treatments if necessary.
11) Provide support for growing plants using stakes or cages as they reach maturity.
12) Harvest sweet corn when the kernels are plump and milky but not mushy.
