3) Prepare the soil by adding compost or organic matter to improve fertility and structure.
4) Plant strawberries in early spring after the last expected frost date.
5) Space plants about 18 inches apart to allow air circulation and prevent disease spread.

8) Apply a balanced fertilizer every four weeks during the growing season.
9) Monitor plants regularly for signs of pests or diseases, and treat promptly if necessary.
