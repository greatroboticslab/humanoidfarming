Task: Growing hot peppers in pots
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Choose a sunny spot for your pot where it will receive at least six hours of direct sunlight daily.
2) Select a pot that is at least twelve inches deep and has good drainage holes at the bottom.
3) Fill the pot with well-draining soil mix designed for vegetables or peppers.
4) Plant one pepper seedling per pot, spacing them about eight inches apart.
5) Water the plants thoroughly after planting to settle the soil around the roots.
6) Use a stake or cage to support the growing plant as it grows taller.
7) Apply a balanced liquid fertilizer every four weeks during the growing season.
8) Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged.
9) Monitor for pests and diseases regularly, treating them promptly if found.
10) Harvest peppers when they turn fully colored and firm to the touch.
11) Continue to provide support as the plant grows larger.
12) Consider harvesting seeds from mature peppers to save for future planting.
13) Move the pot indoors before the first frost to protect the plants.
14) Store harvested peppers in the refrigerator to extend their shelf life.
15) Plan to start the process again next year for continuous growing.
