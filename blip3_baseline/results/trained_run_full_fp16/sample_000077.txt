1) Start by assessing your backyard's soil quality and sunlight exposure to plan which plants will thrive.
2) Incorporate diverse plant species that complement each other's growth cycles to reduce pest issues naturally.
3) Integrate water-harvesting techniques like rain barrels to ensure consistent moisture for your plants.
4) Design a composting system to recycle kitchen scraps and yard waste back into the soil.
5) Plant fruit trees and berry bushes near walkways for easy picking without stepping on plants.
