4) Connect the solar lights to the battery pack or directly to the solar panels.
5) Position the lights at appropriate heights to illuminate the coop and flight pen safely.
6) Ensure all connections are secure and weatherproofed to prevent damage from rain or snow.
7) Test the system to ensure the lights turn on when exposed to sunlight during the day.
8) Adjust the height of the lights as needed to cover all areas of the coop and flight pen effectively.
9) Regularly check and clean the solar panels to maintain their efficiency.
10) Replace batteries or rechargeable cells as recommended by the manufacturer's instructions.
