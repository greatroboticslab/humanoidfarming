3) Water cilantro deeply once a week, ensuring soil stays moist but not waterlogged.
4) Mulch around plants to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
5) Harvest leaves regularly by cutting stems just above the soil level to encourage new growth.
6) Rotate crops annually to prevent soil-borne diseases and maintain plant health.
7) Consider using companion planting techniques like intercropping with tomatoes or basil for better growth.
