Task: HOW TO BUILD THE ULTIMATE NO DIG GARDEN! (USING COVER CROPS AS A SHEET MULCH)
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Choose cover crops that thrive in your climate and soil type for optimal results.
2) Select plants known for their ability to suppress weeds naturally through shading or competition.
3) Plant cover crops in early spring or fall when temperatures are mild to avoid stress.
4) Space cover crops appropriately to ensure proper air circulation and prevent disease.
5) Water newly planted cover crops deeply but infrequently to encourage strong root growth.
6) Mulch around young cover crop plants with straw or grass clippings to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
7) Monitor cover crop growth regularly for signs of pests or diseases that may require treatment.
8) Remove dead cover crop plants before they go to seed to prevent self-sowing and maintain garden beds.
9) Incorporate remaining cover crop material into the soil as compost or mulch once it has died back naturally.
10) Repeat the process annually to maintain a continuous layer of organic matter on the soil surface.
