Task: How to plant Pumpkins
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Choose a sunny spot in your garden that receives at least six hours of direct sunlight daily.
2) Select pumpkin seeds from a reliable source for best results.
3) Prepare the soil by adding compost or well-rotted manure to enrich it.
4) Plant seeds about one inch deep and two feet apart in rows that are six feet apart.
5) Water the plants deeply once a week, ensuring the soil stays moist but not waterlogged.
6) Support young plants with stakes or cages as they grow taller.
7) Apply a balanced fertilizer every four weeks during the growing season.
8) Monitor for pests and diseases regularly, treating them promptly if found.
9) Harvest pumpkins when the skin is hard and the color is fully developed, usually after 70 to 100 days from planting.
10) Store harvested pumpkins in a cool, dry place until ready to use or preserve.
