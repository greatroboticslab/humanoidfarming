Task: IoT Based Smart Irrigation System for Precision Farming. Team Krishi-Shakti
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Emphasize precision, sustainability, and error checks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Identify key parameters for smart irrigation such as soil moisture levels, temperature, and sunlight exposure using sensors.
2) Develop an algorithm to analyze collected data and determine optimal watering times based on plant needs.
3) Design a control system that activates water pumps at predetermined intervals according to the algorithm's recommendations.
4) Integrate a user interface allowing farmers to monitor and adjust settings remotely through mobile devices or web platforms.
5) Implement battery-powered or solar-powered systems to ensure continuous operation without power interruptions.
6) Test the system in controlled environments before deploying it across various farms to ensure reliability and effectiveness.
7) Train farmers on how to use the new technology effectively for improved crop yields and resource efficiency.
8) Monitor system performance post-deployment and gather feedback from users to make necessary improvements and updates.
9) Expand the network of connected devices and services to include weather forecasts, pest alerts, and other agricultural insights for comprehensive support.
10) Collaborate with local communities and organizations to promote sustainable farming practices and access to advanced technologies.
