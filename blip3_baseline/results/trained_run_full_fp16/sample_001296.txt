Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Start by choosing the right pepper variety suitable for your climate and soil conditions.
2) Prepare the garden bed by removing weeds and adding compost or well-rotted manure to enrich the soil.
3) Plant pepper seeds indoors about six weeks before the last expected frost date or purchase seedlings from a nursery.
4) Transplant seedlings outdoors when nighttime temperatures remain above 50°F (10°C).
5) Space plants about 18 to 24 inches apart in rows that are at least 3 feet apart.
6) Water regularly, keeping the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged.
7) Apply a balanced fertilizer every four to six weeks during the growing season.
8) Support plants with stakes or cages as they grow taller to prevent damage from heavy fruit weight.
9) Monitor for pests and diseases, treating them promptly if necessary using organic methods when possible.
10) Harvest peppers when they reach full color and size, which can vary depending on the variety.
11) Encourage continuous production by removing spent flowers and harvesting mature fruits regularly.
12) Consider mulching around plants to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
13) Prepare for winter by storing harvested peppers in a cool, dry place or preserving them through canning or freezing.
