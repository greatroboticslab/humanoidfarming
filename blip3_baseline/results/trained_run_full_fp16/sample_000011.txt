Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Emphasize precision, sustainability, and error checks.
------------------------------------------------------------
Plant garlic cloves in early spring when soil temperature reaches at least 50 degrees Fahrenheit.
Choose a sunny spot with well-draining soil rich in organic matter for optimal growth.
Plant garlic cloves about two inches deep and six to eight inches apart in rows spaced twelve to eighteen inches apart.
Water the planted garlic thoroughly but avoid overwatering to prevent root rot.
Apply a balanced fertilizer every four to six weeks during the growing season to support healthy growth.
Monitor plants for pests and diseases regularly, treating them promptly if necessary.
Harvest garlic when the tops start to yellow and fall over naturally, usually after about 120 days from planting.
Dry harvested garlic in a warm, dry place away from direct sunlight until the outer skin becomes papery and brittle.
Store dried garlic in a cool, dark location until ready to use or sell.
Inspect stored garlic periodically for signs of deterioration and discard any that show signs of mold or decay.
Sell harvested garlic through local farmers markets, online platforms, or directly to consumers at peak freshness.
Document your success and share experiences on social media or gardening forums to attract more customers.
Adjust planting techniques based on feedback and changing market conditions to improve future yields.
Celebrate your hard work and enjoy the financial rewards of your laborious yet rewarding garlic farming endeavor.
