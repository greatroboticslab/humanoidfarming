Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Provide numbered subtasks with concise justifications.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Obtain necessary materials including grain spawn, sterilized wood chips, and grow bags.
2) Prepare a clean workspace free from dust and contaminants.
3) Sterilize the grow bags using a pressure cooker or autoclave to ensure safety.
4) Mix grain spawn with sterilized wood chips in a ratio suitable for your cultivation needs.
5) Distribute the mixed spawn evenly across the inside of each grow bag.
6) Seal the grow bags tightly to prevent contamination during the inoculation process.
7) Place the sealed grow bags in a warm, humid environment to initiate the growth process.
8) Monitor the grow bags daily for signs of colonization and adjust conditions as needed.
9) Once visible growth is observed, gradually expose the bags to cooler temperatures to promote fruiting body formation.
10) Harvest when mushrooms have fully developed and are ready for collection.
11) Clean and sanitize all equipment and workspace after harvesting to prepare for future batches.
12) Record data on yield, growth rate, and any observations for future reference and improvement.
