Task: How do vaccines work?
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Emphasize precision, sustainability, and error checks.
------------------------------------------------------------
Vaccines introduce weakened or dead pathogens to stimulate an immune response without causing disease.
The body's immune system recognizes these foreign substances and creates memory cells.
When exposed to the actual pathogen later, the immune system can quickly respond and fight off the infection.
Memory cells remember the pathogen and can produce antibodies more efficiently to clear the infection.
This process builds immunity against diseases without the risk of severe illness.
