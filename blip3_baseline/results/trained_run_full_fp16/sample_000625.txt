Task: Learn how to grow maize
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
Plant seeds in well-draining soil enriched with compost.
Water regularly ensuring soil stays moist but not waterlogged.
Apply balanced fertilizer every few weeks during growing season.
Support plants with stakes or trellises as they grow taller.
Prune side shoots to encourage main stalk growth and fruit development.
Monitor for pests and diseases; treat promptly if found.
Harvest when ears turn brown and kernels are full and plump.
Store harvested maize in a cool dry place until ready to use.
Dispose of old plants properly after harvest to prevent disease spread.
Rotate crops annually to maintain soil health and reduce pest buildup.
Use mulch around plants to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
Check weather forecasts for potential storms or extreme temperatures.
Inspect plants weekly for signs of nutrient deficiencies or overwatering.
Trim dead leaves from plants to improve air circulation and light penetration.
Encourage pollination by hand if natural pollinators are scarce.
Prepare garden beds for next season's planting early in spring.
Apply organic matter like manure or leaf mold to enrich soil before planting.
Ensure plants receive at least six hours of direct sunlight daily.
Avoid overhead watering to minimize risk of fungal infections on leaves.
Use drip irrigation system for more efficient water usage and reduced evaporation.
Mulch around base of plants to retain soil moisture and suppress weeds.
Inspect seedlings for signs of rot or other fungal issues before transplanting.
Water deeply once or twice weekly instead of frequent light sprinkles.
Remove weeds manually or use non-chemical methods to keep
