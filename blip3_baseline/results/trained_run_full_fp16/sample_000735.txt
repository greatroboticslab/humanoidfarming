Task: Agricultural Practices regarding Rice Cultivation
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Choose an appropriate location for rice cultivation based on soil type and climate conditions.
2) Prepare the land by plowing, harrowing, and leveling to ensure proper drainage and seedling placement.
3) Plant seeds or seedlings at the right time according to local agricultural practices.
4) Apply organic matter like compost or manure to enrich the soil and improve fertility.
5) Monitor water levels regularly to prevent flooding which can harm young plants.
6) Use pesticides and herbicides as needed to control pests and weeds without damaging crops.
7) Harvest rice when grains have reached full maturity but before they start to turn brown.
8) Dry harvested rice in the sun or using mechanical equipment until it reaches a moisture content suitable for storage.
9) Store rice in cool, dry places away from direct sunlight to maintain quality.
10) Rotate crops annually to prevent depletion of nutrients in the soil and reduce pest buildup.
