Task: Know This Before Planting Stevia Seeds!Gardening Tips
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Choose a sunny spot for your stevia plants as they need at least six hours of direct sunlight daily.
2) Prepare the soil by adding compost or well-rotted manure to improve fertility and drainage.
3) Sow seeds indoors about two months before the last expected frost date or directly outside after all danger of frost has passed.
4) Plant seeds about one-quarter inch deep in seed starting mix or directly in prepared garden beds.
5) Keep soil consistently moist during germination and early growth stages.
6) Transplant seedlings when they have at least two sets of true leaves and nighttime temperatures stay above freezing.
7) Space plants approximately 18 to 24 inches apart to allow for proper air circulation and growth.
8) Water deeply but infrequently to encourage strong root development and discourage fungal diseases.
9) Apply a balanced liquid fertilizer every four to six weeks during the growing season.
10) Monitor for pests and diseases regularly, treating problems promptly to prevent damage to your plants.
11) Harvest leaves when they reach full size, typically after one year of planting, for best flavor and quality.
