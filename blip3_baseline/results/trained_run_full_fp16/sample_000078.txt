Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Provide numbered subtasks with concise justifications.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Choose a suitable location for your watering system near plants needing regular hydration.
2) Select appropriate sensors to detect soil moisture levels accurately.
3) Purchase a relay module to control electrical devices like sprinklers or drip irrigation systems.
4) Connect sensors to the relay module using wires or cables for signal transmission.
5) Program the controller to turn on the watering system when soil moisture drops below a set threshold.
6) Install water tanks or reservoirs to store enough water for multiple plantings.
7) Assemble the hardware components including the sensor, relay, and any necessary wiring.
8) Test the system individually before connecting all parts together to ensure proper functioning.
9) Position the sensors in strategic areas around your garden or potted plants for optimal coverage.
10) Connect the watering system to an automatic timer to schedule watering times based on weather conditions.
11) Attach the sprinklers or drippers to the output ports of the relay module according to your design plan.
12) Power up the entire setup and monitor its performance regularly to make adjustments as needed.
13) Consider adding a backup power source in case of unexpected outages to keep your plants hydrated.
14) Finally, enjoy watching your plants thrive under the care of your newly built watering automation system.
