4) Evaluate the potential benefits such as improved soil health, increased biodiversity, and reduced labor costs.
5) Consult with agronomists or extension services for guidance on implementing these sustainable farming methods.
6) Gradually introduce cover crops and reduced tillage practices starting with small plots to assess their effectiveness.
7) Monitor crop yields and soil quality over time to determine if improvements have been achieved.
8) Adjust the implementation strategy based on observed results and any challenges encountered during the transition.
9) Share experiences and findings with other farmers through workshops or online platforms to promote wider adoption of these practices.
10) Seek funding opportunities from government programs or private investors interested in supporting sustainable agriculture initiatives.
