Task: Making the case for organic farming and for a low external input sustainable agriculture
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Organic farming avoids synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, reducing pollution of waterways and soil.
2) It promotes biodiversity by preserving natural habitats for wildlife.
3) This method enhances soil health through natural processes like composting and crop rotation.
4) Low external input sustainable agriculture focuses on using natural resources efficiently without harming the environment.
5) It encourages local food production, strengthening rural economies and reducing transportation emissions.
6) Such practices lead to higher nutritional value in crops due to healthier growing conditions.
7) They also reduce the risk of pest resistance to chemicals commonly used in conventional farming.
8) Organic and sustainable methods can improve soil fertility over time without relying on chemical additives.
9) These approaches support long-term ecological balance and resilience against climate change impacts.
10) Ultimately, they provide safer food options for consumers while preserving natural resources for future generations.
