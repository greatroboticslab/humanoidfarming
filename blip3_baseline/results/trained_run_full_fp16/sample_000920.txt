2) Determine crop varieties that thrive in arid environments.
3) Prepare the land through plowing and irrigation systems to retain moisture.
4) Apply organic matter to improve soil structure and fertility.
5) Implement mulching techniques to conserve water and reduce evaporation.
6) Use drought-resistant seeds or seedlings for planting.
7) Monitor weather forecasts regularly to adjust watering schedules accordingly.
8) Install drip irrigation systems to deliver water directly to plant roots.
9) Practice crop rotation to prevent depletion of soil nutrients.
10) Apply mulch around plants to keep soil cool and moist.
11) Regularly check for pests and diseases common in dryland areas.
12) Harvest crops when they reach maturity to avoid excessive water loss.
