Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Emphasize precision, sustainability, and error checks.
------------------------------------------------------------
Plant bare root trees in early spring when temperatures are mild.
Choose a sunny spot with well-draining soil for optimal growth.
Water the tree deeply after planting to settle the roots.
Spread a layer of organic mulch around the base of the tree.
Prune any damaged or dead branches during the first year.
Apply a balanced fertilizer once a month during the growing season.
Monitor for pests and diseases regularly, treating as needed.
Support young trees with stakes if they are top-heavy.
Encourage new growth by pinching off the tips of new shoots.
Harvest fruit from mature trees after they have been established for two years.
Inspect trees annually for signs of nutrient deficiencies or imbalances.
Remove weeds from around the base of the tree to prevent competition.
Construct a protective cage around newly planted trees to shield them from animals.
Prune mature trees every few years to maintain shape and promote healthy growth.
Mulch around the tree trunk to keep the area cool and moist.
Water deeply but infrequently to encourage deep root growth in mature trees.
Inspect the tree for signs of winter damage before the next growing season begins.
Apply a layer of compost annually to enrich the soil around the tree's roots.
Trim back overgrown branches to improve air circulation and light penetration.
Check for signs of fungal infections or other diseases periodically.
Remove any suckers that grow from the base of the tree to prevent overcrowding.
Water newly planted trees immediately after planting and then every week until they are established.
Inspect the tree for signs
