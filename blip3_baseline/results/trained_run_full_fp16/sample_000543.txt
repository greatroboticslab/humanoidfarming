Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Start by choosing a sunny spot in your garden for sweet peas as they need at least six hours of direct sunlight daily.
2) Prepare the soil by adding compost or well-rotted manure to enrich it with nutrients and improve drainage.
3) Plant seeds about one inch deep in rows spaced ten inches apart.
4) Water regularly but avoid getting water on the leaves to prevent fungal diseases.
5) Support plants with stakes or trellises as they grow tall to climb.
6) Pinch off the tips of young plants to encourage bushier growth and more blooms.
7) Feed plants every two weeks with a balanced fertilizer to promote healthy growth.
8) Watch for pests like aphids and spider mites, treating them promptly if necessary.
9) Harvest flowers when they reach full size and color, which usually takes about three weeks from planting.
10) Enjoy the beauty of your sweet peas and consider saving seeds for next year's planting.
