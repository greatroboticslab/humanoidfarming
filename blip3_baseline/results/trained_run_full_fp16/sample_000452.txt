Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
Plant seeds in well-draining soil enriched with compost.
Water regularly ensuring soil stays moist but not waterlogged.
Apply balanced fertilizer every few weeks during growing season.
Support plants with stakes or trellises as they grow taller.
Prune side shoots to encourage main stem growth and better bean production.
Monitor for pests and diseases, treating promptly if necessary.
Harvest when pods turn from green to yellow and beans inside are plump.
Store harvested beans in a cool dry place until ready to use.
Clean and shell beans before using them in cooking or preserving.
Dispose of plant material properly after harvest to prevent pest infestations.
Rotate crops annually to maintain soil health and reduce disease spread.
Use soybean meal as a natural fertilizer for future crops.
Encourage beneficial insects like ladybugs to help control pests naturally.
Inspect beans for signs of spoilage before storing long-term.
Label containers clearly with contents and date of storage for easy identification.
Check stored beans periodically for signs of deterioration or infestation.
Dispose of any spoiled or infested beans safely to avoid spreading problems.
