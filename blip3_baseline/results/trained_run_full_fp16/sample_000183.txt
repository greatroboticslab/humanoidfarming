Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Emphasize precision, sustainability, and error checks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Choose a suitable location for your garden that receives at least six hours of sunlight daily.
2) Clear the area of any weeds, debris, or existing plants to prepare the soil.
3) Test the soil to determine its pH level and nutrient content for proper gardening practices.
4) Amend the soil as needed with compost, organic matter, or fertilizer to improve fertility.
5) Mark out the boundaries of your garden plot using stakes and string for easy reference.
6) Dig trenches or holes according to the specifications of your chosen plants or trees.
7) Plant seeds or seedlings in the prepared soil, ensuring they are spaced appropriately for growth.
8) Cover the newly planted areas with mulch to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
9) Water the garden thoroughly after planting to settle the soil around the roots.
10) Apply a layer of mulch over the entire garden bed to conserve water and regulate temperature.
11) Install necessary irrigation systems like sprinklers or drip lines based on your climate and plant needs.
12) Monitor the garden regularly for signs of pests or diseases and take appropriate action if necessary.
13) Maintain the garden by pruning, weeding, and fertilizing as needed throughout the growing season.
14) Harvest vegetables and flowers when they are ready to enjoy the fruits of your labor.
15) Plan future additions to your garden based on what has worked well and what new plants you'd like to try.
