Task: 6. IRRI Agronomy Challenge: Rat and Bird Control (13 January 2012)
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Identify specific areas in the field where rat and bird infestations are most severe.
2) Implement physical barriers such as fences or netting around these areas to prevent entry.
3) Use traps designed for rats and birds in strategic locations within the field.
4) Introduce bird scare devices like wind chimes or lasers to deter birds from landing.
5) Apply rat poison baits in hidden spots away from human access paths.
6) Monitor the effectiveness of control measures regularly and adjust strategies if necessary.
7) Educate farmers about proper disposal of used rat poison to avoid poisoning non-target animals.
8) Consider using natural repellents like chili sprays or garlic oil to repel both rats and birds naturally.
9) Collaborate with local authorities or pest control experts for additional support and advice.
10) Maintain a clean environment around the fields to reduce attractants for pests.
11) Keep crop residues removed to discourage rodents from nesting near the fields.
12) Plant cover crops that do not attract birds or provide food for rats.
13) Regularly inspect the perimeter of the fields for signs of rat and bird activity.
14) Encourage community involvement in monitoring and reporting pest sightings.
15) Develop a long-term plan incorporating sustainable agriculture practices to reduce pest populations over time.
