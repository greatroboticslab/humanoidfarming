Task: Planting Azaleas
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Provide numbered subtasks with concise justifications.
------------------------------------------------------------
Planting azaleas involves several steps to ensure they grow healthily.
1) Choose a suitable location that receives partial shade and has well-draining soil rich in organic matter.
2) Prepare the soil by removing weeds and adding compost or aged manure to improve fertility and structure.
3) Dig holes slightly larger than the root ball of each plant, ensuring they are deep enough for the roots to spread out comfortably.
4) Gently remove the azalea from its container, loosen any tangled roots, and place it in the hole.
5) Backfill the hole with soil, gently pressing down around the base of the plant to eliminate air pockets.
6) Water thoroughly after planting to settle the soil and help establish the roots.
7) Mulch around the base of the plant to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
8) Stake the plant if necessary, especially during windy conditions, to support its growth as it establishes itself.
9) Apply a balanced fertilizer according to package instructions in early spring before new growth begins.
10) Monitor for pests and diseases regularly, taking action promptly if issues arise.
11) Prune lightly in late winter or early spring to maintain shape and encourage healthy growth.
12) Continue caring for your azaleas throughout the growing season, providing regular water and additional nutrients as needed.
