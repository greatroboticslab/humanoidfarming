Task: PLOWING VS TILLING PART 2
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.

PLOWING VS TILLING PART 2
1) Plowing involves turning over the soil to bury weeds and loosen it for better seedling growth.
2) Tilling is done closer to the surface, mixing the topsoil with organic matter to improve fertility.
3) Plowing typically requires more horsepower due to deeper soil turning.
4) Tilling can be done more frequently throughout the growing season for weed control.
5) Plowing is often used in larger fields where deep tillage is necessary.
6) Tilling is more suitable for smaller plots or intensive gardening needs.
7) Plowing can disrupt soil structure if not managed properly, leading to compaction.
8) Tilling helps maintain soil structure and prevents erosion better than plowing.
9) Plowing exposes soil to air and sunlight, which can dry out the soil faster.
10) Tilling preserves moisture in the soil better than plowing, especially during dry periods.
11) Plowing can lead to increased soil erosion due to the removal of protective topsoil layers.
12) Tilling reduces soil erosion by incorporating organic matter that binds soil particles.
13) Plowing can cause nutrient loss as buried organic matter decomposes over time.
14) Tilling helps retain nutrients in the topsoil layer where plants can access them easily.
15) Plowing may require additional fertilization to compensate for nutrient loss.
16) Tilling allows for easier application of pesticides and herbicides directly.
