Task: Quick Guide on Growing SERRANO PEPPER (Capsicum annuum): Planting & Care Tips!
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Start by choosing a sunny spot in your garden where the soil is well-draining and rich in organic matter.
2) Purchase seedlings from a local nursery or start seeds indoors six to eight weeks before the last expected frost.
3) Harden off seedlings outdoors for about a week before transplanting them into the garden.
4) Dig holes twice as wide but not deeper than the pot the plant came in.
5) Place the seedling in each hole and fill around it with soil, gently pressing down to remove air pockets.
6) Space plants about 18 to 24 inches apart to allow for growth and air circulation.
7) Water thoroughly after planting to settle the soil and encourage root development.
8) Mulch around the base of the plants to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
9) Feed plants every four to six weeks with a balanced fertilizer according to package instructions.
10) Monitor for pests and diseases regularly, treating early if necessary.
11) Harvest peppers when they turn from green to their mature color, usually red, orange, yellow, or purple.
12) Continue to support plant growth by staking or caging as needed.
13) Prepare for winter by covering plants with blankets or moving them indoors if temperatures drop below freezing.
14) Save seeds from the best-performing peppers for next year's planting.
15) Rotate crops annually to prevent depletion of nutrients in the soil and reduce pest and disease buildup.
