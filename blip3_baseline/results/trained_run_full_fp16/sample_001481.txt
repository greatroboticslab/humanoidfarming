------------------------------------------------------------
1) Start by selecting disease-resistant tomato varieties suitable for local climate conditions.
2) Prepare the soil by adding compost and organic matter to improve fertility and structure.
3) Plant tomatoes at least 18 inches apart in well-draining soil to allow air circulation and reduce disease risk.
4) Water plants deeply but infrequently to encourage strong root growth and discourage fungal diseases.
5) Use mulch around plants to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.
6) Apply balanced fertilizers every four weeks during the growing season to support healthy plant growth.
7) Prune side shoots and leaves to promote air flow and sunlight penetration, reducing the risk of bacterial wilt.
8) Monitor plants regularly for signs of pests or diseases, and treat promptly using natural methods if possible.
9) Support taller plants with stakes or cages to prevent damage from heavy fruit weight and ensure even ripening.
10) Begin harvesting tomatoes when they reach full color and firmness, typically after 70-80 days from transplanting.
11) Pick tomatoes regularly to encourage continuous production and prevent overripe fruits from falling off the plant.
12) Store harvested tomatoes in a cool, dry place or refrigerate them to extend their shelf life.
