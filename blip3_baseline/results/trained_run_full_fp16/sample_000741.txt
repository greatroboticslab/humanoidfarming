Task: 12!  ! Mixer for animal feed 12! Unloading Screw!
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Calculate 12 factorial first.
2) Then find the factorial of the result from step.
1) 
3) Use this number as input for mixing animal feed.
4) Set up an unloading screw system accordingly.
5) Start the process of unloading the mixed feed.
6) Monitor the mixing and unloading process carefully.
7) Ensure all safety protocols are followed during operation.
8) Adjust the mixture if necessary based on animal needs.
9) Document the mixing and unloading procedure for future reference.
10) Prepare for the next batch of feed production.
