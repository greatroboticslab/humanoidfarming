Task: 07 - Rafter Support
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Measure the length of the roof to determine the number of rafters needed.
2) Calculate the rafter length using the Pythagorean theorem based on the roof pitch and span.
3) Mark the centerline of the rafters on the wall studs for alignment.
4) Cut the rafters to the calculated length using a circular saw or hand saw.
5) Secure the first rafter to the top chord of the trusses or roof joists.
6) Install the remaining rafters in a staggered pattern from one end of the roof to the other.
7) Attach the rafters to the wall studs using lag bolts or screws.
8) Ensure all rafters are level and plumb before proceeding to the next step.
9) Install the ridge board across the top of the rafters.
10) Fasten the ridge board securely to the rafters using nails or screws.
11) Install the valley boards if applicable, connecting the two sides of the roof.
12) Finish the underside of the rafters with sheathing or roofing material according to building codes and preferences.
