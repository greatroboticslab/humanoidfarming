Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Provide numbered subtasks with concise justifications.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Place chicks in a warm brooder at around 90 degrees Fahrenheit at night and gradually decrease temperature as they grow.
2) Provide clean water and feed them specially formulated chick starter cornmeal.
3) Keep the area dust-free to prevent respiratory issues common in young chicks.
4) Ensure the floor is dry and free from drafts to avoid chilling the chicks.
5) Clean the brooder daily to maintain hygiene and remove any waste or soiled bedding.
6) Monitor chicks closely for signs of illness or distress and seek veterinary advice if necessary.
7) Gradually introduce them to outdoor areas after they have grown stronger and more comfortable indoors.
8) Provide adequate space per chick, ensuring there's enough room for each one to move freely without overcrowding.
9) Keep the environment quiet and calm to reduce stress on the chicks during their sensitive early days.
10) Use a heat lamp or other heating source to maintain the correct temperature inside the brooder.
11) Regularly check the chicks' health and weight to ensure they're growing properly.
12) Prepare a safe environment outside where the chicks can explore under supervision once they're ready.
