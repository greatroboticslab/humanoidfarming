Task: Biochar Made in a Trench
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Identify suitable location for trench biochar production.
2) Prepare soil samples for analysis to determine needs.
3) Dig trenches at least six feet deep for optimal results.
4) Add biochar material evenly throughout each trench.
5) Cover trenches with soil to retain heat and moisture.
6) Water trenches thoroughly after filling to settle materials.
7) Monitor growth of plants near trenches for effectiveness.
8) Adjust future biochar applications based on observations.
9) Document process and outcomes for educational purposes.
10) Share findings with community for broader impact.
