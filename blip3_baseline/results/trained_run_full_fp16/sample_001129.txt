Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Provide numbered subtasks with concise justifications.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Farmers start by selecting the best broccoli plants for harvest based on size and health.
2) They use modern machinery like harvesters to cut the heads off the plants quickly and efficiently.
3) The harvested broccoli is then sorted by size and quality before being loaded onto trucks.
4) Modern transportation methods ensure quick delivery to markets, reducing spoilage.
5) At the processing plant, broccoli is cleaned, sorted again, and packaged for distribution.
6) Advanced storage techniques keep broccoli fresh longer, ensuring consistent quality across seasons.
7) Farmers monitor crop yields through data analytics, adjusting planting and harvesting strategies accordingly.
8) They employ drones for aerial surveys to detect any issues early, improving overall farm efficiency.
9) Irrigation systems are automated to water crops at optimal times, conserving resources and enhancing growth.
10) Crop rotation practices help maintain soil fertility and reduce pest infestations, promoting sustainable farming methods.
