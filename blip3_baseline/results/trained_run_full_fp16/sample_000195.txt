Task: Tips on Harvesting Baby Spinach in a Container
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Choose a container that is at least 5 gallons large to ensure enough space for baby spinach plants.
2) Fill the container with a mixture of potting soil and compost, ensuring good drainage at the bottom.
3) Plant baby spinach seeds about 1 inch deep and spaced about 4 inches apart.
4) Water the plants thoroughly after planting to settle the soil around the seeds.
5) Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, watering when the top inch of soil feels dry.
6) Provide partial shade during hot summer days to protect the young plants from sunburn.
7) Harvest baby spinach leaves when they reach about 4 inches tall, cutting them from the base without removing the entire plant.
8) Repeat harvesting every few weeks as long as new leaves continue to grow.
9) Monitor for pests and diseases regularly, treating any issues promptly to maintain healthy plants.
10) Consider adding a balanced liquid fertilizer every two weeks to promote strong growth and larger leaf production.
