Task: 5 COMMON MISTAKES IN CACTUS CARE
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Overwatering cacti can lead to root rot and fungal diseases.
2) Failing to provide enough sunlight causes unhealthy growth and spindly stems.
3) Using regular potting soil instead of cactus-specific soil leads to poor drainage and root rot.
4) Neglecting to prune dead or diseased parts encourages pests and diseases.
5) Applying too much fertilizer during the growing season harms cacti's delicate tissues.
6) Mistaking cacti for succulents and overwatering them further damages their health.
7) Not rotating pots regularly results in uneven growth and weakens the plant structure.
8) Keeping cacti indoors without proper ventilation exposes them to excessive humidity.
9) Ignoring the need for repotting when the plant outgrows its current container restricts growth.
10) Allowing cacti to dry out completely between waterings stresses them severely.
11) Using tap water directly on cacti without letting it sit for days removes essential minerals.
12) Not understanding the unique watering needs of different cactus species leads to inconsistent care outcomes.
