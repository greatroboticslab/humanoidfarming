Task: How to braid/cornrow FOR BEGINNERS!
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Provide numbered subtasks with concise justifications.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Start with clean, dry hair for best results.
2) Divide your hair into three equal sections from top to bottom.
3) Take the right section and cross it over the middle section.
4) Then take the left section and cross it over the new middle section.
5) Hold the braids in place with hair ties or clips.
6) For cornrows, make smaller sections and weave them together tightly.
7) Gently pull on each braid to tighten them as you go.
8) Once done, use hairspray to keep the style in place.
9) Practice makes perfect, so try different techniques until you feel comfortable.
