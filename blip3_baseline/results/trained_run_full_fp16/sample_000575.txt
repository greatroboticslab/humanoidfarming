Task: Fruit harvesting robots - Modern technology in agriculture
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Provide numbered subtasks with concise justifications.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Identify specific fruits suitable for robotic harvesting based on their size and structure.
2) Develop sensors that can detect ripe fruits without damaging them during collection.
3) Design robots equipped with arms capable of grasping and picking fruits efficiently.
4) Program robots to navigate through fields autonomously or with minimal human intervention.
5) Integrate machine learning algorithms to improve fruit detection accuracy over time.
6) Test robots in controlled environments before deploying them in large-scale farms.
7) Train farmers on how to operate and maintain the new robotic harvesting systems.
8) Monitor robot performance and gather feedback from field trials for continuous improvement.
9) Collaborate with agricultural research institutions to further enhance robotic capabilities.
10) Explore possibilities of integrating drones for additional surveillance and data collection.
