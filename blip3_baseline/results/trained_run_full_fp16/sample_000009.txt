Task: Genetically engineered wheat releases insect pheromones to ward off pests
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Emphasize precision, sustainability, and error checks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Scientists identify specific insect pheromones that repel targeted pests effectively.
2) They isolate and extract these pheromones from natural sources or synthesize them chemically.
3) Wheat plants are genetically modified to produce the extracted or synthesized pheromones.
4) The genetically engineered wheat is grown in fields where pest populations are high.
5) The released pheromones confuse and deter pests, reducing their ability to find and feed on the wheat plants.
6) This method enhances crop yield while minimizing the need for chemical pesticides.
7) Continuous monitoring ensures the effectiveness of the genetically engineered wheat over time.
8) Regulatory approval is obtained before commercial cultivation begins.
9) Farmers adopt the genetically engineered wheat as an environmentally friendly pest control measure.
10) Long-term studies evaluate the impact on soil health, biodiversity, and human health safety.
