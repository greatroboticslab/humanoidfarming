Task: Boosting on farm nitrogen fixation in pulses  Liz Farquharson
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Identify which pulses are grown on the farm for nitrogen fixation benefits.
2) Determine if there is adequate soil moisture for effective root nodulation.
3) Apply organic matter to improve soil structure and nutrient content.
4) Rotate crops to prevent depletion of soil nitrogen over time.
5) Use cover crops that fix nitrogen to enhance soil fertility between main crop cycles.
6) Avoid over-tilling to preserve beneficial microorganisms in the soil.
7) Monitor soil pH levels and adjust as necessary for optimal pulse growth.
8) Consider using leguminous green manures or intercropping techniques.
9) Implement integrated pest management strategies to reduce chemical inputs.
10) Regularly test soil samples to assess nitrogen levels and other nutrients.
11) Educate farmers about the importance of maintaining healthy soil ecosystems.
12) Encourage community sharing of knowledge and best practices for sustainable farming.
