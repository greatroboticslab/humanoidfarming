Task: Stop doing these 3 things to be a better worm farmer
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Provide numbered subtasks with concise justifications.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Stop overwatering your worms to prevent their soil from becoming waterlogged and suffocating them.
2) Avoid exposing your worm farm to extreme temperatures as this can harm the health of your worms.
3) Cease adding non-biodegradable materials to your compost bin to ensure clean and safe conditions for your worm population.
