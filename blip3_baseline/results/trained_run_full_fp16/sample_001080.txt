Task: HOW TO make a Gravity Fed Water Supply | What You Need.
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Gather materials including a water tank, pipes, valves, and a gravity source like a rooftop or high hill.
2) Install the water tank at a higher elevation than where you want to use the water supply.
3) Connect the tank to the pipes using appropriate fittings and ensure they are securely fastened.
4) Place the pipes along the path from the tank to the desired location, making sure they slope slightly downhill to maintain flow.
5) Add valves to control water distribution and safety features like pressure relief valves.
6) Test the system for leaks and proper operation before using it for actual water supply.
7) Regularly inspect and maintain the system to ensure efficient and safe water delivery.
8) Consider adding a filter if necessary to clean the water before use.
9) If using a solar-powered pump, install a battery bank to store energy during sunny hours.
10) Ensure all connections are tight and secure to prevent leaks and ensure reliable water supply.
11) Install a backflow preventer to protect against contamination when connecting different types of water sources.
12) Label all components clearly for easy identification and maintenance in the future.
