Task: Mandevilla & Dipladenia Care || Outdoor & Indoor Care of Mandevilla & What's The Difference?
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Provide numbered subtasks with concise justifications.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Identify whether to grow mandevilla as an outdoor plant or indoors based on local climate conditions.
2) For outdoor growth, select a sunny spot that receives at least six hours of direct sunlight daily.
3) Indoors, place plants near a window receiving bright, indirect light.
4) Mandevilla requires well-draining soil rich in organic matter for optimal growth.
5) Water regularly, ensuring the soil is moist but not waterlogged.
6) Dipladenia thrives in similar growing conditions to mandevilla, preferring well-drained soil and consistent moisture.
7) Both plants benefit from regular fertilization during their growing season.
8) Prune mandevilla in late winter or early spring to encourage new growth and maintain shape.
9) Dipladenia may need occasional pruning to remove dead or diseased branches.
10) Mandevilla prefers temperatures between 65°F and 85°F (18°C and 29°C).
11) Dipladenia can tolerate slightly cooler temperatures down to about 50°F (10°C).
12) Ensure both plants have adequate air circulation to prevent fungal diseases.
13) Monitor for common pests like aphids and spider mites, treating them promptly if found.
14) In case of overwatering, ensure proper drainage and allow soil to dry out between waterings.
15) For indoor care, avoid placing dipladenia near drafts or cold windows to prevent leaf drop.
