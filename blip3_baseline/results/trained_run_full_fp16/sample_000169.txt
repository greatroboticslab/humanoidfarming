5) Transplant seedlings outdoors when nighttime temperatures remain above 50°F (10°C).
6) Space plants about 2 feet apart in rows spaced 3 to 4 feet apart for proper air circulation.

12) Encourage continuous fruiting by removing suckers and pruning side shoots as needed.
13) Consider using mulch around plants to retain soil moisture and suppress weeds.
14) Rotate crops annually to prevent buildup of soil-borne diseases and pests.
