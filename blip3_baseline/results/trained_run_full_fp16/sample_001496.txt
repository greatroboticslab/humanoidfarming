Task: Peony Planting Tips
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
Plant peonies in full sun for best blooms.
Choose a site with well-draining soil rich in organic matter.
Prepare the planting area by removing weeds and adding compost.
Dig holes twice as wide but the same depth as the root ball.
Place the peony bulb in the hole with the roots spread out.
Cover the roots gently with soil, firming around them slightly.
Water thoroughly after planting to settle the soil around the bulb.
Apply a layer of mulch over the top of the planted area.
Water regularly during dry spells until the plants establish.
Feed peonies with a balanced fertilizer in early spring before growth begins.
Prune dead flowers to encourage more blooms throughout the season.
Monitor for pests and diseases, treating as needed.
Divide peonies every three to five years when they start to produce fewer blooms.
Harvest seeds from the spent flowers for next year's planting if desired.
Enjoy the beautiful blooms of your newly planted peonies.
