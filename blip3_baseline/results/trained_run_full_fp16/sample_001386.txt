Task: How to Prepare Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) using Fresh Potatoes (Part 1/4)
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Wash fresh potatoes thoroughly under running water to remove dirt and debris.
2) Peel the potatoes, leaving about an inch of skin intact for better extraction of starch.
3) Cut the peeled potatoes into small pieces, ensuring they are evenly sized for even fermentation.
4) Boil the potato pieces in distilled water for about 10 minutes to soften them and extract more nutrients.
5) Allow the boiled potato mixture to cool slightly before transferring it to a sterile container.
6) Add dextrose powder to the cooled potato mixture, mixing well until fully dissolved.
7) Sterilize the prepared PDA medium by autoclaving at 121 degrees Celsius for 15 minutes.
8) Allow the sterilized PDA medium to cool down to room temperature before pouring it into petri dishes.
9) Pour the cooled PDA medium evenly into petri dishes, ensuring each dish contains enough medium for standard inoculation.
10) Seal the petri dishes properly to prevent contamination during incubation.
10) Place the sealed petri dishes in an incubator set at 25 degrees Celsius for optimal growth conditions.
