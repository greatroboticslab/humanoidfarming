Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Start by choosing a sunny spot in your garden for planting zucchinis.
2) Plant seeds about 1 inch deep in well-draining soil mixed with compost.
3) Space plants about 4 feet apart to allow for growth.
4) Water regularly, ensuring the soil stays moist but not waterlogged.
5) Support plants with stakes or trellises to prevent fruit from touching the ground.
6) Prune side shoots to focus energy on main stems and produce larger fruits.
7) Apply balanced fertilizer every few weeks during growing season.
8) Monitor for pests and diseases, treating early to avoid widespread damage.
9) Harvest zucchinis when they reach full size but before they get too large and tough.
10) Keep harvesting to encourage continued production throughout the growing season.
11) Consider planting a second crop of zucchinis after midsummer for fall harvests.
12) Store harvested zucchinis in the refrigerator or freeze them for later use.
