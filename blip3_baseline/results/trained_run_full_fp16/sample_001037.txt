This is the first year I have enough space to grow large.1) I decide to plant watermelons in my new garden area.2) I research different varieties of watermelons suitable for large spaces.3) I prepare the soil by adding compost and removing weeds.4) I carefully select seeds from the researched varieties.5) I plant the watermelon seeds in rows spaced appropriately apart.6) I water the plants regularly to ensure they receive adequate moisture.7) I monitor the growth closely, supporting vines as they spread.8) I thin out weaker seedlings to allow healthier plants to thrive.9) I apply mulch around the base of the plants to retain moisture and suppress weeds.10) I watch eagerly as the watermelons begin to grow larger and develop their characteristic red color.
