Task: Bridging the Gap: Can Subsistence Farming Feed Us All?
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Provide numbered subtasks with concise justifications.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Start by defining subsistence farming as a method where farmers produce food only to meet their own needs and those of their family.
2) Next, examine current global population numbers to understand the scale of food demand.
3) Analyze the efficiency and productivity of modern agriculture compared to subsistence farming methods.
4) Consider the environmental impact of both traditional and modern farming practices.
5) Evaluate the potential for increasing crop yields through advanced technologies in subsistence farming.
6) Assess the role of local communities in maintaining traditional farming techniques and knowledge.
7) Investigate case studies from different regions to see how subsistence farming has adapted to changing conditions.
8) Examine the challenges faced by subsistence farmers in accessing markets and resources.
9) Explore the possibility of integrating subsistence farming with other agricultural systems for greater sustainability.
10) Finally, conclude whether subsistence farming alone can feed everyone globally or if additional strategies are necessary.
