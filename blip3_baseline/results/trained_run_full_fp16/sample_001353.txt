Task: The MOST Damaging Effect of Tillage
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Tillage involves disturbing the soil surface to prepare for planting crops.
2) This process can lead to increased erosion due to wind and water.
3) Soil structure deteriorates, reducing its ability to retain water and nutrients.
4) Organic matter in the soil decreases, impacting soil health negatively.
5) Microbial activity is reduced, slowing down decomposition processes.
6) Soil becomes more prone to compaction, affecting root growth of plants.
7) Nutrient loss occurs through leaching or runoff during rainfall events.
8) Long-term tillage leads to depletion of topsoil layers, reducing fertility.
9) Soil biodiversity declines as certain species struggle to survive.
10) Overall productivity of agricultural lands diminishes over time due to these effects.
