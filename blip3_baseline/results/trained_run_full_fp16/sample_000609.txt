Task: How Air Pollution Threatens Natural Pest Control Methods in Sustainable Farming
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Emphasize precision, sustainability, and error checks.
------------------------------------------------------------
Air pollution increases levels of harmful gases in the atmosphere.
These gases react with other substances to form particulate matter.
Particulate matter can reduce visibility significantly in agricultural areas.
Reduced visibility hinders natural pest control methods relying on visual cues.
Increased air pollution also damages plants directly, making them more susceptible to pests.
Polluted air contains more toxic chemicals that can harm beneficial insects naturally controlling pests.
As a result, natural pest control becomes less effective in sustainable farming practices.
This decrease in natural pest control leads to higher reliance on chemical pesticides.
Higher use of chemical pesticides further exacerbates environmental degradation and health risks.
Therefore, addressing air pollution is crucial for maintaining effective natural pest control methods in sustainable farming.
