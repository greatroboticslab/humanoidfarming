Task: HOW TO SMOOTH AND LEVEL A BUMPY FIELD OR LAWN
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Emphasize precision, sustainability, and error checks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Assess the size and extent of the bumpy area to determine if manual leveling is feasible or if machinery is needed.
2) Clear any debris from the field to ensure smooth operation of equipment.
3) Start at one end of the field and use a rake to remove small bumps, smoothing out the surface as you go.
4) Move to the next section, using a lawn roller to compact the soil and level it further.
5) Repeat this process across the entire field, ensuring consistent leveling throughout.
6) If necessary, use a tiller to loosen compacted areas before rolling them again for better compaction.
7) After leveling, water the field thoroughly to settle the soil and enhance the evenness of the surface.
8) Allow the field to dry slightly before mowing to avoid disturbing newly leveled areas.
9) Check the field for any remaining bumps or uneven spots and make adjustments as needed.
10) Once satisfied with the levelness, apply grass seed or fertilizer as per recommended practices for the specific type of grass growing on the field.
