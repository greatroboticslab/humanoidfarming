Task: FINALLY my dream CAME TRUE Preparing the Farm for Planting Season!  | Tilling the Soil
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Assess the soil condition to determine if tilling is necessary.
2)  Gather all necessary tools including a tiller or hand tools.
3)  Choose an appropriate time of day when the soil is dry but not too hard.
4)  Start at one corner of the farm field and move in a straight line.
5)  Tilt the tiller towards the soil to cut through the top layer.
6)  Continue tilling until the desired depth is reached, typically about 8 inches deep.
7)  Rotate the tiller to cover the previously tilled area.
8)  Repeat the process across the entire field, making sure to overlap slightly between rows.
9)  Remove any large clumps of soil or debris from the surface.
10)  Water the tilled soil lightly to settle the soil and prepare for planting.
