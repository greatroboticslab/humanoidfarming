Task: Furrow Irrigation System - I
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Assess soil moisture levels using sensors to determine when irrigation is needed.
2)  Calculate water volume required based on crop type and current soil conditions.
3)  Position sprinklers or emitters along furrows at appropriate intervals for even coverage.
4)  Connect the irrigation system to a reliable water source such as a well or municipal supply.
5)  Install pressure regulators to maintain consistent water pressure throughout the system.
6)  Program the timing of irrigation cycles according to plant needs and local weather patterns.
7)  Test the system for leaks and ensure proper operation before turning it on for the first time.
8)  Monitor system performance regularly to adjust settings as necessary for optimal results.
