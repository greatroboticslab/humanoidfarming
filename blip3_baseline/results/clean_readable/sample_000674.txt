Task: How to plant Pumpkins
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Choose a sunny spot with well-draining soil for planting pumpkins.
2) Prepare the soil by adding compost or aged manure to enrich it.
3) Plant pumpkin seeds about 1 inch deep and 6 inches apart in rows spaced 8 feet apart.
4) Water the seeds thoroughly after planting to settle them in the soil.
5) Mulch around the plants to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
6) Provide support such as stakes or cages as the vines grow.
7) Water regularly, ensuring the soil stays moist but not waterlogged.
8) Fertilize the plants every few weeks with a balanced fertilizer.
9) Thin out weaker seedlings when they have two sets of true leaves.
10) Monitor for pests and diseases, treating early if necessary.
11) Harvest pumpkins when they reach full size and color, usually 80-120 days from planting.
12) Store harvested pumpkins in a cool, dry place until ready to use.
