Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Identify suitable coconut planting sites based on soil type and climate conditions.
2) Prepare the land by removing weeds and leveling the ground.
3) Dig holes for planting, ensuring each hole is twice as wide as the coconut's root ball.
4) Plant coconut seedlings at the appropriate depth, leaving enough space between them.
5) Cover the roots with soil and gently press down to remove air pockets.
6) Water the newly planted coconut trees thoroughly to settle the soil.
7) Apply organic fertilizer around the base of each tree for initial growth support.
8) Monitor for pests and diseases regularly, taking preventive measures if necessary.
9) Provide shade during the first few months after planting to protect young trees from intense sunlight.
10) Prune dead or damaged leaves to promote healthy growth and improve airflow within the canopy.
11) Harvest coconuts when they turn brown and fall naturally from the tree or can be easily picked.
