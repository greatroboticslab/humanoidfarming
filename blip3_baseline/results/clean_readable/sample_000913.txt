Task: Stop doing these 3 things to be a better worm farmer
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Do not neglect regular inspection of your worm farm for signs of infestation or poor health.
2)  Avoid overfeeding worms as it can lead to excess moisture and waste accumulation.
3)  Do not expose your worm farm to extreme temperatures or direct sunlight, which can harm the worms.
