Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT RPM TO RUN YOUR TRACTOR? ITS COMPLICATED
1) IDENTIFY THE TYPE OF TRACTOR YOU OWN.
2) CHECK THE MANUFACTURER'S RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RPM ON THE TRACTOR'S OPERATING MANUAL.
3) CONSIDER THE LOAD AND SOIL CONDITIONS TO DETERMINE AN APPROPRIATE RPM RANGE.
4) TEST DRIVE THE TRACTOR AT DIFFERENT RPMS TO FIND A FEEL THAT SUITS YOUR OPERATIONS.
5) CONSULT WITH A LOCAL AGRI-PROFESSIONAL OR TECHNICIAN IF YOU'RE UNCLEAR ON THE SPECIFIC RANGES.
