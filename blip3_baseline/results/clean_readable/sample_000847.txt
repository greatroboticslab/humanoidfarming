Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Assess the size and condition of the lawn to determine the area needing raking.
2) Gather necessary tools including a rake, baling twine, and a bale holder.
3) Start at one corner of the lawn and work methodically across the entire area.
4) Use the rake to remove debris and clumps from the grass surface thoroughly.
5) Ensure all blades are sharp for efficient and even raking.
6) Position the baling twine around the desired grass clumps before securing them.
7) Securely attach the bales to the bale holder to prevent them from scattering.
8) Continue raking in sections until the entire lawn is prepared for baling.
9) Dispose of collected debris properly after completing the lawn preparation.
