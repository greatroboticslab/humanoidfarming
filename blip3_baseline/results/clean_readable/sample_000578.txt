Task: 6. IRRI Agronomy Challenge: Rat and Bird Control (13 January 2012)
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Identify specific areas in rice fields prone to rat and bird infestations.
2) Implement physical barriers such as fences or nets around these areas.
3) Use traps specifically designed for rats and birds to control their population.
4) Introduce natural predators like snakes or owls to naturally reduce rodent and bird numbers.
5) Apply repellents that deter both rats and birds from entering the treated areas.
6) Conduct regular monitoring to assess effectiveness of implemented control measures.
7) Adjust strategies based on findings from monitoring to optimize rat and bird control efforts.
