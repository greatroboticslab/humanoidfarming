Task: Our Secrets to Growing the Best Tomato Plants
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Start by selecting disease-resistant tomato varieties suitable for your climate.
2)  Prepare well-draining soil rich in organic matter at least 1 foot deep.
3)  Plant seeds indoors six weeks before the last expected frost or purchase seedlings.
4)  Transplant seedlings outdoors when nighttime temperatures remain above 50Â°F.
5)  Water plants deeply but infrequently to encourage strong root growth.
6)  Apply a balanced fertilizer every four weeks during the growing season.
7)  Support plants with stakes or cages to prevent damage from heavy fruit weight.
8)  Pinch off suckers to direct energy towards developing more fruits.
9)  Monitor for pests and diseases regularly and treat promptly if necessary.
10)  Harvest tomatoes when they are fully colored and slightly soft to touch.
