Task: Boosting on farm nitrogen fixation in pulses  Liz Farquharson
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Identify pulse crops suitable for local climate and soil conditions.
2) Test soil for nitrogen content and pH levels.
3) Apply organic matter to improve soil structure and nutrient retention.
4) Introduce leguminous cover crops to enhance soil nitrogen levels.
5) Practice crop rotation to reduce pest and disease pressure.
6) Use green manure to add nitrogen to the soil naturally.
7) Implement intercropping techniques to maximize land use efficiency.
8) Monitor crop growth and adjust nitrogen application as needed.
9) Consider using microbial inoculants to boost nitrogen-fixing bacteria.
10) Explore the use of biofertilizers for sustainable nitrogen supplementation.
