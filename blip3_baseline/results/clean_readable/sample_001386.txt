Task: How to Prepare Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) using Fresh Potatoes (Part 1/4)
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Wash fresh potatoes thoroughly under running water to remove dirt and debris.
2)  Peel the potatoes and cut them into small pieces, ensuring they are evenly sized for uniform growth.
3)  Boil the potato pieces in distilled water for about 10 minutes to soften them and kill any potential contaminants.
4)  Drain the boiled potato pieces and let them cool slightly before transferring them to a sterile container.
5)  Add dextrose powder to the cooled potato pieces, mixing well until the powder is fully dissolved.
6)  Sterilize the mixture by autoclaving at 121 degrees Celsius for 15-20 minutes to ensure all microorganisms are eliminated.
7)  Allow the sterilized mixture to cool to room temperature before pouring it into petri dishes or jars.
8)  Seal the containers tightly to prevent contamination during storage.
