Task: 5 COMMON MISTAKES IN CACTUS CARE
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Overwatering cacti can lead to root rot and fungal diseases.
2) Placing them in direct sunlight for extended periods damages their leaves.
3) Neglecting to prune dead or diseased parts weakens the plant's health.
4) Using regular potting soil suffocates cactus roots, leading to poor growth.
5) Failing to provide enough light causes stunted growth and unhealthy appearance.
