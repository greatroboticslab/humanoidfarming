Task: 5 Advanced Hydroponic Techniques for Maximum Crop Yield: Beginner to Pro Guide
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Start by selecting the right hydroponic system based on crop type and space availability.
2)  Implement nutrient film technique (NFT) for root oxygenation and efficient water use.
3)  Use aeroponics for high oxygen levels and minimal water usage, ideal for leafy greens.
4)  Apply deep water culture (DWC) for floating plants like lettuce, ensuring roots are submerged in nutrient-rich water.
5)  Integrate drip irrigation systems for precise nutrient delivery and water conservation.
6)  Monitor pH levels daily to maintain optimal growing conditions for crops.
7)  Adjust nutrient solutions weekly according to crop needs and environmental factors.
8)  Regularly inspect plants for pests and diseases using non-toxic methods.
9)  Practice crop rotation to prevent soil-borne diseases and enhance soil health.
10)  Utilize LED grow lights for extended growing seasons and consistent light quality.
