2) Choose native drought-resistant tree species suitable for local climate.
3) Select trees that produce edible fruits to benefit from garden space.
4) Plan placement considering sunlight exposure and wind patterns.
5) Prepare soil by adding organic matter to improve drainage and fertility.
6) Plant trees at appropriate spacing to allow for growth and air circulation.
7) Mulch around trees to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
