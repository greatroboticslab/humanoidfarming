Task: Weeding Made Easy - Year Round Mulch Garden
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Assess garden soil for weed seeds before planting to prevent future growth.
2)  Apply organic mulch around plants to suppress weed growth and retain moisture.
3)  Regularly check mulch layers, adding more as needed to maintain coverage.
4)  Use hand weeding tools to remove weeds between plants when they're small.
5)  Water thoroughly after weeding to help newly planted areas settle.
6)  Rotate crops annually to disrupt weed seed germination cycles.
7)  Consider using shade cloth or other physical barriers in high-traffic areas.
8)  Introduce beneficial insects like ladybugs to naturally control pests and weeds.
9)  Mulch heavily around trees and shrubs to protect roots from weed competition.
10)  Keep pathways free of debris to avoid compacting soil and promote easy access.
