Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Identify key areas needing frequent cleaning in households.
2) Design an irrigation system that can deliver water specifically to these areas.
3) Develop a smart app to monitor and control the irrigation schedule.
4) Integrate sensors to detect when surfaces need cleaning.
5) Program the system to automatically trigger cleaning cycles based on sensor data.
6) Ensure the system uses minimal water and energy for efficient operation.
7) Test the system in pilot homes to gather feedback and make improvements.
8) Deploy the system across multiple households to reduce human contact.
9) Train users on how to use the smart app effectively for optimal performance.
10) Monitor usage and adjust settings as needed to maintain hygiene standards.
