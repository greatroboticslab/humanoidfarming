Task: Growing Hibiscus Plants Indoors | Overwintering
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Choose a suitable indoor location with bright, indirect sunlight for your hibiscus plant.
2)  Water the plant thoroughly but avoid overwatering to prevent root rot.
3)  Use a well-draining potting mix rich in organic matter.
4)  Apply a balanced liquid fertilizer every four weeks during growing season.
5)  Prune the hibiscus regularly to encourage bushy growth and remove dead branches.
6)  Prepare the plant for winter by reducing watering frequency and moving it to a cooler room.
7)  Cover the plant with a frost cloth or move it indoors if temperatures drop below 50°F (10°C).
8)  Keep the temperature between 50°F (10°C) and 60°F (15°C) to protect the plant from cold damage.
9)  Resume normal care when temperatures stabilize above freezing.
10)  Repot the hibiscus in fresh soil if necessary, ensuring the pot has adequate drainage holes.
