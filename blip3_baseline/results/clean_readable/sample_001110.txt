Task: Ford 8N Tractor  Changing Transmission Hydraulic Fluid
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Locate the manual for your Ford 8N tractor to find specific fluid type and capacity recommendations.
2) Turn off the engine and allow the tractor to cool before beginning any maintenance work.
3) Drain the old transmission hydraulic fluid from the tractor following the manufacturer's instructions.
4) Use a funnel to pour in the new specified transmission hydraulic fluid into the designated reservoir.
5) Ensure the level of the new fluid reaches the appropriate mark on the reservoir.
6) Start the engine and run it at idle for about five minutes to circulate the new fluid through the system.
7) Check the fluid level again after running the engine to ensure it has not been lost due to circulation.
8) If necessary, add more of the recommended fluid to reach the correct level.
9) Close all access panels and tighten any loose connections to prevent leaks.
10) Perform a final check of the fluid level and condition before resuming normal operation of the tractor.
