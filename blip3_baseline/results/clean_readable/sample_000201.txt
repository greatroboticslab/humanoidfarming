Task: Graham Collier - Sequestering Carbon between crop rotations
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Identify specific crops suitable for sequestering carbon in soil between rotations.
2) Determine optimal planting and harvesting schedules to maximize carbon capture.
3) Implement crop rotation strategies that alternate high-carbon-demanding plants.
4) Monitor soil health and carbon levels through regular testing and analysis.
5) Adjust practices based on findings to optimize carbon sequestration efficiency.
6) Educate farmers about benefits of carbon sequestration in agricultural systems.
7) Collaborate with local communities and stakeholders to promote sustainable farming methods.
