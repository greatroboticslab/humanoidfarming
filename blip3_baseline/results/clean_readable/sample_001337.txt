Task: Small Farm Irrigation - Video 5 - Attaching and Plugging Drip Tape to a Lay Flat Header Pipe
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Start by gathering all necessary tools including a lay flat header pipe, drip tape, and irrigation fittings.
2) Lay out the lay flat header pipe on a flat surface for easy handling and attachment of drip tape.
3) Cut a section of drip tape to match the length needed for your irrigation area.
4) Connect one end of the drip tape to the lay flat header pipe using appropriate fittings.
5) Ensure the connection is secure and leak-free before proceeding to the next section.
6) Continue attaching drip tape sections to the lay flat header pipe, ensuring they are evenly spaced.
7) Use clamps or clips to secure each section of drip tape to the lay flat header pipe.
8) Once all sections are attached, check for any leaks and make adjustments if necessary.
9) Finally, plug the other end of the lay flat header pipe to prevent water from leaking out when not in use.
