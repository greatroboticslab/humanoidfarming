Task: Starting Sweet Corn seeds indoors
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Choose a suitable container for starting sweet corn seeds, ensuring it has drainage holes at the bottom.
2)  Fill the containers with a well-draining seed-starting mix, leaving about an inch of space from the top.
3)  Sow two to three seeds per container, covering them lightly with soil.
4)  Place the containers in a warm location, maintaining a temperature between 70째F and 85째F (21째C.
- 29째C).
5)  Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, using a spray bottle or misting system.
6)  Once the seeds sprout, thin out the weaker seedlings, leaving only one healthy plant per container.
7)  Gradually harden off the plants by exposing them to outdoor conditions over several days.
8)  Transplant the hardened-off plants outdoors when all danger of frost has passed, spacing them about 18 inches apart.
