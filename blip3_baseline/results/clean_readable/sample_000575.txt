Task: Fruit harvesting robots - Modern technology in agriculture
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Identify key fruits suitable for robotic harvesting.
2) Develop sensors to detect ripe fruit on trees.
3) Design robots capable of climbing trees safely.
4) Program robots to navigate through orchards efficiently.
5) Integrate cameras for detailed fruit inspection.
6) Implement AI algorithms for precise picking.
7) Test robots in controlled environments first.
8) Evaluate robot performance in real orchards.
9) Address challenges like weather conditions and tree height.
10) Collaborate with farmers to refine technology needs.
11) Secure funding for large-scale deployment projects.
12) Train operators on using new robotic systems.
