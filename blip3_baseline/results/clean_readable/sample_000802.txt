Task: NASA Satellites: Advancing Agriculture and Monitoring Plant Health from Space
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
NASA Satellites have advanced agriculture and monitoring plant health from space.
1)  NASA launched the first satellite specifically designed for Earth observation in.
1972) 
2)  These satellites carry various sensors that can capture images and data about Earth's surface.
3)  The collected data includes information on vegetation health, soil moisture levels, and crop conditions.
4)  Farmers use this data to make informed decisions about planting, irrigation, and fertilization.
5)  Scientists analyze the data to understand global climate patterns and their impact on agriculture.
6)  Governments utilize the information for policy-making related to food security and environmental conservation.
7)  Remote sensing technology allows continuous monitoring of agricultural areas, providing timely insights.
8)  This technology helps in predicting crop yields and managing natural resources efficiently.
9)  By improving understanding of plant health, it contributes to sustainable farming practices globally.
