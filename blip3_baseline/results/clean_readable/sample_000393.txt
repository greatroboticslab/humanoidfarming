Task: Tips for Checking Planter Depth
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Measure the depth of the container or planter you intend to use.
2) Determine the root ball depth of the plant you wish to grow.
3) Ensure the container's depth is at least as deep as the plant's root ball.
4) Adjust the container depth if necessary, adding soil or reducing the size of the planter.
5) Check the soil level after planting to confirm it aligns with the plant's root ball.
