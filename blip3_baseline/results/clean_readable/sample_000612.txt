Task: Modern Agriculture Technology: How Billions of Peaches Are Harvested and Processed by US Farmers
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Billions of peaches are harvested using modern machinery that efficiently picks ripe fruits from trees.
2) After picking, peaches are sorted based on size, color, and ripeness to ensure quality.
3) Sorted peaches are then transported to processing facilities for further treatment.
4) At processing plants, peaches undergo washing, grading, and sometimes blanching before packaging.
5) Peaches are packed into boxes or bags for distribution to retailers and consumers.
6) Some peaches may be frozen or canned for year-round availability.
7) Packaging includes information about the farm, harvest date, and nutritional facts for transparency.
8) Post-processing, peaches are distributed through various channels including supermarkets, online marketplaces, and direct-to-consumer sales.
