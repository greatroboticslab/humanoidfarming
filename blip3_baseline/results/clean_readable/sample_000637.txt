Task: Secret Tool for Moving Pigs! || Setting up Kune Kune Rotational Grazing Paddock || Pastured Pigs
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Assess the land for suitable areas to create rotational grazing paddocks.
2) Measure and mark out each paddock based on the number of pigs and their space needs.
3) Install fencing around each paddock to contain the pigs during rotation.
4) Prepare the soil in each paddock by removing weeds and adding organic matter if necessary.
5) Choose a rotation schedule that allows each paddock to rest and recover between pig use.
6) Plan the order in which paddocks will be used to ensure all areas receive adequate grazing.
7) Set up water sources and feeding stations near each paddock for easy access by the pigs.
8) Train the pigs to follow the rotation plan through positive reinforcement and consistent routine.
9) Monitor the pigs' behavior and paddock conditions regularly to adjust the system as needed.
10) Harvest crops from the paddocks after they have been grazed to improve soil health and prepare for new rotations.
