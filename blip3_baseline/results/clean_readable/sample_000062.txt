Task: Plant Growth: Auxins and Gibberellins | Plants | Biology | FuseSchool
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Identify auxins as plant hormones responsible for promoting cell elongation.
2)  Recognize gibberellins as another group of plant hormones that stimulate growth.
3)  Understand auxins increase cell wall looseness facilitating growth.
4)  Learn gibberellins directly influence cell walls to expand.
5)  Note auxins are crucial for root development and stem elongation.
6)  Discover gibberellins play key roles in seed germination and fruit ripening.
7)  Explore how auxins and gibberellins interact synergistically during plant growth.
8)  Acknowledge auxin and gibberellin levels can vary based on environmental conditions.
9)  Realize understanding these hormones aids in optimizing plant growth and crop yields.
10)  Consider the importance of balanced hormone levels for healthy plant development.
