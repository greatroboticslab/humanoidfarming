Task: THE 'Why' behind Rotational Grazing
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Rotational grazing involves moving livestock to different pastures in a planned sequence.
2) This practice helps maintain grassland health by avoiding overgrazing in any one area.
3) It allows pastures to recover between grazing periods, improving soil quality.
4) By rotating livestock, biodiversity in the ecosystem is preserved.
5) Rotational grazing reduces erosion and promotes water infiltration.
6) It enhances forage production through varied nutrient cycles.
7) This method supports sustainable agriculture by mimicking natural grazing patterns.
