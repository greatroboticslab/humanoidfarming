Task: Planting Azaleas
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
Plant azaleas in full sun or partial shade.
Choose a location with well-draining soil rich in organic matter.
Prepare the planting site by removing weeds and loosening the soil.
Water the area thoroughly before planting to settle the soil.
Dig a hole twice as wide but the same depth as the root ball.
Place the azalea in the prepared hole ensuring the top of the root ball is level with the ground.
Backfill around the plant with soil, gently pressing down to remove air pockets.
Water the newly planted azalea deeply to settle the soil around the roots.
Apply a layer of mulch around the base of the plant, keeping it away from the stem.
Water the plant regularly, especially during dry periods, maintaining consistent moisture.
Monitor for signs of pests or disease and treat if necessary.
Prune azaleas in late winter or early spring to promote healthy growth and shape.
Fertilize azaleas in early spring with a balanced fertilizer suitable for acid-loving plants.
