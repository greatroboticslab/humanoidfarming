Task: Seeding Tomatoes
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Choose suitable tomato seeds from a reputable source.
2)  Prepare seed starting trays or small pots filled with moistened potting soil.
3)  Plant one seed per container at a depth of about 1 inch.
4)  Cover the seeds lightly with a thin layer of soil.
5)  Place the containers in a warm location with indirect sunlight.
6)  Maintain consistent moisture by watering gently but thoroughly.
7)  Once sprouts appear, gradually increase light exposure to mimic outdoor conditions.
8)  Transplant seedlings when they have at least two sets of true leaves and the danger of frost has passed.
9)  Harden off plants by exposing them to outdoor conditions for several days before planting in the garden.
10)  Space tomato plants about 2 feet apart in rows spaced 3 to 4 feet apart for proper air circulation.
