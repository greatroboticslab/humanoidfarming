Task: Backyard Composting | From the Ground Up
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Choose a suitable location for your compost bin that receives at least six hours of sunlight daily.
2)  Gather materials such as kitchen scraps, yard waste, and brown materials like leaves or straw.
3)  Build or purchase a compost bin made from wire mesh or wood to contain your compost.
4)  Layer materials in the bin, alternating between green (nitrogen-rich) and brown (carbon-rich) materials.
5)  Add water to keep the compost moist but not soggy.
6)  Turn the compost regularly using a pitchfork or shovel to aerate it.
7)  Cover the compost pile to retain heat and moisture.
8)  Monitor temperature; ideal temperatures range from 130째F to 160째F (54째C to 71째C).
9)  Once compost is dark and crumbly, it's ready to use as fertilizer.
10)  Store finished compost in a container to prevent pests and ensure freshness.
