Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Choose a 5-gallon bucket with a lid for your cucumber container garden.
2)  Drill several drainage holes at the bottom of the bucket for excess water.
3)  Fill the bucket about halfway with well-draining potting soil.
4)  Plant one or two cucumber seeds about an inch deep in the center of the soil.
5)  Water the soil until it is moist but not soggy.
6)  Place the bucket in a sunny spot receiving at least six hours of direct sunlight daily.
7)  Keep the soil consistently moist by watering as needed.
8)  As the plants grow, support them with stakes or a trellis.
9)  When the first flowers appear, apply a balanced fertilizer every two weeks.
10)  Harvest cucumbers when they reach full size and have a bright green color.
