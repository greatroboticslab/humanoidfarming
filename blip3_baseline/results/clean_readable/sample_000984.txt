Task: Calibrating a Solid Manure Spreader
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Begin by gathering all necessary tools including a tape measure, calculator, and a reference spread rate chart.
2)  Mark the starting point on the field where you will begin spreading manure.
3)  Set up the solid manure spreader according to the manufacturer's instructions ensuring all components are correctly aligned.
4)  Adjust the spreader settings to match the desired application rate as per the soil type and crop needs.
5)  Start the spreader and observe its operation to ensure it is functioning correctly without leaks or malfunctions.
6)  Begin spreading at the marked starting point, maintaining a consistent speed and direction.
7)  Use the tape measure to periodically check the spread width and depth against the spread rate chart for accuracy.
8)  If discrepancies are found, make adjustments to the spreader settings until the spread rate matches the chart.
9)  Continue spreading in a straight line until the designated area is covered.
10)  After completing the initial spread, use the tape measure to verify the total coverage area and adjust if necessary.
11)  Stop the spreader and clean it thoroughly before storing it for future use.
