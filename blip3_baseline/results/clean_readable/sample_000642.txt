Task: Learn how to grow rice
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Choose an appropriate location for your rice field that receives at least six hours of sunlight daily.
2)  Prepare the soil by removing weeds and rocks, then till the land to loosen the soil.
3)  Add organic matter like compost or manure to enrich the soil's fertility.
4)  Plant seeds in rows spaced about 15-20 cm apart.
5)  Cover the seeds with a thin layer of soil and water gently.
6)  Monitor the growth regularly, ensuring the soil stays moist but not waterlogged.
7)  Thin out seedlings when they reach about 15 cm tall, leaving only the strongest plants.
8)  Apply fertilizer every two weeks to support plant growth.
9)  Keep weeds under control to prevent competition for nutrients.
10)  Harvest the rice when the grains turn from green to golden yellow.
11)  Allow the plants to dry slightly before threshing to separate the grains from the stalks.
12)  Store the harvested rice in a cool, dry place to maintain its quality.
