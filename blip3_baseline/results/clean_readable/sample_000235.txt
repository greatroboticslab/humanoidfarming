Task: TILLING A GARDEN IN VIRGIN GROUND WITH A SUBCOMPACT TRACTOR
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Assess the garden's size and shape to determine the number of passes needed for tilling.
2) Start at one corner of the garden and move in a straight line towards the opposite corner.
3) Begin tilling from the ground surface down to the soil layer, ensuring even depth across the entire area.
4) Use the subcompact tractor's tiller attachment to cut through the soil vertically.
5) Move the tiller attachment back and forth across the garden in a sweeping motion.
6) Continue tilling until the entire garden is covered, making sure to overlap each pass slightly.
7) Adjust the tiller attachment as necessary to maintain consistent depth and coverage.
8) Once completed, remove any clumps or debris from the tilled soil surface.
9) Rake the garden to level the soil and prepare it for planting seeds or seedlings.
