Task: Bridging the Gap: Can Subsistence Farming Feed Us All?
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Define subsistence farming as small-scale agriculture meeting basic needs of farmers and their families.
2) Assess current global food production against population growth projections.
3) Evaluate subsistence farming's efficiency in producing staple foods like grains and vegetables.
4) Analyze challenges such as climate change, soil degradation, and pests affecting subsistence farms.
5) Examine alternative strategies to enhance subsistence farming's productivity and sustainability.
6) Consider potential for integrating modern agricultural techniques into traditional subsistence practices.
7) Investigate the role of local communities and governments in supporting subsistence farmers.
8) Explore international aid and trade policies that could benefit subsistence farmers globally.
9) Compare subsistence farming's impact on food security versus industrial agriculture methods.
10) Conclude by discussing the feasibility of feeding all people through subsistence farming alone.
