Task: IoT Based Smart Irrigation System for Precision Farming. Team Krishi-Shakti
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Conduct market research to identify suitable IoT devices for smart irrigation.
2)  Design sensors to monitor soil moisture, temperature, and weather conditions.
3)  Develop an algorithm to analyze data from sensors for optimal watering schedules.
4)  Integrate sensors and control systems into a cloud-based platform for remote monitoring.
5)  Test the system in a controlled environment before deploying it on farms.
6)  Collaborate with farmers to gather feedback and refine the irrigation system.
7)  Deploy the IoT-based smart irrigation system across various farms for precision farming.
8)  Monitor system performance and adjust settings based on real-time data analysis.
9)  Implement a maintenance plan to ensure continuous functionality of the irrigation system.
10)  Train farmers on how to use the smart irrigation system effectively for sustainable agriculture.
