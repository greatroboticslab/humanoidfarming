Task: Frosty Pigs - How do they Stay Warm in Cold Weather
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Frosty pigs have thick fur coats to insulate their bodies from cold temperatures.
2) They huddle together for warmth, sharing body heat among group members.
3) Their small size helps conserve body heat more efficiently than larger animals.
4) Frosty pigs have short legs which reduce surface area exposed to cold air.
5) They dig burrows or find sheltered spots to sleep through harsh weather.
6) Some species of frosty pigs have adapted to live in colder climates naturally.
