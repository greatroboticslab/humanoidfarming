Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Sugarcane farming begins with planting seedlings in prepared fields.
2) After harvesting, sugarcane is transported to processing plants.
3) At the plants, cane is cut into sections and fed into machinery.
4) Machinery crushes the cane to extract juice rich in sugar.
5) The extracted juice undergoes boiling to concentrate and crystallize sugar.
6) Once crystallized, sugar is separated from molasses through centrifuges.
7) Molasses may be further processed or used as a byproduct.
8) Processed sugar is then packaged for distribution to markets worldwide.
