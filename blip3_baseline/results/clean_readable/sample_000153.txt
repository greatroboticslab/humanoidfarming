Task: Alternate wetting and drying (AWD)--using less water to grow rice
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Identify suitable rice varieties that can tolerate alternating wetting and drying conditions.
2)  Implement a system where fields are alternately flooded and drained as per crop needs.
3)  Monitor soil moisture levels closely to avoid overwatering or underwatering.
4)  Adjust irrigation schedules based on weather forecasts and local climate data.
5)  Use sensors to measure soil moisture and automate watering systems accordingly.
6)  Apply organic matter to improve soil structure and retain moisture between irrigations.
7)  Encourage natural drainage through proper field design and slope management.
8)  Train farmers in efficient AWD techniques for optimal crop growth and water conservation.
9)  Conduct regular assessments of crop health and adjust practices as necessary.
10)  Share best practices and technologies among farmers to promote widespread adoption of AWD.
