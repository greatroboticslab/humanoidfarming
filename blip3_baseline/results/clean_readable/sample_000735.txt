Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Identify suitable rice varieties for local climate conditions.
2)  Prepare the soil by plowing and harrowing to loosen and level the ground.
3)  Apply organic or chemical fertilizers based on soil tests to enhance nutrient levels.
4)  Plant seeds at appropriate depths and spacings according to variety recommendations.
5)  Monitor seedling growth and thin out weaker plants to ensure proper spacing.
6)  Irrigate regularly to maintain moisture in the soil, especially during critical growth stages.
7)  Control weeds manually or chemically to prevent competition for nutrients and water.
8)  Harvest when grains turn from green to golden yellow, ensuring full maturity.
9)  Dry harvested rice in the sun or using mechanical equipment to reduce moisture content.
10)  Store in a dry, cool place to prevent mold and pests.
