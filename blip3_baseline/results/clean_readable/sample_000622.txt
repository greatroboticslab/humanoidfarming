Task: What is Regenerative Agriculture?
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
Regenerative agriculture involves practices that enhance soil health and biodiversity while improving ecosystem services.
It aims to restore degraded lands and ecosystems through holistic management approaches.
This includes integrating livestock grazing with crop rotation and cover cropping systems.
The goal is to increase carbon sequestration in soils and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
It also seeks to improve water quality and availability through better land management techniques.
Regenerative agriculture promotes the use of natural fertilizers and pest control methods.
Farmers adopting these practices often see increased yields and resilience against climate change.
It encourages collaboration among farmers, researchers, and policymakers for sustainable agricultural development.
