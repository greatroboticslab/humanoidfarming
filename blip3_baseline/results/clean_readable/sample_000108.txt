Task: Caladium Care || Planting-Growing-Storing Bulbs
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Choose a sunny spot for caladiums, ensuring they receive at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily.
2) Prepare the soil by adding compost or well-rotted manure to improve drainage and fertility.
3) Plant caladium bulbs about 4 inches deep and 8 inches apart in the prepared soil.
4) Water thoroughly after planting to settle the soil around the bulbs.
5) Mulch around the plants to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
6) Water regularly, keeping the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged.
7) Fertilize every 4 to 6 weeks with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season.
8) Pinch back the tips of the leaves to encourage bushier growth and prevent legginess.
9) Monitor for pests and diseases, treating promptly if any issues arise.
10) Stop watering and fertilizing once temperatures drop below 60°F (16°C) in autumn.
11) Lift and dry the bulbs after the first frost, removing any dead foliage.
12) Store the bulbs in a cool, dry place until spring planting time.
