1)  Start by selecting suitable organic seeds or seedlings that are well-suited to your local climate.
2)  Prepare the soil by adding compost and organic matter to improve fertility and structure.
3)  Practice crop rotation to prevent soil depletion and reduce pest and disease buildup.
4)  Water plants deeply but infrequently to encourage deep root growth and discourage fungal diseases.
