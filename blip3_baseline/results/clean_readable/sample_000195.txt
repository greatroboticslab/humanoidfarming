Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Choose spinach varieties known for high yield and early maturation.
2) Plant seeds indoors or in a greenhouse about 6 weeks before the last expected frost.
3) Transplant seedlings to your container garden when they reach about 4 inches tall.
4) Fill containers with a well-draining potting mix suitable for leafy greens.
5) Space plants approximately 6-8 inches apart for optimal growth.
6) Water consistently, keeping soil moist but not waterlogged.
7) Provide adequate light; use grow lights if necessary for indoor containers.
8) Harvest baby spinach leaves when they are about 3-4 inches long and tender.
9) Snip leaves from the outside of the plant to encourage new growth.
10) Replenish soil as needed, adding compost for nutrients every few months.
11) Monitor for pests and diseases regularly, addressing issues promptly.
12) Harvest the entire plant once it has produced its full crop of baby spinach leaves.
