1)  Start by identifying the type of weeds in your garden to choose the right herbicide or manual removal method.
2)  Remove visible weeds by hand, pulling them out by their roots to prevent regrowth.
3)  Apply a selective herbicide according to the label instructions for effective weed control without harming other plants.
4)  Use mulch around plants to suppress weed growth and retain soil moisture.
