Task: WATERMELONS  This is the first year Ive had enough space to grow large.
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
This is the first year I have enough space to grow large. I will assess my garden for suitable locations. I need to decide on the variety of watermelon that will thrive in my conditions. I should prepare the soil by adding compost and ensuring good drainage. Next, I will plant the watermelon seeds or seedlings according to the recommended spacing. I will ensure the plants receive adequate sunlight and water regularly. I plan to monitor for pests and diseases and take necessary precautions. When the fruit starts to develop, I will support the vines as they grow. I will harvest the watermelons when they reach their full size and have a solid green color.
