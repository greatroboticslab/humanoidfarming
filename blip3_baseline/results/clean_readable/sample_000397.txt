Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
Key ecology terms include biotic and abiotic factors.
Biotic factors encompass all living organisms in an ecosystem.
Abiotic factors refer to non-living components affecting ecosystems.
Ecosystems consist of populations of different species interacting.
Communities are groups of interacting species within a given area.
Habitat describes the physical environment where an organism lives.
Population refers to all individuals of the same species in an area.
Species diversity measures the variety of different species in an area.
Food chains illustrate the flow of energy through an ecosystem.
Food webs show interconnected food chains in an ecosystem.
Energy flow in ecosystems is unidirectional and decreases.
Nutrient cycling involves recycling of nutrients within ecosystems.
Primary producers convert sunlight into chemical energy.
Primary consumers feed directly on primary producers.
Trophic levels represent different positions in a food chain.
Decomposers break down dead organisms and waste materials.
Biogeochemical cycles involve movement of elements through Earth systems.
Symbiotic relationships describe interactions between species.
Predation is a common interaction between predator and prey.
Mutualism occurs when both species benefit from interaction.
Competition arises when two species compete for resources.
Extinction happens when a species disappears from Earth.
Conservation efforts aim to protect biodiversity and habitats.
Ecological succession is the process of community change over time.
Ecosystem services include benefits humans receive from nature.
Pollution affects ecosystems through various harmful substances.
Climate change alters ecosystems through temperature and weather patterns.
Human activities impact ecosystems through deforestation and agriculture.
Sustainability aims to meet current needs without compromising future generations.
