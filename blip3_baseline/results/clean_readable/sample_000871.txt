Task: Irrigation works drive up agricultural production 50%
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Identify specific irrigation works that significantly enhance water delivery to crops.
2) Analyze the impact of these works on crop yield and quality.
3) Measure the increase in agricultural production as a result of improved irrigation efficiency.
4) Calculate the percentage increase in production due to the irrigation works.
5) Compare the calculated increase to the original production levels to determine the 50% claim's accuracy.
6) Document the findings for future reference and potential replication of successful irrigation projects.
