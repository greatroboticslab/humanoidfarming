------------------------------------------------------------
A tractor and a skid steer have different purposes.
Comparing them involves considering their intended uses.
Tractors are typically used for heavy-duty tasks on large areas.
Skid steers are more suitable for smaller, more precise tasks.
Their comparison depends on the specific task at hand.
Therefore, fairness in comparison depends on matching the task to the appropriate equipment.
