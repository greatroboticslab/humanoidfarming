Task: Growing and harvesting large quantities of onions - Advanced agricultural techniques
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Start by selecting suitable onion seeds or sets for planting based on local climate conditions.
2) Prepare the soil by adding compost and ensuring good drainage to prevent waterlogging.
3) Plant seeds at least 6 inches apart in rows spaced 18-24 inches apart for optimal growth.
4) Cover seeds lightly with soil and keep moist until sprouts appear.
5) Thin seedlings to one plant every 12 inches once they reach about 4 inches tall.
6) Water regularly, especially during dry spells, maintaining consistent moisture levels.
7) Apply balanced fertilizer every 4 weeks to support healthy growth and bulb development.
8) Mulch around plants to retain soil moisture and suppress weeds.
9) Monitor for pests and diseases, using organic methods if possible.
10) Harvest when tops naturally fall over and leaves turn yellow, usually 100-120 days after planting.
11) Dig bulbs carefully to avoid bruising, leaving about an inch of stem attached.
12) Cure harvested onions in a warm, dry place with good air circulation for several weeks.
