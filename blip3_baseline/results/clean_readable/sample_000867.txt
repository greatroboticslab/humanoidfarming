Task: PLOWING A FIELD WITH A SMALL TRACTOR. DID IT WORK?
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) The small tractor is positioned at the beginning of the field.
2) The driver starts the engine and checks all machinery for proper operation.
3) The driver begins to move the tractor forward in a straight line across the field.
4) Implements such as plow blades or discs are engaged and positioned correctly on the tractor.
5) The tractor moves slowly over the field, turning at designated points to cover the entire area.
6) Soil is broken up and turned under by the plowing process.
7) After completing one pass, the tractor turns around and repeats the process until the entire field is plowed.
8) The driver inspects the field to ensure even coverage and proper soil disruption.
9) Any necessary adjustments are made before continuing with subsequent passes if needed.
10) Once the desired depth and coverage are achieved, the tractor stops and the work is considered completed.
