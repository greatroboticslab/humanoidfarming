Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Farmers start harvesting eggplants when they reach their desired size, typically around 4-6 inches long.
2) They use specialized tools like scissors or small knives to cut the plants at ground level.
3) Carefully removing each plant ensures minimal damage to the surrounding eggplants.
4) Harvested eggplants are then sorted for quality and freshness before being packed.
5) In greenhouses, temperature control helps maintain optimal growing conditions for continuous harvests.
6) Regular monitoring of soil moisture and nutrient levels ensures healthy growth throughout the season.
