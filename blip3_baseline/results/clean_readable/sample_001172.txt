Task: Grass Roots in the Soil part 1
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
Grass roots grow downward from the base of the plant.
They penetrate the soil to anchor the plant firmly.
Roots absorb water and nutrients from the soil.
They also help in the process of air exchange between soil and atmosphere.
As roots grow, they create channels that improve soil structure.
