Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Korean farmers start harvesting onions when they reach maturity, typically in late summer or early autumn.
2)  They carefully select healthy, large onions for juice production, discarding smaller ones.
3)  Harvested onions are washed thoroughly to remove dirt and debris.
4)  The outer layers of the onions are peeled off, exposing the inner white part.
5)  Peels and outer layers are separated from the inner white part for different uses.
6)  Inner white parts are chopped finely to prepare for juice extraction.
7)  A mechanical press is used to extract juice from the chopped onion pieces.
8)  The juice is filtered to remove any remaining solids and impurities.
9)  The onion juice undergoes pasteurization to ensure safety and extend shelf life.
10)  Finally, the processed onion juice is bottled and labeled for distribution.
