Task: Peony Planting Tips
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
Plant peonies in full sun or partial shade.
Choose a site with well-draining soil rich in organic matter.
Prepare the planting bed by removing weeds and adding compost.
Dig holes twice as wide and deep as the peony's root ball.
Place the peony in the hole ensuring the bud union is slightly above ground level.
Backfill the hole with soil, gently pressing down around the roots.
Water thoroughly after planting to settle the soil.
Apply a layer of mulch around the base of the plant, keeping it away from the stem.
Support the plant with a stake if necessary, especially during windy conditions.
Water regularly, maintaining consistent moisture levels.
Fertilize with a balanced fertilizer in early spring before new growth begins.
Prune spent blooms to encourage more flowers and prevent disease.
Monitor for pests and diseases, treating promptly if issues arise.
Divide the plant every 3 to 5 years to maintain vigor and flower production.
