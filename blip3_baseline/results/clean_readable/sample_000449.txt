Task: IMPROVE your raised bed soil the EASY Way! (With cover crops)
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Choose suitable cover crops that complement your existing plants for pest control and nutrient enhancement.
2)  Select a mix of legumes like clover or peas to fix nitrogen in the soil.
3)  Plant cover crops in late summer or early fall when temperatures start cooling down.
4)  Allow cover crops to grow until they begin to flower, ensuring they have enough time to establish roots.
5)  Mow or till the cover crop into the soil once it reaches a height of about 6 inches.
6)  Mix the cover crop into the top 6-8 inches of soil using a garden fork or tiller.
7)  Rake the soil surface smooth after incorporating the cover crop material.
8)  Water the soil thoroughly to help settle the mixture and distribute nutrients evenly.
9)  Apply a layer of organic mulch over the soil surface to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
10)  Monitor the soil health regularly, adjusting as needed based on plant growth and nutrient levels.
