Task: solar powered drip watering system
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Research solar panel specifications suitable for the water system's power needs.
2)  Choose a water-efficient drip irrigation system compatible with solar power.
3)  Design the layout of the drip irrigation system to cover all plants efficiently.
4)  Install solar panels in an optimal position to maximize sunlight exposure.
5)  Connect the solar panels to an inverter to convert DC to AC power.
6)  Integrate the inverter with the drip irrigation controller for automated operation.
7)  Set up the drip irrigation controller to distribute water evenly according to plant needs.
8)  Position the drip emitters at the base of each plant to deliver water directly.
9)  Install tubing and connectors to route water from the emitters to the soil.
10)  Test the entire system to ensure proper functioning and adjust as necessary.
11)  Monitor the system regularly to check for leaks or malfunctions.
12)  Adjust the watering schedule based on weather conditions and plant growth.
