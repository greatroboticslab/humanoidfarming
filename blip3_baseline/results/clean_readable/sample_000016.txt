Task: How Farmers Harvest Lemons: Modern Techniques in the Processing Factory! | Farming Documentary
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Farmers begin harvesting lemons when they reach full maturity, typically in late summer or early autumn.
2) Workers use specialized ladders to reach high branches for picking lemons carefully.
3) Picked lemons are sorted by size and quality before being transported to processing facilities.
4) At the factory, lemons are washed thoroughly to remove dirt and debris.
5) Mechanical peelers strip off the outer skin of each lemon, separating the pulp from the zest.
6) The juice is extracted using centrifuges that spin at high speeds to separate the liquid from the solids.
7) Lemon zest is dried and used as a flavoring agent in various culinary applications.
8) The remaining pulp is processed into lemon juice concentrate or sold as whole fruit.
9) Quality control checks ensure all products meet safety and taste standards before packaging.
10) Finished products are then distributed to retailers and consumers worldwide.
