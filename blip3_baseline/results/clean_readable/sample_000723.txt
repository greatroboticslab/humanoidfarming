Task: Composting 101 - building your compost bin
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Choose a suitable location for your compost bin that receives at least six hours of sunlight daily.
2)  Select a container or build a bin from materials like wood, wire mesh, or plastic.
3)  Line the bottom of the bin with twigs, straw, or shredded newspaper to improve drainage.
4)  Add brown materials such as leaves, straw, and shredded paper to provide carbon.
5)  Add green materials like vegetable scraps, grass clippings, and coffee grounds to provide nitrogen.
6)  Maintain proper moisture levels by watering the pile regularly but not soaking it.
7)  Turn the compost every two weeks using a pitchfork or shovel to mix the contents.
8)  Cover the compost bin with a lid to retain heat and moisture.
9)  Monitor the temperature inside the compost pile; it should reach around 130-160°F (54-71°C) for optimal decomposition.
10)  Once the compost is dark and crumbly, it's ready to use in gardens or as mulch.
