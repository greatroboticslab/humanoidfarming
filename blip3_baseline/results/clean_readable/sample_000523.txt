Task: Powerful Tractor Plowing the Field | Farming in Action  #Tractor #TractorPlowing #PlowingTheField
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) A powerful tractor is selected for its strength to plow through tough soil.
2) The tractor's large wheels roll over the field, preparing the ground for planting.
3) The plow blade cuts into the earth, turning it over as the tractor moves forward.
4) Soil is lifted and distributed evenly across the field, creating a smooth surface.
5) The process repeats across the entire field, ensuring uniform preparation for crops.
6) After plowing, the field is ready for seeds to be planted, marking the start of farming activities.
