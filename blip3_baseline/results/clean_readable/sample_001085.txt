Task: Manufacturing of Biochar
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Collect organic waste materials suitable for biochar production.
2)  Preprocess the collected organic waste by shredding or grinding to reduce particle size.
3)  Mix the preprocessed organic waste with an appropriate carbon source if desired.
4)  Load the mixture into a biochar production reactor.
5)  Heat the reactor to a temperature between 400°C and 600°C in an oxygen-free environment.
6)  Maintain this temperature for several hours to allow for pyrolysis.
7)  Allow the reactor to cool down naturally after the heating process.
8)  Separate the biochar from the remaining charred organic matter.
9)  Screen or sift the biochar to remove any large particles.
10)  Store the processed biochar in a dry, well-ventilated area.
