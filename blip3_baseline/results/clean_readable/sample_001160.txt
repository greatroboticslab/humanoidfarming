Task: Transplanting Tomatoes
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Choose healthy tomato seedlings from a nursery or your garden.
2)  Select a sunny spot in your garden that receives at least six hours of direct sunlight daily.
3)  Prepare the soil by turning over the topsoil to a depth of about 12 inches.
4)  Amend the soil with compost or well-rotted manure to improve its fertility.
5)  Dig holes for the tomato plants, spacing them about 2 feet apart in rows that are also 2 feet apart.
6)  Gently remove the seedling from its container, taking care not to damage the roots.
7)  Place the seedling in each hole, ensuring the root ball is level with the surrounding soil.
8)  Fill the holes with soil, pressing down firmly around the base of the plant.
9)  Water the transplanted tomatoes thoroughly to settle the soil and encourage root growth.
10)  Apply a layer of mulch around the plants to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
11)  Monitor the plants for signs of pests or diseases and take appropriate action as needed.
12)  Provide support for taller varieties using stakes or cages to prevent damage from wind or heavy fruit.
