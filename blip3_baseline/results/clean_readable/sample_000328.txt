Task: How American Farm Workers Harvest Millions Of Tons Of Vegetables
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) American farm workers start their day early to begin harvesting vegetables before the heat of the sun becomes too intense.
2) They use various tools like hand-held knives, shears, and long-handled rakes for efficient picking.
3) Workers meticulously sort harvested vegetables based on quality and size to ensure marketability.
4) Some farms employ mechanized equipment such as harvesters and pickers to increase efficiency.
5) Nighttime harvesting is also common in some regions to avoid the midday heat and take advantage of cooler temperatures.
6) Farm workers often work in teams, dividing tasks among themselves for faster completion of large-scale harvests.
7) Safety measures are strictly followed to protect workers from injuries caused by machinery or hazardous conditions.
8) After harvesting, vegetables are quickly transported to processing plants or storage facilities to prevent spoilage.
9) Some farms implement sustainable practices to preserve soil health and reduce environmental impact during the harvesting process.
10) Seasonal changes influence the types of vegetables harvested, requiring workers to adapt their techniques accordingly.
