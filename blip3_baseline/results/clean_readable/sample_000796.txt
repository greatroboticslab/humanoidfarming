Task: HOW TO SMOOTH AND LEVEL A BUMPY FIELD OR LAWN
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Assess the size and extent of the bumpy areas to determine the best approach.
2) Gather necessary tools including a rake, broom, and possibly a tiller or cultivator.
3) Start by raking the entire lawn to loosen soil and expose bumps.
4) Use a broom to sweep away debris and small rocks from the surface.
5) For larger bumps, use a tiller to gently level the soil, working in small sections.
6) Rake the leveled area again to ensure smoothness and remove any remaining clumps.
7) Water the lawn thoroughly to settle the soil and help it adhere better.
8) Consider using grass seeds or sod to fill in bare spots and enhance the lawn's appearance.
9) Regular maintenance such as mowing at appropriate heights and watering can help maintain the lawn's smoothness.
