Task: Off Grid-solar and wind set up
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Assess energy needs and available space for solar panels and wind turbines.
2) Choose appropriate solar panel and wind turbine models based on location and size.
3) Install solar panels facing optimal sun direction for maximum efficiency.
4) Position wind turbines in areas with consistent wind speeds for reliable power generation.
5) Connect all components to a battery bank for storage of excess energy.
6) Integrate an inverter to convert direct current from solar/wind to usable alternating current.
7) Set up monitoring system to track energy production and consumption.
8) Ensure proper grounding and safety measures are in place throughout installation.
9) Test all systems to ensure they function correctly before full operation.
10) Plan maintenance schedule to keep equipment running efficiently over time.
