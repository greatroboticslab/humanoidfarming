Task: From Cane to Crystal: The Hidden Secrets of Sugar Production
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Begin by selecting suitable sugarcane varieties for optimal sugar yield.
2)  Harvest sugarcane during peak maturity for maximum sugar content.
3)  Transport harvested sugarcane to processing facilities quickly to prevent spoilage.
4)  Crush sugarcane stalks mechanically to extract juice rich in sugar.
5)  Boil extracted juice to concentrate sugars and remove impurities.
6)  Add lime water to juice to precipitate insoluble solids and improve filtration.
7)  Filter boiled juice through charcoal or sand filters to remove remaining solids.
8)  Evaporate remaining liquid to form thick syrup, which is then crystallized.
9)  Cool crystallized sugar to separate it from syrup and prepare for packaging.
10)  Store processed sugar in clean, dry warehouses to maintain quality until distribution.
