Task: How the Amish Raise Millions of Chickens for Meat and Egg Production
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) The Amish community starts by selecting breeds known for their high egg-laying capacity or meat yield.
2) They maintain small-scale farms to ensure close monitoring of each chicken's health and welfare.
3) Chickens are raised in coops that mimic natural habitats to reduce stress and disease.
4) Organic feed is used to avoid antibiotics and hormones, aligning with their religious beliefs.
5) Regularly scheduled veterinary check-ups prevent diseases from spreading among the flock.
6) Eggs and meat are sold locally through direct sales or at farmers' markets.
7) Community support and word-of-mouth marketing help sustain demand for their products.
8) Continuous improvement in farming techniques ensures efficiency and profitability without compromising ethics.
