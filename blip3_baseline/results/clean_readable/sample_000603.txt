Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Start seeds indoors six weeks before the last expected frost.
2)  Plant seedlings outdoors when nighttime temperatures stay above 60Â°F.
3)  Water deeply once a week, ensuring soil stays moist but not waterlogged.
4)  Mulch around plants to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
5)  Stake or cage plants to support growth and keep fruit off the ground.
6)  Pinch off male flowers to encourage more female flowers and fruit production.
7)  Apply balanced fertilizer every four weeks during growing season.
8)  Harvest zucchinis when they reach 6-8 inches in length for best flavor.
9)  Rotate crops annually to prevent soil-borne diseases and nutrient depletion.
10)  Consider using floating row covers to protect young plants from pests and cold weather.
