Task: DIY watering automation system build #2
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Purchase necessary components including a soil moisture sensor, a relay module, a water pump, and a microcontroller like an Arduino.
2)  Connect the soil moisture sensor to the microcontroller using appropriate wires and breadboard.
3)  Program the microcontroller to read the moisture level from the sensor.
4)  Set up the relay module to control the water pump based on the moisture reading.
5)  Install the water pump in your garden or potted plant area.
6)  Connect the pump to the relay module for automatic activation.
7)  Test the system by manually adjusting the moisture levels and observing the pump's response.
8)  Position the soil moisture sensor in the soil where you want to monitor and control watering.
9)  Connect the sensor to the microcontroller as per the wiring diagram.
10)  Write the code to activate the pump when the soil moisture drops below a certain threshold.
11)  Power the microcontroller and test the entire system to ensure it works correctly.
12)  Adjust the watering schedule according to your plants' needs and local climate conditions.
