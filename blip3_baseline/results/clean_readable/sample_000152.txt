Task: Small Farm Irrigation - Video 1 - How to Attach a Lay Flat Header Pipe to a Garden Hose Faucet
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Start by turning off the main water supply to prevent accidental water flow during attachment.
2)  Locate the garden hose faucet on your irrigation system and turn it clockwise to close it.
3)  Remove any existing connectors from the faucet to ensure a clean connection.
4)  Carefully unscrew the faucet handle to expose the internal threads.
5)  Insert the male end of the lay flat header pipe into the faucet's threaded opening.
6)  Use a wrench or pliers to tighten the connection until snug but not over-tightened.
7)  Reattach the faucet handle and turn it counterclockwise to open the water supply.
8)  Test the connection by turning on the faucet to check for leaks or proper water flow.
9)  If everything is secure, connect the other end of the lay flat header pipe to your sprinkler system.
10)  Turn the main water supply back on and adjust the valves as needed for your irrigation schedule.
