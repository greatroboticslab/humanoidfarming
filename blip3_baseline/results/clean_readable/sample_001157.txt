2) Evaluate hydroponic's water efficiency versus traditional farming's water usage.
3) Assess hydroponic's ability to grow year-round without seasons' constraints.
4) Consider hydroponic's space-saving design compared to traditional farming's land requirements.
5) Examine hydroponic's potential for higher crop yields per unit area.
6) Analyze hydroponic's reduced need for pesticides and fertilizers in comparison to traditional farming.
7) Evaluate hydroponic's energy consumption versus traditional farming's reliance on sunlight.
8) Assess hydroponic's scalability options for large-scale production or small-scale operations.
9) Compare hydroponic's cost of setup and maintenance against traditional farming's ongoing expenses.
