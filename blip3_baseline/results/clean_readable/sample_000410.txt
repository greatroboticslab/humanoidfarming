Task: See How Crops Get Picked Super Fast by Machines!
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Farmers install advanced robotic harvesters equipped with sensors.
2) These machines recognize ripe crops through light and sound detection.
3) The robots then use mechanical arms to pick fruits and vegetables swiftly.
4) Automated sorting systems separate picked items based on quality.
5) Harvested produce is immediately transported to processing facilities.
6) This process reduces labor costs and increases crop yield efficiency.
