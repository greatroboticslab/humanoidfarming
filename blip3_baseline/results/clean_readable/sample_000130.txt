Task: Milking Cows with Hand
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Position yourself facing the cow, ensuring you are in a safe distance.
2)  Gently pat the cow to calm it down if it shows signs of agitation.
3)  Use your dominant hand to grasp the udder firmly but gently.
4)  Apply steady pressure to the teats to stimulate milk flow.
5)  Hold the teat securely while allowing the milk to flow into a container.
6)  Rotate the hand to target different teats for even milking.
7)  Continue this process until all teats have been emptied.
8)  Clean the teats and the container thoroughly after milking.
9)  Dispose of the used container safely and wash your hands.
