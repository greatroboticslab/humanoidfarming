Task: Heat Lamp and Heat Plate Differences | Cackle Hatchery
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Identify heat lamp and heat plate as heating devices used in incubation.
2) Determine heat lamp uses infrared radiation for even heating.
3) Contrast heat plates which use direct heat transfer through contact.
4) Note heat lamps are portable and can be moved easily.
5) Highlight heat plates are stationary and require less space.
6) Explain heat lamps are safer for chicks due to indirect heat.
7) State heat plates may cause burns if not handled carefully.
8) Mention heat lamps are more energy-efficient than heat plates.
9) Conclude heat lamps provide better temperature control during incubation.
10) Summarize heat plates offer simpler setup and lower initial cost.
