Task: Know This Before Planting Stevia Seeds!Gardening Tips
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Choose a sunny spot for stevia plants as they require at least six hours of direct sunlight daily.
2) Prepare the soil by adding compost or well-rotted manure to improve drainage and fertility.
3) Sow seeds indoors about four weeks before the last expected frost or directly outside after all danger of frost has passed.
4) Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged during germination and early growth stages.
5) Transplant seedlings when they have at least two true leaves and outdoor temperatures are above 60°F (16°C).
6) Space plants approximately 18 to 24 inches apart to allow for proper air circulation and growth.
7) Water deeply once a week, reducing watering in winter months to prevent root rot.
8) Apply a balanced fertilizer every four to six weeks during growing season to support plant health.
9) Harvest leaves when they reach full size, typically after one year of planting, for best flavor and yield.
10) Remove spent flowers to encourage more leaf production and prevent excessive energy from going into seed production.
