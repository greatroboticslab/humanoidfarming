Task: How Solar Irrigation Systems Work: Save Water & Power Your Farm Sustainably!
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Solar panels absorb sunlight and convert it into electricity.
2)  The generated electricity powers an irrigation pump.
3)  The pump circulates water from a well or reservoir to fields.
4)  Sensors monitor soil moisture levels and adjust watering as needed.
5)  Drip irrigation systems deliver water directly to plant roots.
6)  This method minimizes water loss through evaporation and runoff.
7)  Solar-powered irrigation reduces reliance on fossil fuels.
8)  It conserves water resources for future use in agriculture.
9)  Sustainable farming practices enhance crop yields and resilience.
10)  Farmers can implement solar irrigation without significant upfront costs.
