Task: Cilantro Growing Guide: Plant in Every Season to Harvest Year-Round
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Choose a sunny spot for cilantro plants.
2) Start seeds indoors four weeks before last frost or directly sow outdoors after danger of frost has passed.
3) Water cilantro deeply once a week, keeping soil consistently moist.
4) Pinch off flowering tops to encourage more leaf growth.
5) Harvest leaves when they reach 6 inches tall, cutting from the base.
6) For continuous harvest, plant new batches every two weeks.
7) Keep plants at least 6 inches apart to allow for air circulation.
8) Mulch around plants to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
9) Consider using containers if space is limited or if you live in a cold climate.
10) Store excess cilantro in the refrigerator or freeze for later use.
