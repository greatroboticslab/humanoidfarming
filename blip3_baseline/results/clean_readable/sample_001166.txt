Task: How do vaccines work?
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
Vaccines introduce weakened or inactivated pathogens to the body.
The immune system recognizes these pathogens and mounts an immune response.
Memory cells are produced that remember the pathogen for future encounters.
If the vaccinated person is later exposed to the actual pathogen, the memory cells activate quickly.
This results in a faster and stronger immune response to fight off the pathogen.
