Task: 3 ways to get rid of ants naturally
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Seal entry points around windows and doors using caulk or weatherstripping.
2)  Remove standing water by emptying and scrubbing out containers like flower pots and birdbaths.
3)  Use baking soda mixed with water as a spray to deter ants; apply directly to ant trails.
4)  Place coffee grounds or diatomaceous earth in areas where ants are active; these materials can dehydrate ants.
5)  Plant mint, lavender, or citronella plants near your home; their strong scents can repel ants naturally.
6)  Create a vinegar solution by mixing equal parts white vinegar and water; use this to clean surfaces where ants have been seen.
