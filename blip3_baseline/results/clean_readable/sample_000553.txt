Task: Potted Fig Tree Care: Water Sunlight Fertilizer Pot Size & MORE
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Choose a pot at least twice as wide as the fig tree's root ball to ensure ample space for growth.
2) Place the pot in a spot that receives bright, indirect sunlight for at least six hours daily.
3) Water the potted fig tree when the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch, using room temperature water.
4) Use well-draining potting soil mixed with compost to provide necessary nutrients and prevent waterlogging.
5) Apply a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer every four weeks during the growing season (spring and summer).
6) Keep the humidity around the fig tree high by misting leaves or placing a tray of water near the pot.
7) Prune the fig tree regularly to encourage bushy growth and remove any dead or yellowing leaves.
8) Rotate the pot periodically to ensure even growth on all sides of the fig tree.
9) Monitor for pests and diseases, treating them promptly with appropriate organic methods if necessary.
10) During winter months, reduce watering frequency to once every two weeks and move the pot to a cooler area indoors if possible.
