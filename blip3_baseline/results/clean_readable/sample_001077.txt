Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Provide a warm, draft-free environment at around 90 degrees Fahrenheit during the first few days.
2) Ensure chicks have access to clean water and starter feed specifically formulated for young chickens.
3) Maintain a hygienic environment by regularly cleaning and disinfecting all equipment and surroundings.
4) Keep chicks away from drafts, extreme temperatures, and loud noises to prevent stress.
5) Monitor chicks closely for signs of illness or distress, such as lethargy or difficulty breathing.
6) Gradually introduce chicks to cooler temperatures over the next week to acclimate them to their new environment.
7) Provide soft bedding like straw or wood shavings to absorb moisture and provide comfort.
