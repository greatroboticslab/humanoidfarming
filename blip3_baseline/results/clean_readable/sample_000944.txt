Task: How to Feed Your Worm Farm | Smash it Down & Add Some Browns!
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Begin by gathering your worm farm materials including bedding, worms, and food scraps.
2) Choose fresh, non-spoiled fruits and vegetables as primary food sources for your worms.
3) Chop larger food items into small pieces to make them easier for worms to digest.
4) Avoid feeding meat or dairy products as they can attract pests and produce unpleasant odors.
5) Alternate between green (food scraps) and brown (dry leaves, shredded paper) materials for a balanced diet.
6) Place food scraps in the center of the bedding, away from the worms' burrows.
7) Cover the food scraps with a layer of brown materials to help retain moisture and prevent odors.
8) Regularly check the moisture level of the bedding; it should feel like a damp sponge.
9) If the bedding becomes too dry, mist it lightly with water without making it soggy.
10) Rotate the worm farm every few weeks to ensure all areas receive equal amounts of food and oxygen.
11) Harvest mature worms by separating them from the bedding and discarding the waste material.
12) Replace the old bedding with fresh materials to start a new cycle.
