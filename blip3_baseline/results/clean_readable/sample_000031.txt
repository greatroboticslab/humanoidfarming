Task: From farm to table: Hog processing in action @UncleTimsFarm
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Uncle Tim's Farm begins the hog processing by stunning the pigs to ensure humane handling.
2) The stunned pigs are then bled to remove their blood for food safety.
3) Next, the carcasses undergo evisceration to remove internal organs.
4) The pigs' skin is removed, and the meat is cut into various cuts.
5) Processed meat products are packaged and stored for distribution.
6) Finally, processed meats are transported to local grocery stores or sold directly at the farm.
