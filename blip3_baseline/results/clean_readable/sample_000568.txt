Task: 8 Tips For Dry Climate Gardening Without Irrigation (Dust Mulch Wide Spacing Hugelpaths Etc.)
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Choose drought-resistant plants suitable for your climate.
2) Apply a thin layer of organic mulch around plants to retain moisture.
3) Space plants widely to allow better air circulation and reduce water loss.
4) Use hugelkultur beds by stacking rotting logs and adding compost.
5) Water deeply but infrequently to encourage deep root growth.
6) Incorporate greywater or rainwater harvesting systems for supplemental watering.
7) Employ mulching techniques like straw bale gardening for additional moisture retention.
8) Consider using reflective materials on paths to minimize evaporation from hot surfaces.
