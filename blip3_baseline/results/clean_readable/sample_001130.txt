Task: How Irrigation Systems Can Increase Malaria Risk
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Irrigation systems can increase water availability in areas previously dry.
2) Increased water availability supports mosquito breeding habitats.
3) Mosquitoes breed faster in irrigated areas, leading to higher populations.
4) Higher mosquito populations expose more people to malaria transmission.
5) People in these areas may have less access to protective measures like bed nets.
6) Thus, increased irrigation leads to a higher risk of malaria infection.
