Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Identify suitable materials for composting on-farm including organic waste from crops and livestock.
2) Choose an appropriate location that is easily accessible and has good drainage.
3) Prepare a compost bin or pile using layers of green and brown materials in alternating fashion.
4) Maintain moisture levels to ensure aerobic conditions for decomposition.
5) Turn the compost regularly to aerate and speed up the decomposition process.
6) Monitor temperature within the compost pile to ensure it stays between 130°F and 160°F for optimal activity.
7) Add nitrogen-rich materials like manure or grass clippings when necessary.
8) Cover the compost pile to retain heat and moisture during cooler weather.
9) Harvest finished compost after several months, checking its consistency and nutrient content.
10) Use compost as a soil amendment to improve fertility and structure.
