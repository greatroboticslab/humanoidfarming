Task: HOW TO GROW YOUR OWN ORGANIC VEGETABLES AND HERBS AT HOME PART 1
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Choose a suitable location for your garden that receives at least six hours of sunlight daily.
2)  Select an appropriate container or garden bed based on available space and soil quality.
3)  Prepare the soil by testing its pH level and adding organic matter like compost or well-rotted manure.
4)  Decide which vegetables and herbs you want to grow based on climate suitability and personal preferences.
5)  Start seeds indoors four to six weeks before the last expected frost date if growing in colder climates.
6)  Harden off seedlings gradually by moving them outside during the day to acclimate them to outdoor conditions.
7)  Plant seeds or seedlings according to the recommended spacing and depth for each vegetable or herb.
8)  Water plants regularly, ensuring they receive about one inch of water per week through rainfall or irrigation.
9)  Mulch around plants to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.
10)  Monitor for pests and diseases, using natural methods such as handpicking, insecticidal soaps, or neem oil when necessary.
11)  Harvest vegetables and herbs when they reach maturity for the best flavor and yield.
12)  Rotate crops annually to prevent depletion of nutrients and reduce pest and disease buildup.
