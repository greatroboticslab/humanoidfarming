Task: How to Weld an Impossible Triangle (Tribar)? | Is It possible?
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  First, gather all necessary materials including steel rods, welding equipment, and safety gear.
2)  Ensure the steel rods are of equal length for creating an equilateral triangle.
3)  Lay out the three steel rods parallel to each other to form the base of the impossible triangle.
4)  Connect the ends of two rods with a weld to create one side of the triangle.
5)  Position the third rod perpendicular to the first two, ensuring it is centered between them.
6)  Weld the third rod to both sides of the triangle to secure its position.
7)  Carefully inspect the structure for any gaps or misalignments before applying additional welds.
8)  Continue welding the remaining connections to complete the impossible triangle shape.
9)  Allow the welds to cool completely before handling the structure to ensure stability.
10)  Test the strength of the impossible triangle by applying pressure or weight to confirm its integrity.
