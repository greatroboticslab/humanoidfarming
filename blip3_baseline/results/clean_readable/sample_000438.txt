Task: Milking Our Goat For the First Time (Nigerian Dwarf Goats)
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Choose a calm morning for milking to avoid stress on both goat and handler.
2)  Gather all necessary supplies including clean containers for milk, towels, and a milking stand.
3)  Gently approach the goat and offer her a treat to encourage her to come willingly.
4)  Place the milking stand in a quiet area away from distractions.
5)  Use a soft voice and gentle touch to reassure the goat during the process.
6)  Hold the goat's hind legs gently while supporting her body weight.
7)  Insert the milking equipment slowly and carefully into the teat.
8)  Pull the equipment steadily to extract the milk without jerking or pulling too hard.
9)  Clean the equipment immediately after use to prevent bacterial growth.
10)  Offer the goat a small amount of fresh water or grain as a reward for her cooperation.
11)  Dispose of the used equipment properly in a designated waste container.
12)  Record the amount of milk produced and any observations about the goat's behavior.
