Task: Secrets to Fertilizing and Weeding Corn for Lush Big Ears
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Start by preparing the soil in your corn garden, ensuring it is well-draining and rich in organic matter.
2) Plant corn seeds about 2 inches deep and 3-4 feet apart in rows spaced 6-8 feet apart.
3) Water the corn regularly, keeping the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged.
4) Apply a balanced fertilizer every 4-6 weeks during the growing season, following package instructions.
5) Monitor the corn plants weekly for weeds, pulling them by hand as soon as they appear.
6) Mulch around the corn plants to suppress weed growth and retain moisture in the soil.
7) Support tall corn stalks with stakes or corn cages to prevent lodging and ensure proper pollination.
8) Harvest corn when the kernels are plump and the silks have dried, usually 100-120 days after planting.
