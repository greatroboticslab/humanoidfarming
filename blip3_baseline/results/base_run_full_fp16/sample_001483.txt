Task: Continuous Grazing VS Rotational Grazing
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Emphasize precision, sustainability, and error checks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Define continuous grazing as livestock being allowed to graze on the same pasture continuously without rest periods.
2)  Define rotational grazing as dividing pastures into smaller sections and moving livestock between them in a planned schedule.
3)  Assess the environmental impact of continuous grazing through soil erosion and nutrient depletion.
4)  Evaluate the environmental impact of rotational grazing for reduced soil erosion and improved nutrient cycling.
5)  Calculate the economic benefits of continuous grazing including lower labor costs but higher feed expenses.
6)  Estimate the economic benefits of rotational grazing with potential savings from reduced feed costs and increased animal health.
7)  Implement continuous grazing by regularly monitoring pasture health and adjusting livestock numbers accordingly.
8)  Implement rotational grazing by creating a grazing plan that includes rest periods and rotation intervals.
9)  Monitor both systems for at least one growing season to observe differences in pasture health and livestock performance.
10)  Analyze data collected from both systems to determine which method is more sustainable based on environmental and economic outcomes.
11)  Adjust management practices if necessary to optimize the chosen system for long-term sustainability.
12)  Document findings and share insights to contribute to the broader understanding of sustainable livestock farming practices.
