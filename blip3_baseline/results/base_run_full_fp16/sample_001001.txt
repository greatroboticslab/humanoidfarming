Task: Troubleshooting Valve Issues Using The Armada Pro50
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Identify the specific valve issue to troubleshoot, such as leaks or malfunction.
2)  Check the manual for the Armada Pro50 system to locate the relevant valve model.
3)  Ensure all necessary tools and parts are available before starting work.
4)  Turn off the power supply to the system and isolate the affected area.
5)  Open the valve's access panel and visually inspect for any visible damage or debris.
6)  Use a multimeter to test for continuity across the valve's electrical connections.
7)  If the valve is electrically operated, check the power supply voltage and wiring connections.
8)  For pneumatic valves, verify the air pressure and check for any blockages in the air lines.
9)  If the valve still does not operate correctly after these checks, consult the troubleshooting guide provided with the Armada Pro50 system.
10)  If the problem persists, consider contacting the manufacturer's customer support for further assistance.
11)  Document all findings and actions taken during the troubleshooting process for future reference.
