Task: Intelligent Agricultural Irrigation System
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Assess soil moisture levels using a sensor to determine when irrigation is needed.
2) Set up a weather station to monitor temperature and humidity for optimal watering times.
3) Install a smart pump controlled by an IoT device to regulate water flow accurately.
4) Connect all devices via a reliable network to ensure data transmission between sensors and controller.
5) Program the system to adjust watering schedules based on seasonal changes and local climate data.
6) Use a calibrated sprinkler system to deliver precise amounts of water in measured liters per minute.
7) Implement backup power sources like solar panels or batteries to maintain operation during power outages.
8) Regularly calibrate sensors and check equipment for leaks to prevent water wastage and ensure safety.
9) Train farmers on how to interpret system alerts and troubleshoot common issues independently.
10) Schedule regular maintenance checks to keep the irrigation system running efficiently and safely.
