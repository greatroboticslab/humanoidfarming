Task: Small-Scale Irrigation Innovation Lab
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Identify key challenges in small-scale irrigation systems through surveys and interviews.
2)  Conduct preliminary research on existing technologies and innovations.
3)  Formulate a hypothesis for potential solutions based on identified challenges.
4)  Design prototypes of innovative irrigation systems using available materials.
5)  Test prototypes under controlled conditions to assess efficiency and durability.
6)  Gather feedback from farmers and stakeholders on prototype performance.
7)  Refine designs based on feedback received from testing and stakeholder meetings.
8)  Develop detailed specifications for production of final prototypes.
9)  Secure funding or resources needed for mass production of prototypes.
10)  Collaborate with local manufacturers to produce final prototypes.
11)  Implement pilot projects in selected areas to evaluate system effectiveness.
12)  Collect data on water usage, crop yields, and farmer satisfaction.
13)  Analyze collected data to determine the impact of the new irrigation systems.
14)  Share findings and best practices with other communities facing similar challenges.
15)  Document lessons learned and improvements for future iterations of the project.
