Task: Smart Irrigation Systems: Boosting Yields While Saving Water!
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Conduct a site survey to determine soil type, climate conditions, and plant species.
2)  Install moisture sensors in key areas of the garden or farm.
3)  Connect sensors to an irrigation controller for automated watering schedules.
4)  Program the irrigation system based on weather forecasts and sensor data.
5)  Set up a smart app or web portal for remote monitoring and adjustments.
6)  Implement rain sensors to prevent unnecessary watering during rainfall.
7)  Use drip irrigation or soaker hoses to minimize water loss through evaporation.
8)  Monitor system performance regularly and adjust settings as needed.
9)  Educate users about optimal watering times and amounts for different plants.
10)  Backup all irrigation system data weekly to avoid loss in case of equipment failure.
11)  Have a manual override option available for emergencies or unforeseen circumstances.
12)  Schedule routine maintenance checks on the irrigation system every six months.
