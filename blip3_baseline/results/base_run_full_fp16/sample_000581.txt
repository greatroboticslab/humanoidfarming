Task: THE 'Why' behind Rotational Grazing
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Assess the land's slope and soil type to determine suitable rotational grazing patterns.
2) Measure the pasture area in hectares or acres for accurate planning.
3) Use GPS technology to map the pasture boundaries precisely.
4) Select livestock based on their weight capacity to avoid overgrazing.
5) Install temporary fencing to create paddocks of manageable sizes.
6) Calculate the rotation frequency based on grass growth rate and animal needs.
7) Train livestock handlers on proper use of rotational grazing techniques.
8) Monitor pastures regularly to assess health and adjust management as needed.
9) Maintain adequate water sources and mineral supplements for livestock.
10) Keep detailed records of grazing rotations and animal health for future reference.
