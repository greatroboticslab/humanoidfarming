Task: Growing hot peppers in pots
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Choose a sunny spot for your pot; hot peppers need at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily.
2) Select a pot with drainage holes to prevent waterlogging.
3) Use well-draining soil mix suitable for vegetables, ensuring adequate nutrients.
4) Plant one pepper seedling per pot, spacing them about 12 inches apart.
5) Water the plants thoroughly after planting, keeping the soil consistently moist but not soggy.
6) Apply a balanced liquid fertilizer every two weeks to promote healthy growth.
7) Monitor for pests regularly, using organic methods if possible.
8) Prune the plant to encourage bushier growth and remove any yellow leaves promptly.
9) Harvest peppers when they reach full color and size, which typically takes about 70-80 days from planting.
10) Rotate your pots seasonally to maintain optimal growing conditions and reduce disease spread.
