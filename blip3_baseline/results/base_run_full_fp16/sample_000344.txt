Task: Hydroponic Farming Without Electricity: Best Passive Systems
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Research passive hydroponic systems that do not require electricity.
2)  Select a system based on local climate and plant types.
3)  Design a system using natural light and gravity for nutrient delivery.
4)  Implement a rainwater collection system for water supply.
5)  Construct a simple, open-topped grow bed for plants to access sunlight.
6)  Use a wicking bed design for efficient water transport without pumps.
7)  Integrate a passive solar greenhouse for temperature regulation.
8)  Create a vertical garden structure using stacked tiers for space efficiency.
9)  Apply mulch and compost to retain moisture and nutrients in soil.
10)  Monitor plant growth and adjust system components as needed.
11)  Ensure proper ventilation to prevent overheating and maintain air quality.
12)  Regularly check for pests and diseases without relying on electrical equipment.
