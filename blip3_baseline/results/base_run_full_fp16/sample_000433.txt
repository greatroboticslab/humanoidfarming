Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Identify local climate and soil conditions for optimal forage growth.
2)  Research recommended spring forage mix components based on local conditions.
3)  Consult with agricultural experts or extension services for tailored advice.
4)  Choose grasses like tall fescue, orchardgrass, or bluegrass for resilience.
5)  Select legumes such as clover or alfalfa for nitrogen fixation and protein content.
6)  Incorporate brassicas like radish or turnip for their high protein levels.
7)  Add clover varieties for early spring growth and nitrogen supply.
8)  Ensure adequate diversity in the mix for balanced nutrition and pest control.
9)  Consider including annuals like buckwheat or cowpeas for quick cover and nitrogen.
10)  Evaluate moisture retention and drainage needs of the planting area.
11)  Plan for rotation with other crops to maintain soil health and fertility.
12)  Prepare the soil by tilling or incorporating organic matter before planting.
13)  Apply fertilizer according to soil test results and specific plant requirements.
14)  Plant at the appropriate time based on local frost dates and weather forecasts.
15)  Monitor for pests and diseases regularly throughout the growing season.
16)  Adjust the mix if necessary based on plant performance and environmental changes.
17)  Harvest forage when it reaches maturity but before it becomes too tough or fibrous.
18)  Store harvested forage properly to prevent spoilage and maintain quality.
