Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Farmers in the Sundarbans use raised beds to protect their crops from rising sea levels.
2) They implement rainwater harvesting systems to conserve water during dry seasons.
3) Crop diversification includes salt-tolerant varieties like rice and vegetables.
4) Mulching practices help retain soil moisture and reduce evaporation.
5) Crop rotation is used to maintain soil fertility without depleting nutrients.
6) Farmers employ organic manure for soil improvement and pest control.
7) Use of drought-resistant seeds ensures survival during extreme weather conditions.
8) Installation of solar-powered irrigation systems reduces reliance on fossil fuels.
9) Implementation of early warning systems for cyclones helps in timely crop protection.
