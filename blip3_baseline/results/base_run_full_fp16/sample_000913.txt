Task: Stop doing these 3 things to be a better worm farmer
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Provide numbered subtasks with concise justifications.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Stop overfeeding your worms, as this can lead to a buildup of uneaten food and potentially harmful bacteria in the compost bin.
2) Avoid introducing too many different types of organic waste at once, as this may confuse the worms and affect their feeding habits and overall health.
3) Cease exposing your worm farm to extreme temperatures or direct sunlight, as these conditions can stress the worms and reduce their efficiency in breaking down organic matter.
