Task: Refilling Grain Drill with Pasture Mix/Oats/Red Clover to Reseed Old Pasture
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Emphasize precision, sustainability, and error checks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Assess soil fertility and moisture levels before refilling.
2)  Choose pasture mix, oats, or red clover based on local climate and soil conditions.
3)  Calculate the required amount of seeds based on previous pasture coverage.
4)  Prepare drill for planting by checking all parts for functionality.
5)  Ensure proper seed depth and row spacing as per recommended guidelines.
6)  Apply herbicides if necessary to control weeds and pests.
7)  Mark field boundaries and set up equipment for even distribution of seeds.
8)  Start drilling at one corner of the field, ensuring uniform seed placement.
9)  Monitor drilling progress and adjust speed as needed to avoid over-seeding.
10)  After drilling, cover seeds with a light layer of soil to protect them from drying out.
11)  Water the newly planted area immediately after drilling to aid seed germination.
12)  Implement rotational grazing practices to promote healthy growth of new plants.
13)  Monitor plant health regularly and remove any dead or diseased plants promptly.
14)  Adjust fertilization and irrigation schedules according to plant growth needs.
15)  Harvest the pasture once it reaches maturity, ensuring sustainable use of resources.
