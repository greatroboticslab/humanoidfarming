Task: Transforming Chicken Manure into Fertilizer: The 5-Step Magic
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Collect chicken manure from the farm in clean containers.
2)  Rinse the manure thoroughly to remove any remaining food particles or dirt.
3)  Spread the manure evenly over a large area outdoors to allow for air circulation.
4)  Cover the spread manure with a thin layer of straw or hay to retain moisture and prevent odors.
5)  Allow the manure to sit for at least two weeks under controlled conditions.
6)  After two weeks, test the manure's pH level using a soil testing kit.
7)  Adjust the pH if necessary by adding lime or sulfur, following the instructions on the product packaging.
8)  Mix the adjusted manure thoroughly with compost or other organic materials.
9)  Store the mixed manure in a dry, well-ventilated area until ready for use.
10)  Before applying to plants, perform a small-scale trial to ensure no adverse reactions occur.
