Task: Crop Rotation in Farming
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Assess soil health and nutrient levels before planning crop rotation.
2) Identify suitable crops for the upcoming seasons based on local climate and market demand.
3) Determine the rotation pattern ensuring adequate time between similar crops to prevent disease buildup.
4) Measure fields accurately using GPS or measuring tapes for precise boundaries.
5) Use appropriate tools like tillers, planters, and cultivators for efficient planting and maintenance.
6) Plan irrigation systems to ensure water distribution is consistent across all sections of the field.
7) Prepare seed beds by removing weeds and adjusting soil pH as needed for optimal growth conditions.
8) Implement pest management strategies including natural predators and organic pesticides to protect crops.
9) Monitor crop progress regularly to detect any signs of stress or infestation early.
10) Harvest crops at the right time to maximize yield and quality, following recommended guidelines.
