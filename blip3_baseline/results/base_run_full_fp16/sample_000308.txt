Task: Starting Sweet Corn seeds indoors
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Choose a suitable container for starting sweet corn seeds, ensuring it has drainage holes at the bottom.
2)  Fill the containers with a seed-starting mix, leaving about an inch of space at the top.
3)  Moisten the soil lightly without making it soggy to prevent fungal diseases.
4)  Plant one sweet corn seed per container, covering it with a thin layer of soil.
5)  Place the containers in a warm location, ideally around 70째F (21째C), where they will receive plenty of light.
6)  Use grow lights if natural light is insufficient, positioning them about 3-4 inches above the plants.
7)  Monitor the temperature; if it drops below 60째F (15째C), consider using a heating mat under the containers.
8)  Once sprouts appear, gradually increase light exposure to mimic outdoor conditions.
9)  As the seedlings grow, thin out weaker plants, leaving only the strongest one per container.
10)  When all danger of frost has passed, transplant the seedlings outdoors, spacing them about 18-24 inches apart.
11)  Water the transplants deeply but infrequently to encourage strong root growth.
12)  Keep the soil consistently moist until the plants establish themselves in their new environment.
