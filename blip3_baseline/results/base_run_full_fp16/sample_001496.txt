Task: Peony Planting Tips
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Choose a sunny spot with well-draining soil for planting peonies.
2) Measure out at least 3 feet between each plant to ensure growth space.
3) Use a spade or fork to dig holes about 18 inches deep and 18 inches wide.
4) Mix in compost or well-rotted manure to improve soil fertility.
5) Place peony tubers horizontally in the hole with the buds facing up.
6) Cover with soil, gently pressing down to remove air pockets.
7) Water thoroughly after planting to settle the soil around the roots.
8) Apply a layer of mulch over the soil to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
9) Keep newly planted peonies well-watered during their first growing season.
10) Prune dead flowers to encourage more blooms and prevent disease.
