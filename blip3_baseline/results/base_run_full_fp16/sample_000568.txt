Task: 8 Tips For Dry Climate Gardening Without Irrigation (Dust Mulch Wide Spacing Hugelpaths Etc.)
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Emphasize precision, sustainability, and error checks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Start by selecting drought-resistant plants suitable for your climate zone.
2)  Implement mulching techniques to retain soil moisture and suppress weeds.
3)  Apply a layer of organic material like straw or wood chips over the soil surface.
4)  Ensure mulch is at least 2 inches thick to provide effective moisture retention.
5)  Space plants widely to allow air circulation and reduce water evaporation.
6)  Use hugelkultur methods by building raised beds filled with decomposing logs and leaves.
7)  Incorporate deep-rooted plants that can access water from deeper soil layers.
8)  Regularly check for signs of pests and diseases to prevent them from depleting plant resources.
