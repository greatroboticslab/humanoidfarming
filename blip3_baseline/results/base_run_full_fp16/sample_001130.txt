Task: How Irrigation Systems Can Increase Malaria Risk
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Identify areas where irrigation systems are implemented near or within breeding grounds of mosquitoes.
2) Measure mosquito population density in these areas before and after irrigation system installation.
3) Calculate water volume used for irrigation in liters per day to assess potential mosquito breeding sites.
4) Monitor water temperature changes due to irrigation, as higher temperatures can increase mosquito reproduction rates.
5) Assess the distance between irrigation channels and human dwellings to determine risk exposure.
6) Evaluate the type of vegetation around irrigation areas to identify suitable mosquito breeding habitats.
7) Use traps and tests to measure mosquito bites per person per night in both irrigated and non-irrigated areas.
8) Collect data on rainfall patterns to correlate with mosquito activity levels in irrigated regions.
9) Analyze the chemical composition of irrigation water to detect any nutrients that might attract mosquitoes.
10) Document the frequency and duration of irrigation activities to understand their impact on local mosquito populations.
