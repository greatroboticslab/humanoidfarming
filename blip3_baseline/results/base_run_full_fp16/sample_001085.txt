Task: Manufacturing of Biochar
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Assess the type of biomass to be used for biochar production considering its moisture content and carbon content.
2)  Preheat the kiln or reactor to the appropriate temperature range suitable for the chosen biomass type.
3)  Load the biomass into the kiln or reactor ensuring proper distribution for even heating.
4)  Monitor the temperature inside the kiln or reactor using thermocouples placed at strategic points.
5)  Maintain the temperature within the specified range to ensure efficient pyrolysis without overheating.
6)  Control the airflow through the kiln or reactor to manage the rate of gasification and prevent excessive smoke formation.
7)  Collect the biochar from the cooler sections of the kiln or reactor after the desired processing time has elapsed.
8)  Cool down the kiln or reactor gradually to prevent thermal shock to the biochar product.
9)  Measure the yield of biochar produced in kilograms or tons based on the initial biomass input.
10)  Ensure all equipment is cleaned thoroughly before storing or transporting the biochar product.
11)  Store the biochar in a dry, well-ventilated area away from sources of ignition to prevent spontaneous combustion.
12)  Label the storage containers with the date of production and any relevant safety information.
