Task: EXPLAINING HYDRAULIC MULTIPLIERS 3RD FUNCTIONS & DIVERTERS
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Identify the specific hydraulic multiplier model to understand its third function and diverter components.
2)  Research online or consult the user manual for detailed information about the third function and diversers.
3)  Ensure all tools needed for installation or adjustment are readily available, including wrenches, screwdrivers, and possibly a torque wrench.
4)  Measure distances and angles accurately using a tape measure and protractor for precise setup of the hydraulic system.
5)  Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), such as gloves and safety glasses, to prevent injury during installation.
6)  Follow safety guidelines provided by the manufacturer regarding power supply and electrical connections to avoid electric shocks.
7)  Use the correct hydraulic fluid as specified in the user manual to ensure proper operation and longevity of the hydraulic components.
8)  Test the hydraulic multiplier under low load conditions initially to check for any leaks or malfunctions before full operation.
9)  Regularly inspect the hydraulic system for wear and tear, especially around the third function and diversers, to maintain optimal performance.
10)  Keep documentation of all maintenance activities and inspections for future reference and compliance with safety regulations.
