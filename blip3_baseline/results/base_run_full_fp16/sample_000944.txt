Task: How to Feed Your Worm Farm | Smash it Down & Add Some Browns!
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Provide numbered subtasks with concise justifications.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Choose a suitable worm farm container that is easy to manage and has adequate drainage holes for excess moisture.
2) Fill the bottom of the container with about one-third of the total volume with shredded newspaper or cardboard strips, ensuring they are moist but not soaking wet.
3) Add a layer of dried leaves, twigs, or straw on top of the newspaper to create a brown material layer, which helps in maintaining proper carbon-to-nitrogen ratio.
4) Mix in a handful of composted kitchen scraps or food waste evenly throughout the layers, starting from the bottom.
5) Repeat the process of adding newspaper, brown materials, and food scraps until the container is approximately two-thirds full.
6) Leave the worm farm undisturbed for a few days to allow the worms to settle in and start feeding.
7) Once settled, add more food scraps as needed, covering them with a thin layer of brown materials to keep them contained and prevent odors.
8) Maintain a consistent temperature between 60째F and 77째F (15째C and 25째C) for optimal worm activity.
9) Regularly check the moisture level of the bedding; it should feel like a damp sponge when squeezed gently.
10) Harvest the castings (worm poop) and use them as fertilizer when the container becomes too full or the worms are visibly overcrowded.
