Task: Optimizing Agricultural Practices: Balancing Manure Use and Minimizing Compaction
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Assess current manure application rates to identify overuse areas.
2)  Implement soil testing to determine nutrient levels before applying manure.
3)  Schedule manure applications during dry weather to reduce runoff.
4)  Use precision agriculture tools for targeted manure application.
5)  Establish buffer zones between fields and water sources.
6)  Rotate livestock grazing patterns to avoid compacted soil areas.
7)  Install cover crops to improve soil structure and prevent compaction.
8)  Monitor crop growth and health for signs of nutrient deficiencies or excess.
9)  Adjust manure application rates based on soil test results and crop needs.
10)  Conduct regular soil compaction assessments using geophysical methods.
11)  Apply lime or gypsum to improve soil structure and reduce compaction risk.
12)  Educate farmers on best practices for both manure use and soil conservation.
