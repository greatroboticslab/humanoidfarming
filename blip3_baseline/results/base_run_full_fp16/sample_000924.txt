Task: The application of precision agricultural techniques to archaeological survey
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Provide numbered subtasks with concise justifications.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Identify specific archaeological sites requiring detailed survey using traditional methods.
2) Collect initial data on soil composition, vegetation, and topography for each site.
3) Apply remote sensing technology like drones equipped with multispectral cameras for aerial surveys.
4) Use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to analyze collected data and create digital elevation models.
5) Employ Geographic Information System (GIS) tools to overlay historical maps and satellite imagery.
6) Implement Geographic Information System (GIS) algorithms to predict optimal areas for further excavation based on soil fertility.
7) Integrate Geographic Information System (GIS) with Global Positioning System (GPS) for precise location tracking during fieldwork.
8) Utilize Geographic Information System (GIS) to map out potential artifact distribution patterns across surveyed areas.
9) Develop Geographic Information System (GIS) models to simulate crop growth cycles and their impact on archaeological findings.
10) Apply Geographic Information System (GIS) to prioritize areas for targeted archaeological digs based on predicted outcomes.
11) Use Geographic Information System (GIS) to monitor changes in land use over time and their effects on archaeological sites.
12) Share Geographic Information System (GIS) data with local communities and stakeholders for collaborative conservation efforts.
