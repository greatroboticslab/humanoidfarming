Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Gather materials including a plastic bottle, a small hole puncher or scissors, a drill or nail, and water source.
2) Punch a small hole near the bottom of the plastic bottle to create an outlet.
3) Drill or pierce a small hole in the side of the bottle about one-third of the way up from the bottom.
4) Insert a thin tube or string through the side hole to connect the bottle to the plant pot.
5) Place the plant pot under the bottle so that the tube is inserted into the soil.
6) Fill the bottle with water and secure it to the plant pot using tape or clips.
7) Monitor the plant's water needs and refill the bottle as necessary.
8) If the plant shows signs of overwatering, remove the bottle and adjust placement or frequency.
9) For better stability, bury the bottle partially in the soil around the plant pot.
10) In case of blockage, gently blow air into the tube to clear any debris.
