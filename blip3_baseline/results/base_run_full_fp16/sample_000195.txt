Task: Tips on Harvesting Baby Spinach in a Container
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Choose a container at least 10 inches deep to ensure baby spinach has enough space to grow.
2) Fill the container with a high-quality potting mix, ensuring it is moist but not waterlogged.
3) Sow baby spinach seeds evenly across the surface of the soil, spacing them about 1 inch apart.
4) Cover the seeds lightly with a thin layer of soil, maintaining a depth of approximately 1/4 inch.
5) Place the container in a location that receives partial shade or indirect sunlight for optimal growth.
6) Water the seeds gently but thoroughly, keeping the soil consistently moist without becoming waterlogged.
7) Monitor the soil moisture regularly, adjusting watering as needed based on temperature and humidity.
8) Once seedlings emerge, thin them out to about 2 inches apart to allow proper growth and air circulation.
9) Harvest baby spinach leaves when they reach a length of about 3-4 inches, cutting from the base to avoid damaging the plant.
10) Use clean scissors or your fingers to harvest, removing only the outer leaves to encourage new growth.
11) Replant any remaining baby spinach plants every 2-3 weeks to maintain a steady supply of fresh greens.
