Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Start by assessing the soil condition to determine if tilling is necessary.
2)  Rent or borrow appropriate farm equipment for tilling.
3)  Clear any weeds or debris from the field before tilling begins.
4)  Begin tilling the soil in sections, moving from one end of the field to the other.
5)  Adjust the depth of the tiller as needed based on crop type and soil quality.
6)  Check the tilled area for unevenness; use a rake to smooth out the surface.
7)  Water the tilled soil thoroughly to settle the soil and prepare for planting.
8)  If rain is expected, cover the tilled area with plastic sheeting to prevent erosion.
9)  Once the soil is ready, mark the rows where crops will be planted.
10)  Prepare the seedbed by removing stones and small clumps of soil.
11)  Apply fertilizer according to the specific needs of the crops to be planted.
12)  Plant seeds at the recommended depth and spacing, ensuring proper coverage of the soil.
13)  Cover the newly planted seeds with a thin layer of soil and water gently.
14)  Monitor the plants closely for signs of pests or disease, and take corrective action if necessary.
15)  Continue to maintain the farm, including watering, weeding, and monitoring plant health throughout the growing season.
