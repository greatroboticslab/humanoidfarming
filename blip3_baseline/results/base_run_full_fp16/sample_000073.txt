Task: Transplanting Tomatoes & Peppers and a Look at the Growing Area
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Assess the health of tomato and pepper seedlings for transplanting.
2)  Choose a day with mild weather to avoid transplant shock.
3)  Prepare the growing area by loosening soil and adding compost.
4)  Water the seedlings thoroughly before transplanting to prevent dehydration.
5)  Dig holes in the prepared soil, ensuring they are twice as wide as the root ball.
6)  Gently remove seedlings from their containers without disturbing roots.
7)  Place each seedling in its hole, making sure the top of the root ball is level with the soil surface.
8)  Fill the hole with soil, gently pressing down around the plant to secure it.
9)  Water the transplanted plants immediately after planting to settle the soil.
10)  Apply a layer of mulch around the base of the plants to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
11)  Monitor the plants for signs of stress or disease, adjusting care as necessary.
12)  Provide support structures like stakes or cages if needed for taller plants.
13)  Ensure adequate spacing between plants to allow for growth and air circulation.
14)  Regularly check for pests and diseases, applying appropriate treatments if needed.
15)  Maintain consistent watering practices based on the specific needs of tomatoes and peppers.
