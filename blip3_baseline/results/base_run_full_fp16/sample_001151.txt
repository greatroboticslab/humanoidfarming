Task: Time for ecofriendly and sustainable agriculture
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Identify local climate and soil conditions for optimal crop selection.
2) Plan crop rotation schedules to enhance soil health and reduce pests.
3) Implement integrated pest management strategies instead of chemical pesticides.
4) Use organic fertilizers like compost or manure to improve soil fertility naturally.
5) Install rainwater harvesting systems to conserve water and reduce runoff.
6) Utilize solar-powered irrigation systems to minimize energy consumption.
7) Introduce cover crops to prevent erosion and maintain soil structure.
8) Monitor crop yields regularly using digital scales in kilograms.
9) Measure water usage in liters per plant per day for efficient irrigation.
10) Employ biodegradable mulch films to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
11) Set up windbreaks made from native trees to protect crops from harsh winds.
12) Regularly test soil pH levels with a digital meter to ensure proper nutrient uptake.
