Task: CREC Steve Zwinger: Organic wheat/flax intercropping
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Emphasize precision, sustainability, and error checks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Identify suitable organic wheat and flax varieties for intercropping.
2)  Conduct soil tests to determine nutrient levels and pH balance.
3)  Plan crop rotation schedule avoiding monoculture practices.
4)  Design intercropping layout ensuring adequate sunlight and space distribution.
5)  Prepare fields by removing weeds and tillage to prepare soil structure.
6)  Plant wheat and flax seeds at optimal planting dates based on local climate.
7)  Monitor plant growth and health regularly for early detection of pests or diseases.
8)  Apply natural fertilizers and pest control methods sustainably.
9)  Harvest wheat and flax separately to avoid damaging each other's crops.
10)  Compost remaining plant materials for use as organic fertilizer in future cycles.
11)  Evaluate yield and quality data from the intercropping experiment.
12)  Adjust farming techniques based on results for improved efficiency and sustainability.
