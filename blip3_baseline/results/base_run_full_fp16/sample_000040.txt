Task: The Basics of Organic Growing Strawberries (in the Tropics)
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Emphasize precision, sustainability, and error checks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Choose disease-resistant strawberry varieties suitable for tropical climates.
2)  Prepare soil rich in organic matter, ensuring good drainage.
3)  Implement crop rotation to prevent soil-borne diseases.
4)  Use organic mulch to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
5)  Apply compost or well-rotted manure as a slow-release fertilizer.
6)  Water plants deeply but infrequently to encourage deep root growth.
7)  Maintain a consistent temperature between 60째F and 85째F (15째C to 30째C).
8)  Prune runners to focus energy on producing fruiting canes.
9)  Monitor for pests and diseases regularly using natural control methods.
10)  Harvest strawberries when they are fully ripe and show their characteristic color.
11)  Encourage pollination by planting bee-friendly flowers nearby.
12)  Practice regular soil testing to adjust pH and nutrient levels as needed.
13)  Compost plant residues and kitchen scraps to recycle nutrients back into the soil.
14)  Avoid using synthetic pesticides and herbicides to maintain organic integrity.
15)  Rotate strawberry beds every three years to reduce pest and disease buildup.
