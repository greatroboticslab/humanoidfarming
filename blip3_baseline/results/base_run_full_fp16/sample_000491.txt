------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Start by preparing the soil in early spring, ensuring it is loose and rich in organic matter.
2)  Plant corn seeds at a depth of about two inches, spacing them six to eight inches apart.
3)  Water the corn regularly, maintaining consistent moisture levels throughout the growing season.
4)  Apply a balanced fertilizer, such as a 10-10-10 mix, once every four weeks starting from planting.
5)  Mulch around the corn plants to retain soil moisture and suppress weeds.
6)  Monitor the corn closely for signs of pests or diseases, addressing issues promptly.
7)  Weed manually or use a hoe to remove weeds before they overshadow the corn plants.
8)  Harvest corn when the kernels are plump and the silks have dried, usually after 20 to 25 days from pollination.
9)  Rotate crops annually to prevent soil depletion and reduce pest infestations.
10)  Consider using natural methods like neem oil or diatomaceous earth for pest control if necessary.
