Task: Permaculture Water Retention Techniques on the Farm pays off big in a drought.
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Identify areas on the farm that naturally retain water, such as low-lying spots or floodplains.
2)  Install rainwater harvesting systems to collect and store rainwater for later use.
3)  Construct swales along contour lines to slow down water flow and allow it to infiltrate the soil.
4)  Plant deep-rooted perennials and trees to help stabilize soil and increase water retention.
5)  Create living mulches using cover crops to reduce evaporation and improve soil moisture.
6)  Introduce hugelkultur mounds made from rotting wood and leaves to enhance soil structure and water storage.
7)  Implement composting toilets to recycle human waste as nutrient-rich fertilizer.
8)  Establish a pond or wetland area to provide habitat for wildlife while retaining excess water.
9)  Monitor soil moisture levels regularly to adjust watering schedules based on weather conditions.
10)  Evaluate the effectiveness of these techniques annually to ensure they continue to pay off during droughts.
