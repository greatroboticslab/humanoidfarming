Task: Frosty Pigs - How do they Stay Warm in Cold Weather
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Provide numbered subtasks with concise justifications.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Frosty pigs have thick fur coats to insulate their bodies from cold temperatures.
2) They huddle together for warmth, sharing body heat among group members.
3) Their small size helps conserve body heat more efficiently than larger animals.
4) Frosty pigs have short legs that reduce surface area exposed to cold winds.
5) They dig burrows or find sheltered areas to stay warm during harsh weather.
6) Their metabolic rate slows down slightly in colder conditions to conserve energy.
7) Frosty pigs can also increase their body temperature through shivering when necessary.
