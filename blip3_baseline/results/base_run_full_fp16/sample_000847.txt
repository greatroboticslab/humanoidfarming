Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Emphasize precision, sustainability, and error checks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Assess the condition of the grass to determine if raking is necessary.
2)  Choose the appropriate rake for the job based on the size of the field.
3)  Start at one corner of the field and work methodically towards the opposite corner.
4)  Ensure the grass is evenly distributed across the field before moving to the next area.
5)  Check for any clumps or uneven areas that need additional raking.
6)  Use a broom or brush to remove any debris from the raked grass.
7)  Verify that the grass is free of rocks, sticks, and other obstacles.
8)  Confirm that the raked grass is ready for the baler by checking its consistency and density.
9)  Perform a final walk-through to ensure all areas have been properly raked.
10)  Implement sustainable practices such as using a rake with a long handle to reduce soil compaction.
