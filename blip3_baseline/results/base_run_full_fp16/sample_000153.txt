Task: Alternate wetting and drying (AWD)--using less water to grow rice
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Assess soil moisture content using a soil moisture meter before each irrigation cycle.
2)  Measure water volume with a calibrated measuring cup or bucket.
3)  Use a flow meter to control water flow rate during irrigation.
4)  Set up a drip irrigation system for precise water distribution.
5)  Install sensors to monitor temperature and humidity in the growing area.
6)  Implement a rain gauge to measure rainfall accurately.
7)  Calculate water usage based on crop needs and local climate conditions.
8)  Train farmers on proper AWD techniques to ensure consistent results.
9)  Store water in tanks or reservoirs to maintain supply between irrigation cycles.
10)  Regularly inspect irrigation equipment for leaks and malfunctions.
