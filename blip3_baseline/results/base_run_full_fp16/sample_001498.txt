Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Assess the soil's moisture level before spraying to avoid over-saturating it.
2)  Choose the appropriate spray equipment based on the size of your garden.
3)  Fill the spray tank with water according to the manufacturer's instructions.
4)  Add the recommended amount of fertilizer or compost to the water for optimal results.
5)  Test the pressure of the sprayer to ensure it is neither too weak nor too strong.
6)  Begin spraying from the center of the garden moving outward in a circular pattern.
7)  Adjust the nozzle setting as needed to cover all areas evenly without wasting water.
8)  Monitor the soil's condition after spraying to ensure it has been adequately hydrated.
9)  If necessary, reapply the spray during dry periods or if the soil shows signs of dehydration.
10)  Clean the spray equipment thoroughly after use to prevent clogging and maintain its longevity.
