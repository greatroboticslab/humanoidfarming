Task: How do vaccines work?
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Emphasize precision, sustainability, and error checks.
------------------------------------------------------------
Vaccines introduce components of a pathogen to stimulate an immune response without causing the disease.
The first step is identifying the specific pathogen or component of the pathogen that will be used in the vaccine.
Next, the chosen pathogen or its components are processed to ensure they are safe for use but still capable of stimulating an immune response.
Then, the processed pathogen or component is administered to the individual through various delivery methods such as injection, oral intake, or inhalation.
After administration, the immune system recognizes the introduced pathogen or component and begins to produce antibodies specific to that pathogen.
Following this, the immune system also forms memory cells that can quickly respond if the actual pathogen enters the body in the future.
Finally, if the actual pathogen enters the body later, the immune system's memory cells recognize it and mount a rapid and effective defense against the infection.
