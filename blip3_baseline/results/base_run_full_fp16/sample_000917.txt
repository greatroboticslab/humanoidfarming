3)  Using a harvesting basket or net, they gently pluck the ripe fruits from the vines.
4)  The harvested eggplants are sorted by size and quality before being placed in crates.
5)  Workers then transport the crates to the packing area for further processing.
6)  In greenhouses, temperature control is maintained to ensure optimal growth conditions.
7)  Regular monitoring of soil moisture levels ensures proper hydration for the plants.
8)  Automated irrigation systems are used to water the plants efficiently.
9)  Farmers apply organic fertilizers to maintain healthy plant growth throughout the season.
10)  Once all eggplants are harvested, the greenhouse is prepared for the next planting cycle.
