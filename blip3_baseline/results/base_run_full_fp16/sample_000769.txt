Task: Corn Harvesting - Top Technology in Agriculture
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Identify suitable corn varieties for harvesting through advanced genetic modification techniques.
2)  Deploy drones equipped with high-resolution cameras to map fields for precise planting and monitoring.
3)  Utilize satellite imagery to track weather patterns and soil conditions affecting crop health.
4)  Implement IoT sensors in the field to monitor soil moisture, temperature, and nutrient levels in real-time.
5)  Use AI algorithms to analyze sensor data and predict optimal times for planting, fertilizing, and harvesting.
6)  Integrate automated tractors with GPS guidance systems for efficient and precise tillage and planting operations.
7)  Develop autonomous combine harvesters capable of recognizing different types of corn kernels for improved yield and quality.
8)  Establish a cloud-based platform to store and analyze harvested data, enabling farmers to make informed decisions about future crop management.
9)  Train farmers on the use of new technologies through workshops and online resources to ensure effective adoption.
10)  Monitor the performance of implemented technologies through regular evaluations and gather feedback for continuous improvement.
