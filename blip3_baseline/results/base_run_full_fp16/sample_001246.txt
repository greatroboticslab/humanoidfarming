Task: Rotational Grazing
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Assess the grazing area for size and terrain suitability.
2) Determine the number of animals based on the area's capacity.
3) Calculate the rotational grazing zones using the area per animal.
4) Measure the perimeter of each zone to ensure adequate fencing.
5) Select appropriate fencing materials and tools for installation.
6) Install temporary or portable fencing in designated zones.
7) Mark boundaries clearly for both animals and humans.
8) Plan feeding areas within each grazing zone for nutrient balance.
9) Schedule rotation times based on animal needs and pasture recovery.
10) Train animals to follow the new grazing pattern safely.
11) Monitor animal health and pasture condition regularly.
12) Adjust plans as needed based on observations and environmental changes.
