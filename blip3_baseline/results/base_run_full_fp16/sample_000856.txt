Task: System of Rice Intensification (SRI): Producing more with less
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Assess soil health for optimal SRI practices.
2) Plant rice seedlings at a spacing of 30-60 cm apart.
3) Water plants deeply but infrequently to encourage deep root growth.
4) Monitor for pests and diseases regularly.
5) Apply organic fertilizers sparingly to avoid nutrient burn.
6) Harvest rice when fully matured and dry.
7) Use appropriate safety gear when handling pesticides.
8) Measure water usage in liters per plant per day.
9) Employ tools like trowels for planting and weeding.
10) Maintain records of crop yields and water consumption.
