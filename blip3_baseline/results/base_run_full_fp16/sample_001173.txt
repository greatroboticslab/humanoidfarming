------------------------------------------------------------
I dont have cows but mob graze my horses & they do an excellent job.1) Verify that there are indeed no cows present in the area where horses graze.2) Ensure that the horses are being managed by a professional or experienced handlers to prevent overgrazing and maintain pasture health.3) Monitor the grazing patterns of the horses regularly to ensure they are not causing damage to the grass or soil.4) Consider implementing rotational grazing methods to distribute the grazing pressure evenly across different areas of the pasture.5) Evaluate the impact on the horses' health and behavior due to the increased mobility and social interaction with other horses during mob grazing.6) Assess the environmental impact of mob grazing on the local ecosystem, including soil quality and biodiversity.7) Adjust management practices as necessary based on the results of these evaluations to ensure sustainable practices.
