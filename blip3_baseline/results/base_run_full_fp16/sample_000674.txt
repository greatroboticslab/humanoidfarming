Task: How to plant Pumpkins
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Choose a sunny spot with well-draining soil for planting pumpkins.
2) Prepare the soil by adding compost or aged manure to enrich it.
3) Plant pumpkin seeds about 1 inch deep and 6 inches apart in rows spaced 8 feet apart.
4) Water the seeds thoroughly after planting to ensure good germination.
5) Use stakes or cages to support growing vines as they reach upwards.
6) Mulch around plants to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
7) Monitor for pests and diseases regularly, using organic methods if possible.
8) Harvest pumpkins when they turn solid orange and feel heavy for their size.
9) Store harvested pumpkins in a cool, dry place until ready to use.
