Task: Cassava : The Goldmine Tuber #gardening #HealthyFood #Cassava #ProfitableFarming #
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Identify suitable soil for cassava planting, ensuring it is well-draining and rich in organic matter.
2) Measure out planting space, using a tape measure or ruler for accuracy.
3) Prepare the soil by turning it over with a shovel to a depth of at least 30 cm.
4) Use a hoe to create rows spaced 1 meter apart for optimal growth.
5) Plant cassava cuttings about 30 cm deep into prepared rows, spacing them 60 cm apart.
6) Water the planted areas thoroughly to settle the soil and provide initial moisture.
7) Apply a balanced fertilizer according to package instructions, ensuring even distribution across the planting area.
8) Cover the soil around the plants with mulch to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
9) Monitor for pests and diseases regularly, using appropriate protective measures as needed.
10) Harvest cassava roots when they reach maturity, typically after 6-8 months, using a spade or fork carefully to avoid damaging the plant.
