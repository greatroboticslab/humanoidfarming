Task: Four fruiting trees for drought-prone gardens
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Identify four drought-tolerant fruiting tree species suitable for the garden's climate.
2)  Research each tree's water needs and adjust planting locations accordingly.
3)  Choose trees that thrive in the soil type and pH level of the garden.
4)  Ensure at least one tree is self-pollinating to avoid cross-pollination issues.
5)  Plant trees at least 10 feet apart to allow for adequate growth space.
6)  Water trees deeply but infrequently to encourage deep root development.
7)  Mulch around trees to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
8)  Monitor trees for signs of pests or diseases regularly.
9)  Prune trees annually to maintain shape and promote healthy growth.
10)  Apply organic fertilizer sparingly to support overall tree health.
11)  Prepare for potential frost damage by covering young trees if necessary.
12)  Harvest fruits when ripe to ensure quality and prevent overripening.
