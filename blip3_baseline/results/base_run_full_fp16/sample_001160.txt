Task: Transplanting Tomatoes
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Choose healthy tomato seedlings from a nursery or greenhouse.
2)  Water the seedlings thoroughly before transplanting to keep soil loose.
3)  Select a sunny spot in your garden that receives at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily.
4)  Dig holes twice as wide but the same depth as the root ball of each seedling.
5)  Place each seedling in its respective hole, ensuring the soil level matches the original planting depth.
6)  Fill the holes halfway with water to settle the soil around the roots.
7)  Water the transplanted tomatoes thoroughly again after planting.
8)  Apply a layer of organic mulch around the plants to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
9)  Monitor for signs of stress such as wilting or yellowing leaves.
10)  If any seedlings show signs of stress, gently reposition them or replace them with new, healthier seedlings.
11)  Keep an eye on pests and diseases, and take appropriate action if necessary.
12)  Provide support stakes or cages as needed to help the plants grow upright and prevent damage.
13)  Fertilize the tomatoes once every two weeks with a balanced fertilizer according to package instructions.
14)  Prune the plants regularly to encourage bushier growth and better air circulation.
15)  Harvest tomatoes when they reach full color and firmness, typically 60-70 days after transplanting.
