Task: Worm Farm Experiment: Will My Kitchen Scraps Turn Into Castings 5 To 1?
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Emphasize precision, sustainability, and error checks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Obtain kitchen scraps including fruit peels, vegetable trimmings, coffee grounds, and eggshells in equal proportions of five parts kitchen scraps to one part water.
2)  Place the mixture in a sealed container to prevent odors and pests from entering.
3)  Ensure the container is placed in a warm, well-ventilated area away from direct sunlight.
4)  Check daily for any mold or unpleasant smells, indicating improper conditions.
5)  After two weeks, observe if the mixture has turned into castings, which should resemble dark, crumbly soil.
6)  If not, add more water or adjust the ratio of kitchen scraps to water.
7)  Once castings form, use them as natural fertilizer for indoor plants or compost them further.
8)  Dispose of the remaining kitchen scraps responsibly, either in the trash or through composting.
9)  Clean the container thoroughly before storing it for future use.
10)  Record observations and results for future experiments or sharing with others.
