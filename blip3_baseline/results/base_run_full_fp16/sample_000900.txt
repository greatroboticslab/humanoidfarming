Task: Adding Biochar into Manure Management
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Collect biochar from a reliable source ensuring it meets quality standards.
2)  Test biochar for pH balance to ensure compatibility with manure.
3)  Mix biochar evenly with manure in a large container or spread it over the manure pile.
4)  Monitor the temperature of the manure pile to prevent overheating which could kill beneficial microorganisms.
5)  Ensure proper ventilation around the manure pile to avoid excessive moisture buildup.
6)  Regularly check the manure's consistency and adjust the biochar ratio as needed.
7)  Apply the treated manure to soil at recommended rates based on crop type and soil conditions.
8)  Evaluate crop yields and nutrient content to assess the effectiveness of biochar addition.
9)  If issues arise, such as poor crop growth or nutrient deficiencies, reassess the biochar application method.
10)  Consider consulting agricultural experts for further guidance if necessary.
