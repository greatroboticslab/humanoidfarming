Task: How to Prevent Soil Erosion by Planting Sweet Potatoes
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Provide numbered subtasks with concise justifications.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Choose a suitable location with gentle slopes for planting sweet potatoes to minimize soil erosion.
2)  Prepare the soil by removing weeds and adding organic matter like compost or manure.
3)  Plant sweet potato slips in rows spaced at least 4 feet apart for better root growth.
4)  Cover the planted areas with mulch to retain moisture and suppress weed growth.
5)  Water the plants deeply but infrequently to encourage strong root development.
6)  Monitor the plants regularly for signs of pests or diseases that could weaken the soil structure.
7)  Harvest sweet potatoes when vines start to yellow and roots reach their full size.
8)  After harvest, till the soil to improve its structure and prepare for future planting seasons.
9)  Implement contour plowing along the slope to slow water runoff and reduce soil erosion.
10)  Consider intercropping with other crops that can help stabilize the soil surface.
