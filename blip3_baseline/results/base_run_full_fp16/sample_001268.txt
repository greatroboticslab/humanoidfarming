Task: Buried sprinkler irrigation system display
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Assess the area to be irrigated for proper sprinkler placement ensuring adequate coverage without overwatering.
2) Choose appropriate sprinklers based on the water volume required per zone.
3) Install sprinklers at recommended depths, typically 6-12 inches below ground level.
4) Connect sprinklers to the irrigation system using flexible PVC or polyethylene tubing.
5) Ensure all connections are secure and leak-free before turning on the system.
6) Use a pressure gauge to check water pressure within safe limits, usually between 30-60 psi.
7) Measure soil moisture levels periodically to avoid overwatering and ensure efficient use of water resources.
8) Regularly inspect sprinkler heads for clogs or damage, cleaning as needed to maintain optimal performance.
9) Adjust sprinkler heads as necessary to cover uneven terrain or changing landscape features.
10) Label each sprinkler zone clearly for easy identification and maintenance tracking.
