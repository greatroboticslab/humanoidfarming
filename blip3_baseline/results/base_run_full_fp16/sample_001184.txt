Task: Salt-affected soils: discovering a missed reality
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Identify salt-affected soil areas using satellite imagery or ground surveys.
2) Collect soil samples from identified areas for laboratory analysis.
3) Measure soil electrical conductivity (EC) in millisiemens per meter (mS/m).
4) Use a conductivity meter calibrated to measure EC accurately.
5) Record temperature and pH levels alongside EC measurements for context.
6) Employ a pH meter to measure soil acidity or alkalinity.
7) Prepare soil samples for analysis by drying them at room temperature.
8) Store samples in airtight containers to prevent contamination.
9) Ensure all equipment is calibrated before conducting measurements.
10) Wear appropriate personal protective equipment during sample collection.
11) Document all findings meticulously including location, dates, and measurements.
12) Consult local agricultural extension services for interpretation of results.
