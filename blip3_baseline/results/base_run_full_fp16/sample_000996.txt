Task: Subsurface & Sprinkler Irrigated Corn
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Emphasize precision, sustainability, and error checks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Identify suitable locations for subsurface irrigation systems based on soil type and crop needs.
2)  Ensure sprinkler irrigation systems are properly aligned to cover all corn plants evenly.
3)  Calculate water usage for both systems considering local climate conditions and crop water requirements.
4)  Implement sustainable water management practices such as rainwater harvesting and efficient irrigation scheduling.
5)  Monitor soil moisture levels regularly using sensors to avoid overwatering or under-watering.
6)  Adjust irrigation schedules based on weather forecasts and soil moisture readings to optimize water use.
7)  Use drought-resistant corn varieties to reduce overall water demand.
8)  Conduct periodic soil tests to assess nutrient levels and pH balance, ensuring optimal plant health without excessive fertilization.
9)  Apply mulch around corn plants to retain soil moisture and suppress weeds, reducing the need for frequent watering.
10)  Train farmers in best practices for subsurface and sprinkler irrigation to ensure proper installation and maintenance of systems.
