Task: Two Major Signs That You Need to Repot
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Observe if roots are growing out of drainage holes.
2)  Check for signs of root rot or yellowing leaves.
3)  Assess if the plant is outgrowing its current pot size.
4)  Examine soil texture; if it's compacted or waterlogged.
5)  Evaluate growth rate; has the plant doubled in size?
6)  Measure the plant's height and width; compare to pot dimensions.
7)  Feel the weight of the plant; if it feels heavy, roots may be overcrowded.
8)  Look for stunted growth or poor flowering.
9)  Test soil pH; if it's outside ideal range for your plant type.
10)  Consider the pot material; plastic can retain heat and moisture poorly.
