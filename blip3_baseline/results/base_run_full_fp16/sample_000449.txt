1) Choose suitable cover crops that complement your existing plants and enhance soil health.
2) Prepare the soil in your raised beds by removing weeds and adding compost or well-rotted manure.
3) Plant cover crops according to their specific planting times and depths, ensuring they cover the soil surface.
4) Water the cover crops regularly to establish them quickly and prevent weed growth.
5) Monitor the cover crops for signs of pests or diseases and address them promptly if necessary.
6) Allow the cover crops to grow until they start to die back naturally, typically after several months.
7) Till the cover crop into the soil, mixing it thoroughly to improve soil structure and nutrient content.
8) Apply additional compost or organic matter as needed to maintain optimal soil fertility.
9) Continue to monitor and adjust your soil's pH and nutrient levels as required for your plants' needs.
