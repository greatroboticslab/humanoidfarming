Task: Secret Tool for Moving Pigs! || Setting up Kune Kune Rotational Grazing Paddock || Pastured Pigs
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Emphasize precision, sustainability, and error checks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Assess the land for suitable areas to set up rotational grazing paddocks, ensuring they are at least 1 acre each to accommodate Kune Kune pigs comfortably.
2)  Design paddocks in a circular or semi-circular layout to facilitate easy rotation and access to different parts of the pasture.
3)  Mark out the paddock boundaries using natural markers like trees or rocks, or temporary fencing to ensure accurate placement.
4)  Prepare the paddocks by removing any obstacles or debris that could harm the pigs or complicate movement.
5)  Install water sources within each paddock, ensuring they are easily accessible and clean for the pigs.
6)  Integrate feeders strategically around the paddock to provide a balanced diet, including fresh greens and pig-safe grains.
7)  Monitor the paddock's vegetation growth and adjust feeding schedules as needed to maintain a healthy balance between plant life and pig consumption.
8)  Rotate the pigs every 3-5 days to prevent overgrazing and promote biodiversity in the paddock.
9)  Regularly check for signs of disease or parasites among the pigs, treating them promptly to maintain herd health.
10)  Evaluate the effectiveness of the rotational grazing system periodically, making adjustments as necessary to optimize resource use and animal welfare.
