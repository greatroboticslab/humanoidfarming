Task: The MOST Damaging Effect of Tillage
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Identify the type of tillage practice being analyzed.
2) Determine the specific area or field where tillage is applied.
3) Measure soil depth before and after tillage to assess changes.
4) Collect soil samples for analysis at various depths post-tillage.
5) Monitor soil moisture levels before and after tillage for comparison.
6) Observe and record any immediate visible effects on soil structure.
7) Calculate the percentage change in soil organic matter content post-tillage.
8) Assess the impact on soil erosion potential using runoff tests.
9) Evaluate the effect on soil temperature changes pre- and post-tillage.
10) Conduct a visual inspection for signs of compaction or tilth alteration.
