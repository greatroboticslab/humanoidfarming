Task: Water conservation with trenches - Farm Innovator Subhash Sharma 13
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Assess the farm's water needs and identify areas needing trenching for efficient water flow.
2) Measure the land to determine trench length and spacing for optimal water retention.
3) Choose appropriate trench depth based on soil type and local climate conditions.
4) Select safe trenching equipment such as shovels, picks, or mechanical trenchers.
5) Ensure all workers wear protective gear including gloves and goggles during trenching.
6) Use measuring tapes or laser levels to maintain consistent trench width and depth.
7) Lay down geotextiles or plastic sheets in trenches to prevent soil erosion and improve water absorption.
8) Install perforated pipes or PVC conduits within trenches to guide water towards crops.
9) Fill trenches with a mixture of soil and organic matter for better water retention and soil health.
10) Cover trenches with a layer of topsoil and plant cover crops to stabilize the area and reduce runoff.
11) Regularly check trenches for leaks or damage and repair them promptly to ensure effective water conservation.
12) Monitor water usage and efficiency after implementing trenches to evaluate their impact on water conservation.
