Task: How Amish Grow Millions Of Crops Without Fancy Equipment
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) The Amish use traditional hand tools for planting, such as hoes and rakes, ensuring each seed is placed correctly without machinery.
2) They measure soil depth carefully using wooden stakes and string to plant crops like wheat and corn accurately.
3) For irrigation, they employ simple systems like gravity-fed ditches and buckets, avoiding the need for complex pumps.
4) Safety is prioritized with protective gear like gloves and hats, reducing risks from manual labor.
5) Crop yields are monitored weekly through visual inspection and basic scales, providing data for future planning.
6) Tools are maintained regularly with oiling and sharpening to ensure longevity and effectiveness in farming practices.
