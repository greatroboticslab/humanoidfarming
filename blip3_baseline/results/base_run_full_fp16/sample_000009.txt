Task: Genetically engineered wheat releases insect pheromones to ward off pests
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Emphasize precision, sustainability, and error checks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Conduct thorough research on genetically engineered wheat species suitable for pest control.
2)  Identify specific insect pheromones known to repel targeted pests effectively.
3)  Isolate and analyze the chemical composition of these pheromones for genetic modification.
4)  Integrate the isolated pheromone genes into the wheat genome using biotechnology techniques.
5)  Test genetically modified wheat in controlled environments for safety and efficacy against pests.
6)  Monitor the genetically modified wheat for unintended environmental impacts and allergenicity.
7)  Obtain regulatory approval from relevant authorities for commercial cultivation of genetically engineered wheat.
8)  Implement sustainable farming practices to minimize reliance on chemical pesticides.
9)  Educate farmers about the benefits and proper use of genetically engineered wheat for pest management.
10)  Establish monitoring programs to track pest populations and effectiveness of genetically engineered wheat over time.
