Task: How to Prepare Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) using Fresh Potatoes (Part 1/4)
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Wash fresh potatoes thoroughly under running water to remove dirt and debris.
2)  Peel the potatoes, leaving about an inch of skin intact for better agar formation.
3)  Grate the peeled potatoes using a box grater or food processor to create a fine consistency.
4)  Place the grated potatoes in a large pot and cover them with distilled water.
5)  Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for about 30 minutes until the liquid is reduced to half its original volume.
6)  Strain the potato liquid through a cheesecloth or fine mesh sieve to remove any solids.
7)  Transfer the strained potato liquid to a clean container and let it cool to room temperature.
8)  Once cooled, add sterile dextrose powder to the cooled potato liquid according to the recommended concentration, usually 20 grams per liter.
9)  Mix well to ensure even distribution of dextrose throughout the liquid.
10)  Sterilize the prepared PDA solution by autoclaving at 121 degrees Celsius for 15-20 minutes.
11)  Allow the sterilized PDA solution to cool to around 45-50 degrees Celsius before pouring it into petri dishes.
12)  Pour the cooled PDA solution evenly into petri dishes, ensuring they are filled to the brim without overflowing.
13)  Let the PDA solidify at room temperature for about 30 minutes before using it for microbial culture.
