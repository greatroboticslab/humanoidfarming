Task: Workmaster 25  I welded a quick attach plow first time out.
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Before starting, ensure all personal protective equipment including gloves, goggles, and a dust mask is worn.
2)  Check that the Task Force 25 is properly grounded to prevent electric shock hazards.
3)  Verify the welding area is free from flammable materials and has adequate ventilation.
4)  Use a measuring tape to ensure the quick attach plow fits securely onto the Task Force 25 frame.
5)  Select appropriate welding rods based on the material of the plow and Task Force.
25) 
6)  Position the Task Force 25 on a stable surface away from any obstacles or people.
7)  Mark the areas to be welded on both the plow and the Task Force 25 using chalk for precision.
8)  Turn off and unplug the welding machine before beginning to avoid accidents.
9)  Set up the welding machine according to the manufacturer's instructions, ensuring it is at the correct voltage setting.
10)  Start the welding process carefully, maintaining consistent pressure and speed across the marked areas.
11)  Monitor the weld closely for signs of overheating or improper fusion between the plow and Task Force.
25) 
12)  Once completed, allow the weld to cool naturally before testing its strength and functionality.
