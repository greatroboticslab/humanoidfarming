Task: How Monsters Spawn in R.E.P.O. (Guide and Code deep dive)
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Provide numbered subtasks with concise justifications.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Analyze the game's spawn logic to understand how monsters appear.
2) Identify key variables affecting monster spawning rates.
3) Examine the algorithm used for randomizing spawn times.
4) Study the impact of player actions on monster spawn patterns.
5) Review the game's data structures managing monster populations.
6) Trace the flow of code responsible for spawning monsters dynamically.
7) Debug the code to ensure accurate and consistent monster spawns.
8) Implement a testing framework to validate the spawn system's effectiveness.
9) Optimize the spawn system for performance without compromising realism.
10) Document findings and improvements for future updates or modifications.
