Task: Peter Jennings: Focusing on agronomy to increase rice yields in Asia
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Identify Peter Jennings as the subject of focus for increasing rice yields in Asia.
2) Research agronomy techniques suitable for Asian climates and soil types.
3) Develop a comprehensive plan including crop rotation and pest management strategies.
4) Collaborate with local farmers to implement the agronomy techniques.
5) Monitor rice yields regularly using appropriate measurement units like kilograms per hectare.
6) Adjust agronomy practices based on data collected from yield measurements.
7) Ensure all necessary tools such as tractors, plows, and irrigation systems are available.
8) Train farmers in the use of these tools and agronomic practices.
9) Establish a feedback loop between researchers and farmers for continuous improvement.
10) Use technology like drones for aerial surveys to measure rice growth accurately.
