Task: 3 ways to get rid of ants naturally
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Provide numbered subtasks with concise justifications.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Identify ant entry points by checking around windows, doors, and cracks in walls.
2)  Seal any openings using caulk or weatherstripping to prevent future infestations.
3)  Apply boric acid powder near ant trails as it is non-toxic to humans but lethal to ants.
4)  Use vinegar and water solution to spray on surfaces where ants are active; ants avoid acidic environments.
5)  Place diatomaceous earth around baseboards and in corners; it dehydrates ants upon contact.
6)  Plant mint, lavender, or citronella plants outside to repel ants naturally through their scent.
