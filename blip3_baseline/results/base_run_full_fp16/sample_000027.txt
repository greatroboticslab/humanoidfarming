Task: Precision Farming: How GPS Technology is Revolutionizing Agriculture
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Identify specific agricultural needs such as crop type, soil quality, and water availability.
2)  Use GPS technology to map out fields accurately in hectares or acres.
3)  Install GPS-enabled sensors to monitor soil moisture levels precisely.
4)  Employ drones equipped with GPS for aerial surveys of crops and land.
5)  Develop algorithms to analyze data collected from GPS sensors and drones.
6)  Implement precision irrigation systems guided by GPS coordinates.
7)  Utilize GPS-guided tractors for planting, fertilizing, and harvesting crops.
8)  Train farmers on safe operation procedures for GPS-enabled equipment.
9)  Ensure all GPS devices are calibrated regularly to maintain accuracy.
10)  Establish communication protocols between GPS systems and farm management software.
