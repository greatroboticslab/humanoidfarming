Task: Weeding Made Easy - Year Round Mulch Garden
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Emphasize precision, sustainability, and error checks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Assess garden soil for weed seeds before applying mulch to prevent immediate weed growth.
2)  Choose organic mulch materials like wood chips or straw to maintain soil health.
3)  Apply mulch evenly around plants, leaving a small gap of about 2 inches from plant stems.
4)  Regularly check mulch depth, adding more as needed to keep it at least 2 inches thick.
5)  Water newly applied mulch thoroughly to settle it and reduce evaporation.
6)  Monitor mulch regularly for signs of pests or nutrient depletion, adjusting accordingly.
7)  Rotate mulch types annually to avoid buildup of specific nutrients or pest issues.
8)  Compost any removed mulch to recycle organic matter back into the garden.
9)  Use mulch to retain moisture, reducing water usage and minimizing the need for weeding.
10)  Implement companion planting strategies alongside mulching practices for natural weed suppression.
