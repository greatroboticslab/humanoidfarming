Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Check okra maturity by looking for pods that are about 4-6 inches long and have a bright green color.
2)  Use sharp scissors or pruning shears to avoid damaging the plant.
3)  Pick okra regularly to encourage continuous production.
4)  If plants start to produce flowers but not pods, ensure they receive enough water and nutrients.
5)  Remove any yellowing leaves to prevent disease spread.
6)  Store harvested okra in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
7)  If pests appear, identify them and use organic methods like neem oil for control.
8)  For larger harvests, consider planting more okra seeds every few weeks.
9)  Mulch around okra plants to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
10)  Monitor for signs of fungal diseases and treat promptly if necessary.
