Task: Planting Azaleas
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Provide numbered subtasks with concise justifications.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Choose an appropriate location with well-draining soil and partial shade for azaleas.
2) Prepare the planting site by removing weeds and enriching the soil with compost.
3) Dig holes slightly larger than the root ball of each azalea plant.
4) Place the azalea in each hole ensuring the top of the root ball is level with the ground.
5) Backfill around the roots with soil, gently pressing down to remove air pockets.
6) Water thoroughly to settle the soil and encourage root growth.
7) Apply a layer of mulch around the base of the plants, keeping it away from the trunk.
8) Space azaleas at recommended distances based on their mature size.
9) Stake taller plants if necessary to support them during windy conditions.
10) Monitor newly planted azaleas for signs of stress or disease and provide care as needed.
