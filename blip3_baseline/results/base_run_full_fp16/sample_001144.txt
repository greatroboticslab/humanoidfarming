Task: Revolutionize Your Farm with Solar Irrigation!
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Assess your farm's water needs and determine the appropriate solar irrigation system size.
2)  Choose a suitable location for your solar panels to maximize sunlight exposure.
3)  Install grounding rods to ensure electrical safety in your solar panel setup.
4)  Measure the distance between solar panels and the pump to calculate wire length accurately.
5)  Select a high-quality solar pump that matches your water demand and climate conditions.
6)  Connect the solar panels to the battery bank using waterproof connectors for long-term reliability.
7)  Use a multimeter to check the voltage and amperage of your solar panels before installation.
8)  Ensure all connections are secure and insulated to prevent electrical hazards.
9)  Calculate the required storage capacity for your battery bank based on daily usage.
10)  Purchase and install a battery bank that can store enough energy for nighttime use.
11)  Test the entire system for leaks and proper functioning before turning on the solar pumps.
12)  Monitor the system regularly to maintain optimal performance and catch any issues early.
