Task: How the Aztecs Created Floating Gardens to Survive a Drought
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Emphasize precision, sustainability, and error checks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  The Aztecs identified areas with high water tables suitable for creating floating gardens.
2)  They used aquatic plants like water hyacinth to create rafts that could float on the water surface.
3)  Mud was collected from riverbanks and spread over the rafts to provide a stable base.
4)  Vegetables and fruits were planted in the mud, ensuring they remained above water.
5)  The floating gardens were strategically placed near the Aztec settlements for easy access and maintenance.
6)  This method allowed the Aztecs to grow food without depleting local soil resources during droughts.
7)  Regularly removing excess plant growth and adding fresh mud maintained the garden's productivity.
8)  The floating gardens provided a sustainable food source, reducing reliance on scarce land and water.
9)  By using this technique, the Aztecs demonstrated an innovative approach to agriculture under challenging conditions.
10)  Their success in sustaining populations through these gardens influenced agricultural practices in Mesoamerica.
