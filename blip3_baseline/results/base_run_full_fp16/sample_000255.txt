Task: Farming Life: 10 Eggs a Day Greenhouse Cleaning & Pepper Planting
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Begin by ensuring all electrical equipment in the greenhouse is unplugged and turned off to avoid electric shock hazards.
2)  Use a soft-bristled brush and mild detergent solution to clean the greenhouse walls and floor, avoiding any chemical substances harmful to plants.
3)  Measure and mark the area for planting pepper plants using a measuring tape and chalk, ensuring adequate spacing between each plant.
4)  Fill seed trays with a suitable growing medium, such as peat moss or vermiculite, to a depth of about 2 inches.
5)  Sow pepper seeds according to package instructions, covering them lightly with soil.
6)  Water the seedlings gently with a watering can fitted with a fine rose nozzle to prevent disturbing the seeds.
7)  Place the seed trays in a warm, well-lit area of the greenhouse, maintaining a temperature around 70°F (21°C).
8)  Monitor the seedlings daily for signs of pests or disease, and take action immediately if any issues arise.
9)  Once seedlings have grown to about 2 inches tall, transplant them into individual pots filled with potting soil.
10)  Water the transplanted peppers thoroughly, ensuring the soil is moist but not waterlogged.
11)  Set up an egg collection system, such as a wire mesh tray placed under the nesting boxes, to collect eggs safely without harming the hens.
12)  Ensure that the egg collection system is cleaned regularly to maintain hygiene and prevent the spread of diseases.
13)  Harvest 10 eggs daily from the collection tray, storing them in a cool, dry place until use.
14)  Maintain a consistent feeding schedule for the hens, providing them with a balanced diet to ensure they lay eggs efficiently.
15)  Regularly check the greenhouse for pests and diseases, taking preventive measures like introducing beneficial insects or applying organic pesticides if necessary.
16)  Adjust the lighting in the greenhouse as needed to provide the correct amount of light for optimal growth of the pepper plants.
17)  Prune pepper plants as needed to encourage bushier growth and improve air circulation, reducing the risk of fungal diseases.
18)  Monitor the pepper plants for signs of nutrient deficiencies, and apply fertilizers as recommended by the product instructions.
19)  Harvest peppers when they reach their desired size and color, typically within 60-90 days after planting.
20)  Dispose of old egg shells responsibly, either composting them or disposing of them in the regular trash.
