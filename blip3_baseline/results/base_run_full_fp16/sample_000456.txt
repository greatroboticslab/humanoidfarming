Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Provide numbered subtasks with concise justifications.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Ensure the coop is shaded to provide natural cooling for the chickens.
2) Install fans or use natural breezes to circulate air and reduce heat inside the coop.
3) Provide plenty of water sources to encourage drinking and help maintain body temperature.
4) Use cool bedding materials like straw or wood shavings to absorb excess heat.
5) Limit the time spent in direct sunlight by moving the coop to shaded areas during peak heat hours.
6) Consider using shade cloths over the coop to block direct sunlight and reduce heat absorption.
7) Introduce misting systems or sprinklers to cool the air and provide a refreshing sensation for the chickens.
8) Offer a variety of cool treats like frozen vegetables or fruits to supplement their diet and keep them hydrated.
9) Monitor the weather forecast regularly to prepare for heatwaves and adjust care accordingly.
10) Keep the coop clean and free from ammonia buildup, as this can exacerbate heat stress on the chickens.
