Task: Let's begin to farm with the JADAM No-Till method.
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Provide numbered subtasks with concise justifications.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Identify suitable land for JADAM No-Till farming based on soil type and climate conditions.
2) Prepare the land by removing weeds and debris but leaving crop residues in place.
3) Plant seeds directly into the residue layer without tilling or plowing the soil.
4) Water the planted seeds thoroughly to ensure they receive adequate moisture.
5) Monitor the crops regularly for pests and diseases, applying natural remedies if necessary.
6) Harvest crops when mature, ensuring not to disturb the soil structure further.
7) Rotate crops annually to maintain soil health and prevent pest buildup.
8) Maintain a consistent cover of crop residues throughout the growing season.
9) Use natural fertilizers like compost or manure to enrich the soil without tillage.
10) Implement intercropping techniques to enhance biodiversity and reduce weed growth.
