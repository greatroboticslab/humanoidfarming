Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Emphasize precision, sustainability, and error checks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Open the sprayer's cleaning valve to drain any remaining water or deicing solution from the tank.
2)  Use a soft-bristled brush to scrub the inside of the tank, focusing on areas where ice or debris might have accumulated.
3)  Flush the tank with clean water to remove all residues, ensuring no soap or detergent remains.
4)  Allow the tank to air dry completely before storing to prevent rust or corrosion.
5)  Clean the nozzle and spray mechanism with a soft cloth to remove any residue or blockages.
6)  Drain and flush the pump chamber thoroughly to ensure no residual liquid is left behind.
7)  Dry the pump chamber with a clean cloth to prevent moisture damage during storage.
8)  Store the sprayer in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight to protect its components.
9)  Label the storage container clearly with the date of the last cleaning for easy tracking.
10)  Ensure all parts are properly packed to avoid damage during transportation or storage.
