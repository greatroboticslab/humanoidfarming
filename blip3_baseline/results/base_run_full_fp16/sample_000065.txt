Task: PLOWING VS TILLING PART 2
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
2) Compare the efficiency of plowing versus tilling in terms of time required.
3) Evaluate the soil structure improvement achieved by each method.
4) Assess the impact on crop yields after implementing both methods.
5) Determine the environmental effects of using plowing or tilling techniques.
6) Identify the labor requirements for each farming technique.
7) Measure the water retention capacity of soils treated with plowing or tilling.
8) Compare the residue left behind after each process to assess weed control effectiveness.
9) Calculate the energy consumption associated with each farming practice.
10) Implement a small-scale experiment comparing plowing and tilling methods side by side.
