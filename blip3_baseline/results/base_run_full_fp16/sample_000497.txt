Task: Incorporation of bean plants in soil with different agricultural practices
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Identify suitable bean plant varieties for the intended agricultural practices.
2)  Select a diverse range of soils to test different agricultural practices.
3)  Prepare the soil according to recommended agricultural practices.
4)  Plant bean plants in each prepared soil sample.
5)  Apply consistent watering and fertilization schedules across all samples.
6)  Monitor bean plant growth and health regularly.
7)  Record observations on plant height, leaf color, and overall vigor.
8)  Implement a backup plan for soil preparation if initial attempts fail.
9)  If necessary, adjust agricultural practices based on preliminary results.
10)  Conduct a final assessment of bean plant performance after a set period.
11)  Document findings for future reference and potential replication.
12)  Share insights from the experiment with agricultural communities or publications.
