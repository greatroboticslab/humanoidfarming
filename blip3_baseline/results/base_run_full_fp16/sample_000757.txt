------------------------------------------------------------
1) Identify suitable materials for composting on-farm, including organic waste from crops and livestock.
2) Choose an appropriate location that is easily accessible and has good drainage.
3) Construct or acquire a compost bin or pile to contain the materials.
4) Layer materials in alternating layers of green (nitrogen-rich) and brown (carbon-rich) materials.
5) Maintain proper moisture levels by watering or adding dry materials as needed.
6) Turn the compost regularly to aerate and mix materials thoroughly.
7) Monitor temperature inside the compost pile to ensure active decomposition.
8) Allow sufficient time for composting, typically 2-6 months depending on conditions.
9) Screen compost to remove large particles before use as fertilizer.
10) Apply composted material to soil to improve fertility and structure.
