Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Emphasize precision, sustainability, and error checks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Select a suitable location for the Romaine towers ensuring ample sunlight and protection from strong winds.
2)  Prepare the soil by testing its pH level and adding necessary nutrients to ensure optimal plant growth.
3)  Design the irrigation system using drip irrigation to minimize water waste and ensure even moisture distribution.
4)  Install the irrigation system according to the manufacturer's instructions, checking connections for leaks.
5)  Connect the water source to the irrigation system, verifying that water flows freely without any blockages.
6)  Position the Romaine towers in the prepared soil, ensuring they are evenly spaced for proper airflow and light exposure.
7)  Plant the Romaine lettuce seeds or seedlings following the recommended spacing and depth guidelines.
8)  Water the newly planted Romaine towers thoroughly, making sure the soil is moist but not waterlogged.
9)  Monitor the plants daily for signs of pests or disease, implementing appropriate control measures if necessary.
10)  Adjust the irrigation schedule based on weather conditions and plant needs, aiming for consistent watering without overwatering.
11)  Harvest the Romaine lettuce when it reaches maturity, ensuring that the plants are healthy and free from pests.
12)  Maintain the irrigation system regularly, cleaning filters and checking for clogs to prevent system failure.
