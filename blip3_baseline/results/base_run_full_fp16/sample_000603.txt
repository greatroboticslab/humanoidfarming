Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Start by choosing a suitable location with plenty of sunlight and well-draining soil.
2)  Plant zucchinis in rows spaced at least 4 feet apart to allow for growth.
3)  Water plants deeply once or twice weekly, ensuring the soil remains moist but not waterlogged.
4)  Apply a balanced fertilizer every four weeks to support healthy growth.
5)  Prune side shoots regularly to encourage the main stem to grow straight and produce larger fruits.
6)  Monitor for pests and diseases, using natural remedies like neem oil if necessary.
7)  Harvest zucchinis when they reach a size of about 6 inches long for the best flavor.
8)  Consider trellising plants to save space and make harvesting easier.
9)  Rotate crops annually to prevent soil-borne diseases and maintain soil fertility.
10)  Use floating row covers to protect young plants from pests and cold temperatures.
11)  Encourage pollination by hand-pollinating flowers if bees are scarce.
12)  Keep an eye on weather forecasts; avoid planting during extreme heat or cold spells.
