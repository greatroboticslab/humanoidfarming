Task: Regenerative Weed Management
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Identify weeds in the garden using a comprehensive weed map or manual inspection.
2) Determine the type of weeds found to choose appropriate herbicides or manual removal methods.
3) Apply herbicides according to product instructions, ensuring proper coverage and timing.
4) For manual removal, pull weeds carefully, removing as much root as possible to prevent regrowth.
5) Water the area thoroughly after treatment to help herbicides penetrate the soil effectively.
6) Monitor the treated areas for any signs of new weed growth within the next few days.
7) If new weeds appear, repeat the process with either herbicides or manual removal.
8) Maintain regular maintenance schedules to prevent future weed growth through consistent watering and mulching.
