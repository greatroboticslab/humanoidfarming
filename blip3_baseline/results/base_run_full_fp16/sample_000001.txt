Task: Transplanting a Tomato plant in a 4" pot to a gallon pot
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Provide numbered subtasks with concise justifications.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Inspect both pots for any signs of pests or diseases before transplanting.
2) Water the 4" pot thoroughly to loosen soil and make transplantation easier.
3) Gently remove the tomato plant from the 4" pot, supporting the root ball.
4) Loosen the root ball slightly to encourage new growth in the larger pot.
5) Place the plant in the gallon pot, ensuring it is at the same depth as in the smaller pot.
6) Fill around the base of the plant with fresh potting soil, pressing gently to secure.
7) Water the transplanted plant deeply, allowing excess water to drain out the bottom.
8) Apply a layer of mulch around the base of the plant to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
9) Place the gallon pot in a location that receives adequate sunlight and has good air circulation.
10) Monitor the plant for signs of stress or distress over the next few days.
