Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Research local classifieds, auctions, and tractor dealerships for used tractors.
2) Inspect the tractor for visible damage, especially under the hood and tires.
3) Check the engine's oil level and smell for any unusual odors.
4) Test drive the tractor on a flat, safe surface to assess its performance.
5) Verify the tractor's serial number and check for any maintenance records.
6) Ensure the tractor has a valid safety inspection certificate from your state.
7) Measure the tractor's dimensions if you plan to transport it; use feet and inches.
8) Prepare necessary tools like a jack, lug wrench, and a torque wrench for inspection.
9) Arrange transportation or delivery services if the tractor is too large to move yourself.
10) Negotiate the price based on the tractor's condition, mileage, and features.
