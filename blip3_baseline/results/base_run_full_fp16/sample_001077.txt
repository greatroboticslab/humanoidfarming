Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Provide numbered subtasks with concise justifications.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Ensure the chicks have access to a warm brooder at around 95°F (35°C) during the first few days.
2)  Provide a chick starter feed that is high in protein suitable for their age.
3)  Keep the brooder clean and dry to prevent bacterial growth.
4)  Offer fresh water and feed frequently, ensuring they do not go hungry.
5)  Gradually increase the temperature over the next week to acclimate them to room temperatures.
6)  Introduce a dust bath area for natural parasite control and hygiene.
7)  Monitor the chicks for signs of illness or distress daily.
8)  Provide soft bedding like wood shavings or straw to absorb moisture and keep the floor clean.
9)  Keep the environment quiet and stress-free as much as possible.
10)  Plan to introduce them to outdoor space gradually after about two weeks if conditions permit.
