Task: NCREC Leandro Bortolon: Resilience of Cropping Systems
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Identify specific cropping systems to study resilience.
2) Collect data on climate conditions over several years.
3) Measure crop yields annually for comparison.
4) Use rainfall in millimeters as a unit of measurement.
5) Employ rain gauges to accurately record precipitation.
6) Assess soil moisture content using a soil moisture meter.
7) Record temperature data using thermometers in degrees Celsius.
8) Implement GPS technology for precise location tracking.
9) Utilize satellite imagery for broader landscape analysis.
10) Calculate yield per hectare in kilograms or tons.
11) Apply statistical methods to analyze data trends.
12) Prepare detailed reports summarizing findings and conclusions.
