Task: Grain Storage | Storage Hygiene and Structural Treatments
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Assess grain type for moisture content using a hygrometer.
2) Measure grain height in meters to calculate storage capacity.
3) Use a grain probe to test grain temperature at various depths.
4) Install ventilation systems according to local climate conditions.
5) Apply protective coatings to prevent mold growth on grain surfaces.
6) Regularly check structural integrity of storage bins with a tape measure.
7) Inspect grain levels weekly to ensure proper aeration and moisture control.
8) Maintain all equipment used for grain storage with a checklist.
9) Keep detailed records of all measurements and maintenance activities.
10) Ensure all workers are trained in safe handling procedures for grain.
