Task: How to make Carbonized Rice Hull
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Obtain rice hulls from a local supplier or prepare them yourself by removing husks from rice grains.
2)  Clean the rice hulls thoroughly to remove any dirt or debris.
3)  Spread the cleaned rice hulls evenly on a baking sheet in a single layer.
4)  Preheat an oven to 200 degrees Celsius (392 degrees Fahrenheit).
5)  Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for about 2 hours, stirring occasionally.
6)  Check the carbonization level by smelling the rice hulls; they should have a burnt aroma.
7)  If the smell is not strong enough, increase the oven temperature to 220 degrees Celsius (428 degrees Fahrenheit) and bake for another hour.
8)  Once fully carbonized, allow the rice hulls to cool completely before storing them in a sealed container.
9)  Test the carbonized rice hulls for completeness by crushing them between your fingers; they should crumble easily without releasing much smoke.
10)  Store the carbonized rice hulls in a dry, cool place away from direct sunlight.
