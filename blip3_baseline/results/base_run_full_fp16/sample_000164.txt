Task: Prepping the Chicken Coop for Winter ~ FAIL
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Emphasize precision, sustainability, and error checks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Inspect all exterior doors and windows for any drafts or gaps, ensuring they are properly sealed to prevent cold air from entering.
2)  Apply a layer of insulation to the walls and roof using eco-friendly materials like sheep's wool or recycled denim, checking each application for even coverage.
3)  Install weather stripping around doors and windows to further reduce heat loss, verifying its tight fit and secure attachment.
4)  Replace old, inefficient heating systems with energy-efficient models that meet local building codes, ensuring proper installation and functioning.
5)  Clean and maintain all heating equipment, checking for blockages or malfunctions, and test them before winter sets in.
6)  Collect and store firewood responsibly, choosing sustainable sources and storing it away from the coop to avoid attracting pests.
7)  Ensure adequate ventilation inside the coop during winter months, adjusting the opening of vents and windows as needed, monitoring temperature and humidity levels.
8)  Provide extra bedding made from natural materials such as straw or wood shavings, replacing it regularly to maintain cleanliness and warmth.
9)  Secure all movable parts of the coop, including gates and doors, against potential damage from harsh winter conditions, checking their functionality periodically.
10)  Prepare emergency supplies including food, water, and medical kits, ensuring they are accessible and in good condition, checking expiration dates and restocking as necessary.
