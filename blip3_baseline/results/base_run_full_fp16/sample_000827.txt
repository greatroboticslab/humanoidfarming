Task: A Cleaner and More Efficient Charcoal Kiln for Developing Countries
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Conduct market research to identify local materials suitable for building efficient charcoal kilns.
2)  Design a prototype using locally available materials that reduces fuel consumption.
3)  Test the prototype in a controlled environment to assess its efficiency and durability.
4)  Gather feedback from users on the prototype's usability and effectiveness.
5)  Refine the design based on user feedback and test again.
6)  Develop a detailed manual for constructing the improved charcoal kiln.
7)  Organize training sessions for community members on proper construction techniques.
8)  Distribute the manuals and conduct follow-up visits to ensure compliance.
9)  Monitor the performance of the new kilns over time to evaluate their impact.
10)  Adjust designs based on ongoing monitoring and gather additional user feedback.
11)  Collaborate with local government agencies to promote adoption of the improved kilns.
12)  Establish a support system for communities to address any issues with the new kilns.
