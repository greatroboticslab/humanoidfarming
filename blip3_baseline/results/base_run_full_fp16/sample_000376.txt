Task: Harvest & count a Turing's sunflower
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Wear appropriate protective gear including gloves and safety goggles to prevent injury during handling.
2) Choose a sunny location for the sunflower to ensure optimal growth conditions.
3) Use a measuring tape to measure the height of the sunflower from the ground to the tip of its tallest stem.
4) Count the number of florets in one spiral pattern starting from the base of the flower head.
5) Measure the distance between two adjacent florets along the same spiral pattern using a ruler or measuring tape.
6) Repeat steps 4 and 5 at least three times to ensure accuracy in counting and spacing measurements.
7) Record all measurements and counts in a notebook or digital document for future reference.
8) Ensure the sunflower is watered regularly and receives adequate sunlight to support healthy growth throughout the process.
