Task: Plant Growth: Auxins and Gibberellins | Plants | Biology | FuseSchool
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Identify the roles of auxins and gibberellins in plant growth.
2)  Research how auxins promote cell elongation and differentiation in plants.
3)  Examine the mechanism by which gibberellins stimulate stem elongation.
4)  Analyze the impact of auxins on root development and apical dominance.
5)  Investigate the effects of gibberellins on seed germination and fruit ripening.
6)  Compare and contrast the functions of auxins and gibberellins in different plant species.
7)  Study the interplay between auxins and gibberellins in regulating plant growth.
8)  Explore the potential applications of auxin and gibberellin research in agriculture and horticulture.
9)  Validate findings through controlled experiments using various plant species.
10)  Document results and share knowledge with the scientific community for further research.
