Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Assess the trellis system for any visible damage or signs of wear.
2) Measure the distance between support posts to ensure uniform spacing.
3) Use a tape measure for accurate length and width measurements.
4) Gather necessary tools including a level, hammer, nails, and wire cutters.
5) Check soil moisture levels to avoid damaging roots when removing old trellis.
6) Disassemble the trellis carefully, using pliers to remove any stubborn nails.
7) Prepare new posts by driving them into the ground at measured intervals.
8) Ensure posts are straight and level using a carpenter's level before attaching.
9) Install crossbars or horizontal supports to reinforce the trellis structure.
10) Attach the new trellis to the posts using appropriate fasteners like nails or screws.
11) Secure the top and bottom edges of the trellis to prevent sagging or movement.
12) Water the garden gently after installation to settle the soil around the new trellis.
