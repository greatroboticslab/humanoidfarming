Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Assess current food supply and demand in drought-affected regions of Somalia using satellite imagery and local agricultural data.
2) Measure water availability in wells and boreholes in cubic meters to determine if there is enough for irrigation.
3) Identify areas most vulnerable to drought through climate models and historical rainfall data.
4) Develop a plan to distribute emergency food aid in kilograms to affected households.
5) Collaborate with local authorities and NGOs to ensure timely delivery of aid.
6) Monitor crop yields in hectares to evaluate the effectiveness of implemented measures.
7) Use drones equipped with multispectral cameras to assess soil health and nutrient levels.
8) Establish early warning systems for drought conditions using weather stations and mobile apps.
9) Implement sustainable agriculture practices like rainwater harvesting and drought-resistant crops.
10) Conduct training sessions for farmers on improved farming techniques and drought management.
