Task: Tech alone wont raise farm yields
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Assess current farming practices for efficiency and sustainability.
2) Identify specific areas needing technological intervention.
3) Research and select appropriate technologies based on needs.
4) Ensure all chosen technologies comply with local regulations.
5) Evaluate potential risks and benefits of each technology.
6) Calculate expected yield improvements using historical data.
7) Measure initial yields before implementing new technologies.
8) Monitor and record performance of implemented technologies regularly.
9) Adjust technologies as necessary based on performance metrics.
10) Collaborate with agricultural experts to validate results.
