Task: The Benefits of Crop Rotations (Hall 2/6)
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Identify suitable crops for rotation based on local climate and soil conditions.
2) Plan rotations to include at least three different types of crops annually.
3) Calculate crop yields using standard agricultural measurement units like kilograms per hectare.
4) Measure soil health through pH levels and nutrient content before and after each rotation cycle.
5) Use tools such as soil testing kits and pH meters for accurate measurements.
6) Monitor pests and diseases in each crop type to assess effectiveness of rotation strategies.
7) Adjust rotation plans based on observed outcomes and environmental changes periodically.
