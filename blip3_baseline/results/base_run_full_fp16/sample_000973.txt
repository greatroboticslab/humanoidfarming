Task: Evolution of Agricultural Working Dogs
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Provide numbered subtasks with concise justifications.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Domestication of dogs began thousands of years ago, coinciding with early human agricultural practices.
2) Early farmers relied on dogs to herd livestock and protect crops from predators.
3) Over generations, dogs that assisted in agriculture were selectively bred for specific tasks.
4) These selective breeding practices led to the development of distinct breeds suited to various farming roles.
5) Different regions developed specialized working dog breeds adapted to local climates and environments.
6) The evolution of these working dogs improved agricultural productivity through better animal management and crop protection.
7) As farming techniques advanced, so did the roles of these working dogs, adapting to new challenges like mechanization.
8) Today, while some traditional roles have diminished, working dogs still play crucial roles in modern agriculture.
