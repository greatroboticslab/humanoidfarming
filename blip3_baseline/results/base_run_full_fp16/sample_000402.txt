Task: Soil-Building Practices for Healthier Crops
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Assess soil pH using a soil testing kit to ensure optimal nutrient availability.
2) Measure soil moisture content with a moisture meter before irrigation.
3) Collect compost from kitchen scraps and yard waste in a large container.
4) Mix compost into the topsoil at a ratio of one part compost to three parts soil.
5) Use a tiller or garden fork to mix the compost thoroughly into the soil.
6) Apply organic mulch around plants to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
7) Regularly measure soil temperature with a thermometer to monitor plant growth.
8) Use a rake to spread mulch evenly over the soil surface.
9) Ensure all tools are clean and sanitized before use to prevent disease spread.
10) Wear gloves and protective clothing when handling soil amendments and tools.
11) Keep records of soil tests, compost additions, and any pest or disease issues encountered.
12) Schedule regular soil tests every two years to track changes in soil health.
