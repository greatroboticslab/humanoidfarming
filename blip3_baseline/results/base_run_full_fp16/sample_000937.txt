Task: The Future of Farming: High-Tech Greenhouses
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Identify key technologies for high-tech greenhouses like IoT sensors, AI for crop management, and hydroponics systems.
2)  Conduct market research to understand consumer demand for sustainably grown produce.
3)  Develop prototypes of high-tech greenhouses incorporating identified technologies.
4)  Test prototypes in controlled environments to ensure reliability and efficiency.
5)  Collaborate with agricultural experts to validate the effectiveness of the technology on crops.
6)  Analyze data from tests to refine and optimize the greenhouse designs.
7)  Secure funding through grants or partnerships to scale up production.
8)  Establish pilot farms using refined designs to gather real-world data.
9)  Launch commercial operations based on successful pilot farm results.
10)  Monitor performance and adjust strategies as needed to maintain optimal farming conditions.
11)  Continuously improve technology and practices based on feedback and new scientific discoveries.
12)  Educate farmers about the benefits and use of high-tech greenhouses to increase adoption.
