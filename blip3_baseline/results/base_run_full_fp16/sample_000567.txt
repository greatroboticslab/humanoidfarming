Task: Coconut planting method_Tiptur
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Emphasize precision, sustainability, and error checks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Select a suitable location with well-draining soil and ample sunlight for optimal coconut growth.
2)  Prepare the land by removing weeds and rocks, ensuring a level surface.
3)  Plant coconut seeds at least 10 feet apart to allow for proper growth and spacing.
4)  Water the newly planted coconut seedlings deeply but infrequently to encourage strong root development.
5)  Apply organic fertilizer every three months to support healthy plant growth without chemical runoff.
6)  Monitor for pests and diseases regularly, using natural remedies or biological controls when necessary.
7)  Prune the coconut tree annually to maintain its shape and promote air circulation, reducing the risk of fungal infections.
8)  Harvest coconuts when they turn brown and fall naturally from the tree, ensuring not to damage the surrounding plants.
9)  Collect fallen coconuts carefully to avoid soil compaction and ensure minimal disturbance to the ecosystem.
10)  Practice crop rotation and intercropping with other crops to maintain soil fertility and biodiversity.
11)  Implement water conservation techniques such as drip irrigation to minimize water usage and reduce runoff.
12)  Evaluate the success of the coconut plantation annually, adjusting management practices based on observed outcomes.
