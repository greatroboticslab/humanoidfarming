Task: Furrow Irrigation System - I
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Assess soil moisture levels using sensors to determine when irrigation is needed.
2)  Calculate water volume required based on crop type and weather conditions.
3)  Activate the irrigation system according to pre-programmed settings or manual control.
4)  Monitor water flow through the system to ensure even distribution across fields.
5)  Adjust sprinkler heads if necessary to prevent overwatering or under-watering areas.
6)  Verify that all valves and pipes are functioning correctly before starting the irrigation cycle.
7)  Set up backup power sources in case of electrical outages affecting the irrigation system.
8)  Schedule regular maintenance checks for irrigation equipment to ensure optimal performance.
9)  Train operators on proper operation and troubleshooting techniques for the furrow irrigation system.
10)  Implement a feedback loop to continuously improve irrigation efficiency based on field observations and data analysis.
