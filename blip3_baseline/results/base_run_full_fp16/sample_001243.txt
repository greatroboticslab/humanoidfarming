Task: Strategic grazing of winter crops
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Assess crop type and soil conditions for optimal grazing.
2) Determine safe grazing areas based on terrain and water availability.
3) Calculate total grazing capacity in livestock units per hectare.
4) Measure pasture growth weekly to monitor health and adjust grazing.
5) Use fencing tools to create secure, manageable grazing zones.
6) Implement rotational grazing to prevent overgrazing and soil depletion.
7) Regularly check for signs of pests or diseases affecting crops.
8) Maintain accurate records of grazing patterns and crop health.
9) Adjust grazing plans as needed based on weather forecasts and crop needs.
10) Ensure all workers are trained in safe handling of livestock and equipment.
