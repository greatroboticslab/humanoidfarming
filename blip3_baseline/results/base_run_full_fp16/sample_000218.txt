Task: Rain Water Collection System
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Emphasize precision, sustainability, and error checks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Assess local rainfall patterns to determine the size and shape of the rainwater collection system.
2)  Choose sustainable materials for the collection and storage components to minimize environmental impact.
3)  Design the system to capture runoff from rooftops or other surfaces efficiently.
4)  Install gutters and downspouts to direct water flow towards the collection system.
5)  Ensure proper slope and spacing between gutters to prevent clogging and maximize water collection.
6)  Select appropriate storage containers that can hold the collected water safely.
7)  Implement filtration systems to remove debris and contaminants before storing the water.
8)  Connect the collection and storage components securely to ensure they function as intended.
9)  Test the system for leaks and functionality before filling it with water.
10)  Regularly maintain the system to keep it clean and operational, checking for blockages and damage.
11)  Educate users on the importance of using collected water for non-potable purposes like gardening.
12)  Monitor the system's performance over time to make adjustments as needed for optimal efficiency.
