Task: Boosting on farm nitrogen fixation in pulses  Liz Farquharson
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Identify pulse crops suitable for nitrogen fixation.
2)  Conduct soil tests to assess current nitrogen levels.
3)  Apply organic matter like compost or manure to increase soil organic matter.
4)  Introduce leguminous cover crops to enhance soil nitrogen.
5)  Use green manures as a method of adding nitrogen to the soil.
6)  Rotate pulse crops with non-leguminous plants to maintain soil health.
7)  Implement crop rotation practices to prevent soil depletion.
8)  Monitor crop growth and nitrogen levels regularly.
9)  Adjust fertilization based on soil test results and plant needs.
10)  Consider using microbial inoculants to improve nitrogen fixation efficiency.
11)  Educate farmers about best practices for pulse cultivation and nitrogen management.
12)  Evaluate the effectiveness of nitrogen fixation strategies annually.
