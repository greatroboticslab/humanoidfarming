Task: Grazing Systems
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Identify the type of grazing system to implement based on land characteristics and livestock needs.
2)  Conduct a soil analysis to determine nutrient levels and pH for optimal pasture growth.
3)  Plan the layout of paddocks ensuring adequate space and access to water and shade.
4)  Select appropriate forage species that match the climate and soil conditions.
5)  Establish a rotational grazing schedule to prevent overgrazing and promote soil health.
6)  Install fences to delineate paddocks and ensure animals stay within designated areas.
7)  Monitor livestock behavior and health regularly to adjust management practices as needed.
8)  Implement a weed control strategy to maintain pasture quality and reduce competition for forage.
9)  Provide supplementary feed if necessary during periods of low forage availability or poor weather conditions.
10)  Evaluate the effectiveness of the grazing system periodically and make adjustments as required.
