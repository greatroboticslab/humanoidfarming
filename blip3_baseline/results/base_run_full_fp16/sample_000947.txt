Task: rainwater collection system
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Emphasize precision, sustainability, and error checks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Assess local rainfall patterns to determine the size and capacity of the rainwater collection system.
2)  Choose a location for the rainwater collection system that is accessible and not prone to flooding.
3)  Design the system to include a filtration mechanism to remove debris and contaminants from collected water.
4)  Install gutters and downspouts to direct rainwater efficiently into the collection system.
5)  Select appropriate storage containers or tanks made from durable, non-toxic materials.
6)  Ensure proper slope in the ground around the collection area to facilitate water flow towards the system.
7)  Connect the downspouts to the collection system using flexible pipes to allow for expansion and contraction.
8)  Implement overflow protection to prevent overfilling of storage containers during heavy rains.
9)  Regularly inspect and clean the system to maintain its efficiency and ensure safety.
10)  Educate users on the importance of maintaining the system and reporting any issues promptly.
11)  Monitor the system's performance regularly to adjust as necessary based on usage and environmental changes.
12)  Consider integrating solar-powered pumps for pumping water if the system is located far from the intended use areas.
