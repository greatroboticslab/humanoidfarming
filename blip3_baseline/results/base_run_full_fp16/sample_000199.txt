Task: Maize Combine Harvester (field test)
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Emphasize precision, sustainability, and error checks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Conduct initial site assessment for soil type, crop density, and topography.
2)  Install GPS navigation system for precise field mapping and guidance.
3)  Calibrate combine harvester sensors for optimal performance under local conditions.
4)  Test hydraulic systems to ensure smooth operation during field operations.
5)  Perform routine maintenance on all mechanical components before testing.
6)  Load the combine with sufficient fuel, lubricants, and spare parts for the test.
7)  Set up communication devices for real-time data collection and troubleshooting.
8)  Train operators thoroughly on safety protocols and machine operation procedures.
9)  Begin field testing with a small section of the field to identify any immediate issues.
10)  Monitor combine's efficiency in harvesting speed, yield, and quality of crop separation.
11)  Adjust settings as necessary based on feedback from the first section of the field.
12)  Continue testing across different sections of the field, ensuring consistent performance.
13)  Document all findings, including any malfunctions or improvements made during testing.
14)  Evaluate overall performance against set benchmarks for sustainability and efficiency.
15)  Prepare comprehensive report detailing the results of the field test for further analysis.
