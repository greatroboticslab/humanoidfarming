Task: Flood Irrigation
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Include validation steps and fallback procedures.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Assess soil moisture levels using a moisture meter to determine if irrigation is necessary.
2) Check weather forecasts for upcoming rainfall or evaporation rates.
3) Calculate water volume needed based on crop type, size, and current moisture content.
4) Open flood irrigation valves slowly to prevent sudden pressure surges.
5) Monitor water flow and adjust valves as needed to ensure even distribution across fields.
6) Observe plants for signs of overwatering such as wilting or yellowing leaves.
7) If issues arise, shut off water immediately and recheck soil moisture before resuming.
8) Adjust irrigation schedule based on plant growth stages and environmental conditions.
9) Regularly inspect irrigation systems for leaks or clogs to maintain efficiency.
10) Document all irrigation activities for future reference and analysis.
