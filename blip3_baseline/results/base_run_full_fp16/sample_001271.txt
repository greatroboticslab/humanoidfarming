Task: How to Weld an Impossible Triangle (Tribar)? | Is It possible?
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Provide numbered subtasks with concise justifications.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) First, ensure all materials used for welding are clean and free from rust or debris.
2) Select appropriate welding equipment and techniques suitable for metal alloys of the tribar.
3) Carefully align the three sides of the impossible triangle before beginning the welding process.
4) Apply even pressure across the joints during the welding process to ensure strength.
5) Use a flux if necessary to improve the weld quality and prevent oxidation.
6) Allow the weld to cool completely before handling the tribar to avoid cracking.
7) Inspect the welds for any defects or imperfections using a magnifying glass or microscope.
8) If needed, apply a protective coating to the welded area to enhance durability and appearance.
