Task: Simple Machines Make Life Easier for Poor Farmers
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Identify simple machines used by poor farmers, such as levers or pulleys.
2) Assess the current farming tasks that could benefit from these machines.
3) Evaluate the safety risks associated with using these machines in rural settings.
4) Determine appropriate measurement units for assessing machine efficiency.
5) Select necessary tools for constructing or improving the simple machines.
6) Calculate the cost-effectiveness of implementing these machines for farmers.
7) Train farmers on safe operation and maintenance of the new simple machines.
8) Monitor the impact of the simple machines on productivity and sustainability.
9) Adjust the implementation strategy based on feedback and observed results.
10) Document best practices for future reference and replication.
