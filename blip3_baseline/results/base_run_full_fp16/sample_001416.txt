Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Emphasize precision, sustainability, and error checks.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Start by selecting high-quality seeds from a reputable source.
2)  Prepare a seed starting tray filled with well-draining soil mix.
3)  Sow the seeds about 1/4 inch deep and space them 1 inch apart.
4)  Cover the tray with a clear plastic lid or use a dome to maintain humidity.
5)  Place the tray in a warm location with indirect sunlight.
6)  Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged.
7)  Once seedlings emerge, remove the lid to allow air circulation.
8)  Transplant the seedlings into individual pots when they have at least two true leaves.
9)  Use containers with drainage holes and fill with potting soil.
10)  Gently remove seedlings from the tray and place one per pot.
11)  Ensure each pot has adequate drainage and is placed in a sunny spot.
12)  Water the plants regularly, keeping the soil slightly moist.
13)  Monitor for pests and diseases, using organic methods if necessary.
14)  When temperatures are consistently above 50°F (10°C), harden off the plants by gradually exposing them to outdoor conditions.
15)  After hardening off, plant the baby bok choy outdoors in well-drained soil.
16)  Space plants about 12 inches apart to allow for growth.
17)  Provide regular watering, especially during dry spells.
18)  Apply a balanced liquid fertilizer every two weeks to promote healthy growth.
19)  Harvest baby bok choy when the leaves are 4-6 inches long and tender.
20)  Continue harvesting as needed throughout the growing season.
