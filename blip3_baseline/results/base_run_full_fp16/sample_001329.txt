Task: Harvesting and Storing Water for Crop Irrigation
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Assess local water sources ensuring they are safe to use for irrigation.
2) Measure water volume using gallons or liters for accurate calculations.
3) Use a hose or pipe to transport water from source to fields.
4) Install drip irrigation systems for efficient water usage and soil moisture retention.
5) Position sprinklers strategically over crops to ensure even watering coverage.
6) Monitor weather forecasts to avoid overwatering during drought conditions.
7) Regularly check water levels in storage tanks to prevent overflow.
8) Clean filters monthly to maintain optimal water flow and prevent clogging.
9) Store harvested water in clean containers to minimize contamination risks.
10) Label containers clearly with date of harvest and type of water used.
