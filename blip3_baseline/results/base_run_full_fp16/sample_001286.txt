Task: Why Have a Pond? Reason #4 FLOOD IRRIGATION
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
4) Ensure the pond is large enough to safely hold floodwaters without overflowing.
5) Measure the pond's capacity in cubic meters or gallons to understand its water storage capability.
6) Use a hose or flow meter to test how much water the pond can handle during a flood event.
7) Prepare necessary tools such as shovels for quick drainage if needed, and sandbags for levee construction around the pond perimeter.
8) Plan where to direct excess water from the pond to prevent flooding of nearby areas, using local topography and drainage maps as guides.
