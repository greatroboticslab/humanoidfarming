Task: Drip Irrigation Flow Rates | From the Ground Up
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Provide numbered subtasks with concise justifications.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Identify the type of plants requiring drip irrigation for accurate flow rate calculation.
2) Determine the water requirement per plant based on species and size.
3) Calculate the total volume needed daily or weekly for all plants.
4) Choose appropriate drip emitters based on plant needs and water volume.
5) Measure the distance from the water source to the furthest plant.
6) Select a suitable pressure regulator to match the system's required pressure.
7) Install tubing and emitters according to manufacturer guidelines.
8) Connect the tubing to the water source and ensure proper alignment.
9) Test the system for leaks and adjust as necessary.
10) Monitor plant health and adjust flow rates if needed periodically.
