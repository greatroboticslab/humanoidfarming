Task: Understanding the Connection: Stress Reduction Through Soil Health - Brian and Jamie Johnson
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Identify participants in stress reduction study involving soil health.
2) Measure soil pH levels using a soil pH meter.
3) Collect soil samples from various locations for analysis.
4) Use a trowel to dig soil samples to a depth of 10 cm.
5) Record temperature and humidity conditions at the time of sampling.
6) Apply a 10 cm layer of organic compost to test plots.
7) Monitor participants' stress levels before and after intervention.
8) Conduct weekly soil tests for nutrient content.
9) Observe plant growth and health in treated versus untreated areas.
10) Calculate changes in soil microbial activity through lab analysis.
11) Evaluate participants' reported stress levels using validated scales.
12) Document all findings in a comprehensive research report.
