Task: Backyard Composting | From the Ground Up
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Provide numbered subtasks with concise justifications.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Choose a suitable location for your compost bin that receives at least six hours of sunlight daily.
2)  Gather materials such as kitchen scraps, yard waste, and brown and green organic matter in equal parts.
3)  Build or purchase a compost bin made of wire mesh to allow airflow and drainage.
4)  Layer the collected materials in the bin, starting with a layer of brown material like leaves or straw.
5)  Add a layer of kitchen scraps, ensuring they are moist but not soggy.
6)  Repeat layering until the bin is full, maintaining a balance of greens and browns.
7)  Turn the contents of the bin every two weeks using a pitchfork to aerate and mix the materials.
8)  Water the compost pile if it feels dry to touch, keeping it moist but not wet.
9)  Cover the compost bin with a lid to retain heat and moisture.
10)  Monitor the temperature inside the bin; ideal temperatures range from 130째F to 160째F (54째C to 71째C).
11)  Once the compost reaches maturity, typically after several months, it will have a dark, crumbly texture and an earthy smell.
12)  Use the finished compost as a natural fertilizer for plants and soil amendment.
