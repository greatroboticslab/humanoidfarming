Task: 5 Advanced Hydroponic Techniques for Maximum Crop Yield: Beginner to Pro Guide
Please break it into step-by-step subtasks. Focus on safety, measurement units, and necessary tools.
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Start by selecting a suitable hydroponic system based on your space and budget, ensuring it complies with local regulations.
2)  Choose plants that thrive in hydroponics, such as lettuce, tomatoes, or herbs, considering their specific nutrient needs.
3)  Prepare the growing medium if using one, ensuring it is clean and free from contaminants.
4)  Set up the nutrient solution reservoir, measuring the water volume accurately using liters or gallons.
5)  Adjust the pH level of the nutrient solution to between.
5) 8 and.
6) 2, using a pH meter calibrated for hydroponics.
6)  Install LED grow lights providing optimal light spectrum for photosynthesis, ensuring they are placed at least 20-30 cm above the plants.
7)  Monitor temperature and humidity levels, maintaining them within a range suitable for your chosen crops, typically between 20°C and 25°C.
8)  Implement a regular feeding schedule, adding nutrients according to plant growth stages, measured in ppm (parts per million).
9)  Practice proper plant spacing, ensuring adequate air circulation around each plant to prevent disease and promote healthy growth.
10)  Regularly inspect plants for pests and diseases, treating them promptly with environmentally friendly methods.
11)  Harvest crops when they reach maturity, assessing ripeness through visual inspection and taste testing.
12)  Maintain a clean and organized workspace, disposing of waste safely and recycling used materials where possible.
