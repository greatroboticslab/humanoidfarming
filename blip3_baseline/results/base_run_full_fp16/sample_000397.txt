2)  Understand the importance of biodiversity in maintaining ecological balance.
3)  Learn about trophic levels and food chains within an ecosystem.
4)  Study the concept of carrying capacity and its relation to environmental limits.
5)  Explore the roles of producers, consumers, and decomposers in an ecosystem.
6)  Define symbiotic relationships and their significance in ecological systems.
7)  Recognize the impact of human activities on local and global ecosystems.
8)  Familiarize oneself with measurement units such as biomass, population density, and species richness.
9)  Use field guides or digital resources to identify various flora and fauna accurately.
10)  Employ scientific measuring tools like rulers, scales, and pH meters for accurate data collection.
