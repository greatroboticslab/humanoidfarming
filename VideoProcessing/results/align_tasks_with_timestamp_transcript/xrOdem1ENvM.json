Then I need to break this down into subtasks. Let me think. The subtasks would involve explaining why choosing the right breed is important. That's a subtask: Explain importance of choosing the right breed for a commercial farm. Then they mentioned the large white breed as the top choice. So, a subtask could be: Mention the large white breed as the top choice globally and in Africa. They also talked about the landrace breed as another excellent option. So, another subtask: Highlight the landrace breed as another excellent option for commercial farming. They mentioned Hampshire as well. Subtask: Discuss the Hampshire breed as a viable choice. Then they introduced TN70 as a cross of large white and landrace. Maybe: Introduce the TN70 breed as a cross of large white and landrace, suitable for commercial farming. Next, the Camboro was mentioned. So: Mention the Camboro breed as a massive, fast-growing option for crossbreeding. Then Duroc was discussed for those who want to sell finished products. Subtask: Recommend the Duroc breed for commercial farmers who want to sell, despite cost. Finally, the Pi\u00ebtraits breed was mentioned as new and up-and-coming. So: Mention the Pi\u00ebtraits breed as a new option gaining popularity. That covers the main tasks I think. But let's make sure.",
