These tasks cover grain handling from harvest to storage, emphasizing dry-down methods, safety measures, and monitoring grain conditions. Subtasks include assessing moisture levels using meters, determining optimally dry harvesting times, employing various drying techniques, and safely storing grain with proper aeration and monitoring systems. Additionally, the transcript highlights the importance of preventing slips and falls, adhering to lockout/tagout procedures, and managing confined space hazards. These tasks and subtasks are directly relevant to the agricultural practices discussed, ensuring a practical guide based on the speakers' expertise.",
