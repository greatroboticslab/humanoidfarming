Additionally, tasks related to farm management involve operating a CSA program (MICY TASK), coordinating member involvement (SUBTASK), rotating fields and integrating livestock (SUBTASKs), as well as processing value-added products like fermented vegetables (MAINTASK involving SUBTASKs like collecting and fermenting vegetables, ensuring food safety, and distributing products). Soil testing and analyzing organic matter (SUBTASK) contribute to broader farm management and sustainability goals (MAINTASK).
