Let me read through it again and pick out the key physical tasks a person would perform. The main thing here is following biosecurity guidelines, which involves several steps. First, when you're bringing in new animals, you have to make sure you get permission to enter the farm, right? They probably have a specific entrance. Then you need to call the farmer and get any necessary numbers or passcodes to get in. So I think the task there is \"Following biosecurity guidelines when transporting livestock,\" and under that, the subtasks would be identifying the entrance, contacting the farmer, getting inspected, maybe cleaning the truck if needed, signing in, following routes, checking paperwork, making sure the truck is clean before leaving. Then when you're picking up animals, you do the same thing, right? You go through the process of getting permission, maybe inspecting the truck, loading the animals, checking paperwork again, unloading, and then cleaning the truck. So maybe the MAINTASK is \"Admitting and handling transportation procedures at the farm,\" which would include all those subtasks. Wait, but actually, the transcript talks about both picking up and delivering animals. Let me check.",
