However, the transcript doesn't indicate that the humans are directing, just that someone (Daddy) is saying \"More little animals\" after each dance. Maybe a parent is leading the children, but the primary action is following the dance steps. Therefore, possibly I need to consider that subtasks include not just the movements but also following the beat or commands. If a person is to perform this in real life, they have to both follow the choreography and maybe also participate in the group movement.",
