Key tasks include exploring past manual planting methods, understanding advanced machinery and GPS systems in current planting, automated irrigation and sensor usage, powerful harvesting machines with GPS, and the entire sugar production process from crushers to packaging. The transcript also mentions the continued use of traditional artisanal methods for their cultural and flavor preservation benefits. While the main focus is on industrial processes, the video touches on the balance between technological advancement and traditional practices in the sugarcane industry.
