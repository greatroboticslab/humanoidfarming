Since the transcript is about the setup, perhaps only include the tasks related to the learning and planning process. Alternatively, perhaps the MAINTASK is \"participate in the process of growing a rice crop,\" which includes both the learning aspect and the actual farming tasks. But in the transcript, it's mainly the commitment and the initial actions. Hmm. Let's check the transcript again.",
