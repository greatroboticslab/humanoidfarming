The transcript mentions that the training is part of the second phase of the Seven Crops Project. While that's information, it might not directly translate into a task, unless part of the training content. The title of the event is \"proper cultivation techniques and ways of combating major pests and diseases.\" So those are the main things being taught. Then, the introduction of new varieties is a key part, which is addressed in a separate MAINTASK. And the market diversification is touched upon, which could require understanding the current market; hence, the respective subtask. Converting all that into tasks and subtasks should work. The only thing to confirm is whether the consumption method (red okra should be raw) is something that has to be taught or is just general knowledge. But since the speaker specifically mentions, \"taking note of continuous success of the Seven Crops project\" and how eating okra is supposed to be done, perhaps it's part of the training. So including it under the okra consumption MAINTASK makes sense.",
