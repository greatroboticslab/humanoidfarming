  "text": "In every state across America, there's a clear dividing line. On one side, it's fresh air, green grass, serenity, peace, and quiet. On the other, it's mayhem, crowds, commotion, and traffic, oh, miles and miles of traffic. We're here to talk about city versus country. This is the original love-hate relationship in America that has literally shaped every state. Thomas Jefferson hoped to build America on simple values and healthy country lifestyles. His agrarian dream clashed with what federalists like Alexander Hamilton saw as progress, a nation built on thriving cities, centers of industry and culture. So what's the difference between rural and urban? Well, rural areas have fewer than 50,000 residents. Anything bigger is considered urban. And today, a full 80% of us live in or around a city. Curious about whether you're in the city or the country? Well, just try to get a cup of morning joke. When we map the nation's coffee shops, it reveals that our coffee shop density well, it corresponds to the map of the largest cities. The farther you travel from a city center, the harder it is to get some coffee or a latte, a sure sign that you're heading into the countryside. Back at the time of the American Revolution, everybody lived in the country. The last 200 years has seen a trickle away from the country turn into a flood toward the city. A mass migration that started in the late 1800s permanently changed the map. The main reason folks moved to the city, something we hear a lot about today, jobs. The growth of urban factories created a huge demand for labor. While country folk once outnumbered their city cousins in the 20s to one. Today for every one person who lives in the country, four live in the same suburbs. It's a trend that is projected to continue. To dance more of us head for the big bright lights of the city, we plug into a faster life, changing ourselves, altering the map of these United States. Getting elected president is an expensive business. Campaign costs add up. There are advertisements to make. Action costs, even bumper stickers. But where does all this money come from?",
