  "text": "I became enriched with its experience. It all began when I met George Kahumoko Jr. on his tour in California. George is a Hawaiian-born guitar legend raised in the islands. I was quite impressed and thankful to have so much in common with him. He handed me his business card years past before we reconnected, and I told him I was coming to Maui. He was excited at the news, and we made plans to meet on the island. The day I arrived, George brought me over to Honokahau Valley late at night for me to meet his longtime friend, Job Kabato. The area is known as Honokahau Valley. Maui Volcano House of Water in Hawaiian known as Kahukalo. This valley begins along the curvaceous road across rugged cliffs at mile marker 36. In Honokahau Valley, you are surrounded by several natural beaches in Honolua Bay. You can leave behind the heat of the valley for a cool refreshing dip into some of the most secluded beaches and go snorkeling to discover beautiful sea creatures unlike anywhere else on the island. Over 30 years ago, George's friend Job created the Gardener's Guild and did what no one has ever done in Honokahau Valley. He had a beautiful vision of restoring the land of its old Hawaiian nature. He left the main island where he grown up and arrived in the valley with nothing but a vision to create human connections and everlasting friendships through farming, landscape design, environmental cleanup and improvement. He quickly discovered he could penetrate deep into and reconnect with his soul by using his hands and his mind.",
