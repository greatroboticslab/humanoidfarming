These are horses a Mother horse is called a mare and a young horse is called a colt These horses are grazing and the area that they're grazing in well That's called a pasture a place that grows grass for horses to graze now these horses Are at a water trough. This is so that they can drink water an animal the size of a horse needs lots of water Horses are often referred to by their color the horse on the left is a bay the horse on the right is a Searle it looks like the one in the back is also a bay Whatever their color horses get surrounded by flies Now one thing about horses is they love to eat This is the inside of a barn a barn shelters horses from the weather And it's often where they are fed It's a good place to store hay You see lots of barns in the countryside, but horses seem happiest when they're outside grazing Check out this beautiful scene in southern, Oregon. I'm leading this horse with a halter Horses require a lot of care These horses are getting brushed something the horses very much enjoy Brushing is just one of the steps and getting a horse ready to ride Another step is putting on the saddle Speaking of riding both horse and rider enjoy going out for a ride Even going backwards sometimes Children are fascinated by horses another great animal found on the farm This is the tail end of the video clip, of course",
