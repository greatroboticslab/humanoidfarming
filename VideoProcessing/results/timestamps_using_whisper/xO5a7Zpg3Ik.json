  "text": "I never thought that four years of undergrad and a two-year master's degree would eventually mean that I am actually a professional gate holder, but here I am proud of it You know, I mean dreams really do come true about they'd be too mighty to do anything so It's not fun The calves are fed now Run to the house change and get the kids to their school Yeah, one of those mornings got a love Monday Before we get the skull How to make a pit stop to get a drink at Miss Jackson's country boys Yeah, baby. This is what matter She said what she said she's gonna give me 99 cent, but she gave me a penny. She gave you a penny. Okay That's one cent. Yeah, since you were one cent over a dollar It costs 99 cents. So she gave you back. She said she was gonna give me 99 cent. Okay, anyway So Got the kids dropped off Getting ready to go feed in the mud when my husband gets back. He went to help a Friend who has dairy steers to take to market and needed an extra trailer So when he gets back, we'll talk on the mud. We are enjoying a mild 55 degree day Even though it's rained An inch and a half this weekend And feeding is absolutely horrendous Because of the mud and because we have we still have our cows and calves in smaller lots Because they're not quite done calving Basically almost and as soon as they are then we will work We'll run them through the chute and we'll work them and put them out on some larger pasture, but Can you believe how fast that little monkey Drinks that milk You're all done look at that anyway, so That's what we're doing today got the kids delivered at home school Co-op because we home school. I haven't really talked about that but We do that so on Mondays they go to a co-op and mom gets a day off to do other things Like writing because i'm a freelance writer for progressive farmer and a digital magazine called ag now And for that magazine, I also record what I write So if you don't like to read you can click a button and let me read it to you. So I got that done today edited some pictures I don't know y'all. It's just always a lot going on here anyway We'll head out in the mud in a minute almost I don't need that I'm just going up the road almost forgot though that I need to make a phone call business phone call and We don't have a landline because it stopped working And our cell phone service is really crappy. So I go to the barn to conduct business in my truck So that's amazing. Yay rural internet and cell phone service Still holding out hope one day We'll get both Okay office time done and the wind is whipping out there Which is good because when the wind whips The mud starts to dry I mean hopefully And I almost forgot that somebody is coming to get corn tonight That hasn't been bagged yet. So guess who gets to do that? And there's an m in my way Okay one down Nine to go I don't know if you remember but a while back I showed um My husband picking corn with his old corn picker well This is after This is what's left after probably I don't know 400 or so bags that we sold at least Yeah, we've still got plenty And this is for deer hunters. Somebody's gonna ask me that It's for deer hunters. So yeah Here we go Yeah, don't even act like you're tired All right, that's done 10 bags That need to be closed, but um, I don't know how to do it My husband has this fancy little knot he does and I haven't mastered it. So I figured I'd leave something for him to do Yeah, here we go Everybody's hungry We're a little later feeding today a lot later My husband had to take a load of calves To mark it for a neighbor It's muddy. Obviously, this is not ideal feeding conditions And we had another way right now we would do it, but We do the best we can of what we have I've seen it worse But this isn't isn't good Fun thing over the last few years. I have been able to add something else to my resume Gate holding extraordinary We thought that four years of master's degree Would eventually mean that I am actually a professional gate holder, but here I am Crowd of it You know, I mean dreams really do come true And the sun came out Maybe for more than 30 seconds and the wind's blowing so That's what we need",
