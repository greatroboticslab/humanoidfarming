  "text": "How do we take a field of lettuce just like this and turn it into a bowl of lettuce day after day for Pretty much the entire year. We're gonna use something called the cut-and-come-again method There's two different ways to do it. We're gonna talk about that in today's video With cut-and-come-again what you're trying to do is preserve the growing tip of the plant and for lettuce and many leafy greens That is in the center and we call it the crown and so what you're seeing me do here with this bib lettuce Very standard classic type of lettuce is come around the outside and you can do it clockwise counterclockwise But what you're trying to do here is take away those large mature leaves And I'm doing it here with this Merlot lettuce too, which is more of a frilly variety This one I'm gonna take down pretty considerably Just to show you a peek at what the inside really looks like because if you do damage the crown Then your plant is done for good And so you really want to avoid that you're seeing me take away these outside leaves and look there's just very small Versions of those leaves in here. So if we dig in we can see the future of this plant basically these are four or five maybe even six little leaves that are in Development and in four or five days you'll see those really start to come out And so you can do this with something like spinach to come around Make sure that you're not chopping off that crown get around the outside And you're gonna get a lot more yield out of this because you're taking off those mature leaves letting them grow up And then doing the same thing so we can see here crown is the exact same those baby lettuce leaves are coming out Sorry those spinach leaves and now here is a different method. This is a more efficient method So you can come in with a chef's knife or something similar Make sure you know right about where the crown is so you don't chop off too much of it And then grab it like a head of hair almost and then just come through and slice And you you're gonna want a really sharp knife for this and so you've got a nice bunch of lettuce You've preserved the crown we can see I didn't chop the crown off and there we go It's really that simple guys so the cut-and-come-again method explained in about a minute or two Well, there we have it the cut-and-come-again method very simple explained you can get bowls of lettuce Day after day using this method as long as you're doing it the right way But it does bring us to a couple questions and the first question is how many times can I actually cut? one of these plants before It actually is just done for good, which is a great question So usually it depends on really does depend on the type of plant the type of lettuce or leafy green that you're doing but for the most part anywhere from three to five cuts and That's about it So, you know, it's not like the plants just going to continue producing forever Like it might if you look at my basil video I have a video on how to prune basil you can more or less keep it going forever Relatively speaking it still will die but much later than a green for something like you know this Loose leaf lettuce right here. You're gonna get three to five cuts Before the quality of the leaf is going to start to degrade it won't be this big And it also won't taste that good and it's going to sort of be just a little bit uglier and just the plant is Trying to bolt because it knows that you know its life is coming to an end But you're not really giving it the energy and the ability to do so so then you're in a bad spot So that's it endless supply of lettuce. I'm gonna go make a salad now guys I'll see you in the next video hit like hit subscribe if you enjoyed it Let me know what you'd like to see in future videos later on in the comments. All right. Good luck in a garden Keep growing",
