  "text": "We're here in the village of Sardar in the province of Kandahar in Afghanistan. We just had a fantastic meeting with a group of village elders, farmers and a farmers association to talk about some of the many challenges they're facing in this country, which has been facing now over 35 years of war for. What is really interesting with these farmers is to discover how aware they are of the challenges they're facing. We've talked a lot about water, water scarcity. We've talked about crops. We've talked about the soil problems, markets. But what's most amazing to me is their awareness of the fact that their agricultural systems need to change, to evolve, to adapt to what they're facing. Climate change. Here we've just finished looking at a check dam, which will help them to prevent too much water flow in their land, to prevent erosion. And we'll also recharge groundwater. This is an important project that was funded by the World Bank and implemented through FAO, one of almost 7,000 check dams that FAO has done in the country. They want to move into horticultural crops. They realize that farming systems must evolve. But for us as FAO, the most precious part here is the fact that they already know what these challenges are, and we can support them. We can help them with so many ways, but we're pushing on an open door. They already know so much of what it's about.",
