They did it by following their principles, by being the best and by being honest to their customers. DIS. Technology driven. People focused. Well, inventory is a dirty word, used. But you've got to have used inventory for the person that comes in on a given day to have it. Not everybody can afford the new one way or another. If you don't have someone the lot, they drive through the lot, they don't even stop. And the way our lots are located, people are driving through all the time and they'll say, they'll call and say, well, am I way through to Pierre? We looked at something, we've seen it, what have you. But if it's sitting on the country and you don't trade for it, you don't ever have it. Now, unit-wise, we're very heavy, I'll admit that. But, dollar-wise, because we don't have 10 combines, 10 four-wheel drives, things like that thing there, we can have smaller inventory, which looks outlandish in most people's eyes. But we're just one small dealership with a huge inventory that's covering a very vast area. And I think because of that, people are stopping through on the way by seeing what we have and we're getting phone calls, we're getting, enhances our sales through the internet and things like that, which has been very helpful.
