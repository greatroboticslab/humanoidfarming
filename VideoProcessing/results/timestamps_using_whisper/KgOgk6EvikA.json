  "text": "Let us start this lecture with a thought process that all of you are here to learn right learning is a process and we should have love for learning. So I always feel that love for learning lessens the labor pains of learning. Today learning is a very difficult process for all of you right. Because you people are occupied with several other things and therefore it is very important you should develop a love for it and learning is a part and parcel of human life. Let us recall what we learnt in the last lecture. We basically looked at that why we need to go for agriculture as a basis for our growth right. And why because you know like we are having a naturally endowed with the resources which are very conducive and you know for the agriculture or the farming. And later on we looked at like what are the processes involved in agriculture and how this modern agriculture being implemented as of now right. And today we will be looking at what are the problems we are facing with the modern farming and you know like in 1950s or the 60s you know like we are having green revolution. People are very much where gaga about it and today also some of the you know intellectuals are very saying that we need to go for second green revolution. Is it really revolution or not that we will see and I will put forward or I will show you some data to it. But let us before that let us look at what are the problem in the modern agriculture. We use more fertilizers and more pesticide for what because more fertilizers will give the growth will be better and then you know production of the crop will be higher. And more pesticide will have to give because the pests are more increasing at a number. Because as a result that we are more profit maniac you know we are want to have more greedy greediness has come to our mind too much right. And there is a whole wall not only in India because of this is what you call metallism like as I told earlier market metallism makes a man maniac. So we became maniac you know like for profit man air for grabbing all those things are going on in our mind that is what you call deterioration of mind power to think which is right which is wrong getting swayed away. So therefore that is the problem and then it is thrust upon us and we are just not thinking about one and pest and diseases are part and parcel of nature. Keep in mind that because one person will be relying another right and they balance and so also disease is the thing to decay and then you will be going. So this is the part of nature in ideal system natural balance between predators and pest are to be maintained. So that you know each are connected with each other these are all philosophy what are embedded in our you know traditional knowledge system in our ancient wisdom and which we need to understand basic things what we are talking about here you need to understand the basic laws of nature and then work accordingly not going against and you know imbalancing are doing something that balance will be broken balance is important because we cannot really look at only small micro management the whole big picture we need to look at it and big picture are very order and then it may be looking like a disorder but actually as I told that our civilization order in disorder and that is natural so that has to be looked at. So chemical control that is why we want to have a control over this diseases and also the pest so that last 40 years you know insectize use have increased tenfold while the crop losses from the pest damage have double losses are increasing and you are increasing that also right insectize. So one has to look at that why it is so and as a result the safety of the people 1 million cases of poisoning by pesticide each year around the world and up to 20,000 of these results in debt this poisoning because of and in this number may be more I mean like you know and dates occur in tropical countries where chemical pesticides which are banned in Europe and other western countries like USA are still being used in India right I mean there are several examples I am not going to look at it and you can see your for example DDT and then some other thing even URIA people are not but we are using here in this country. So and cost of farming increasing at alarming rate and as a result food prices are also being increased very much around 300% in last 10 years and if you look at we are having a people who are hands to mouth like hands to mouth laborers and I think where they will get the food because the food price are now is a comparable to the global global market and earlier days food was very cheaper in this country whenever I visit other country I feel oh we are safe we are having at least food a common person can get today it is not because of globalization and you know right and problem with the industrial agriculture practice here I have already discussed let me just highlight some of the points I will be highlighting more again because I want that some of the things will be repetitive in nature but keep in mind these are important we need to understand that then only we can take characteristic as I told that monocultures basically the single kind of crop they use and that erodes the biodiversity among both plants and animals it is not only with the plants only because all are connected so therefore that is creating and if you look at the nature is always multi layer or you know various things it is not heterogeneous is not homogeneous we trying to make it homogeneous because in engineering we do that you know but that is not that is a wrong it is not easier to handle the heterogeneous thing you make it homogeneous therefore you say that no it nature is other way around it is your limitation that you are trying to push forward or the you know thrust upon the people but you must understand that nature is not like that and there is a strength in that synthetic chemical fertilizers are being used blatantly which pollute the soil not only the soil water and air all whatever the environment we are getting spoiled because of this blatant use of chemical fertilizers I will be showing how it is so and both environment and although not only the human health but also the animal health plant health you know all are being connected so soil which is the soul of infinite lives right and that is getting spoiled you know much faster than it can be replenished and taking with its lands fertility the whatever the fertility nutrients the land the soil is having it is going away and which are very important this fertility and nutrients are very important for the growth of the plants and those things we eat as a food but those are being getting away you know I will be showing you later on like what are the things and I will also give you data how this most of the civilization got extinguished got spoiled because of soil quality is going down at that time we need to keep that and maybe in the next class I will show you some data and what are these consumed at unsustainable rates in many agricultural areas because water being used too much and it is also helping to take away a leaching out the what you call this fertility and nutrients which you are adding to the soil artificially and also the natural one all are going away so you know you are using because of too much use of water so effect of pesticides on environment if look at chemical pesticide can kill useful insects there is a lot of you know microorganism insects are very useful pollination for pollination we need but they are not you know and if pollination won't be there then you can't have a food production you may have very big plants but you don't have nowadays in western country people are using artificial pollination you know like why you will do that and cost is in will be increasing which ate the pest leading to the imbalance in nature whole mother nature is in balance you are cutting the limbs often they know fingers or you know if you look at a body my fingers are being cut my you know hand being removed from the mother nature you know mother nature if you consider it as a body that is not the way so therefore you need to look at it and as I told earlier artificial chemical can stay in environment in the bodies for a number of years right even if you want to use it will stay for in your thing for generation to generation and you cannot really afford to do that and causing problem for many years it is not for your generation it is for the next maybe 5 10 generation will have to suffer because of you have used the chemical fertilizers and which are not good for the health. So therefore we need to understand insect pest are very quickly or over a fear of breeding cycles they become resistant to artificial products they also try to resist the thing and develop a hormones and other things so that they can because that is the nature nature is intelligent you know they are working to go suppose somebody will try to eat you you will have to protect yourself right find out ways and means use your mind use your body use your resources use your power to do that they are also doing that way okay and are no longer controlled by the label of chemicals what we were using earlier days I will be showing you some data as well. So if you look at fertilizer consumption you look at this in 1960s we are having fertilizer consumption is very very low if you look at this is the color orange color that brown is very very low million tons maybe you know like 1 or 2 million tons and it is goes on increasing and so also China and then we are because we want to grow at a faster rate than the other people and that is the bigger problem but if you look at America which is a very intelligent people you know like they have grown this a higher increase from 1960 to maybe 80s they realize these are not good and they are almost remaining constant and sometimes going negative and I do not know the data lost maybe 6 7 years but I am sure that they might have decreased so if you look at we need to do that we will have to cut off and then the whole business you know they are sending their multinational company to here to Swindilas and users and then spoil we will be intelligent enough we should understand this and then do that so and if you look at we are as we are using more fertilizers and more pesticides and other things we are spoiling also the groundwater I was told of course this may not be the correct but you please check do not go by any data I am giving please correct it check it and then accept it in some newspaper this thing I learned that 60% of groundwater in China are not drinkable in India you think about it my guess is around maybe 20 to 25% of the at least in Kanpur I know there is a some area where the water has gone groundwater has gone bad deadly bad so therefore we need to and worry about that because that sustains the life and if we spoil the ground utter and which are interconnected how we are going to what you call correct it or how we are going to replanage how we will do that can you take it out by the pump and they again put it is it possible all are connected you know interconnected right so how we will you know take care of that polluted what so therefore we will have to worry about and if you look at the fertilizer consumption I know nitrogen as there is a phosphatic type and potassium potassium type it is all are increasing you know in 1991 where something 80 in lakhs tons you know this is in lakhs of tons 80 lakhs tons now 1 in 2000 say in 166 and today maybe it will be something 175 or maybe 80 I do not know okay you please look at it so all are increasing we should decrease it we should at least stabilize it you know because we know it is they are harmful but still because our people are illiterate and then so also the thing and the people are using advertisement and other thing to what you call leave them for this for the more production and more profit as a tool to imbibe them you know right leave them but all our we are spoiling the health let us look at how is the food production related to faulty fertilizer consumption right so if you look at that this is I have taken the data from 70 to 2002 it is a little old data but let us look at the trend this blue color is fertilizer consumption rate it is going up sometimes in 75 it is gone up above the red line that is corresponding to the million terms of food production and then if you look at it is food production is lowered down at least 95 onwards and the fertilizer consumption is increasing and let me tell you last year I had gone to some nearby village in Kanpur where people are you know and then I inquired with the farmers I told what are the consumption they are saying that we are using almost double the fertilizers what we are using 10 years back for getting the same you know tonnage for acre kind of aircraft see look at what we are doing that means the soil fertility has gone down and you are adding more and more and then it will be spoiling right so therefore the farmer Swiss committing suicide because the cost of farming is increasing at an alarming rate than the what price they can get in in the you know what to call market as a result you know they are in debt therefore government of India is you know what to call taking away the debt in the sense giving the subsidy no not subsidy it is maap Karthik then I like waving waving of their loans they are waving of the loans but that is not the solution solution has to be found out looking at what are the causes of it and then look at fundamentally and solve the problem and there all of you who are listening to these lectures and then you will have to come into picture and educate them and also educate the government about this wrong policies of using these concepts because you know we are democracy we should do that and the growth is we are all talking about the green revolutions and other thing we want to have a another green revolution people are talking about genetically modified crops and I am afraid one should not venture to that of course there are several reason I will be not talking about why we need to but you will have to if you are interested get into that and find it out yourself. So, the growth rate of the crop production let us look at what happened in our the green revolution let us look at that this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 in this diagram for the wheat we are talking about pre-green revolution something 1951 to 1968 we are having something 37 you know is a tons of this. So, this I have taken the data from the draft of 12 plan document daily planning commission and 2013 right. So, let us say this is the percentage you know what you are having then it has been decreased in the green revolution period 69 to 81 and then it is again little bit increase up and then going down and then down again this thing then again people are increasing because of in the 7th plan and that is true with if you look at this point you know for the rise for the wheat and then pulses for oil seeds of course oil seed has little bit gone up I mean corresponding to this 1951 and in the today kind today means 11 and 12, but wheat and rice and pulses you know it is lower than that what it was there in pre this thing. So, therefore you can judge from yourself and this data I have taken from this thing that look this is a myth that we are having a green revolution because the crop we are putting lot of pesticide lot of fertilizer than this thing, but we are not growing I mean like course there is a various fluctuation depending upon your what you call your climates and this depending upon other parameters you know that is there. So, one has to look at data and analyze it and then only we can say that look there is a green and beside this we are paying price for the what for this use of this chemicals fertilizer pesticide spoiling soil air and the thing we will be talking about what are the problems of chemical fertilizer let us understand that and there is a micronutrient imbalance because of utilizing the chemical fertilizers because we know that chemical fertilizers contain nitrogen phosphorus potassium which are micronutrients these are the micronutrients you know you can think of and excess use of fertilizers during the farming causes micronutrient imbalance because the soil you are giving artificially if we are giving artificially you know soil will be imbalance maybe you are adding more than what is required. So, excess of anything is bad right you need to know that what are the things and there will be also imbalance because of root will be taking and then it will be not taking all the thing it will be remaining I will be talking about later on about you know like root how they take and what will be the size of roots if we use chemical fertilizer if you use natural farming all those things I will be talking about little bit later on particularly when I will go to the natural farming. Excess is a particular affect the soil fertility adversely and also the productivity as I told just now that which my own experience talking with the farmers nearby the Kanpur area they are saying they are using last number of you know large amount of fertilizer for the same amount of crop production in the same land right over the years and that is true that you can see I mean you can ask anybody and you are having also data nowadays internet you can get the data and maybe from reliable source because the internet one has to be careful about the data right you can go to the government sources some other thing then you can find out what are the consumption you know I have so new already that. So, there is a nitrate pollution like excess nitrogen nitrogenous fertilizers leach deep into the soil because you are using a lot of water also irrigation you know like and that is a ground water you are using using the pump you know power right electricity and then diesel and the lift irrigation system has now come up right and you just press a button and then water will be spread over this thing. So, and it is sometimes I have seen at least in the nearby Kanpur area that is they use a lot of water unnecessarily and that can contaminate the ground water also and that is happening in lot of areas and other water pod is nearby is being spoiled by the you know nitrolysis fertilizer and if the concentration of nitrate in the drinking water excess 25 milligram per liter it affects mortality rate and the low weight of the new born babies which is basically these you know low weight at a thing known as a blue baby syndromes right and which is showing I will show you a diagram maybe next slides that and blue baby syndrome refers to at least two situations one is cyanotic heart means you know there will be heart arteries which will be you know be thicker and then there will be thinner that problem will be there and this mathemoglobinemia that means like anemia you know like blood will be less and then now it will be little bit different than that so this causes a problem in the blood itself. So, you can look at this term I am not you know sure about that but you look at that so what is that I mean this is causing problem which will be with the baby itself you know then where you will go right. So, these are very serious problem of the blue baby syndromes and there is another problems which come euthrophication. Euthrophication basically when you use excess fertilizer that can pass to the nearby water bodies and as a result this there will be over nourishment in this pond water bodies and which is known as eutrophication because the over nourishment if over nourishment will be there then what will happen that the algae you know there will be lot of growth in algae at the faster rate and then they will grow very rapidly right and then again they will die and then as a result because their life is short and they die and pollute the water affecting the aquatic life adversely that you might have seen that in your you know observation if you are having good observation see the cause is this one. So, therefore, this causes and that is the problem if you look at this pesticide there are two kinds of pesticide people use first generation pesticide use sulfur arsenic lead and mercury to kill pest look at these are all you know dangerous you know once you doubt it but we are using the second generation of course the DDT what is dichloro-difenyl trichloroethane used to kill the pests and these pest is organic nature of course but pest protect or corrupt from severe losses due to pest but they have several side effects you know you can think of there are several side effects it should not be used as such and side effects of pesticide as I told that basically they talk non target organisms suppose you want to kill X but now you will be killing YZ and you know other things and which are beneficial. So, several insectide kill not only the target space but also the several beneficial and organism which are not of target and as I told that after you know use this pest several times the people those are also living organism they try to resist and certain pest of course certain things may not resist properly but certain pests that could manage to survive become highly resistance to all kinds of pesticides you know and though these pests are called as super pest like super man you know they become super pest. So, and bio magnifications is another thing most pest here non biodegradable right it is not it cannot be degraded by the soil or other things. So, get into food chain which is known as bio accumulation it will getting accumulated and these pesticides in bio accumulation form are harmful to the human beings and we as I told it will remain for your body chain you know chain food chain for several time also in your own body right and it will be transmitted you know various forms and surface and groundwater pollution you know like toxicity to aquatic wildlife and human through drinking waters right all those things. Risk of cancers like pesticide enhances the risk of getting cancer in two ways it acts as a carcinogen also and it indirectly spoils the immune system you might be aware there is a train known as cancer train which is originated from Punjab you are aware all of you there is a train all cancer patient will be coming you know that is why people call it cancer because they in Punjab Haryana region they are using these pesticides and fertilizers to larger extent they can say the rice what you call wheat bowl or the food bowl of India but they are really spoiling their own health and giving us food and that is also not of good quality. So, I will stop over here and we will be looking at the what you call disadvantages or the of the using this modern farming in the next lecture and later on I will tell about like what is the quality of food we are using and then we will be looking at basically why we need to go for the ancient technology for the agriculture. Thank you very much.",
