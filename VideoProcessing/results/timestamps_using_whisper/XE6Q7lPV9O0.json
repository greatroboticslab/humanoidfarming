They did it by following their principles, by being the best and by being honest to their customers. D.I.S. Technology-Driven, People Focus. I think the unique thing about Johnson Tractor maybe doesn't unique to us, but our industry is an awful lot of hard work. In the spring and the fall, I came from the banking world and we worked hard there, but this is different. The pace in the spring and the fall is very hectic. We try to do what we can to keep our customers going and eliminate any downtimes they might have. And I see our employees giving 110, 120 percent during those times. And I think that is unique. They seem tired sometimes, but happy to do it. It's a different pace and it isn't for everybody, but we have surrounded ourselves with an awful lot of good people who are very committed to their jobs. And I think that's good for us and it's especially good for our customers. And I think employees have a way of working with each other and teaching each other. They sort of start to learn and I think we all have what's acceptable in a workplace and what is the norm. The owner Eric worked very hard during those busy months too. And I think that's an example. We try to be flexible with our employees as far as we don't want them to miss family events and trying to schedule their time appropriately. So I think they see that and they're willing to maybe go the extra mile when we need them as well. So I think they learn from each other. I think we all try to have a team approach. It's fun to see them problem solving with a technician and a parts person. And maybe Leo and Eric all working on something together to get a farmer going. And that's what it's all about. And I think they enjoy the challenge. In a small community in the Pacific Northwest, a dynamic company is growing. This company has served the equipment dealer market for 30 years.
