  "text": "Pruning your cucumber plants is such a great way to promote better air circulation which promotes better plant growth and prevents disease and pest issues plus it makes harvesting so much easier. So here's how you do it. So here's a cucumber plant that I did a little pruning on already and I just wanted to show you all the main parts of the plant. So we have our main stem that goes all the way up this trellis and right here we have a sun leaf. Then right here in the nook we have the blossom where the cucumber will grow and another sun leaf. And as you work your way up the plant you will see right here we have this sun leaf, we have the main stem, we have the blossom and then right down here we have a sucker and this is what could be pruned off. But ideally you want your plant to have plenty of air circulation so you can see this one that I already pruned up. I pruned off most of the suckers and I left some leaves to provide shade but there's plenty of air circulation which will promote healthy growth.",
