  "text": "Today we don't need to cut down more forests. We have enough land in this planet for production for everybody. When my father took over this property 15 years ago, he had a forest. When we don't have forests, we have nothing. No birds, no animal, no trees. You know, it looks sad, it looks completely open. And the summer was so hot. I started planting the first trees because I was looking for the shade, you know. We are human people and we make impact. This is true. You know, all the time we make an impact. But sustainability for me is when the impact is less. My dream is to create a sustainable farm. This is my work. Agroforestry for me is one ecosystem to produce sustainable products today, tomorrow and also in the future. The canopy is really important because they permitted the connectivity for the different ecosystems. The forest produced the condition for the healthy rain. The trees help other plants to survive better here in the farm. In the farm, in the forestry ecosystem, we have around 22 different crops. Bananas are different species. Pineapples, white, yellow, yellow, we have sour sap. Six different species of cedrics. We have cinnamon, we have vanilla, we have cacao. Beginning with her. But when the people can see results and the people start to believe, ah, it's possible to do different. In this moment, my father starts to believe he's happy, really, really happy. The human people, unfortunately, forget, you know, can we need the forest around the world, not just the tropical forest. All the forests around the world, you know. The tropical rainforest is not too much. But when we destroy the small area in the planet, we destroy practically the balance in the planet. We need to find solutions. We can find more possibilities to take something for the forest and not to cut down. We need to have crops and trees, even together in the ecosystem. Agroforestry can exist everywhere in the tropical ecosystem around the world. This is one of the solutions to save the forest.",
