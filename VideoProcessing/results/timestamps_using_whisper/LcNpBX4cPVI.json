  "text": "If you want to grow garlic like this in your home, first take a few bulbs of garlic. After that, remove the skin and slightly peel the top part of the garlic. Now take some plastic bottles and cut them like this and fill them with water. Now place the garlic one by one on top of each hole in the plastic bottle. Then pour water in it in such a way that the bottom part of the garlic gets submerged in water. After five days, you will see that the garlic has started to sprout, and in about 15 days, it will have taken the form of a complete plant with well-developed roots and leaves. Now separate these plants one by one and plant them elsewhere. Keep in mind that there should be a distance of three to four inches between two plants. Now your garlic plant is ready, and with proper care, it will produce a mature bulb after a certain amount of time.",
