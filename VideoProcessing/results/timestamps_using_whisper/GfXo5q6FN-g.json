  "text": "Today we're sitting down with Wendell Berry and Mike Klein along with Brian Wood and Wendell has been a family friend of ours. I don't remember the first time you and Tony 83 and I think dad met Gene Logsdon in 1980 and then Was it okay, yeah, so We're just really glad to have the opportunity to sit down here with you and if you could just give us a little bit of an introduction About the area here as well and then we're going to get into you know the The past 100 years of agriculture here what we see in the future and just kind of kind of talk about what you've seen So Wendell, thanks for joining us Well, you're more than welcome as you know We're talking here in Henry County, Kentucky. It was one of the Larger producers of burly tobacco this county in the Old days When the Program was still in effect and so on. I don't know how it ranks now There's still some tobacco grown around here, but it's grown on contracts and the Asking price is gone But this is a county Topographically very broken up into ridges and and Creek valleys Drainages that are too steep for anything but trees or grass and It's a county that That calls for careful use I Ask a very good farmer years ago if he thought we could Safely break 10% of this county in any year and he said more like five So it's a county that needs to be in grass Tobacco was an ideal crop because of its small acreage Acreages To fit the agriculture here that was Highly diversified in animals Sheep cattle and hogs and in the earliest part of my life the workstock horses mules also now Now the tobacco program has gone Tobacco is no longer a standard Source of income on every farm The old diversity of livestock and crops is gone and Mostly the agriculture here now divides between people who are still raising cattle cowcafe operations mostly and Farmers who've gone to planting Soybeans and corn this has happened over the last six years maybe Planning soybeans and corn on Fields that had been mainly in grass or entirely in grass all my life This is very hard to watch now you grew up here Were you away from this area growing up and then then moved back you were here your whole life I Was I'm a native of this county and My mother Was born and grew up at Port Royal just at the top of the hill my father was born and grew up At what we call our home place about five miles from here about four miles on the other side of Port Royal and I Lived here constantly until I was 14 years old At which time I was alarmed to discover that by my misbehavior in school and my very bad grades I had earned myself a trip to a military school And so I was absent during the school year for four years and then after that in college but always there would be I would return here in the holidays and Worked on the farms In the Summer times Even when I was in school from the time I was pretty small played on the farms before that Where did you go to school I went to school here in Newcastle through the eighth grade and then I was sent to a School known as Millersburg Military Institute MMI which stood for mother's marching idiots according to some My dad sent me some questions that he wanted me to ask you and so I'm gonna I'm gonna preface this by In the back end of the question in quotations. He says dad wants to hear this Could you tell us a little bit about your time at Stanford and your friendship with Wallace Stegner? well, I Had the great good fortune to Receive a Writing fellowship to Stanford in 1958 Tony and I were married by then and our daughter was a baby and We went out to Stanford my was my first trip Tonya's a California girl She was born out there and a lot of her growing up was done in the Bay Area and But I this was new country to me and And I was raised to think that the bluegrass pasture was the Ultimate in landscape and I pretty much resented the deserts and the Rocky Mountains and all that I wanted better pasture But anyway, I learned to like all that Wallace Stegner Was as I now Understands to a fairly young man in those days a very handsome man A very very much a man of honor and honesty He didn't have a program to Present that he expected his students to subscribe to He didn't try to indoctrinate us in any kind of ideology But he gave us very good Criticism of our work I didn't I Didn't really come under his influence For several years not until Tony and I moved back here and I had really understood that I was going to be a placed writer and I had to look around then for for elders Who could show me how to be a responsible? Kentucky writer and Wallace Stegner of course was an exemplary Western writer because he had taken responsibility For his region not just as subject matter for his fiction but as a conservationist and so then I began to really Benefit from his influence and his example he was a A thoughtful man He was very generous And I have an idea that that I still don't know the extent to which He helped me get jobs and so on after I left Stanford settling here pretty much pretty much Made him indispensable to me as a teacher an example and the way you hadn't been before He was the kind of man whose presence made you feel like you needed to be at work that thing How about did we get that? All right, well, that's that's Staggering and stuttering at the subject enough, but it's a big subject When when did you have your first? Book published what year was that I had a little novel called Nathan Coulter that I had started and Maybe I got the Stanford Fellowship because of the six-year so pages I had of that book and By the time I got out there, maybe I had more but then I Stayed through my my year as a fellow and then Mr. Stegner asked me if I wanted to would stay on as an instructor and teach a course and That was a way to Have an income and of course I stayed I was and Tony and I both were glad enough to have another year out there and And Who I'd worked pretty constantly on that little novel and it was published Just before we finally left after the second year. It was published in April 1960 and it took about 30 years for us to make significant income from my right Doesn't happen overnight. No, not hardly Now when your your book the unsettling of America was published in 77 Which was the year I was born You know, it's it's 2017 now we're looking at 40 years Are you seeing what you were expecting to be seeing today It's hard to talk about Expectations. Well, I can't I can't do it quickly or simply I had what proved to be the Extremely naive idea that there must be a public conversation going on about agriculture And when Tony and I came back here, I could see that everything I loved about this place And the ways of farming here that I'd grown up learning all that was in jeopardy and I thought that by Writing about the situation here I could take part in this Supposed public conversation. Well, what I didn't know was that there was no public conversation about farming or land use in this country and Moreover there is not such a conversation now What I had to say was not welcome in what I would Call the official forces of farming not in the ag schools not of course in the in agribusiness and the corporations and And not in the The Bureaus of the government that I was very clearly a dissenter and I Knew That in my writing I was very much my father's son. I was my brother's brother And I had some pretty good teachers farmers One in particular who were were Convinced Hereditary agrarians who had those values and could speak of them, but there were Outside my family and my my friends here I had no ally that I knew and Slowly Over the years as I wrote and published I I didn't Sell many copies of my books, but I picked up friends A handful Jean Logson in about 1970 Maury Tallinn in 74 West Jackson in 1980 and your dad in 83 and those That was the The force that I knew about we were the Those four people were my allies and fortunately my friends and it was something wonderfully sustaining about that that shared Friendship and goodwill and conversation and really quite a lot of laughter It was if without that I couldn't have made it now I Thought by getting into the supposed Public conversation I might be able to help preserve the The things that were good in my home country here and Of course, I couldn't and I haven't Didn't understand how much worse the situation would be in 40 years And I look upon that book as a tragic book Because it's more relevant now Than it was then I mean when I wrote that book five percent of the population of our country were farming Now it's somewhere of less than one and There is no public interest in these issues of land use Nobody cares that these Huge acreages of corn and soybeans for instance are lying bare all winter without a cover crop The people supposedly interested in carbon sequestration and so on don't care That there's nothing green on these fields for months after months and every year month after month every year and They don't care that most of the rivers In rural America are polluted or toxic West Jackson lately talked to somebody who was working on this issue of the rivers and Ask her if it would be true to say that that there wasn't an unpolluted river in the country and she said that is a allowable Possibility that there's not one West also sent me a Photocopy of a sign that he'd found in a motel in Colorado That warned pregnant women and nursing mothers not to drink the water You know going back to what you were saying about you know the unsettling of America how you were trying to get a conversation going and Yeah, you ended up with some friends and nothing else. That's right Being that Brian and I work in the organic industry now with a lot of farmers I don't think you guys have any idea how much of an influence you've had in a positive way with that Where even in conventional agriculture you are hearing a lot more about cover crops getting Something green on that field during the winter Being careful about erosion. There's a there's a lot of positives happening right now I see but on a very very small scale Yes, it's not touching the big guys, but you're seeing it on the small farms Yeah, I know that a little bit and and it's very moving to me that the bunch of us have had an effect Even a small effect it's very gratifying and and It's you could perhaps regarded as hope giving but I've begun to Warn the young people I talked to about hope. It's possible to hope Too much and for the wrong things and so I've been telling them the important thing is to find out what's right and then do it There's a great sustenance in that and There are a lot of farmers who know what the right way is and who will tell you that they can't afford to do it and That's that's what I find encouraging with with organics and within organic Valley is There is enough of a premium there that it allows some of these farmers to to go back to more Practices and then they end up realizing that wow this actually doesn't cost more and it's more effective and it's working it works others You I think it's necessary to say that our cheap food policy has been a Farm destroying policy food is too cheap and so I would want to argue that efforts like Organic Valley Are not putting a premium On the cost of milk But simply bringing the price up to something like justice Fairness fairness would be a better word This is a very complex situation food is too cheap People are not having to pay as high a proportion of their income to eat as they ought to But what to Justly complicate matters it's necessary to say that for poor people it's too expensive And we I think we can't afford if we want to be righteous we can't afford to forget either of those things Now we've covered a lot of ground coming up to you know you settling back here after Stanford Now we had talked a little bit earlier about the tobacco Co-op and can you because I do work for organic Valley and we do work within the cooperative structure Can you kind of explain how the tobacco growers got together and started that co-op and how their Supply management, I don't think you're allowed to call it supply management anymore because that's called collusion But it's collusion. Yeah Well But it works within the cooperative structure. We've got to talk about supply management because it makes sense Supply management simply means That if you've got a limited supply You need to be careful how you use it up If it's coming to the end of the of winter and you've got still a month of cold and Maybe a month supply of firewood you manage the supply. That's all there is to it It makes sense. It's just common sense That's the way it should be done Economics, you know at root means household management and and Still I think if we want the clues the clues about How to have a healthy economy we have to go to the household for our analogies You don't cook with everything cook all the food you have If you have a limited supply you ration it out That's the rule that's the rule in household management, it's the rule in farm management And it ought to be the rule in the management of a regional or a national economy So if you want farmers to continue to farm you can't use Overproduction as a way to get rid of them and that's pretty much what we've done after World War two the word went out from the think tanks and the government experts and so on that we had too many farmers and a Deliberate effort was made to get rid of them to reduce the farm population which of course increased the the numbers in the labor pool and It increased the numbers of consumers If you can get all all these farmers to stop raising home gardens and Managing their households in that old economic way they did That's better for the corporate suppliers So it wasn't They didn't reduce the number of farmers In the interest of the farmers and they didn't do it in the interest of the farm land That was completely irresponsible and Fundamentally greedy Policy what was the justification for too many farmers? What did they say in that report? What was the justification for too much farming that? this miraculous industrialization was going to take place and the farming would be done primarily by technological devices and We wouldn't need them. Of course that leaves out quite a lot my one of my best mentors Who my met just in time Henry Bessoud and a great sheep breeder from Clark County? Over by Winchester. He had a farm called Vinewood farm that he He rescued That it was washed to pieces and he Healed it up and made it over and into a great farm He made himself into a great farmer But Henry said if a man loves his land, he'll save it And that's what the policymakers you see forgot if you Exize love As a motive for land use you've really brought your land into jeopardy There's no help for it We've got if we're going to put the farm situation back together Gather the scattered pieces and put them back together. We're going to have to find a way to Put the scattered pieces of humanity back together too and love is an indispensable ingredient World of you know, there's plenty of it in your family. These people are working lovingly Because they don't they don't have more land and they can get around to with their love for one reason The scales right it makes love effective at a certain scale and it beyond that scale it isn't effective But we've also probably got to go back to that law love thy neighbors thyself too as an essential ingredient because You can't do it by yourself. You can succeed you can't be whole by yourself On the supply management going back to the tobacco co-op did now you had mentioned earlier that They didn't they had a minimum that they were allowed to produce so anybody could be could be coming in with Was that was that based on acreage or yield or what what were the we'll have to get into that in steps the burly the the effort to make a cooperative effort that would involve the producers of burly tobacco. That's a variety Actually, it was very much in demand as a cigarette tobacco that effort started about 1920 and From then until 1941 it was a kind of on and off business For the reasons that I spoke of earlier Not everybody would get in not everybody would cooperate They had a good year that reduced their perception They that reduced the perceived value of the cooperative principle a bad year brought it back and What made the difference was that under the new deal the The Roosevelt farm program made it possible for the co-op to receive a loan a government loan against the crop and That loan as far as I know was always repaid and That really was the only Government expense it wasn't a handout. It was not some form of governmental charity What the loan made possible was for the farmer to be paid If his crop wasn't bought by a tobacco company To get to get the crop the corporation had to pay a penny a pound above the support price the Support price was determined by the principle of parody which was that the gainfully employed farmer out to be able to Participate in the economy about the same level as a gainfully employed city person So they put in they've limited the the supply and they underpinned the price by the on the parody principle and the the Buyers the corporations that bought the crop had to Give their expected need in other words the co-op Was informed of the likely demand and could adjust the supply to the demand Now that would have started they would have gotten those demands before the crop was planned. Yes Okay, yes, and then they the the allotments were given out according to the What was needed if Legit or Reynolds or American didn't buy the crop didn't bid more than a penny a pound above the support price then the co-op took the crop under loan and paid The farmer would be paid at the warehouse Just like everybody else so there was nobody who was having say wait a minute. I got to have my money Ever they had it you see and The story of the of the How they manage the supply now there's this is a very complicated story But At first they attempted to control the supply by allotting acreages And these were Remarkably small in comparison to the farm size. I mean a 300 acre farm might have a four acre tobacco base But at the same time industrialization was taking part in in The economy of the farms The experts From the official forces would come out and they'd say to the farmer well you can only grow these this many acres Let me tell you how to grow more tobacco on those acres And so the era of nitrogen fertilizer began in the tobacco economy I mean they were just Practically blasting it out of the ground with with nitrogen and One of the results would be overproduction One Astonishing thing that happened was it but I believe it was 1955 If there's a transcript I can correct things like this, but I believe it was 55 they had too much tobacco in storage and All this Was done by referendum the growers voted and so the Proposal had to go out from the co-op to the members would you be for a 25% reduction in Production for this coming year and they voted to do it and That was because enough of the old ones were still around you know And they knew why the co-op existed in the first place had been hungry enough to know and they voted In effect against themselves you might say Accepted in fact they were voting for the survival of the program and hints of their own Family economy Eventually they shifted it And my dad worked very hard on this Among the growers and in Washington they shifted it from an acreage allotment to a poundage allotment and That cured that part of the problem Because then if they knew roughly what they could produce per acre and if they thought they could produce more per acre It would free up acre for something else. It just yes So this you see a tobacco was a small At best as it was originally it was a crop of small acreage And so it fitted very well into a highly diverse very conservative way of farming here One of these Rules That we're into the culture now No grain is going to leave my farm if it doesn't walk off In other words every farm was great was raising only the corn or whatever that it could feed Now they would occasionally sell the wheat that came from the cover crop on the tobacco and corn fields But I've fed a lot of wheat to hogs Back in those days They've put the wheat in the barrel Poor put it will put water in it, you know and ferment that weed you'd stir it up and Slop the hogs with that fermented wheat and they you know, they didn't hesitate They weren't finicky eaters when you put that out for them Grind it grind the wheat and do that or you could do it with a whole grain. I guess you Didn't wait for it to swell after it got inside the animal But that all that fitted very well, but then this other thing was cranking up to more More traction power enabled bigger Acreages and I'm sure that I forget the year now They permitted the bases to be leased off the farm and This permitted Crop eight acreages to accumulate Where they'd had Four or five acres or maybe farming on two or three farms ten fifteen acres they'd have 30 or 60 or a hundred and First thing you know The Mexicans are coming in It was originally a Crop made with family labor Made with neighborhood labor exchanges of work among neighbors and the rule there was exemplary Perfectly Christian, although I never heard the preachers talk about it the rule was That you joined together Because alone you were not as effective you needed your neighbors The other rule was nobody's done till everybody's done When you got your crop finished you didn't quit and go home You stayed till the last of the last crop was in the barn and safe and if I'm remembering correctly there was Not well around here the one with the work people I work with There was no settling up Nobody ever got to the end said I owe you half day you owe me two days This didn't happen and so the community thrived also as a as a membership so The government help it seems to me Significant that the government help was not brought in by outside experts The co-op was formed by people like my dad who were involved in farming and involved in the communities And they knew the people they were trying to help they knew the crop they knew the economy and the market and When the government loan then came to them They were motivated to administer it in the common interest and It seems to me that given that way the Government loan the help to the farmers To give them protection on the market was a perfectly appropriate thing for the government to do Mean if you can strew that the government ought to protect us from our enemies That is our military opponents Why isn't it just as reasonable that it should protect us from our economic Enemies the people who want to pillage and plunder and take away our work at no no return It's a perfectly appropriate thing to do The trick I think is to keep the outside experts at bay That's a problem. It's a problem. It's hard to get that done now. I'll tell you I've visited once a very remarkable Amish farmer up near Fort Wayne Martin Will smoker and he had a nephew Martin both of them were splendid Belgian horse breeders Among other things but Mari Taline sent me up there because will had had made a ground-driven hay baler And my first surprise was that this ground-driven hay baler was not a gym crack. It was a new John Deere baler And the Gear ratios and so on have been exquisitely calculated had a bull wheel and He could just take eight horses and pull that baler in operation with 150 bales of hay on the wagon behind it Of course, it's flat up there But he worked eight brood mares who were royalty in the Belgian breed They all had colts left of the left them in the barn They didn't have an ounce of surplus flesh. They were hard work of hard and I Bet the bunch of them didn't have five hundred dollars worth of harness All together. I mean every people who were Taking care of things patching the old harness making it work But After In the course of my conversation with will I asked him you get any help from the extension service. Oh He said yes when we have a problem We sometimes get help from them and I'd already started home and was some ways down the road for I understood They defined the problem they didn't invite the extension agent to come out and look around see if you saw anything wrong They defined the problem and so they controlled the knowledge and the expertise that was applied They also put on a horse show will and and Martin I had Den with me and they began to Lead out One splendid Belgian horse after another Will had a great famous stallion named Constrico and But they had a they were absolutely tops the two of them and they were leading these wonderful horses out and Trotting them up and down the road, you know and showing them to us and it went on and on And I finally said Martin, I know it's your supper time. You don't have to be showing us these horses Oh, he said around here. We eat when there's nothing better to do You see that's of the essence of it to me the excitement the love of it and When you see a farmer that loves we talked about loving the land Yeah, but when you see them love the animals and the land together You see how everything is taken care of because there's that connection to it and that goes a long ways Working with animals and the land absolutely if if you work stock if your traction power is coming from animals Then it's creatures all the way and you love essentially the the the animal and the crop and The pasture in the same way with the same kind of heart And you Though you that that keeps your motive intact across the whole spectrum of the work and the The living creatures that you're working with So there's delight Delayed my father gave all that time in his life To the the Burley co-op lots of time lots of effort lots of worry and thought But his passion was grass and he thought that for us here in the kind of big Vulnerable land we have that the one crop we could grow year after year to our advantage was grass Mm-hmm So you know there's that passion that capacity to be pleased to be delighted Look at it. Look at it. He'd say Look at the look at the cover on this pasture and say this is what we're going into the winter with took me a long Time to even know what he was talking about but there it was he was tickled to death Yeah Driving down here this morning I saw the one farm down the road bunch of beef cattle out and I was like, oh, that's that's the grass You're talking about in the river bottoms and then Half a mile down the road you saw that huge flat Soybean field that who knows how many feet of topsoil has left that? Well, this you see there's that whole valley side there the bluffs and That water that comes off there has got to cross that bottom to get to the river and that is completely disregarded That you have a field with a bunch of Kentucky 31 in it some old Fescue that's not leaving That's not leaving that's holding steady right there another thing that That hardens me is that if you have that Kentucky 31 Fescue on a hillside like this one behind the house You can't get rid of it. No, but the bluegrass will persist along with it and the clover So there's that good Your dad's book is full of delight That's going back to you know, you talked about using horsepower and how then the whole farms connected to a living thing I don't think dad would nearly have the stories If he didn't have to rest the horses at the end of the field and And lay there on his back looking at migrating hawks and doing all this stuff and same thing with with The family lunchtime the horses need a break you go in and you eat dinner with the family so And in the way their farms are set up. It just makes makes perfect sense Unfortunately, we've we've come so far that That is not reality to 99% of the farmers I mean it just when you dig yourself a hole that big What do you do you talk to some of these farmers these you know these very large-scale farmers, you know Profitability is not something they're worried about it's just cash flow and what is cash flow? It just means that they need to do more and more and more and more and it's like the story you told before lunch You know they need more land so they need a bigger tractor Well, then they need more land to support that bigger tractor and it's just a bigger tractor That much land and they've got their computers in their hands all the time finding out moment-to-moment How they're doing that changes they just will be in Las Vegas Playing the slots except they ain't having as much fun as people Well, they're losing as much money though Wes ask you dad when oh you dead told Wes I read San County Arman Act while I was plowing West said oh you mean you read it while you rested the horses. Well They said I did that for a while, but then I got so interested in the book. I read and plowed at the same time Hey, see that's that reveals a lot because There were more than one mind involved And David was benefiting from his horses his team's knowledge of how to plow He didn't have to look all the time to keep his furrow horse in the furrow you see and I'm thinking more and more in terms of the the economic value of intangibles and There David's education was coming to him by courtesy of his having a smart team and a well-broke team But sheep don't naturally come to the fold at night you You can train them to and If your fold is down the hill their instinct is telling them to spend the night up at the top of the hill Very good for the ground because you know what the drainage off the roosting place is fertilizing the slope below But if you've got a predator problem the way we do here you got to get them down into the fold They learn to come They learn to come and they come I've got a dog. I can send the dog out, but they know already when they see the dog coming what they're gonna have to do It's a one and it pays off It shortens the time that I have to spend doing that work and I've been telling people you know you well your Scattle market goes down people get rid of all their cows then too many of them, you know buy in when the price goes up again, so Being have them in production just in time for it to go down again, but Nothing more short-sighted than a farm. You bring a bunch of big stock big animals on your farm And they don't know where they are or where the gates are or what they're supposed to do or what to expect from you You're gonna pay for that they're gonna you're gonna pay for it with gates defenses Trouble time So there's no way to measure their knowledge Which sometime ago Man named James Rebank was here and James Rebank wrote a wonderful book called The Shepherd's life I think either a shepherd's life or the shepherd's life. I think it's the shepherd's life and He he lives in the Lake District In Northern England the famous tourist draw For this landscape is very beautiful the romantic poets, you know a lot to that country But he grows he produces The only thing that can be produced in that very difficult mountainous landscape, and that is a breed of sheep called herdwick They're very courseful, but they can live in that country only feed that that country produces and For hundreds and hundreds of years that's been so so and they You've got three Cultures operating there. Well one thing they do there is called hefting sheep that are born on a certain Definable part of the landscape always live on there. They know where they belong. So you've got three cultures operating there a human culture a Sheep culture because they're their generation after generation on the same land and a Dog culture So the shepherd and his sheep and his dog they're all operating making that landscape productive for human good out of a Cultural resource if it weren't for the cultural resource it couldn't be done. It's just Wonderful and it's satisfyingly complicated, you know, you'd say well now send your expert in here and beat this He couldn't couldn't They think they could But they think they but you're taking 500 yards up into the country couldn't find his way home He'd take his GPS along. I'm sorry. He'd take his GPS along. Oh, yeah, now way back. Yeah The expert knows best right just ask him. That's right. That's right. Well, he used to be you know when they were I was just remembering the other night Back in the day when they The tobacco allotments were in acres. They'd send a lot of High school and college boys made money in the summer by surveying the the tobacco patches and Some could could get along and some had a little trouble But there was a story about this fellow that went to this farm up in the mountains and he was Had come to survey the tobacco And the farmer said sure you're welcome. There's the tobacco crop go right to it And so on but I for you now, I wouldn't go in that holler up there well the young man said I Have a card in my pocket. It means That I can go any place on your farm that I want to Well farm said go to it So he went on in the house in the 80s dinner And when he came out here this boy came out of the forbidden holler with the bull right on his heels He's bumping along the yard help help help the farmer said show him your card So We we touched on a lot of things coming up to it I want to kind of go back to you know the unsettling of America and now Do you think that the advent of GMOs and and that life is eight resistant the round of ready crops? Do you think? Has that changed your outlook? No, has that had negative positive neutral effect on what was happening with land use? That it only increases the displacement of the farmer from the farm There is It seems to me that what's involved is a kind of death wish that we We're wishing all the time against our physical existence Somehow the ideal is to have a job that doesn't involve any work and Farmers feel like there is entitled to that as anybody else less work and more pay less work and more pay or no work and and all the pay or whatever and And But as I've suggested in talking about this the creatureliness of it What's necessary to good use of the land is love or affection however you'd want to say it and this involves Bottley contact presence I mean what a farmer can learn from walking across the field Through his feet he knows the condition of the ground His West talks about the eyes to acres ratio, which means That if the eyes to acres ratio is right the farmer or the rancher doesn't have more land Then he or she can look at and with understanding I think that's a key right there is look at with Understanding you can look at a lot of lot of land. It doesn't mean you're understanding. That's going on there This is this changes the the human Understanding of the land from scenery to Well, it changes the nature of the land in the farmers understanding from scenery to a fellow creature Something is that's alive that needs to be nurtured and loved same as any child we could say a member of the family Yeah, yeah So this is extremely important as for the GMOs the What we're really talking about is the necessity for local adaptation and it's a wonder to me that all the Biology that the farm experts and so on have studied hasn't told them That humans too are subject to this law this need for local adaptation So I think any good farmer will tell you that What will work on the neighbors farm might not work on my farm Mm-hmm, or he'll know that in this thing that looks like one field there may be three or four different kinds of land Spots you know the column there's a spot out there that's kind of waxy when it turns up So what what the Monsanto approach One seed and one herbicide for any place Is completely Opposed to that need for local adaptation And it's strictly monoculture because the only You can only control If you're going with a monoculture because if you have a diverse field with all these diverse plants in there There's no way to To chemically feed that or kill stuff unless it is strictly mono Well, and that's another way of saying it's extremely simplified the imposition the imposition of an extremely simple System on an extremely complicated original ecosystem So there's no room in it for any sensitivity At all you can learn to farm the Monsanto way if you don't read anything But the owner's manuals and the instructions on the bottles in the bags You don't have to know your land And well, I mean isn't that kind of what they sell that product on I mean Essentially it made farming easier and it goes back to like you were saying earlier We want less work more pay and that's kind of the Stick that that that the big egg companies have sold these These products on but it's gone the opposite direction The problem is the farmer doesn't control the ratio between work and pay The suppliers control that ratio and so there's a lot of frustration in it a lot of suffering actually the I Know that these farmers are Handling an immense amount of money or credit But it's going straight through them Going through them like a dose of salt. Yep, and it doesn't even stop at the community level either I mean, that's the that's the part that carries it out of the county Carries it out of the state. Yep. It's gone. It's just like a safe and right from the bank to the supplier Well here we've got Some forest you can look up and down the river you're looking at thousands of acres of forest on this valley these valley sides And they're logging them really pretty heartlessly but you can imagine of a Forest economy in a place like this that would Start with the care of the living forest the standing forest and it would go on from that to The people who would log it The horses the people who would supply the horses people grow feed for the horses people who You see the blacksmiths the farriers The harness makers it would become elaborate locally and As you elaborated that Structure that economic structure you would increase the number of people who are working in effect Who are acting in effect as a lobby for the good care of the local forest? And I think that's what we had a well interest. You know Think about Mount Hope in those little towns up there in Holmes County There's still that that web that connects the farmers and the merchants and the Repair people and so on well on one of our recordings with Mike's dad He said you know he told the story of going to the post office and the The postmaster was You know shuffler it was counting the money for the day and he had these worn out one dollar bills And he said you guys never leave town and David just said you know, that's that's the point You know this money is staying in the community. That's right And well and that's why they that's why those small compute small communities thrive Yeah, it's because the local farmer is spending money at the local business And it just it makes its round and that's stopped. I mean we drove through I don't know what this little town just North of us English. I think English. Well, that's a railroad town. You see well, it looks like it's seen its Better days. Yes it has That English you see is built on there's slew hollers there And they just built on a set of backbones And most of those houses don't have backyards So you speak you hardly get through English because of the kids and the playing and the people gossiping and so on out in the road I still remember When Walmart first came to town how Dad was devastated. Yeah, because he said every evening that money is wired To Bentonville, Arkansas. That's right sucked Right out of the community. He said it is a big vacuum and It really didn't I Didn't understand really what he was talking about until years later Yeah, you know the money that has worked so hard for within the community they get the money and just like that it's going and When you look at all the little shops that we have in Holmes County that are That they survive because of the local Economy that is there and to know that you are doing Permanent damage to the community by spending your money at the Walmart's and and I if I wish there was some way we could Educate people on that because most people don't think but we've educated what we've educated out of our people is the idea that a living isn't enough Or a decent living isn't enough We've taught people to prefer what we call a killing Which produces conspicuous spending and too much leisure and Well, we talked about cheap food earlier as well and the reason Our country loves cheap food is because then you can have extra money to go spend it on dumb stuff You don't need yes, that supposedly is going to make you happy and bring fulfillment. I Got a letter from a fellow and I've referred to a number of times He was raised in the Licken River Valley over here Licken River goes into the Ohio opposite Cincinnati He was raised over there by an old uncle. I think an old elder in the tobacco patches And he wrote to me because he thought I'd be interested and I was he was right People wonder what comes after The tobacco program I can tell you what comes after the tobacco program dope and addiction it had happened to him Because the kids weren't no longer being raised by their elders Neighbors family members and so on they're not they don't have an economic place. They don't they're not useful anywhere Well this sort of thing needs to be thought about very carefully now in my book I told about Newcastle in 1946 that's the year after World War two It had a population of about 650 people and It had 55 commercial and professional offerings It put an ad in the in the local paper for itself as a place to come and shop It had four grocery stores two hardware stores Four places that worked on cars and sold gas Two blacksmith shops done along and on and then the lawyers and doctors and whatnot Well, it was a great place for a boy to grow up. You could just I mean you could make 50 cents a week Distributing bills from the grocery store or You could have a paper route or Or well one of the grocers hired me one time to trap rats. I Don't think I made with about a dollar and a half, but He gave me 50 cents a rat But that kind of thing you see you were in on the life of the town there are many ways to get involved in the life of the community economic ways not just Freedom to play wherever you want to if you were a boy anyway 55 places and you know then you were the Kids they were known you could My brother and I used to When we were building things we were always doing something with in the order of construction We'd mark our boards and carry them around to the blacksmith shop Because they always had their souls sharp around there And they tolerated it, you know Have a kid in there So I I know this is this is going to be a really huge Probably unanswerable question, but in going back to the unsettling What do you see in 40 years from now you've seen the last 40 up to today Do you see I I mean I know it's a hard question, but do you see the similar amount of change happening or? Are we tapped out on? Destroying it at this rate. I think you know we must be approaching a limit of some kind Where things will begin to go backwards or they'll get better in a In a more authentic way one of the One of the essays in my new book is called leaving the future behind And I began to argue against this obsession that we have with the future because we're so often wrong about it, you know and We we abuse the future I mean we pass our debts to the future and we assume This is perfectly superstitious of us and really makes us look bad We assume that we can go on making the mistakes that we're making Because in the future the technology will be better and the humans a lot smarter and so We're just hand them these problems. This is terrible behavior. It's horrible behavior So what I can tell you is that a book like the unsettling of America the books of that Publications things that's written by Jean Maury Wes your dad have I Can tell you for sure that those people have instructed my children and So Mary started this What she calls the Barry Center and started because she realized that all that work that my dad and his Friends had done was forgotten People were just treating it as of the past and therefore of no interest And So there's that then they are working. I mean it's of very material interest to them that organic Valley started out with seven farmers So there are these things in the wind, you know that are right. That's all you have That's all you have a right to ask if it's if it's right or not Mary Has a daughter now who's involved up there in the Barry Center. She's running the bookstore But also organizing reading groups Reading agrarian books. I didn't expect to see this In my lifetime and it's it's happening and this is not just because of my influence or my dad's or my brother's it's It's Jeans and may know my friends those four men their influence is leaking in here That's when we sat down with Wes We actually had it was the night before a dinner, you know, I asked him, you know when Kind of the five horsemen, you know, who's gonna step in and take over for you? You know you and your friends and West said well you guys are doing that right now And I'm like what doesn't seem like I'm doing anything here But it seems like what what you and your friends have started has grown into something where it's not just five people anymore It's thousands and thousands of people that are seeing the importance of this and it's I think there's actually Enough positive things happening now that it gives me hope Well, you see you don't you're not a you're indicating in various ways that you don't feel this burden that you're carrying And that's because it's internal. It's not a pack on your back. It's somebody's filled up with with Information and instruction it's inside you it's in your heart and And You know we had those My four friends and I Had the old agrarianism in our hearts And we when I met your dad we just started talking We had there was so much that we knew in common and that we felt in common that didn't need to be explained Everybody were in a hallway at Oberlin all these kids going around us this way in that way and we were talking The same way with all the others. I mean You didn't have to say now I've got this agrarianism on my mind. You just knew it Old Jean turned up here He very improbably was working for Farm Journal living in Philadelphia. I had just Fairly recently come home And I published a book of poems called farming a handbook which Some publicist of course it sent to farm journal It was displaced. It was this outer place. There's Jean was the gene got it He picked the book up and he began to read him. Well, this guy You know, I need to talk to him and so he turned up here. Well, we just started talking You know, and so I was getting from him The confirmation that he got from his mother that confirmed what I'd got from my father and his father and so on So that's the way it's gonna work People have it in their hearts. They'll do what their hearts tell them some of them will and that's All you can ask it's all you can ask it's very lovely. It's beautiful if it's beautiful. It's fine You know my great Suspicion of a lot of this clean energy technology is that it's ugly a Field full of solar panels is doing I'm sure a very good thing But it's horrible. I mean what's going on under it? If you've got to have it you ought to put it up here and put the sheep on the ground under it or something And then these great big old wind machines good gracious They're horrible to me have you seen them out West there and well in Western Ohio when you go out 30 past Upper Sundaske they've got hundreds of them out there. Yeah, and they are kind of an eyesore Well, you know what West would ask you Will they in their lifetime make enough energy to reproduce themselves? I Would say the answer is probably no well nobody knows you see it's another Another thing we have we talk very convincingly to ourselves. Well, this is the answer We humans one thing we're very good at is misleading ourselves and We're very superstitious in that way David Aaron felt wrote a book called the arrogance of humanism one time and he talked about The folly of relying on what he called in product analysis Making fun of the polysyllabic language that In product analysis well after we got got the end product then we can subtract Cost from price that sort of thing Nobody says ahead of time. Oh be careful No, because this is the next great thing right that's right. This is the next great thing And somebody gonna put some money in his pocket because of it But you mentioned that that you know kind of what got you through Well finding the other four Friends that sustained you through being and you know a spokesperson for the agrarian lifestyle I guess for lack of a better way of putting it You know on the like Mike was saying on the bright side, you know, it's not a pack That's on our back to try and continue that word because There is a ground swell of people and it's so it's absolutely in the positions We're in we work with farmers that that lived that lifestyle So so that makes it a lot easier to but then there's also this on their grounds swell of people that have been far away from farms for what I think is like instinctually too long they they're feeling the call to come back That's very true And that's why the conversation that we give them has to be Kind and also critical because nobody gets to the point where he doesn't need criticism That is the judgment It's been of enormous work worth to me As a public advocate and going and speaking in meetings is one one to have my brother And I'd call him up and I'd say I'm about to say this can I say that Or I'd send him a draft I'd say would you read this and tell me whether I can say this or not And he'd sometimes he'd say put it on them And sometimes he'd say Wendell I agree with everything you say, but I think we better talk I Took all that seriously, you know, he'd say you're saying it but this is the wrong place to say it and this is invaluable Or I'd say call up Wes and I'd be verging over into something scientific, you know, I'd say Wes can I say this? well you know I began to hear that Then I had to take up on my bit, you know and say well tell me tell me tell me how far I can go or Every time I've mentioned the homage I send something to David. Can I say this? Well, you can call me like the people I work with do yeah That's right. Well somebody you got to have something you can call Because I because we run into the same thing where we're talking about organic Valley and organic farming and We have some things that I might think is really important to talk to the farmers about but I need to vet it through with somebody who Can tell me I'm not sure you want to go there or yes, you're right on track because if you don't Talk to people smarter than yourself You're never going to stay accurate on your That's right, and that's why my brother knowing me would say you think we better talk That's why I'm so lucky that I have a dad to buy that's right to have it that back in valuable You'd well you see what we're getting this down to finally is the ability to talk about scale And If we what we know I can tell you You got I know this from my experiences a writer and from what I know of farming if you get the scale right you can get the form right and The form of a good farm is Just as complex just as demanding as the form of a good novel it really is It's as high a feat you know intellectually and imaginatively as Any other art it's there at that point it's an art and it's a very high art and Then as I suggest that we've got to learn to talk about intangibles what Finally whether you love your farm or not has an economic outcome It just does It's it's really hard to put everything you have within you into something you don't love Absolutely, you know if you love something you're going to nurture and you're gonna take care of it and if you don't care about it You're not gonna take care of it or even worse It's just an economic engine to get to your to get to your end goal of money Well, there's a kind of miracle that happens. I've experienced it over and over again since I was a little little boy My daddy could be very demanding and he was he was he was a hell of a critic he said very high standard and He was afraid for me as he's child, you know And so I got a lot of criticism from my dad But when I was a little little boy He wanted me to go to go with him on some farm expedition and I wouldn't want to go In first place, I liked my mother at one period better by far than I did him For another thing and I Was comfortable with what I was doing and he had enough sense if he took me with him to give me something to do and First thing you know, I'd be into it And everything would be fine If he hadn't done that There would have been that substrangement between us But here I need your help but still a lot of my work has been done indoors because I had to sit down somewhere and And in the wintertime, you know to have to get up out of a comfortable room Nice and warm and all that and go out somewhere and fix a fence You know when you're knowing a Few minutes you won't be able to feel your fingers and so on and it's this is gonna be awful And you tell yourself how awful it's gonna be in five minutes It's just dandy Same in the heat Here you are in a fairly cool place nice breeze blowing and you've got to get out there in this bruising heat this river valley is just a Steamer it's awful And you go out and you know and you if you may have to give you use a little force And you go out and you shed a little sweat you get into it and it's just fine. There's no problem I had to go my Steers are up in a field where there's no water so It freezes every day So I just haul hot water up to him in a tank And but I've got a chip out the ice and yesterday afternoon You know it was really nice and warm in the house and it was about 20 mile an hour wind and 25 degrees and I Was dreading it once I got up there and did it. I actually stood there and watch the steers drink water Like 10 minutes there. I'm like, you know this isn't nearly as cold as I had expected it to be because I was Well, hopefully my heifer isn't freshening today, but it looked like she's going to freshen any day But I just wanted to look at her and it just made me love what I've got. Yeah Yeah, that happens over and over with me. I won't want to go feed my lambs And I'm gonna do it just as fast as I can and get back to the house and First thing, you know, I find that I've got my elbows up on the gate and I'm watching them eat this Well, you know the first rule about cutting ice for your stock is don't stand and cut chop all around yourself Oh, yeah, yeah Fella like around here did that Oh Do you want to talk a little bit about the Berry Center and And kind of what you've got what your daughter Mary's got going on with it and well now Mary is really the authority on the Berry Center and if you Want to talk to her she'll be glad to talk with you and you should call her up all I can tell you about the Berry Center is that it's far beyond anything I ever expected and that Mary is Well, I'm not not Not surprised and she's my daughter and I've known her all her life but She's just astonishingly good at talking to people and talking to audiences and that sort of thing and And dealing with people and I'm Just very proud of her and the Berry Center and all those people who work up there It's just a great thing but You ought to talk to Mary because she knows how it works and what in detail what they're trying to do maybe maybe we should talk to her and get a little and when we Put this out have have a plug in here for the Berry Center Well, it's just a deliverance for me in a way. I mean here it is right here Organic values a kind of a deliverance for me. I mean it means that that my values can work in the in the World they can prove out economically and agronomically and however they need to do it But then here's the Berry Center right here looking around and seeing something needs to be done for these farmers in Henry County and This is a very big deal for my my soul But I could I could hardly be more proud or more grateful And my granddaughter as I say she's into it too, I don't know there's grandchildren around and What they're gonna do finally is an interesting question but Well Bundle I think we're gonna wrap it up. We've taken in more than enough of your time Well, we haven't taken any more than I'm delighted to give you Really do appreciate it. Yes. This was this was a delight sitting down",
