And it takes four to six weeks to plant the crops. After that, if it's dry, we're into irrigation to keep the crops healthy. And in the summertime, we keep the program going and then we start harvest usually the first of August, as soon as the potatoes are matured. After two weeks, then we start harvesting and we go right to the middle of October. And then we're hopefully done. We're down to regular hours in the wintertime. We do maintenance and we check all the equipment over for the following year. And it never seems like we have the data, we have nothing to do. There's always something. We have lots of equipment to check out. And before we're done, it's spring again.",
