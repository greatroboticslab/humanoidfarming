  "text": "Guys, how we doing? Welcome to Good Works Tractors. Beautiful. Spring day. Actually, it's technically winter time still, but a spring feel to it. Going to be aerating the lawn today. Have the new Sweepall 48 inch toe behind, not a three point, but a toe behind sweeper right here. This is a commercial grade unit. All right. And so not for the faint of heart, but it's still actually a very competitive price. If you stack it up against a lot of the three point mounted versions, the difference is going to be this is commercial grade. This is something that they sell a lot of them to rental shops and outfits as well or to commercial contractors because it can withstand that kind of use. But the difference is this is priced competitively with other consumer grade aerators. So this is a product to overview. We're going to give you all the features, everything you need to know about this aerator right here. But we're going to follow it up with a field test using it to core aerate my yard, both front and back here this spring. Hey, so if you end up enjoying this video, I'd love to get a thumbs up from you and make sure you hit that subscribe button right down below. And if you want more information on one of these aerators or another product for your tractor, make sure you read through that description below or head on over to goodworks tractors.com. You know, I took a really quick spin just one pass on the side yard over there. Very impressed with the consistency and the depth of the core plugs that are in here. We have this weighted down with, oh, what did we say? Was it 10? 410 pounds. 410 pounds of suitcase weights. You can weight this down with a lot of different things. I'm just using suitcase weights because I have a whole bolt load of my hand. But you can get this with and without this weight box. You can put a 55 gallon drum of water if you want to, or just get the weight box and fill it full of sand or rock or bags of material, whatever you have on hand. Just something to put in here and fill it up. So you're going to notice this is a drawbar or a receiver type of hookup, not a three point mount. So anybody that has a garden tractor, this is right up the alley for you. You can also use it, of course, on a subcompact or a compact machine. You know, we have a heavy hitch weight bar that's on here and then it has a two inch receiver. So I just have it tied into there just to give me a little bit more flexibility raising it up and down. Not that you really need it, but if I have the opportunity, why not? You could also put it right into the pinhole that's on your receiver mount back here or a drawbar that's on the tractor as well. There's a lot of ways to hook this up. Let's take a moment to talk about what's going on underneath. You're going to see there's two independent sections that are on the left and right side. The reason for that is so if you're turning one way or another that these two sections can rotate at a different rate. So if you're turning to the left or to the right, the inside is going to turn a little bit slower than the outside. That way, when these spikes or plugs are down in the ground and when you're turning, they're not going to want to rip as you're kind of going to the left or going to the right, they're going to spin at a slower rate and prevent that from occurring. So you're going to have four of these individual teeth or spikes here on each flange. You're going to have five flanges per side, 10 overall, so you have 20 spikes on this side, 20 on the other side. And so with this core aerator here, you do have the ability to get all the way up to a maximum of four inch deep plugs. As a quick side note or a tangent, why you aerate to begin with, this is like a little core here. It's a good sample of your soil composition that you can see firsthand. You have some little roots all the way down to the bottom sticking down here. You can see the depth that your roots are actually going to go down for your grass or maybe you have weeds in your lawn or a combination of everything. And you can see the soil color changes. You get closer to the top with that organic matter and the nutrients that are sitting up here. And I put a lot of different nutrients on my lawn last year and very sandy soil, as you can see further down. But the more you fertilize and more you add those additional amendments to your lawn, you're going to have healthier and healthier soil. And you can see how deep these roots want to be drawn from moisture throughout the summer. You know, this is dormant right now. We're in March, the grass isn't growing. So these roots are here from last fall. It's just kind of an interesting side note to think about how it's all coming together. And so if you think about it another way, the reason why you are core air rating is to loosen up that soil. Because if it's too compacted and too hard at a certain point, nutrients and water are not going to be able to flow all the way down to where the roots are located at. And so you want to be able to soften that up and loosen it up. It's just a healthy thing to do. Maybe not every year, maybe every other year. It depends on your individual circumstances and scenario that you have going on. I didn't core air rate last year at all. I thought about doing it in the fall, but that's just one of those things that kind of cut it out. I didn't have time to do so. I'm tackling it here this spring. And so whether you hire it out or you want to tackle it yourself or maybe get an air rate or like this, do your own lawn and then hire it out for a few others to help pay it off a lot quicker. It's part of a healthy lawn regimen. A few other features that really stand out about the Sweetball, you're going to have flat free tires. So there's no need to worry about these going flat over time. You're also going to have a main body here, the main structure made out of 10 gauge steel. And you're going to have plenty of greaseable Zerk fittings here on both of the wheels and all of your pivot points along the front. You're also going to have individual grease points with Zerks on both ends of each individual shaft here for the core plugs. Now you can get this equipped with either an electric actuator or a manual lift. I chose to go with the electric actuator. I wanted to highlight what it was all about. I think a manual lift is pretty easy to visualize just to lever that you're going to raise and lower. The electric allows you to do it right from the operator station, includes all the cabling and a little switch that you can keep up here. You just clip it right onto your battery terminals and then you power it that way. You'll see this is your controller right here. You can pretty much position this wherever you want to, but it does actually have a magnet mounted to the backside. You can stick it right to a piece of metal. Couple with that, I want you to make sure you notice the extra length of cable. I've just wrapped it around the arm on the ropes, but basically you want to have more than enough that way a variety of applications are going to be suitable. I do think for most situations this electric actuator is going to be a very nice upgrade. The reason being is you think about here in a neighborhood or if you have a sidewalk that you have to constantly cross over as you're going and turning around going each way, you can quickly raise this up from the operator seat there without having to get off. Monkey with the lever, spin around, monkey with the lever again. You just simply hit a button and it raises or it lowers. It's going to be a lot more efficient and comfortable for the operator. Some other things to consider. Green is going to be the standard color for this. Happens to be one of my favorite colors, but if you want to get another color that is available for an upcharge, it may extend the lead time just a little bit. Just know it's an option. There is just one width. It's going to be 48 inches wide for the operating width. The overall unit is about a foot wider than that with the wheel assemblies that stick out on either end. If you're interested in placing an order for one of these sweep ball aerators, you can do so through me with Good Works Tractors. The best part is you can get 5% off with code GWT. I take your order. I send it into the factory and they'll ship it factory direct right to you. Now that code applies to everything at sweep ball, including the aerator, but also the sweeper that they have as well. That is going to be PTO driven. It's great for leaves. It's great for core plugs that we're going to use it for now. Maybe winter cleanup, maybe even spring cleanup from the sticks here. You have maybe just rock and gravel that got spewed into your yard that you want to clean up after a long winter. Maybe you have walnuts or acorns or construction debris or maybe you own a golf course and you have a lot of goose poop that's all over the place. This can be used for all sorts of different applications. Apples, clay pigeons, all sorts of uses for this sweep ball sweeper. You get 5% off with code GWT. Just shoot me an email. I'm happy to help. Now I will say there is a debate about whether you should just leave these plugs in your lawn and let them deteriorate and kind of just flow back into the earth or if you should sweep them all up or rake them all up. Now I have historically left these plugs right in the lawn where they lay, but at that time I had a pretty long or tall grass that I was cutting about 3 or 3 1 half inches. I've since transitioned to mowing my lawn at about an inch tall. I use a real mower now to mow it. I'm a little crazy like that. So this year I am definitely going to want to sweep all these up because I want as level of a lawn as possible for when I'm mowing. You know, any of those little bumps and ripples are kind of more pronounced and more noticeable. So historically I've been fine leaving the plugs in the lawn, but that is going to depend on your application, the final look that you're going for. And even if you want to give it those two or three or four weeks potentially to kind of dissolve and get back down into the earth. All right, that's it folks. Pretty much everything we've gone over here. It's pretty straightforward, pretty easy to talk about, even easier to use. Oh, and you know what? If you like what you see here, I'd love to get a thumbs up from you and make sure you hit that subscribe button right down below. And if you want to get more information on one of these aerators or maybe another product for your tractor, read through that description right underneath the video or head on over to GoodWorksTractors.com.
