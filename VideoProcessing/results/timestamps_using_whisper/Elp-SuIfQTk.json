  "text": "Hey everybody, welcome back to the homestead. Today I wanted to make a video on something that I was thinking about as I was sitting in that tractor auguring all those holes. Is this worth it? So about a week ago I rented an auger, a skid steer with an auger attachment on it and I was all excited. Yeah I'm going to film this. It's trying to think of how to make a guide drill in holes with a skid steer interesting. Kind of seemed like a snoozefest to me. But anyway as I was drilling some test holes with it before I even set up the camera or anything I began to get a little frustrated and was thinking to myself is this worth it? You know I'm spending $400 for a day for this equipment and it's not going exactly as I planned. So I want to kind of help you if you're thinking about renting an auger and give you some ideas and things to think about. So yeah first things first let's talk about the different types of augers. So you got your one man auger, two man auger, three point hitch attachment for a farm tractor or a, and I'll count this as one skid steer mini-escavator or backhoe attachment. It's pretty much the same setup. So the one man auger that's going to work really well in a situation where you have premium soil, nothing too hard, too rocky, just your good easy digging soil. If you can dig it with a post hole digger really easy you're going to have a really good time with a one man auger. So yeah and it's going to be a lot less energy than using a post hole digger. Only be able to go with such a not a very big hole with a one man auger. And then your two man augers you're going to be able to step up on your bit size a little bit probably get a little bit more leverage with two guys pushing down and also holding and that's going to work a better in your somewhat rockier soils and situations where you're doing you know maybe more holes than you would do with a single man auger and it's going to be a little bit easier with two guys rather than one and that that unit is heavier than the single man and it's a job for two people we'll say that. The nice part about the one man and the two man is you can get it in between gates or in between buildings and they also have a one man auger that's kind of like a seesaw and the engine's mounted on the back and then it's you push down on it. Those are really cool you can get those into tight spaces and they seem kind of a little bit easier than a one or a two man because you've got you got leverage and then you have your three point hitch style attached to a farm tractor with a PTO. That's going to work really well in big pastures or big areas where you have plenty of room to move the tractor around. They're going to work probably just as well as a skid steer mini excavator backhoe attachment but then you get to your skid steer mini excavator backhoe attachment and I chose that one because I was working alone and I wanted the down pressure of the equipment to kind of you know push down for me. I knew that I am in terrible soil we live on a rock farm. I felt like that equipment would do a little bit better and then for your skid steers excavator for that style you're going to need a little bit more room not as much as you would for a tractor but you're going to need some room and I had plenty of room to dance around here. You can also get larger holes with your equipment mounted augers than you could with a man or man held auger. Let's talk about soil types real quick. First of all dig a test hole or dig multiple test holes. If you have rocks say any bigger than your fist I probably wouldn't do a one or a two man auger. You'll probably be better off with some sort of equipment mounted auger. For example here I had areas that were rocks and then further down I had areas that were not as big they were you know one inch and maybe just a hair bigger size rocks. And then for example I was drilling holes here and could only get so deep and then once I dug it out by hand with the uh postal digger and a digging bar I found where I was hitting and it was like a rock about this big and I couldn't really move my holes especially for my corner post areas because they kind of have to be in the designated spot you know they can't move too much. Also some things to think about too are if you're near a lot of trees I would suggest probably not going with a man held auger. The tree roots are pretty uh pretty tough to get through so and even still I had a hard time getting through it with the skid steer. If you dig in your test holes your multiple test holes and you find rocks that are say you know any bigger than say two fists or more it might be a good idea to maybe just dig it by hand but that's not true because you know you could have half your holes be rocky and then half of them are not and then it would it would kind of work out. So something to think about too the best time or season to drill your holes I would suggest doing it in fall or spring when the soil has a little bit of moisture in it not saturated but there's some moisture in there so when you're drilling it it kind of sticks together and you can so you could pull out the auger with the dirt on it and and kind of clear it from there. The issue that I had is it's dry as a bone out here and I would drill the hole and it would drill down deep enough but as soon as I lifted the bit up all the dirt would just fall right off back into the hole and I had to go back and clear it out with the uh post hole digger. You don't want it too wet out or saturated because then you're just gonna get all messy and if you have equipment it's going to start roughing everything up it's just not going to be a good deal. So in conclusion and my opinion on if you should rent an excav- if you should rent auger equipment I had about 40 holes here that I did. Half of them not even half say 15 of them worked out nice and I got down to depth that I wanted to do and then maybe another quarter got down a foot maybe two foot and then the rest of them were just complete duds. I barely got down six inches or a foot but thinking about it at the end of the day I think it was worth it even though I got less than half of my holes dug to depth. One because those extra 15-20 holes that I don't have to dig by hand is going to save me a lot of energy a lot of sweat and blood and tears and time. Those are holes that I didn't really have to dig. I do got a clear amount which I guess it is what it is. If you got more than 15 holes to do it might be worth renting a some equipment to drill the holes to auger the holes and that's my opinion or thoughts on if you should rent auger equipment if it's worth it. This will be my first video after we hit a thousand subscribers and I am extremely excited and thankful for all you that are watching and I hope that I am giving you some inspiration or at least entertainment of things we're doing out here on our homestead and thanks for watching we'll see you on the next one.",
