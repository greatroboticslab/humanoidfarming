  "text": "Good morning, afternoon, evening, night. Whenever you're watching this, geographers, welcome back to the Mr. Sin channel. Today we start going into unit five of AP Human Geography. We're going to be looking at different agricultural and rural land use patterns. Today we're starting our unit off with 5.1 where we're going to look at an introduction to agriculture. If you were ever to travel around the world or even your own country, you'd get the opportunity to be able to see different cultures, religions, hear different languages be spoken, see different types of architecture and most importantly get to try a bunch of unique food. Remember each society has its own sense of place and part of that sense of place is the food that exists within that society which is defined by the types of food that people eat but also the agricultural practices that are used to grow the food. All of these components help make a sense of place for a location. The physical geography shapes what type of food can be produced and what type of food will become part of the local cuisine. For example we can see that when looking at the cold mid-latitude climate which would make up parts of southern Canada and eastern Europe, farmers grow wheat and barley and have a variety of livestock or if we look at southern China or the southern part of the United States where the climate is a warm mid-latitude we can see more fruits and rice produced. If we go to California or the Mediterranean Sea region we can see a Mediterranean climate where grapes, olives and dates are grown and if we continue our journey around the world and look into a tropical climate with Indonesia we can see production of coffee, sugar and tea bags. Or if we go to the grassland continental steppe climate located around western United States, Mongolia and northern Africa we can see more cattle ranching sheep horses camels and goats. Each of those climate and regions have certain physical features which will offer their crops and livestock to grow and flourish. Some of them have access to fresh water while others have more arable land or a longer growing season. Now throughout this unit one of the things you're going to notice is just how much environmental possibleism has impact agriculture. Technology has revolutionized how we produce food. Society today is using genetic modification on plants to get them to grow larger faster and in environments that they used to not be able to grow in. Farms around the world are now using chemical fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides to be able to increase the yields of their crops and to be able to put more nutrients into their soil. We're now seeing greenhouses be created to extend growing seasons or vertical farming be used in urban areas to be able to counter food deserts. We've also seen such techniques as irrigation to make sure that plants are getting enough water and even creating artificial light to allow plants to grow in dark areas. All of these advancements are helping us produce more food and it's increasing the world's food production. All of these changes are things that people like Thomas Malthus just never thought possible. Remember Thomas Malthus all the way back to unit two? Ah good times of unit two. Now when looking at different types of agriculture around the world we can see it broken into two categories. We have intensive agriculture and extensive agriculture. Intensive agricultural systems are traditionally located near urban areas. They require less land for the production of the crops. However they end up requiring more capital and labor to be able to produce the final good. Intensive agriculture seeks to maximize the yield of the crop and also the profits for the farmer. Examples of intensive agriculture would be plantation farming, mixed crop and livestock and also market gardening. Plantation agriculture is traditionally found in less developed countries and also former colonies. The reason why it's located here is because of the cheap labor. This allows for farms to be able to maximize their profits. The majority of the crops that are grown are actually cash crops. These cash crops are produced in less developed countries but they're sold to more developed countries and that's how the farms can maximize their profits. A couple common examples of crops that you'll find in plantation agriculture would be sugar, coffee, tobacco and tea. Mixed crop and livestock agriculture on the other hand is found in more developed countries. Here farmers are going to be growing crops like corn and soybeans but it's not for human consumption. These crops are going to be used to fatten up their livestock. Once the livestock have been fattened up they'll be sent to the slaughterhouse. This is where the farmers make the majority of their profit. Market gardening or truck farming as it's also known is often located in geographic regions that have longer growing seasons such as the southeastern part of the United States. Here fruits and vegetables are often grown. The food is often harvested by migrant labor and that's to keep costs down. Once the food is picked it's either canned, frozen or processed, put on a truck and then shipped out across the country. Now we've gone over some examples of intensive agriculture but now we're going to talk about extensive agriculture. Extensive agriculture often requires less labor and also capital. However it does require more land. Traditionally it's located further away from population centers and because of the less capital and machinery used it often also has lower yield for the production of the crops. Examples of extensive agriculture could be shifting cultivation no matter herding or ranching just to name a few. Shifting cultivation is often located in more tropical climates such as Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa or Southeast Asia. Here the agricultural land will be identified and then cleared. Once cleared crops will be planted and they'll continue to be planted until the agricultural land loses its nutrients. Then new land will be identified and the process will repeat. The original plot of land will be left to follow. This means that the land will be left alone for plants to be able to regrow and nutrients to be able to be put back into the soil. The next type of extensive agriculture is nomadic herding which is often located in Central and Southwest Asia and also North Africa. Here the climate is really dry. Herders are always on the move with their livestock which is traditionally goats, cattle and sheep. Because herders are nomadic and always on the move with their livestock their population size is limited and they lack economic development and you might be thinking well why would you practice nomadic herding? Well the reason is their local environment does not allow for sedentary agriculture to happen. The last example is ranching. Ranching is traditionally located on land that's less suitable for traditional agriculture. It's also located further away from urban centers. This is because ranching requires a lot of land to allow the cattle and sheep to be able to graze. When ranchers locate further away from the urban center they reduce the cost of the land which allows them to become more profitable. All right geographers that was a really quick introduction into our agricultural unit. Today we talked about different climates, we looked at technology and its influence on the production of food, we talked about intensive agriculture and extensive and we looked at a bunch of different types of agriculture that fell under those categories and this is just the start of this unit. We are going to be going throughout a ton of cool concepts throughout the rest of these topic review videos. Now you know the drill before we get to that you need to practice what you just learned. Answer the questions on the screen and check your answers down in the comments below. Also if you're struggling in your AP Human Geography class consider getting my ultimate review packet. It's a great resource that covers all of the units in the class. It'll definitely help you get an A in your class and also a five on that national exam. All right that's all the time we have for today. Thank you so much for watching geographers. If you found value in this video consider subscribing. It's a great way to support the channel and it'll make sure you don't miss any of the future videos. All right I'm Mr. Sin and until next time geographers I'll see you next time online.",
