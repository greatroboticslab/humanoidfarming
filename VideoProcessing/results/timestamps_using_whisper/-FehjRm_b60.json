  "text": "Hello viewers, welcome to LMTV, a station where you watch, you interact and also you learn. Your tutor today is Mr. Nyoike, an agriculture teacher. In today's lesson we informed three lessons ten. The topic is livestock production form and the sub topic is livestock rearing practices. One to the lesson of objectives, by the end of this lesson you should be able to explain state various methods of controlling parasite and disease other than vaccination. And the second one state any three types of vaccines. The second routine management of livestock rearing that is parasite and disease control. Remember we covered the first one as feeding, the first one feeding as routine management in the previous lesson. And there are several methods that we normally use to control parasite and diseases. A parasite is an organism which normally live on another organism at the expense of the other. For example, a tick, we have also parasite like the ones which normally causes diseases. And therefore they are supposed to be controlled so that you can end up having high levels of production. Then the first method of controlling parasite and diseases is deworming. And therefore during deworming you can use appropriate tool to put the dewormers all to introduce into the livestock. You can see there is a diagram here of a person who is doing deworming in sheep and the person is using a drenching gun to introduce the anti-helmin ticks. Those are the drugs which are meant for controlling worms. Then we have the second one is dipping. And this is aimed at controlling the ecto or external parasite where chemicals such as akaricide are used. Then we have spraying also akaricide is used but in spraying you can use the hand spraying method. Then the fourth one we have pasture management and during pasture management you can use structures such as the paddock whereby you will be regulating the paddock or the grazing unit using different paddock. And therefore whenever the animals are feeding on a particular paddock the other paddock should be closed to make sure that the heat of the sun heats the eggs of the parasite and therefore destroying them and therefore breaking the cycle of parasite cycle. Then we go to the docking that is another one that is referred to the cutting of the tail or tailing. It is also referred to as tailing and the importance of this is to control the blue fly infestation. And the other one we have the hoof trimming whereby a hoof cutter is normally used to cut the overgrown hooves so that you can control the hoof rot diseases. Then we have dust bath. Dust bath is an example of dust bath here. We have a pit ash here which is normally provided to the pottery so that they can bathe with it and the pit ash is very very important because it will kill the parasite which normally affect pottery. Then we have vaccination is another method of controlling diseases or controlling the spreading of diseases. Vaccination you can vaccinate your animal you can inject your animal with a particular vaccine so that you can control the disease from spreading. Then methods of vaccination you can administer the vaccine through injection as you can see in this diagram the animal is injected using a vaccine. Then we have the second method we have oral vaccination that is where you introduce the vaccine through the mouth. Then we have inhalation. Inherition is through the nose and also insertion at the crow aka when it comes to pot tree. Then types of vaccines we have for in today's we are going to cover for the first one we have live variant vaccine is the one which is administered when the disease causing microorganism. Actually vaccine is a disease causing microorganism whose ability to cause the disease has been reduced and therefore for live variant vaccine is the one which is introduced when the disease causing microorganism or parvagen is live. Then we have life attenuated is the one which is normally the disease causing microorganism is mixed with the sun can cause to reduce its powers therefore it will not affect the animal and the form in the examples of diseases which are controlled using this method or this type of vaccine. We have anthrax and also we have brusillosis we have killed an all dead vaccine that is why you killed the disease causing microorganism then you mix it with the formal form madhyde this chemical then you introduce into the body so that the body of an animal can become stimulated to produce its own antibodies. Then we have the togzi vaccine it is in form of form marine and actually once it is introduced to the body of animal the animal is stimulated to produce its own immunity. Then we have properties of good vaccine should be good immunity it should be as good as natural immunity then the second one long shelf life the immunity which should the vaccine should have a long keeping shelf life that is the time the life span before it expires should be longer. Then single dose should produce life long immunity then the fourth one easy to administer it should not be complicated when it comes to introduction of the vaccine into the body then no side effects should not have the animal or also should not have the farmer who is administering them to the animal. Then compatible with other vaccine yes a good vaccine should be compatible with other types of vaccine. We have come to the end of today's lesson and we are going I'm going to give you assignment the first question defined the foreign terms as used in livestock production for the first one is vaccine and the second one is vaccination. Then the second question is highlight any four types of vaccine used during livestock production then we have reference you can refer from secondary agriculture book student book that the publisher is the Kenya literature bill for my information you can reach us at RMTV using the foreign contacts the first one we have SMS using that number then you can reach us. Thank you for joining me in this lesson till next lesson goodbye.",
