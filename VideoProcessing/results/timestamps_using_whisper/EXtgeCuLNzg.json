  "text": "How air pollution threatens natural pest control methods in sustainable farming. Few individuals are aware of the dangers that air pollution poses to both people and the environment. Humans who breathe polluted air are more likely to get cancer, heart disease, and even birth defects. Additionally, the disruption of the natural ecosystem caused by air pollution from different human activities such as industrial manufacturing, car emissions, and power plants reduces biodiversity by altering the migratory patterns of plants and animals in AFFEX wildlife habitats. This could jeopardize farmers usage of non-toxic, non-GMO natural pest management techniques, genetically modified organisms. Here is how air pollution endangers organic pest management techniques used in sustainable agriculture. Air pollution has been recognized as an increasingly major hazard to the environment in recent years. For instance, a research reported in the journal Science indicated that both indoor and outdoor air pollution contribute to up to 8 million premature deaths annually. Both natural and man-made sources, such as car emissions and industrial waste gases, directly release pollutants into the air outside. Air pollution's effects on organic farming. Natural pest management strategies in sustainable agriculture are under danger due to the growing issue of air pollution. The health of plants is impacted by higher levels of pollutants including ozone, particulate matter, and nitrogen dioxide because they cause premature fruit ripening, which can reduce yields and quality. Due to decreased pest defenses when crops are stressed by air pollution, they are also more prone to bug infestation. This may lead to lower crop yields and a higher need for insecticides. The danger of organic pest control techniques. One of the most environmentally friendly ways to care for crops is through natural pest control methods. However, a recent study indicates that the pollution from factories, farms, and autos may be endangering these organic pest management strategies. Researchers discovered that ladybugs struggle to locate their meal when there is a lot of air pollution around. Additionally, it prevents them from having offspring. A healthy environment depends on ladybugs, which also help keep insect populations in check and potentially save farmers a lot of money on pesticides. Future of sustainable agriculture. Sustainable farming is gaining popularity as a means of feeding a rising population well while preserving the environment. The use of natural pest management techniques, such as crop rotation or chemical free fertilizers, as opposed to pesticides, is one of the main benefits of sustainable farming. Recent research has revealed that air pollution may be endangering these organic pest management techniques. Please subscribe to enjoy more videos. Thank you.",
