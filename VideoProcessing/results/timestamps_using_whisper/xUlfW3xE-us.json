The government argued that for Kenya to be a food-secure country, it must adopt genetically modified crops. They said for instance the reduction in corn production in Kenya by that 5% from 2018 to 2022 was due to lack of insect or pesto taril Panda varieties in the market, however this was not true. According to a report by Fao, the reduction was primarily caused by the great drought experience in a similar period. This month, we are focusing on genetically modified crops or the common known as GMOs. They so aim of being to reveal the truth and the myth about genetically modified crops but first let's understand what is genetically modified crops and what are they made of. accomplishment.

In this way the genes that carry information for all parts of the organism are passed down the generation in a Nyue. In contrast, genetically modified is a laboratory-based technique that is completely different from natural breeding. Here are the main stages of genetic modification process. Number 1. In a process known as tissue culture or 38 karma, tissue from the plant that is to be genetically modified is placed in the culture. Then the next step, millions on the tissue culture plant cells are subjected to GMG injection process these results in the GMG or genes being h kuwa, namasba na mala mawa kwa nga nga hini, hiki makutututututututututututu na donated kwa hini, hiki makututututututututu na toxicite nga hini, u labia, hiki hiki makututututu na korunia.

Radiation induced mutation bred is potentially even more metagenic than the genetically modified and at least as destructive to gene expression and crops produced by this method should becoming regulated at least as strict he janetically modified crops. It is unnecessary to take risk who is genetically modified when conversional breeding assisted by safe modern gene mapping technology is capable of meeting our crop breeding needs. Genet mode deed organism or GMO meeds, end trath treatment are treated with plant The hormones humiliated these genetically modified plants to proliferate and differentiate into small GM plants that can be transferred to soil and grown on. Once the genetically modified plants are growing, the genetic engineer examines them and eliminates any that do not seem to be growing well. He or she then does tests. Liminian plants to identify one or more that express the genetically modified genes at the high levels. These are selected as candidates for commercialization. The resulting population of genetically modified plants all carry and express genetically modified genes of interest. However, we have not been assessed for health and environmental safety on nutritional value. Genetically modified transformation process is artificial, does not automatically make it undesirable or dangerous. Actually it is the consequences of the procedure that gives a concern. At this point you understand the whole procedure. It might sound more much of botanical but that's the whole procedure that genetic engineers and breeders that all they go through to come up with a genetically modified crop. This series will continue. We shall look at the myth, we shall look at the truth and also we shall look finally in our final sections that will come later on. Neson that Kenya can learn from other countries such as South Africa but has been pregnant, maintain this system for over 10 or even 20 years. So make sure to stick around if you have any question on genetically modified crops or genetically modified organisms, the GMOs and GM ask and in this month we shall explore the genetically modified crops. Meen aims to identify the whole truth and try to learn. Hope to see you in the next or in the part 2 where we shall look now on the myth and dive more on genetically modified crops. Let us know your thoughts on genetically modified crops. Also don't forget to like, subscribe and also spread the same word to other farmers. Remember sharing the best way that you can help us reach as many farmers as possible.",
