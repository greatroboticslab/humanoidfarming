  "text": "Hello again and welcome back to Horsch live directly from the Horsch headquarters in Germany, the Zitznhof. For those of you who haven't joined us earlier today, I'm Johannes and I will be your host for the English language sessions today. Well, a quick reminder on what is Horsch live. Obviously, we would have loved to have you here in person, but because of COVID-19, this apparently isn't possible, unfortunately. So, we thought about a creative solution to interact with you anyways, and this is Horsch live. Fortunately, this new format actually gives us a chance to present you an even larger and more international seminar than ever before. So, a special welcome to the international audience and thank you very much for joining. We hope you enjoy the next session. Before introducing our next topic and our next guest, a quick remembering very quickly on what this is about. This is Horsch live and so we hope not only you will hear from us, but that we will hear from you as well. So please ask all your questions via the chat function of your channels and we'll try to answer as many of them either after the sessions from the presenter or via the chat function directly. To our next speaker, actually the two upcoming presentations will cover a topic that Horsch has been dealing intensively with for about two years now and that's called bio control or biological plant protection. What is it about is actually the biological control of pests and diseases through the targeted application of an active biological agent. Something that here in the EU is somehow still a niche sector, but in other parts of the world like Brazil, this is already widely accepted and commonly used. Our next two guests will share insights on this innovative and interesting technology with us from two different perspectives. The user's perspective as well as the producers. Gregory Sanders will make a start and talk to us about the practical use of biological agents in large scale farming operations. Gregory is director of operations of Grupo Pogresso, a family structured group of agricultural companies that will harvest close to 100,000 hectares in two harvests in 2021. Their operation is focused on the production of soy, corn and cotton. Gregory will talk to us about using biological control as an element of their integrated plant production system and will share information about related opportunities, challenges, cost effects and benefits to biological management as well as intended future steps. Welcome, Gregory. I'm an agronomist and operation director of Progressive Group. Progressive Group is a group of companies, familiar companies and individual growers that are established since 2001 in the state of Minas Gerais in the Southeast region of Brazil and also in POE, the Northeast region of Brazil. We grow cotton, corn and soybean and we have also a business of soybean seeds and I would like to thank you a lot, Horsch, to give me this opportunity to participate in this life, inviting me and my company to talk about what we are doing in this presentation that we will award biological control in our company here in the POE. Some of the main characteristics of Progressive Group is we are pioneering cotton planting with high technology in the POE state. We started planting cotton here in the year 2003. We built our own gene in the year 2006 and since that we become a reference in cotton here in the region of Cerados in POE state. We are one of the references in quality of soybean seeds in Brazil. We get recently, we've invested a lot in our unit here, mainly in POE and use of new technologies to make possible to produce soybean seeds here in POE in a place that is very hot and offer a big challenge to get a good quality in soybean seeds. We are known by being innovative in our production process. We always, to be pioneering in the region we are operating. We have some discovery by ourselves, the way adjusting our process by our own to make possible to explore the crops we are in this region. We have a characteristic of share a lot of the knowledge we learn. Everything we learn here in the region we use to share with other growers and for us it's a way to make these mistakes. We made another people want to do this and we can at same time when we share learn a lot things that it would cost a lot in our mistakes. So this is a character we have is to share everything that we learned along all over the years operating here in the region. And we are avid to new technologies. I must say we are the second horse customer here in Brazil and we are very proud of this. Talking about our farms we have a Olo Branco farm located in Paracatu, Minas Gerais State. It's the only farm we have in the Minas Gerais State. It's the first one the group established in the year 1997 before becoming really a group. These farms nowadays 2,600 hectares. Normally we have all the area planted with soybean in the first harvest and almost 70% of the area planted with corn in the second harvest. We have another farm the Pen\u00ednsula is the Liruong we have located in Guadalupe POE with 682 hectares irrigated area. It's very strategic for us to soybean multiply and give a speed in new varieties of soybean that is being developed. We have an imperial farm located in Sebasti\u00e3o Leal the area total is 10,780 hectares planted area. Normally this farm we make one harvest and the second harvest only crops to cover the soil and make straw in the area. We have Hainha da Serra farm located in Iurusui POE with 14,300 hectares planted area. Normally this area we can plant total area in the first harvest with soybean and something like 10 and 20% of this area along the years we can cover with a second harvest of corn and the rest of the area the same of imperial covering with crop to make straw that is very very important in our region. We have the youngest one a tropical farm located at Baixa Grande do Ribeiro. Nowadays 17,400 hectares planted area. We can make something like 15% of second harvest with corn and these areas is to be consolidated. This next season it will reach the mark of 2021,400 hectares and we have the Progressive farm that first farm here in POE state the most important area the biggest planted area we have in one farm and it's 36,000 hectares is where we concentrate our industrial structures. We have a cotton gene we have the our unit of seeds located in POE installed in this farm. Main activities of the group as I said soybean, corn, cotton, grow and soybeans. The last season 2020, 2001 the current season we will have in all farms in POE and Minas Gerais state a total of 68,300 hectares soybean 9,000 of corn first harvest and 3,900 of cotton and as a second harvest we will have 16,400 hectares of corn 1,100 hectares of soybean and this soybean irrigated 80,150 hectares will be in Peninsuo in the central pivots to multiply new varieties that are in the pipeline to be registered and for the next harvest. The soybean seed business we have a unit in Orobranco farm with a structure of 120,000 sacks of 200,000 seeds like one sack like this normally for you to have an idea you can plant one hectare of soybean with this number of seeds in the one sack so this structure can cover 1,120,000 hectares of soybean all with all this capacity in a structure where we can keep all the seed storage in a cold chamber and our main unit is located at Progresso farm and a structure to 1.2 million sacks of seeds really impressive we have a concept this structure since 2004 and nowadays we are ampliating this structure build a new big chamber cold chamber to storage ready seeds to go to our customers I would like to talk about a little bit about the history of biological control in big crops in Brazil in the years 80 we had introduction of use of baculovirus to control soybean caterpillar the anti-carcinogen matalis and that time the growers used to pick up the anti-carcinogen matalis that seems to be affected by baculovirus and freeze all these caterpillars and then in a certain moment put all in a mixer and then put this solution of caterpillar mixed in a big mixer inside a plane or terrain sprayer or a plane and spray all this solution in the in the soybean crop and this time it used to have a very it was very heavy the work to pick up this and to make all this process and we have suffered a lot with the effects of weather the the response of this kind of treatment by using baculovirus should be very preventive not so you couldn't use this as in the point where the caterpillars was giving you damage to your to your soybean where you would lose money it takes a long time to control the the caterpillar so this failed along the years and the growers stopped using this kind of technology then in the years 90 for brick big crops we know it's a very popular and deep bell bacillus to regiensis and a commercial solution ready for use but it was efficient not so much if compared with the chemical control but it was a way to reduce the impact to the interesting bugs present in the crop but the cost of using deep bell was so close to the the chemical control that doesn't make sense at that moment if you compare the efficiency and you compare the queue the cost it represented that time and it didn't work there was no not so many growers using this technology at that time then you in the year to the years 2000 the beans soybeans and cotton growers in some regions some more cold weather regions where we have a high altitude when you have a temperature below 15 degrees at night this this main tree crops started suffering a lot with sclerotina and sclerotiarum this disease caused by these fungus had a have a very difficult and very expensive cost to control by managing fungicides and that was an opportunity for the biological control with by using trichoderma Harsianum to get succeed and since that year that year until now we have a lot of growers in these main tree crops using constantly year by year this kind of fungus or making buying these from companies specialized companies to produce or some producing these by their own in their own farms and we had a big change in the biological control in Brazil by the year 2012 when we had an introduction of eliquoverpa mijira in Brazil at that time nobody was ready to deal with this new caterpillar very resistant for the normal insect sites we were being using and to control this this new caterpillar we should use some insect sites that was very expensive at that time and the eliquoverpa after its introduction in Brazil leave us a legacy many growers after that started using biological control as a way to control the caterpillars and even other use other purpose and this created a constant demand for all the biological and this environment this new environment created after this event was a perfect for established companies that work at this segment of business and even for new startups to have an opportunity to grow and the recent most recent changing in this segment of business was some companies developed some solutions for the growers to produce their bio control agents inside the farm on farm in the year 2019 progress made a contract with agro biological companies to aid that lemmins St. Paul state Southeast region of Brazil that is specialized in producing solutions for production of biological control in on farm this contract we made an agreement to buy only their kit they have a feed kit for bacteria multiplication called multi-bacter and they've accommodated us 20 bioreactors capable of 2000 liters each so we have a capacity to produce at same time 40,000 liters of bio agents at same time and this contract disagreement leave us free to buy any source of any bacteria to any other company to be multiplied inside the bioreactors that are accommodated with them the year 2019 we used by using an existing building we installed a 20 bioreactors of 2000 liters at Fazenda progress centered between other three farms to produce and deliver all the bio agents to other farms and then November 2019 we started up this structure very simple use by mix mixing the multi-bacter kit and the desired bacteria you need because products at each be reactor 2000 liters of the desired bio agent after producing we put all the solution in of each bioreactor into IBC's of 1000 liters and after that analyze storage in the cold chamber or direct use by spraying with our planes the main use of each produce are for caterpillar controls nematodes and live disease and we've felt a lot the effects of reducing the impact so these structures very simple and we are using this spray in the our planes as the same as other chemical insect size and fung sites to control the main bugs and diseases we we have in the our crops with less impact environment we are controlling now white flies the complex of caterpillars sting bugs spider mites and diseases by using these biological products at the same way of chemical we use to do before the multi-bacter technology create a very simple table for any agent you want to multiply in the columns you have all the agent a commercial product that you you can buy to use as a source of of this bacteria the time of multiplication the amount of commercial product to per each 2000 liters the of the desired product you you may multiply and also you have the shelf life of the product at the ambient temperature the shelf life extended at more or less 50% when kept when you storage this this product at 12 degrees Celsius and you have the target for each agent you have a target a specific target on the crops and also the dosage of each each product to to control the target for instance this table help you to plan everything you need to produce how long will it take and how long will it be available for you to use like the first column the silo storage in a variety as a why the commercial Shantari it takes 48 hours to to be ready the most you will use is four kilograms of commercial product to produce 2000 liters of the the product and if you keep this at ambient temperature eight days duration if you put in the cold chamber 12 days of duration and the purpose of this product is for a spot doctor and you take three or four liters per hectare spray to control this caterpillars in any crop it could be soybean beans cotton and here we have the nine main agents we work with in the last season 2019 2020 with any purpose you have here in this table to have an idea what we did last season 2019 2020 here you are some volume of each agent we multiplied the total a month of be agent we produce it on our be reactors was a total of 1,210,000 liters of the product and you have the total of the product and you have the total of 110,000 liters of be agents most of them with a purpose to control the caterpillars talking about the advantages so many you can save a interest bug that help you in the past control and biological you feel this a lot we can feel the increase of spiders in the in our crops even in soybean even in cotton by using these kind of products and reducing the chemical control and talking about money saving with I find a very simple way to compare what what's being saved in terms of money not to mention another advantage and other benefits of the use of the biological control that are difficult to measure we didn't measure that but talking about money like soybean last year we sprayed the biological it was an average in soybeans of 2.5 springs only using the biological control with with no chemical there so 2.5 springs I changed the chemical by biological with the same result of the chemical but with economy of 4.1 dollar per hectare if you multiply by 2.5 and the area a total economy of 488 thousand dollars almost 489 thousand dollars in soybean only considering the caterpillar control with biological in cotton we had a little bit more sprayers we used the four sprays removing the chemical control only biological control so the chemicals in this kind of of purpose are a little bit more expensive so the reduction was 8 5.85 dollars per spray multiplying that by four sprays and the area 4500 hectares we have an economy of 105 thousand dollars so the total considering just these crops these two crops and this counter of caterpillars we have something like 594 thousand dollars the pandemic of coronavirus we suffered with that because we couldn't get any more sources to multiply we had the multi-bacter kit but we didn't we couldn't buy the source of bacteria mainly the bacillus tourgences and saccharopolis por spinosa 40 use in the coverage crops that we plant in the areas that we don't make this second harvest we plant millet we plant brachiaria and we should we could have a higher economy a higher saving of money if we could use that that point that we mean we intend to use in this next harvest so we are in the rain season 2020 2021 is we are about the middle of this rain season so we are estimating economy much higher than the last year so in soybean this year we have a little we fell a little a little lower pressure of caterpillars in soybean and also cotton I don't know but I estimate to be the same so talking about soybean we believe we will use 1.5 spraying in the total area removing the chemical control and using the biological control so the economy of a little bit higher this year because the dollar is increased its value against the real and the cost of all the biological was in real so this year the economy is a little bit higher than the last year in terms of prices of products so multiplying 5.0 to 1.5 spraying to in the total area of 49,900 hectares of soybean treated with biological we will have a economy of $375,000 this year we removed the first chemical fungicide spraying we changed this by using the bacillus subchilis so we removed one chemical spraying in the first in the vegetative phase of the soybean and introduced only the bacillus subchilis so a considerable reduction of costs 6.44 we reduced the cost in this spraying one spray in total area we have a savings of $321,000 about cotton this year the area is 3,900 hectares for sprays because the difference of cost it become higher 7.04 dollars per spray by changing chemical to biological so if you multiply this by 4 and by the area we had $109,000 of economy and this year different to the year 2019 and 2020 we have we will do the contour of caterpillars in other crops like sorghum millet and brachiaria the total will be 50,400 hectares we estimate at least two sprays economy because the products the chemical insecticides we use in this in these situations are a little bit cheaper than the other than the cotton and the soybean will be a reduction of cost of $2.06 per spray multiplied by two and multiplied by the area we will we expect $207,000 of economy so estimating all the all the use only based on what I changed by chemical to the biological this year we expect saving $1,014,000 of savings by change the chemical to biological with with no with no lost of of performance we had some change comparing the season 2019 to 2020 to the season 2020 2021 that is in course we removed the chromobacterium subsugai from our program because the efficiency of this kind of agent you should at least spray this weekly and this is impacting in our operation mainly in the plains areas to be sprayed is very very high and doesn't make sense to us to continue with this agent that requests so many so many sprays because normally the use of biological goes with other products goes with fertilizer and there is no significant change in our in our process of production the first as I said the first chemical fume site sprayed in soybean which was changed by chemical to the biological in most of the varieties of soybean so this gave us a significant reduction of costs but we didn't see any change in the performance of the control of the fungus disease live disease in soybean and we are concluding our microbiology laboratory to have a sample of each production by reactor and analyze this sample to ensure we are having a good quality product to be sprayed in the hour in our areas we plan some change for the next season 2021 2022 agro biologic company that we make that agreement we have a contract is developing a feeding kit to produce fungi agents in the same bioreactor at the same system we are multiplying the bacterias so by these we will have some new agents that are very important in our production like we will be able with this work we will be able to produce bauvery ebasiana to control white fly on soybean and cotton we will be able to produce is alia fume fume zorosea to control daubulus mites that's a very important bug nowadays in the corn that request a lot of springs to control this pest and you have to take too much care of the corn you have to protect against this bug because is it transmits some virus that can make a disaster in your corn so we expect a very significant reduce of cost in the control of this main main two pests white fly and daubulus mites at corn daubulus mites at corn and white fly and soybean and cotton and we plan to start producing trichoderma arsianum and the purpose of this is to use in the in the planning forum during soybean planning operation to reduce the nematodes to reduce the soil disease that attacked the roofs of all the crops here in our explorate crops so this this changes for the next season we will increase a lot this money savings we are expecting a lot of money savings by this main two new agents this fungy new agents that we will be able to introduce in our control system and that's it well i would like to thank you all for the attention i hope you enjoyed my presentation and this can contribute to your business and i can you can contact me via email that i show in the beginning of presentation gregory at fazendaprogressu.com.br or even accessing our social media with us from brazil gregory welcome and thank you very much for this very insightful and interesting presentation and that you shared with us how's it going in brazil we are starting to harvest very good that sounds good so already good luck for that gregory thanks for being available for answering some questions and the first question isn't directly related to the topic you were talking about it's rather with regard to the opportunity to do two harvests in one rain season one of our viewers noticed that in the first half for the first harvest you planned around 81 000 hectares while for the second harvest it's only and that's still an impressive number but roughly 20 000 hectares so what's going on with the rest with the rest of the 60 000 hectares what's being done with them at the time of the second harvest we used to plant some crops to cover the soil we need a lot of straw to to protect from losing the moisture here in brazil is very important to to keep this and we don't have a window a correct window to produce corn for in the whole area that was the best the best world for us and we use in other crops that request a little bit less water to to produce a month a considerable amount of straw that is very important for us okay well thanks on that coming to your presentation and two questions on that so you made it certainly clear that you're using an integrated system for plant protection so you're not replacing 100 of chemicals with biological control so question on that is what's the ratio of biological control and chemical control and what efficiency level do you see on biological control compared to chemical control okay the the situations we removed uh as i was talking about in my presentation for caterpillars in soybean uh we removed all the chemical control but you have a sting bugs white fly another kind of pests you can't control that efficiently the system we have by using biological but caterpillars that is the the past we most spend money in the control the biological biological substitute changed every chemical to biological okay and uh the other pests we continue to use the chemical but the fung sides control we removed we changed 25 percent between 25 and 30 in 30 percent by using substituting the chemical to biological so specific targets talking about pests we are we changed 25 percent and of control to biological and the fung sides control 25 to 30 percent do you do you see an increase in that possibly in the future or will that stay at the same level for the time being so we force this specific target like sting bugs and white flies we have we expect a better control if by using fungals with the bacteria that the main bacteria that we are producing on farm are not uh efficient in the system we have but with fungals that we expect the next season be producing on farm we expect to control these other bugs by using this this new kind of agents. On one of your last slides you mentioned that one of the agents you used in the first season in 2019-2020 you removed that can you tell us a little bit more about the reasons for removing that what was what made you take that decision was it efficiency that made you decide to switch over again to chemical? That specific agent chromobacteriosubsogui was being used to control the sting bugs and white flies but to be efficient we should spray at least weekly so at each seven days we would have to spray again the chromobacteriosubsogui to have efficient control and our operational capacity of spraying with planes and other sprayers we are not we don't have this capacity to do weekly spraying all over our areas so that doesn't make sense to continue with that agent that's why we stop it using and so do i understand right that there is an effect on workload for biological control or for biological agents so that you in general would say there is a higher workload when applying biological agents because you need to spray more possibly as well as more often in this case as i said before i removed it because it would increase the number of spraying but the system we are now the changes we made from the last season to this actual season we are not spraying more we substitute the chemical by biological in the same spray okay and the main the main point is when you use a chemical you have a need to spray you go to your storage you got a product and you spray and with biological produced on farm is very different you have to see the need you have to produce the biological agent you need and you have to spray that and you have a very lower shelf life of each product you produce if compared to chemical so everything must be very synchronized to be successful in this kind of control did you change anything within your farm system to be able to do so to anticipate when a biological agent is needed did you i don't know hire weather specialists or run your own weather forecast system or things like that to to be able to to adopt to that yes we have to like to like how do we say in in portuguese to have all the area in in your hands to see to know everything is happening to control in this in the right point you can't lose the control you have to get the control in your hands of the whole area that's the main difference and you have to synchronize how long you take to produce the product and you have the capacity of planes and so everything must be you have to be at least two steps ahead if compared to other system by using only chemical a question in this context is do you spray the whole farm at once or do you check within the fields which area has caterpillars and really needs to be sprayed yes that's what we do we spray when needed normally we are needed the first the first spraying between the first 40 days of this mainly soybean you as on demand but we have to enter spraying for the fungicides mainly to protect from ferrugem asiatica i don't know how to say that in english it's a very important disease we have in soybean and you the soybean roast let's say like that i don't know in the in the united states they they don't have this we have this roast and we have to protect from that and that at least 14 days each 14 days you are spraying and if you need to put something to counter caterpillars you put if not you don't put okay that's that's the main point as needed okay all right thank you for that coming back to your integrated system since when exactly so you you mentioned in your presentation that you started to produce your own biological agents in 2019 for the first time and it was 2019 actually also the first time that you actually used biological agents or did you start the usage already before some agents we were using before basilis toligensis we used it a long time ago some some situations but it was our only usage so we buy like a d-pal I mentioned that my presentation I for a long time used the d-pal but the cost of d-pal and efficiency if compared to the the other doesn't make sense at that time and then we we were present to agrobiological the company that give us all the support to to produce on farm and we start from zero producing to using a whole area at the same year so we start because the cost allows us to do this okay coming back just quickly once again to the question of the actual application one of the audience asks how many liters of water per hectare do you spray with a three to four liters of bacteria so in your in your table that you showed in your presentation there was I think like you need three to four liters of product with how many liters of water would that be sprayed per hectare normally we well yeah oh here you are again well we lost you for a second but you're back again thinking it's perfect okay normally each agent between three or four liters per hectare like five you will use three agents normally between nine and 12 liters but they sprayed we can hear you we can hear you uh Gregory you can continue talking we hear you so yeah by by the biological we use only by plants depending on the the amount of chemical and biological we are going to spray normally it goes from nine to to 18 liters of total of total uh liquid of total liters per hectare total amounts okay great so I think it's time for one last question and that would be regarding the economic effects so thank you very much first of all for sharing this profound insights on numbers with us and with the audience um I mean when one looks at those savings that you mentioned um one has to ask oneself why is not everybody doing it this way because the savings that you that you mentioned that you show are so obvious that that normally everybody would have to do it immediately the same way um so the question is is there any any negative effect that that comes along with those savings so do you have a less turnover less revenue that you have to compare those savings with um or is it actually the true savings and and and it's it's just a positive effect very generally yes that is the only the savings I can measure by changing the chemical by changing the chemical by biological and the cost of this change because the rest is the equal and efficiency we are having in the in the products we kept in use are the same we are not there are a lot of effects of um not don't when you use this you don't kill uh benefit uh benefit bugs you have in the crop and there are a lot of things the nematodes control that we are we are not mentioning this so the difficult to to is not really the efficiency the efficiency when you have a synchronized production system are the same of chemical by with a lot of savings of money but the difficult is people to manage to have the the control to produce the the agents on farm to build this so it's it's it's it increase you the difficult to to to deal with the problems you have to another another another thing that is a manufacturer to do the biological products on farm it's another activity another activity you have to to tip in your farm Gregory thank you very much I think that was very very impressive to learn and get these insights from you for me personally I learned that that that I think there's not that much against integrating biological control in your system and I think it's definitely worth looking closer to it here in the European Union as well looks very promising to me what you've already discovered in Brazil so um yeah once again thank you very much for joining us for giving us these insights and um all the best for your harvest and hopefully talk to you soon thank you very much uh your harness thank you all thank you so dear viewers um that was Gregory Sanders from Brazil with uh yeah very impressive insights on biological control from the user's perspective um Horsch live will continue in about well already 10 minutes at um six o'clock central um european time with our next guest on the same topic but from a different perspective so I hope you will join us again soon and see you in a bit",
