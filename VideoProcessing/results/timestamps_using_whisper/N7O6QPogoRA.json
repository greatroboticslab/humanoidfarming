  "text": "Hey everybody Chris here from New Jersey 101.5 and NJ1015.com and today I'm going to show you the proper way to plant a tomato in New Jersey. So here I have a nice heirloom variety, yellow brandy wine and what you want to do is first of all it's May 16th so you want to wait until at least May 15th the last day the last frost date in New Jersey. If you plant them earlier they're just going to be stressed out so don't even bother wait until the 15th and then you want to find one that is pretty big because there's a trick to this. Tomatoes have this interesting property and I don't know if you can come in here where any part of the plant that touches soil is going to start growing roots. So what you do and you have to kind of be brave here is pull all the the leaves off on the bottom part of the tomato and the stems and just leave the top set and then you can come in a little closer here and we'll just show you. You know these roots are all balled up and come in root bound so just pull the bottom of that spread them apart a little bit and now you're going to encourage it to grow all these big roots so we dug a nice deep hole and we're going to try to plant all of that down so all this is going to become become a cool thing to do to help the tomatoes is to save some of your eggshells and what you're going to do is just break up eggshells into the hole so about a half an egg or an egg per hole. Just real quick to get this last set in there and it's okay if they kind of break up or whatever because the plant will kind of take its time to grow but then once those new roots establish it's just going to spread out so far in the soil you're gonna get so much more nutrients and you're gonna get so many more tomatoes and they're just gonna be that much better bigger tastier so go ahead push that soil back in. Don't be don't be scared to push down get rid of the excess leaves just the top is there push your straw back in use straw don't use wood mulch wood mulch will rob the nutrients of the tomato plant. Go ahead and go like that and give it a little drink just at the base there's no need to get the leaves wet just like that the water will settle and as you water it you're gonna do you know one good soaking a week maybe a little bit more as it's getting established but it's gonna encourage the roots to grow down and out into New Jersey soil so hope that works for you you know if you're not brave enough do one and see what you think this year and let me know in the comments below or if you have any other tricks if you want to learn more about why you do this you can check the post and there's a link for that in the description so thanks for much watching and I'm Chris from New Jersey 101.5 happy gardening",
