  "text": "Welcome to A Thriveable Life, a podcast that shows how ordinary people can take everyday actions for a thriveable future where everyone lives in harmony with nature. Hi, I'm Gavya, a project manager by profession, and I am interested in learning about the impact we have on the environment and society and in turn how we are shaped by it. Hi, Mike. I'm a research assistant at Thrive with a background in political science and social policy. I also have a passion for social and environmental sustainability and biodiversity. And we are from the Thrive Project, the Not-For-Profit Research Institute, think tank and advocacy group. Gavya and I will be your co-hosts as we talk with our special guests about how we can create a world that is not just sustainable, but one that thrives. Before we introduce this week's guest, we would like to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the first people of this place now known as Australia, as well as First Nations people across the globe. And today's topic is something our guest is very familiar with. This is sustainable agriculture. We would like to introduce today's guest, Lottlough Delamini. She has a bachelor's degree in physics and agri-mediology. She has worked at a science and technology institution in South Africa. She has completed her master's in business administration at Edinburgh Business School in the United Kingdom and has a special interest in climate change and agriculture. Thank you, Lottlough, for joining us today. Thank you for having me. Maybe we can start by just understanding what's the definition of sustainable agriculture. In simple terms, sustainable agriculture means farming to meet the demands for food production without destroying natural resources, land, air and most importantly, water to irrigate and grow the crops or livestock that you have on your farm. I know you have a background in sustainable agriculture. How did you come about getting involved in this space? Actually, the plan was not to go in agriculture sector. I actually plan to study meteorology, which was mostly influenced by my mom because my mom worked at meteorology in Lesotho. But agriculture is something that was always there at home. My dad was a teacher, but on the side, we had plant crops, we had a sheep and cows, chickens. We were basically farming on the side. We would sell to the community that we have people passing by our house. They would see us saying there's crops and animals and then just come in back. Like I said earlier, the influence was more of what my mom studied. So when I completed my metric, I applied to the University of Pretoria to study meteorology. But then there was challenges with finance because if I had to go out of the town that I've stayed to study in another province, it would actually be more expensive. So my parents were like, how did you find something similar here at home? Then it's related. And that's when I looked at the university that was in my area. I see that they offer agri-materiality. That's when I was like, ah, it's the same. It's the same as studying meteorology. And at home, we are doing fun. So I pursued agri-materiality that way. Yeah, it sounds like a perfect blend of what you'd seen all your life and somehow happened very coincidentally. Yeah, it's basically my childhood. Everything was, they influenced most of my career. What do you see as the need for sustainable agriculture? Like, why do we need it? And what's going to wrong with the ways for at least quite some time it's maybe industrially done or it has been followed? I think sustainable agriculture, we have to ensure that we keep our, we protect our resources. So commercial farming is good in a way that it provides a suit to people, but now it also compromises sustainability, compromises on the environment. Now we have a machine and using machinery that requires for some things. So if we can try to at least incorporate methods that are more sustainable, providing food, still providing food for people, but without impacting the environment. So I think it's important that we consider those factors, especially for commercial farmers, they are more on the commercial side of using more energy consuming machinery. And so it's important they also focus on bringing that sustainability aspect. In their farming practices. And you mentioned about, I think maybe it is challenging when you look at the way agriculture has been done until now, in the sense that commercial agriculture probably uses a lot more resources. And in cases where even, for example, forests are probably being slowly removed to promote certain products which are extremely high in demand. So in such a situation of extreme high demand and then just the need for food increasing and variety food increasing. What are the different challenges that somebody who's trying to move into sustainable agriculture would probably face? The challenges that I think I've noticed among farmers is lack of knowledge. A lot of farmers are not aware of what sustainable practices are for them to actually begin implementing that in their farming practices. And some of them, once they get the knowledge now they are faced with a challenge of finding how do I now get the money to get these resources that are going to help me to produce enough food for people. And help me transition to sustainable agriculture shows. Those are the challenges. And the other challenges that farmers face when it comes to converting to sustainable agriculture is the demand. People are now used to conventional ways of producing food. So now when a farmer comes and tries to introduce food that are organically produced or they didn't use a lot of chemicals, you find that now they are only a small percentage of the community. So they're not getting a lot of bias. So now you find that if someone's like, I still think I need to produce for me to have a livelihood, I still need to produce my crops the way the conventional way. So and sustainable, sustainable produced food are usually more expensive than the, the conventional produce food. So people normally opt for that and it's really a challenge for farmers. So then those are the main challenges actually with transition to sustainable agriculture. Yeah. And I think I'm also seeing, for example, certain organic products sometimes don't look or are not sometimes the same sites in terms of specific species that work well as the conventionally produced one, which look like they're picture perfect in some sense. I don't know if that also has as an impact because I have seen people who might not see a big price difference, but they just don't find it good looking enough to buy sometimes. Not sure if that's an experience that you had to. Yes, yes, I cannot deal with that. And also the other day I got these wipes that say they were organic. And then I realized I have to use them more than the conventional product. So I thought maybe I would use those less, but now I find myself to see more of those products than the other ones. Yeah, I just wanted to raise as well a question. You know, the fact that when we're talking about obviously different organic produce and even as you were saying that low like small scale examples of like farming in a small scale with no local community, but I suppose another factor is as you was kind of alluding to the quality of produce is things like efficiency and on that commercial level, the efficiency of produce and meeting meeting demand from the public in having enough of you know, having enough resources, you know, products to feed a population, etc. and how that kind of intersects with the sustainability requirements on that kind of mass scale. Obviously, people can talk about organic farming, but on that sort of mass scale, I think that must be one of the biggest challenges in terms of supplying demand within populations broadly and how what the sustainability approaches are there. So I'm wondering if that's something that could be noted as needing more of a revision and more of a comprehensive one, as opposed to what is often cited as I've noticed where people do talk about they might ignore the need for, let's say, approaches to preventing deforestation. You know, talk about say animal agriculture, for example, and the huge impact that has on deforestation or water use, etc. But people then point to small scale examples to kind of say, yeah, but this can be done in a way which is more sustainable. But obviously, there are huge challenges given the fact that in order for most supply, for most people, there is that well, let's say that large scale commercial need for agriculture. So I'm just wondering how we could address those challenges and how you would see that lot, lot, lot, the distinction between or where in the South African context, how you would see local or community based produce, is that possible to supply populations broadly or is the commercial side needed and therefore needing to be revised and how it's done so it's done sustainably? I think because now there's more people, especially let me I speak about South Africa, because more people are now in the city. We do need more conventional agriculture to supply food. But if people really stayed in their villages and not move more to the city and I think because what happens in rural areas in villages, people plant crops and they have animals and they would either sell those crops to the community. So you find that you are feeding the community. So now the farmers, the commercial farmers don't have too much pressure on feeding the whole population because now people are also moving away from the villages to the city. There's a demand now to feed these people who are in the city, who are not planting crops in their garden and all that. So that's why I think the the conventional farming has become prominent that way. So there are still small farmers. Like for instance, for me, I always tried for farmers that I could go to to buy the food directly from them. And now in fact, the challenge now with them, I think they also saw, OK, people now want naturally grown food then they don't want to that are produced. Convinational way, you find that now the prices are now so high. And then you realize we can compare them with the prices at the supermarket. You realize, wow, I'm feeding twice as much to get this natural grown chicken or sheep. And that also discourages one to extra support those small farmers who are producing sustainable grown chickens and other livestock. Yeah, I'm just wondering, yeah, and to the, you know, the I suppose the reality faced with the world at the moment is the factor of, you know, population growth and huge. We've got over eight billion people on the planet now. And I suppose that comes into it as well, that like historically, you know, thousands of years, you know, we've been able to live within sustainable parameters, obviously, but with that population growth and supply of food products to the population, there's obviously has to be some attempt at because of the huge scale of agriculture required that it has to have that revised approach. And I think obviously, yeah, so I suppose population is probably a big part of it, as you said, so many people are living in cities, but that too is, you know, just our human existence generally has a big encroaching impact on the natural world. Yes. Yeah. On the demand side, I think that's one of the biggest challenges is having a market that's accepting organic food and also just giving standard of living and just struggles with a bunch of crises we've had in the past, I would say three to four years. There is a, you know, cost attached to it. But there are other challenges as well that we spoke about for farmers. Are there any solutions, maybe technological solutions that are actually helping organic and sustainable practices going forward? Are there any examples that you want to share with us? Well, actually, for commercial, even for sustainable farmers, I think now the US technologies that farmers are using now is precision agriculture, where farmers are now using drones and sensory devices to actually detect pests, checking whether the crops are there, filled, it has water or it's dry, so it helps them improve their farming practices. So those, that is one of the technologies that I'm seeing happening as well as also artificial intelligence is really gaining a lot of momentum in the agricultural sector. Farmers are using it to get early warnings of severe weather conditions like these days we are having heat waves and most farmers are complaining that crops are drying out. So artificial intelligence can help farmers with detecting severe weather conditions like droughts and floods, which normally are some of the factors that influence farmers production. And artificial intelligence, they can also determine the moisture content in the soil of the crops that they have planted, whether there is enough water or less water. So it improves the farmers irrigation system. So the farmer will end up implementing smart irrigation systems that will let him know when to irrigate and when not to irrigate. So in that way, they are conserving water. So it moves water based on what the crop requires. So those are some of the technologies that are actually including that culture sector. Yeah, I think that's great that there are ways technology can help, especially today with digital technology moving at the base that it is. And are there any actual practices that the farmers do which have changed from a day to day perspective in the pursuit of being more sustainable? On one hand, like you said, is the use of technology to get certain data or warning systems. But what have they probably changed in how they do farming? Yes, there are other farming practices that promote sustainable agriculture, which requires farmers to use. Less machinery, less energy. And these, for example, no till practices, no tillage. So farming, you find that in conversion of farming, a farmer would use fossil fuel powered vehicles to actually prepare the soil for planting. But no tillage, you don't have to use. fossil fuel consumption machinery. You just plant the crops directly on the soil without having to alter or disturb the soil. So no tillage is actually one of the sustainable methods that some farmers are using to eliminate energy use. And there's also crop rotation. Farmers, they basically plant crops not at the same area or piece of land, consecutively every year. So you find that way, the land where you initially planted spinach, for example, we now change plant pattern, watermelon. So it also helps retain the soil health and not really affect the composition and the structure of the soil. Maybe while you're talking about practices, we can mention how does having local products or market have any impact? Definitely, yes. Local products are actually good because you find that it takes a shorter time for to deliver these foods to the stalls, to the retailers. So it takes quite a short time and the food are fresher and it becomes less expensive. Local agriculture, supporting it's actually very sustainable. And in some cases, if you buy directly to the farmer, you actually eliminate the farmer having to now package his or her product. So I think even my dad calls, he also supplies to one of the local stalls, Egg Home. They don't use packaging like you see in big retail stalls. Just, you know, fastened with rubber banding. Then it just saves a lot on packaging material. Yeah, that's predominantly plastic in most places. It's quite insane, for example, when you see a banana wrapped in a plastic, which makes absolutely no sense, no matter where I think it comes from. And I think one of the other impacts I think we see that in terms of local products, correct me if I'm wrong, are there specific crops or, you know, way of farming that promotes more sustainable agriculture? Yeah, it's really dependent on whether the crop can sustain the type of weather conditions. So farmers, nobody, they look at weather patterns and when they plan for farming in the next year, they see, OK, this year I might not. I don't think I should plant or some in some cases, they don't know what the weather is going to be like. So but some of them have knowledge about how to mitigate on these severe weather conditions. So crops like maize, where I come from in the three states, they can tolerate drought, they can tolerate heat in the waves. It's a big thing in South Africa these days. And sunflower, it's also one of the crops that can tolerate great drought and heat. And there's other crops in other parts of the world, it's like wheat. I think even in the Soto, wheat and beans, they do well in those conditions. So and yes. And like I said earlier, farming systems like crop rotation helps because if you are planting the same crop every year, you might find that it's not going to survive when this year's weather conditions. So when you rotate your crops and not plant the same thing, the crops might do well. And farmers can also try to farm other crops that they haven't farmed before, because you don't know how they do. The type of soil your farm is or the type of weather that will be there. Yes. Yeah. I just wanted to briefly add to that. And I just wanted to briefly add, I'm not certainly not an expert in agricultural sustainability, but one interesting innovation I'm aware of, as Lotlow was mentioning about new crops was or new approaches was the phenomena, recent phenomena of seaweed farming and just seeing how that has extraordinary potential at least because there isn't that requirement for fertilizer or water used for it to grow. And it does have many uses, including to supplement plastic bags, it can be a plastic use as well as food, food source for different additives as well as protein, but also it is a huge carbon source of carbon sequestration. So it's really it's good for climate. The climate and mitigating climate change as well. So that's probably another just a little interesting point I thought to mention that going forward, you wonder to what extent that will be embraced given that it has a completely different sort of out for 10 way of being produced that then most traditional agriculture obviously on land. Anyway. Yeah. Yeah. I think beyond land agriculture, there's also other things that we could probably grow. What is needed to promote sustainable agriculture? For me, what I think consumers can do really to contribute to sustainable agriculture, firstly, they should focus on eating what is in season, buying what is in season. That way, we do not put too much pressure on the resources. In fact, we do not put too much pressure on farmers to produce crops that are not in season. And that also helps the farmer to not put too much pressures on the resources, because now they have to produce crops that are not in season because people now want. If people can just eat what is in season and rotate crops like that, I think it will contribute to sustainable agriculture and won't have to put too much pressure on our resources. Yeah, and I'll probably just mention obviously just being the consumer to be aware of, you know, the impact that some agriculture can have on the ecosystem broadly. And yeah, to try and choose sustainably. Obviously, plant-based approaches is helpful, but yeah, to choose sustainably, broadly just to be aware of things like water use as well. And as well as particular businesses, which might not be sustainable in their operations as well. Yeah, and I think just education broadly is not just for farmers. It's also for consumers a lot of times, like Clare Lowe was saying. And I think we could also probably focus on the fact that there needs to be probably policies and just general promotion, something that people from all walks of life can kind of come together and try and make a push in their local governments and their local agencies as well to ensure that there is some kind of policy and incentives that might help farmers really focus and sustainable farming without losing. There are sorts of revenue. Yes, most definitely. Yeah, and I think it's also important. I remember a study particularly showing how incentivising farmers and having proper policy guidance by governments for for, you know, moving towards more sustainable farming, and particularly where it's particularly the current practices might be particularly bad, but it does need to be leadership from governments and less sort of governments adhering to short term economic profits or, you know, GDP, short term benefits and looking more to the future of sustainability and guiding both farmers and consumers alike in that way. And the people people within the community, the consumers putting pressure on governments to do so and to look at what is sustainable farming and what isn't and to put pressure on governments to lead in that way to to make it easier for that transition. Yes. Thank you so much. I definitely learned a lot. Thanks to a little bit of Michael for talking together for this much time on this topic. Thank you for having me.",
