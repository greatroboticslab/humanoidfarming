  "text": "Am I the only one who thought vertical gardens were super hard to make? Spoiler. They're not. Here's what you need. A reclaimed wood plank, small pots, screws, a drill, measuring tape, a pencil, and optional hooks or brackets for hanging. First, measure and mark where you want to attach the pots on your plank. Even spacing is key. Next, drill holes at the marked spots. These will secure your pots. Take your small pots and screw them into the drilled holes. Make sure they're snug and secure. Want to hang your garden? Attach hooks or brackets to the top of the plank. Finally, fill your pots with soil and plant your favorite herbs. Give them a good watering and place your vertical garden in a sunny spot. And there you have it. A stylish, functional vertical herb garden perfect for small spaces. Thanks for watching.
