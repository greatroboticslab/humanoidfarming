  "text": "Hi, this is Stacy from The Advisor. I'm very excited today because we have Sandra Vensti here today and he is an amazing individual. He has a really amazing story to tell and he right now, he was going to go and become a veterinarian back in the day and he found his true purpose in life and he's going to share that purpose with you and how he took his purpose and made into a reality. Sandra, tell everybody a little about yourself and what you do. Thank you, Stacy. Yes. When I was younger, I've always had deep love for animals. It wasn't a surprise to me or my parents that I wanted to do something with animals growing up. That was always a North Star for me. I wasn't sure if it was farming or veterinary medicine and as soon as there was any sort of doubt, my parents were like, you got to go explore veterinary medicine, make sure that you go down that road first because farming is tough. You can't have any doubts in your mind when things are getting tough and farming and when you have bad days, stuff like that. You can't live a life with regret and what ifs and stuff like that. I went to the veterinary medicine route. I went to university of Guelph and I did everything that I need to do to get my application ready and instead of sending it in, I changed my mind and I came home and said dairy farm instead. That was 2010 when I graduated. Basically, we farmed together with my parents for four or five years and then 2015, we moved our cows into a new dairy facility, which was very exciting because I found it endlessly frustrating in our old dairy facility because that barn was built in 1987. They didn't really know much about how a barn should be built for a cow to thrive and they didn't. They didn't thrive. It was endlessly frustrating for me being as passionate about animals as I am. When they moved them over to the new barn, the cows thrived. They did better. They proved more milk. They lived longer. They had better body condition. They seemed happier. It was amazing. Right around that same time as the cows health improved, ironically, my own health took a hit. My hormones crashed. I had to look around like, what am I doing wrong? What am I missing? Why all of a sudden now, at the age of 25, has my testosterone crashed to nothing basically to nine-year-old man levels? Then I started looking around and I was questioning everything. I was questioning the healthcare system because I was balancing around from doctor to doctor and nobody was able to figure out what was actually wrong. I had doctors telling me that I need to just accept my condition and move on, stop trying to look for things that I can change or improve or things like that. I just needed to accept it and move on with my life. Naturally, I wasn't willing to do that, but then it took me about six years though to finally figure out enough things where I was able to improve my own health to the point where my hormones returned. Then, but on that same time, questioning my life, I was also questioning the way we farmed. I was looking for ways that I could improve the lives of our farm animals and do things better. Going down that rabbit hole is what led me to regenerative agriculture. A lot of the goals are aligned when it comes to trying to improve animal welfare and the goals of regenerative agriculture and getting the cows back outside in the environment where they can have a positive impact on the environment. Where we are now is I have my commercial dairy farm, which I still have lots of plans, lots of dreams of transitioning that to regenerative agriculture as well, but in the meantime, I'm trying to build that customer base. I have the pasture turkeys that I have on our pasture that fall behind our grass pad beef. It mimics the ways that the massive herds of bison used to roam North America. Then, there would be birds falling behind there. They complement each other really well, which is a common theme in regenerative agriculture where you treat your farm like an ecosystem. It's a lot of give and take and a lot of complementary traits between the different animals and the goals of producing food on your farm. I don't think people realize how common problems with hormones, how many people go through it, how many people go through low testosterone or low progesterone or they have low estrogen or their estrogen is too high and people are really imbalanced in our society. It does. It could start at any age. When people think about low testosterone, they immediately associate it with later in life, but it's not really true. I started having problems with my testosterone at age 39 and I didn't even know what was going on. I just started getting symptoms out of the blue and I went to the doctor and my doctor was the same as yours. Just didn't have an answer. Just take birth control. You'll be fine. I'm like, I'm not taking birth control. Then later on, I went to other doctors that were more natural and they did tests and they figured out what was going on. In our society, people don't realize, but a lot of it has to do too with the foods we eat. In America, because especially, a lot of foods are injected with hormones. Nowadays, you see children at the age of eight starting to develop breasts and starting to go through menstruation at an early age because they're injecting the chickens with hormones and they're injecting certain animals with hormones and they're injecting cows with hormones. Those hormones are going into your body and they're changing the whole chemistry of your body. Like we discussed before, everybody's body is different. We all come from different DNA. For some people, going through low testosterone at a young age can be normal. It can happen at any age and that's what people have to be aware of. Problems like low libido or erectile dysfunction is so common in our society worldwide. It's just not talked about. As we were discussing before, you were talking about regenerative ag and you were talking about how the different foods and how eating certain foods and how to take care of the animals and take care of your bodies can play such a huge role. Can you explain a little bit more about regenerative ag and explain to people what it is and how it could have such an impact on your health? Very simply, regenerative agriculture is just farming in a way that maximizes soil health. That's in contrast to just trying to maximize profits or maximize efficiency. If you take a layer deeper, a little more complex, what you're really trying to do is you're trying to create a thriving ecosystem of microorganisms in the soil. When it's done properly, you have a very complex food chain of these microorganisms. You have your bacteria, you have your fungus, you have protozoa, nematose, arthropods. It's a crazy amount of biomass underneath the soil that we don't even realize is there. But when you have that and it's done correctly, what the plant then can do is it can excrete a sugar into the soil and trade those sugars for nutrients. Then you don't need the synthetic fertilizers because the plant can ask for nutrients from the microorganisms in the soil and they'll go out and they'll mine these nutrients from the rocks and from the silt and sand. Then they'll trade those and then they'll be able to, for the sugars so that the microorganisms can thrive. That's their food source. What's really important in this whole system, a keystone species, is the micro-ryzol fungi, which is basically a long filament that actually embeds into the root of the plant and reaches out into the soil and transports these nutrients and these sugars. What actually happens is when we use these synthetic fertilizers or we use things like large equipment to drive over our land, these fungus are the first to die off. They're very sensitive. We have to be careful with how we treat our land. Then what we can do is we follow these five principles of soil health, which are very important because if you follow these five principles, then you don't have this negative impact on the soil and you don't kill all this diversity in your soil because if you don't have that diversity, you end up being addicted to synthetic fertilizers. There's really no other way to grow crops because without this relationship between the microorganisms and the plant, the plant can't get the nutrients without fertilizer. It's not just the fertilizer and the nutrients that the plant is missing. It's missing the defense chemicals from all the insects and stuff like that. If it doesn't have these defense chemicals from these healthy insects, well then it becomes vulnerable for pests. Then you end up spraying with pesticides. It's the same story with weeds. If you don't have the diversity, not only of the microorganism, but also just the plants that are in the soil, one of the main downsides of these monocrops is that you're missing that diversity that is missing in the soil and the nature doesn't like that monocrops. Then that's when the weeds come in and you start spraying for weeds. It's a vicious cycle, and it's a hard thing to break free from. When you're following these five principles, which is like you need the biodiversity, you need to minimize the impact that you have on your soil. You have to have armor on the soil in the form of plants or pasture or whatever else, and you need to have living roots in the soil all year round. The last thing is you need animal impact. If you have those five things, you can have that diversity where you can break free from that addiction and then you can have that beautiful relationship between these microorganisms and the plants. It's not just, oh, and now I don't need synthetic fertilizer. You end up with a much more nutrient dense food because you can never fertilize for absolutely everything that the every micronutrient that the plant wants and needs that it can find in the soil. You can never fertilize for all those tiny micronutrients. You end up with like with food that has less nutrients in it for that reason. It's a beautiful system, and the end result is nutrient healthy nutrient dense food. You know, it's pretty amazing because it seems like when you do regenerative agriculture, it seems like for one, you're balancing your gut because you have the good bacteria, the bad bacteria, you have the healthy soil, and that helps your digestive system work, which in tale helps everything. It helps because gut health is really related to everything, including your brain and the fogginess, the way we think, our clarity, overall health. That's one of the components that it seems like it really helps. Because when you think about it, once you start adding those pesticides and those weeds and all those toxins into your body, your body doesn't know what to do with them. It stores them and it stores it in our body. What happens is that our body, our organs become sluggish. It affects the way we feel. It could cause illness after so long, and people are going to the doctors. They don't understand why they don't feel good. It all has to do with the root cause of how the food is made, how it's grown, how it's taken care of. People are getting sick all over the United States. I don't know what the regulations are in other countries, but for the United States, there's so many illnesses. In illnesses, the percentages have grown and grown and grown. So many people have realized that a lot of it has to do with gut health, leaky gut syndrome, not having enough of good bacteria versus bad bacteria. It all has to do with a lot of the way we take care of ourselves, we take care of the food that we're growing. It's really hurt in our society. We talked about our hormones and we talked about gut health and illnesses. It all draws back to really we need to have concern of how we are growing our food, and really what we're doing, because it's affecting our society as a whole. It's destroying the health of people nationwide and any other countries that are doing similar things. Absolutely. You're right. There's a huge issue with autoimmunity in our day and age today. A lot of it comes back to the food we eat, but also a lifestyle of sanitation where we're obsessed with putting alcohol on our hands and cleaning everything and making everything perfectly clean and disinfecting. And it starts with the food and the soil because the soil we farm in a way typically with commercial agriculture where it's almost a sanitary soil. There's bacteria, but there's so devoid of life. It's almost like a sanitized growing environment. And then lack of diversity comes up through the food chain. So the plants don't have the healthy microbiome on it as well. Because there's not the microbiome, there's a void there. As soon as you have something growing, some E. coli or some sort of unhealthy bacteria, it will explode in population because there's not the competition of the healthy microorganisms on that food. So it becomes even more important that we sanitize our food. So people talk about food, how it's important. You eat your dirty food and stuff like that with some dirt on it. So you have those microorganisms, but it's not that simple because you've got to make sure it's the right dirt. It's the dirt with the healthy diversity, the healthy ecosystem of microorganisms in it. And then we can fix the whole, not only the food system with the microbiome, but also just our culture of sanitation. It's incredibly important because if you look at our body, we are more bacteria than we are human. We're vessels for carrying this diverse population of bacteria in our body. So we have to be careful too with a lot of these pesticides and herbicides or sprays that we put on our food or sanitize our hands with or whatever else. It might not affect our human cells, but it could very well be affecting our microbiome. Yeah. And they come out with information about everyone with hand sanitizer, especially during COVID and everybody's using it, but hand sanitizer is not good for you. Germs are good for you. People don't realize it, but we need germs. We need to grow our antibodies. We need, just like when they say take a probiotic, you should be taking a prebiotic too because good bacteria versus bad bacteria. You need both. You need both in your body and people don't realize that. And then in America, we have chickens are getting shot up with nitrate and they're getting shot up with all these different chemicals and things. And we as a society really need to try to go more the pure route like you were talking about regenerative ag and be able to have a cleaner way of living because if we don't, we're going to, our country health wise is going to be destroyed. It's already, you see stats of how much illnesses have gone up in so many different categories. And the question is why? And our society is not looking at what they're putting in their bodies. And we were talking about before the show, you really need to treat your body as a temple. And maybe you can expand on that, explain to people why it is so important that we just don't throw things in our mouths and we just don't take anything that we see over the counter, but we treat our body as a temple. Yeah. It's something that I believe in very strongly is because you got to look after your meat bag is how I like to think about it because it makes you more effective at everything you do in life. It makes me a better dad, a better husband. It makes me a better farmer. It gives me more energy, more clarity and thought. It allows me to dream of directions I want to take my life like with more elites and make an impact on agriculture and improving animal welfare and also bring the movement of regenerative agriculture forward. All that health is absolutely critical to be ourselves, but 100% ourselves, not just walking through life and waking up and hitting the snooze button and going through life as a zombie and being on repeat. It's absolutely critical. And the food that we eat is a big part of that. We got to go back to eating a simpler diet. It's not all these complex ingredients and packages stuff like that. It's just your one ingredient and that's real food. And then the step beyond that is the food that you eat that simple is just one ingredient. It's just your whole food. It's nothing packaged. A step beyond that then is like, okay, now that I've made that massive leap away from processed foods, the next step is okay, now the food that I'm eating is that top quality food. Is that also food that's raised in a way that makes it so it's nutrient dense, it's healthy. It's not only healthy, but it improves animal welfare or it improves the environment. It's treated in a way that is healthy for the whole ecosystem, us as a whole, and our planet as a whole. Oh, 100%. I agree with you totally. And it's a lifestyle change. It's not just something you're going to do temporarily and then, okay, just like people go on these fad diets, they after a while, they get sick of doing it and they go back to their old way of living. It's something that you have to incorporate into your life and stay consistent. I don't look at it as things as a diet. I don't look at things as this is the way it has to be. I call it a lifestyle change. Do you want to be healthy? Do you want to feel good? Do you want to prevent illness from a current? Do you want to sustain your illness that you have right now? Do you want to keep it at a level where you could be productive and happy? Do you want to be able to live life the way you've always dreamt of being? Do you want to have goals in the future and be able to reach those goals? Well, people don't realize it, but it all stems back on how we take care of ourselves and what we put in our bodies. And it's so important that people realize that every little thing, whether it's a supplement, a vitamin, the food that we eat, whether it be natural or processed, you have to really think about what am I putting in my body and how is that going to affect me? And make it so natural that you do it so consistently that you don't even have to think about it anymore. You're just doing it. You're just doing it. And I think people have to really, seriously, think about that. How is it affecting their life? People have stomach issues and they're not digesting food well, and they're going to a gastrologist, and I'm having all these problems. What are you eating? Well, I had a pizza yesterday, and then in the morning I had a bowl of cereal, and it had this enormous amount of sugar in it, and people don't get it. But we really have to focus where we're getting our foods and what we're putting in our mouths, and think about the more natural way of living and how that could benefit us in the long run, I think. What are your feelings about that? I completely agree. And we have to be careful that we're not trapped by normal. All the normal ranges for your blood. All the normal diet, that can't be what's causing you. That's not a normal diet for you to be eating. But you know what? It's also normal to diet the ages 60, 75, 80 from cardiovascular disease, cancer, and all these chronic diseases that are arguably preventable with a healthy lifestyle and exercise and a healthy diet. You got to almost be aware of normal, because if you really look at what normal is, that's not a happy road to walk down. I don't want to start losing vitality by the age of 65, because that's for a time and age, and it's normal to have a sore body and an achy body and be incapable of doing the things that I want to do with my life now. And it's normal to now take a step back and no longer have big dreams, because that's what normally happens. Be aware of normal. And it starts with every single day with your daily choices. Are you eating with the normal diet that's leading people down this road, this unhappy road, really? Are you making the normal choices that's going to lead you down that road as well? Or should you now do an overhaul of your pantry and have instead of your packaged food for snacks, you have some pizza or fruit or something like that, have some healthy habits, and it all comes back to habits. Yes. And it becomes easy once you form these healthy habits, these things that become normal for your new life, where you're cooking your own food, you're buying food from that perimeter of the grocery store, and you're having simple snacks that are just one ingredient, that is nothing in a package. And you don't stop and buy that takeout because it's convenient, it's now normal, like, oh, I can just fast. You can fast and not eat for a couple of days, and you'll be fine. It's crazy. And you don't have to stop as soon as you have a hunger paying. You can drive and you can wait until you come home, you can have a piece of fruit, and then you can cook something up that's healthy. Right. These are all habits that you can form. And then like you said, it's not a diet, it's a lifestyle. It's a way of life where you do this long term for the rest of your life, and then so when you can go down a road that's abnormal, that's abnormally amazing, abnormally healthy, with lots of vitality. Yes, and it's so true. And it's all mental, what we put in our head and how we react to things is how we feel. If you start taking care of your body and you start feeling good, in your head, you're going to feel young. And that in itself, because we're all connected, mind, body, and soul, it's all connected. So if you're taking care of your body, you're feeling good, you're feeling young, and it's in your head, I feel great. I feel like a 30 year old. You could be 65, but you feel like you're 30, you're going to act like you're 30. You're going to keep making dreams. Your body feels good, your mind feels clear, and you can keep having those big dreams, even when you're 65, when you're so normal to be retiring, like you could have big dreams still, you can strive for an amazing life. Exactly. Life does not end because the quote unquote, in our normal society, you retire at 65, well, that means life is over, you have to sit on a couch and watch soap operas all day. No, it's all how you perceive it. It's how you take care of yourself, it's what you put in your mind. You could change the way you think, the way you live, the way you've everything, all by creating that healthy lifestyle. Now, I want to just tap into talking about the hormone issues, because I feel like it's such a huge issue, especially in the United States, and all over, because I've spoken with people that are just not from the United States, all over the world that have had these issues and contacted me, having low testosterone, having low progesterone, having low libido, and going through erectile dysfunction, and they just don't know what to do. You see on the counters, a lot of times you'll go into food stores, you'll go into pharmacies, and you'll see tons and tons of bottles, all, boost your testosterone, do this, great muscles, and blah, blah, blah, and all this stuff, and all these promises, but a lot of these things are not good for you. Our whole body is run by hormones, so you have to be very careful. Just like we talked about treating your body like a temple, when you play around with hormones, you have to be really, really careful. I went to a functional medicine doctor, you went to a natural path. We were monitored by a professional. I know that I had to take consistent blood tests, and they had to make sure everything was leveled properly, and because if you have too much of something, it could throw your whole body off in many ways. I don't know how you feel, but when you went to the natural path, everybody else told you, don't worry about it, just live with it, suck it up. What was the turning point when you went to that natural path that helped you get your life back in that area of your life? The real thing that the naturopath gave me was optimism, because everywhere else I spoke with, it was just hormone replacement therapy. There was never any talk of lifestyle. These are the drugs that you should take, and you should accept that and move on. The unique thing about the naturopath is, they said, I asked them, this is what I'm dealing with, this is what the doctors tell me, do you think I could fix this? They saw a road to recovery, and it gave me a glimmer of hope when I wasn't really getting much of that from anywhere else. They helped me with a little more concrete things too. I had digestive issues, and along with digestive issues is I had a B12 deficiency, I couldn't absorb those B vitamins from my food. It took me a short period of time, and that helped a little bit. They also pointed out to me, these are probably the foods that you are reacting to. You can try to avoid these certain foods that are causing you to flare up your immune system and have this inflammation throughout your body. I tried that too, and it definitely helped. And then it got me walking down that path. I started reassessing everything as far as health, my sleep habits. I grew up in a household of three brothers and no sisters and a hard-working dad. So it was a real environment of just go get it and work hard and to help the consequences kind of like you're now. Fight for the future that you want to have. I was all for it. That mindset came naturally to me. It's the way I grew up. It's just that grit and that hard work and push through, and tired doesn't matter. I can handle that kind of thing. It came so naturally to me, and I think that's part of the reason why I struggled. I didn't have this opposing force. This whole other part of my personality wasn't being developed to the same degree as the hard part of my personality. The softer side of myself, I was not developing to the same degree. And that's a real inflection point in my life when I got sick. It's like, what am I missing? And then that's when I started looking at these softer sides of my personality. And surprisingly enough, exercise for me was part of that because it felt like a form of self-expression. Exercise before, because I had a physical job, any sort of exercise was a waste of energy. That could be energy I could put to get in work done, physical work. Taking the time to really focus myself and improve my movement patterns so that I wouldn't have all these achy joints, my body hurt, and all my joints hurt. I couldn't walk without pain anymore. I couldn't even run at all anymore. It was so restricting all this pain that I was constantly trying to force myself through my day, through all this pain, and discomfort, and just tired and brain fog. It's tough because it's not one simple feeling or one simple diagnosis or one simple issue that you're having. Like you said, the hormones, they affect your whole body. So it's a long list of insignificant symptoms that add up to like, I feel like an old man. And have my energy levels, like my immune system is not working, I have warts on my thumb and I try treating it, it wouldn't go away, we just spread. And then, so I was focusing on a lot of different things, things that really helped was like really improve my diet, simplify my diet, get eating those whole foods. And getting enough meat in my diet made a difference too because I got sick, the vegan move was massive. And it seems hypocritical as a dairy farmer to try the vegan diet, but I was desperate, I was willing to try anything. So I did. And there's things that I did improve with, my diet did improve to some degrees because I had a lot of the whole plant foods. But I really started feeling much more vitality when I started adding a lot of those animal products back in and eating a lot of meat and a lot of dairy, raw dairy, because I'm one of the few people in Canada that can have raw dairy because I produce it myself. It's legal for me to consume it. And because like the pasteurized, more processed dairy I was reacting to, it was the thing that was triggering my immune system, but I can drink leaders and leaders of raw milk without issues. So that's added that back to my diet and that really helped as well, as well as fasting. My hormones never returned for six years straight and is frustrating because I constantly was building these healthy habits and my hormones haven't returned yet and it's almost, can be tough to keep going when you're in that place, but it's like when you're sick, you're almost had to push your body to the extreme and to allow it the permission to relax and recover and allow you to bring your hormones back. But for me, the last triggering moment that allowed my body to relax was I did a prolonged fast, the first one I ever did. After that, it was two and a half to three days something like that. I'm never really too picky, dogmatic about it or too strict, but it's like two and a half, three days. And after that, my hormones improved, but they came back and I wasn't taking hormones anymore. And it never gets old being healthy because you can have all sorts of dreams in your life, but as soon as you get sick, you only have one. So it's such a weight lifted off my shoulder to be healthy again. It's wonderful once you start feeling better again because I went from being so young and feeling so old. I couldn't even get myself out of bed. I was so fatigued and I couldn't focus. My moods were all over the board. Everything was changing about me. It was amazing because there's so many tests out there now. They got DNA tests, they got hair tests, they have certain food tests where they could tell you what foods you can eat, what foods you can have moderately, and what foods you need to stay away from because your body might not be agreeing with certain foods, but you're not having a physical reaction. You're not getting bumps or a rash, but you're getting all these symptoms inside and you don't understand why, but your body is not agreeing with the foods that you're putting in your body. For me personally, I did hormone therapy and then they tested all my vitamins and they tested all my what I was lacking and they put me on certain supplements and they put me on certain vitamins that I was deficient in. I also started to do different supplements that rejuvenated the cells in your body because the older you get and when you start to go into the perimenopause and you start to slow down your libido, your body is not the same anymore and your cell production is slower. Everything is starting to get deficient. I was taking pomegranate and I was taking both extract and the pomegranate itself and that helped with the rejuvenation of cells and a lot of other little things and just eating certain foods and like you said, sleep. People don't realize it, but sleep is a huge factor and so is stress, learn how to cope with stress. And I love how you brought up about exercise because exercise is not just about gaining muscle strength. You can let out a lot of steam and it makes you feel good about yourself and it really can help you. It makes you feel good about yourself. It takes that stress level down and you start to feel more focused and it also gives you a good view of the day like wow, I accomplished this, I got this done, I feel good and put you on a different pathway of mentally thinking. So I think exercise and sleep are two major factors because I started to make sure that I got incorporated enough of sleep and some people don't even realize it, but when they're going through this stuff, a lot of people suffer from insomnia. So then there's different ways that you could focus on to try to help with insomnia that are natural, that are out there as well. But sleep is important. You need those eight hours of sleep and just a little bit of exercise and walking around a lake or just going outside and taking a walk down the road. Things like that is all you need. You don't have to be like lifting 60-pound weights and going on the exercise bike for an hour and a half. You could be doing simple things and they could have a huge impact on your body. So I think it's like I learned what my body needed and I learned what my body didn't want. And once I started staying away from what my body didn't want when I started incorporating everything that I needed, I started feeling the change. Was that something similar that you felt as well? Yeah, for me it's the same but different. The path with the natural path, they tell me the B12, they tell me the foods I need to avoid. And those things helped a lot. But eventually the B12 didn't make much of a difference anymore as I was trying to have less inflammation and stuff like that. And the things that made the biggest impact on my health was just the very simple things like the sleep. And my sleep is not perfect now. I got four young boys and they keep me up all hours the day and night. But I have enough of those healthy habits. I think that now I'm able to handle a little bit of lack of sleep but I prioritize my sleep whenever I can. And I have the naps when I need to. And I'm getting through with not as much sleep as I would like. But for me the big things was just there's clues in your life as far as what to focus on. For example, the things that you dread the most quite often, that's a hint. Why do I dread that? For example, when I was in the depth of feeling like an old man, I was almost fearful of being cold, which is a problem because I live in Canada. It gets pretty cold. I dread getting out of the shower. My body was often cold. In my family there's a long line of rhinos where your blood circulation shuts off in your extremities. It gets a little bit cold and then it gets extremely cold because the blood circulation shuts off painful. And you can have all sorts of damage to your skin and stuff like that with a lack of blood flow. But that's something I struggle with constantly. And it got to the point where I almost had symptoms of anxiety around going outside and doing the work that I need to do on a daily basis. So I started doing cold showers. And believe me, the amount of stress that I felt getting that water is insane. But I stuck with it. And I learned so much about my body in the meantime. Not only did I get healthier because the benefits that people often talk about, I revitalize the mitochondria in my body because the mitochondria are the heat producing parts of your cells. And they produce heat and energy. So I had more energy throughout my whole day because of it. But also things like once you get into that cold water, you have to try to control your stress response, control your breathing. And I was never really aware of my breathing before. So when I took what I learned, trying to get into the cold water, and to what stressed breathing felt like and how to control that, and now what relaxed breathing feels like. I started noticing I'm just working, just doing my normal work throughout the day. I'm stress breathing for no reason. Right. To your body, that stress. Yeah. It's a threat your whole day just the way you're breathing. You got to breathe into your, through your diaphragm, into your belly. And I was breathing up in my chest constantly, just shallow breathing. And that's signaling to my body that we're in a stressful situation where I wasn't. I was just going about through my daily routine. And so that was a huge hint, why I'm so fearful and almost anxious of the cold. It's like that's a direction I needed to go. And that made a massive difference, bigger than a lot of other things. And then like in fasting, I was like, it never occurred to me, as I, especially when I was younger, but growing up and like, I'm six feet tall, I had huge growth spurts I couldn't do without food. I need to grow and fuel my body kind of thing. And like, and then later on in life, I got to fuel the work I got to do. I got a physical job. Never occurred to me to do it fast. But when I did, like I said, that was a triggering event that brought my hormones back. And only that is surprisingly easy. And later on, I listened to other people about fasting, you take some salt while you're fasting, it curbs your hunger, and it keeps your strength up. So I can do a physical job. I can pick stones all day, fasted, as long as I have enough salt. If I start feeling shaky and weak, I consume a little extra salt and I'm good to go again. Like it's, and it's like the power that you feel realizing that you control over your diet, because if you're traveling or whatever else that you know, I can go two, three days without food, no problem. So I don't eat this convenient food that's around the airports or wherever else or, or at a party, something like that. And you're feeling some things like you can, you can wait, you won't die. Yeah, exactly. Like, yeah, that's like, there's really much focusing on simple things and looking at my own life for hints of what I should focus on first. But it's like, the really the simple things like eating the whole foods, getting some doing some, some, some exercise, it doesn't have to be crazy. Like you said, like the most important thing, but exercise is doing it consistently. So just do what you love. And for me, more like the, the, the, the animal type movement stuff that just felt freeing for some reason. And it wasn't in a masculine way. It was much more in a softer way that just the self expression only in our artistic way. But for me, it built my body, it got me strong. It was easy for me to stay consistent. And it's a lot of healthy body movements, which applied really well to my physical job, surprisingly enough to all the critics, especially my father out there seeing me exercising, saying like, why are you wasting all your energy? Because like, they allow you to learn how to move properly. Right. Release less joint pain, less body aches and things like that. So then, yeah, it made a, made that made a really big difference too. And all these, all these habits that I, that I focus on one at a time, then you make a habit around it becomes, it comes easy and normal to do those things on a day to day basis. And now he has maintained those habits and it becomes much easier. It's like building those habits and, and then for me, like the final straw was, was the fast. That's great. You know what? When you brought up the breathing, I, you know, that is so important. Like when I started to learn how to do slow breathing, and I took some lessons and they taught you how to control your stress, how to control your body through breathing. Wow. What a difference it made. You know, you couldn't be anywhere, you could be anywhere. And if you are conscious of the way you're breathing, you can change the way you feel, you can change the way your mind is thinking, you could change the way your body is feeling, just by the way you're breathing, you know, people have done like, you know, I've shown people how to do methods of relaxation, breathing, and as they're sitting in their seats at work when they're all stressed out. And you know, it's amazing how impactful it's so important to know how to breathe because most people don't pay attention. But if we're in a stressful situation, or if we're not feeling well, we should focus on our breathing, I think, and really learn the right way to breathe. And that's something that people should look into, I think. What do you feel? Yeah, it's always like, if you told me that 10 years ago, I thought that sounds hokey, I'm not going to worry about that. But like, it made a big difference in the average stress I felt throughout the day. And it's not just like, yes, you got your breathing and like being able to focus on that, but it's like the awareness of what relaxed breathing feels like and what stressed breathing feels like. That was massive for me just having that awareness. And like, so like for me, that was the biggest impact I got from cold exposure. It's just self awareness of what stress feels like and what relaxed feels like. I don't naturally have that much self awareness. I'm not really very naturally very self critical and there's good and bad things to that. Like I'm not really, I don't feel the impact of your pressure the same way some other people do. But like, yeah, it was the downside. Like I could be horribly stressed and have no idea. That awareness made a big difference. And just yeah, like being aware and then being able to change your breathing because you practiced relaxed breathing and just be able to switch over. And for me too, like other things like that I learned that techniques that I also used during those stressful cold periods is like I would smile even though I'm struggling, I would just force a big smile on my face and it's like, it's hilarious. Some of the research that are out there, people just putting pencils in their mouth, which kind of forces a smile and then you feel better. Like it works. Yeah. Like you wouldn't think so. And especially people, especially like myself, are just like go getters. It's like, I don't got time for that kind of hokey stuff. But it's like, it does it makes a difference. It makes a difference. And I feel like, you know, I hear people use that excuse, I don't have time. I don't have time, but we do have time. You know, all you need is five minutes of the day, 10 minutes of the day somewhere. If you can spare 15, even better. But all you need is a few minutes here and there. And just little tweaks can make such a big difference in your life. Something better than nothing. And then what I always tell myself is that it's never a lack of time that's your issue for not making this change. It's a lack of priorities. Like how important is it? Maybe you got just something in your life that's very important to you. Like you got a wedding coming up and you want to get a healthy body or like you have your kids or your grandkids or a massive dream that you might have like chasing your dreams or creating that business. Like, and that's a real thing for me. I'm trying to improve the lives of farm animals. Like, and it's like, you got to tie these little habits that you say, I should add this to my life. I don't got time or, but it's not that at all. It's a lack of priorities. Like what can I give up? Like, I don't golf anymore. Don't play video games forever. But like, it's like, it's like the things that the, like you can give up or like, or you look on your phone, it gives you a number every so often of the average amount of time you spend on your phone. Right. Day, like cut that in half and you can have hours. Exactly. Exactly. You know, I, you hit it right on the nose. It's really just an excuse because you don't prioritize what's important in your life. And you have to really think about what's important to you. You know, what do you really, how do you really want to feel? How do you really want to look? How do you really, you know, when you wake up in the morning, you look in the mirror, are you happy with who you see? Are you happy with the way you feel? And then you got to start just stop making excuses and just make little, you know, prioritize your time just a little better. And all you need is just a few minutes and miracles could happen. It's not going to happen right away, of course, you know, but baby steps, you know, that's part of the problems because usually the things that we need to give up, give us immediate gratification and the things that we're trying to add in requires that delay gratification. But those, but those, that, that, that delay gratification, the impact is massive. So like that's the problem. So you got to have a lot of self control in your life to make that happen. But if you, if you stick to it, it pays back for sure. Oh, it definitely does. It definitely does. Now, if you had to give a couple takeaways before we go, what are some important factors that you want people to realize from this whole conversation? Because we tapped into a lot of important things and we, you gave such, such great advice today. Thank you so much for all the great advice you gave. But if you had to like sum it up, what are some things that you just want the audience to realize from this conversation? Big, big picture is yes, you need to look after your body, look after yourself to make yourself more effective at everything you do. And I think just, just thinking now, like if you are in that place where you're sick, your body has an amazing capacity to heal. And I think that, that is, I think maybe the biggest takeaways. Like your body can heal if you get out of the way and stop feeding it junk and stop doom scrolling and stop sitting on the couch. Like these simple habits that you hear is not rocket science. Every basically everybody knows what you got to do to be healthy. Like you got to sleep enough. You got to exercise just a little bit. It doesn't have to be a whole lot. It's just start that habit. Eat your food, stay on the primitive grocery store. And then like, and then from like, once you get those, those, those core habits in place, like those, those simple things in your life, then you can really go into the weeds with it. And then you can like, you can really focus on like the quality of the food I'm eating. Is it regenerative rays? Do I know the farmer and stuff like that? Can I get more in touch with the food I'm eating and like really respect your food and stuff like that? Like you can keep going down those rows with exercise too and like, and like meditation and like you can keep this endless the way you can go, but just start with those, those few simple habits that can make a massive, massive difference. Oh yeah, for sure. And I got to, I got to be a testimony to what you just said, because I did those things in my, my health and even my mentality did a whole turnaround. So everything you just said is so true 100% true. Now before we go, can you tell everybody your website where they can find you and some of the services that you offer? Absolutely. Yeah. My, my farm is Moral Eats. M-O-R-A-L-E-A-T-S.com is our website. And what we're trying to do with this business is like, I'm trying to improve the lives of farm animals through supply and demand. Supply and demand is so, so powerful. And it's a bigger and more powerful way to make an impact than writing those comments on social media and stuff like that or anything else really. Supply and demand is so powerful and getting your voice heard. So like that's what we're trying to do with Moral Eats. And the best way to get in contact is like through our, through our website, you go and you sign up to our email list. That's our favorite way to contact people and educate people and keep them up to date of what we're trying to do with Moral Eats and our mission of improving the lives of farm animals and furthering regenerative culture. Because like the beautiful thing, beautiful thing about email is like, I don't have to rely on the algorithm to put my, my, my information in front of you. It's like, it's in your inbox. Either you delete it or you read it. Yeah. So it's like, but then beyond that, oh, and like, and if you live in Ontario, where it is, where we farm, like we will, if you sign up to our email list, you get that chance to, to win free, a free meat box and a sampler box of like, of everything that we have. We have our, our, our passion turkeys, our grass, that beef, we have passion pork, we have a wild and sustainably sourced wild seafood. And we try to get like a whole smorgasbord of, of, of products, especially animal products, because we're trying to improve the lives of farm animals. And hopefully in the near future, you'll find some dairy products in there with some calf foot dairy, which is just cows that are allowed, dairy cows are allowed to raise their own calf and, and, and have that be a massive step forward too towards animal welfare and improving animal welfare. So like, we got, we got big plans in the future, big dreams. But like, beyond that, you can, you can find us on, on Instagram and Facebook as, as more elites or on TikTok and YouTube as just my name is Sandra Van Stee. Wow, this has been amazing. Thank you so much, Sandra, for coming on the show today and sharing all this valuable information. I think you really, you know, explain through all the things that you share today, how important it is to, you know, really focus on what we put in our bodies, how we take care of our overall health, you know, and really about putting ourselves on a pedestal, because it's time that people show each other, not just show other people, but show themselves some self love, because really, you know, without taking care of yourself, you'll never be able to take care of the people around you. So you really have to focus on number one, and then you could focus on whatever else is important in your life. But, you know, health is so important. And it really goes down to what, how we're treating our bodies and what we're putting in our bodies. And, you know, and it's so important that we really, like we talked about, create that healthy lifestyle, you know, and make it, you know, break those bad habits and start creating those good habits and just making it a part of our lives. So you've, you've provided us with a wealth of information today. And I thank you so much for coming on the show. It's a bit of a pleasure. Thanks for the opportunity. Oh, you're very welcome. You have a great day. You too.",
