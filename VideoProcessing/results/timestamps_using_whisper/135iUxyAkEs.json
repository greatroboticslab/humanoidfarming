  "text": "Folks, which is better, a box blade or a land plane? What are you gonna choose? Well, no longer do you need to struggle with this decision because now there's a product called the box plane. This gate right here is the secret to all this magic. It goes from a land plane, hence the name box plane. Okay, you got the land plane and the box blade kind of combined into one. And you can drop this gate down, pull large amounts of material if you want to. That's more like what a box blade does. Or you can push, you got a rear blade here too. Or lift this gate up. And to be honest, I was actually shocked at how well it works for a couple of reasons. Number one, this is 60 inches wide on the 25 horsepower Summit TX25. And I kind of thought it was gonna be too big for it to be perfectly honest with you. But this worked really good. You're actually gonna see a few holes on either side where there's a position to put another blade in here. And this worked really well with just the one blade. You put a second blade in here that really kind of helps keep things shuffling along and not building up as much. And that could improve things even more. This is gonna be available again at summit tractors.com",
