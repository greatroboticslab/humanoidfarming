A Naz says is a piece of land Haji ka traitori himo hibiru yazwapwama. So mwen mari mahtoi mahtoi ya. Tuwa mahto ni m populikoa hibiru yazwapwama kakakakakakaka nila.

Abus plants sibhame nagsajI kuya seh detoxime 1 permaa da Power It is easily managed, anasriben is easily managed and therefore it is very very possible to provide the best condition. For example you can have a shed that will provide the shed to the seedlings below the shed so that you can reduce the rate of transpiration and by reducing the rate of transpiration meaning that the seedlings will continue growing in a good manner. Then we will go to the next one that is the facility, it facilitate anasriben, facilitate selection and transplanting of only the healthy and vigoras growing seedlings giving them a good head start. It means that those big seedlings which are on the anasriben they are uprooted, they are transplanted to the main seed bed while the other which are young they are left there to continue with growth. Then enables the raising of many seedlings in a given area. Anasriben is the one which is normally carry a lot of seedlings in a per unit area meaning that you can there is no there is no competition for nutrients because you can provide adequately for the nutrients to the soil. Then we have it allows other land operation to go on in the main seed bed while the crop is growing in the anasriben. Therefore you can continue cultivating the other crops as you wait for the seedling to grow before the time of transplanting is reached. Then that's marks the end of today's lesson and I will give you assignment the first question differentiate between seed bed and seedling bed. And the second one give three uses of seed bed shed constructed above anasriben. You give three uses of a shed constructed above anasriben. For reference you can refer from Secundary Agriculture a student book too and the publisher is the Kenya Ritrature Burial. Then for more information if you'd like to clarify something from us you can reach us at LMTV using the following addresses. The first one we have through SMS using the number which is well displayed for you there. Then you can use YouTube at LMTV you can reach us through Facebook platform at LMTV and finally you can use Twitter at LMU underscore KE. Thank you for joining me my lesson.
