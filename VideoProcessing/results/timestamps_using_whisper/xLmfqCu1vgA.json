For instance, can we also redesign our breakdown of clean drinking water supplies around the country? How do we prevent affluent and discharged from industries, from destroying our soil and our groundwater tables for years to come? Friends, another important point I wish to make is the significance of the make in India in medical devices to bring the fruits of advances in diagnostic to our people. Matma Gandhi once said, it is health that is the real wealth and not piece of gold and silver. To promote well-being, we should not only practice some of the tested traditional wisdom but also continuously enlarge its scope by introducing the modern tools and concepts of contemporary biomedical research. Our vision should be to protect people from the threats of dangerous communicable disease like Nipah, Ebola. We must work overtime to fulfill the promise to eradicate TB by 2025. Globally, India is the leader in the supply of vaccines. We aim to develop India as a world-class hundred billion dollar bio-manufacturing hub by 2024. This will happen with right policy initiatives and support to innovative research, human resource development and enterprise.",
