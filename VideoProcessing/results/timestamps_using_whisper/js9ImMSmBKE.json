  "text": "This one mistake might be why your container plants don't look this good. But let me show you my container mix and the one big mistake a lot of people make. First of all you need a container, in this case we're doing a five gallon root pouch, let's set that aside. Next up you need a high quality potting mix. In this case I'm using Fox Farm's Happy Frog, it's the best of my area, quality in quality out. Fill your container halfway with that soil. Now we take a trip to the compost pile and you might have guessed it, but the other half is going to be compost. Now we can mix up our soil and this is where the mistake comes in and that is mixing your fertilizer in at this stage, but let me explain why. So now we've got the soil back in, we could throw our cauliflower in here, I'm going to see if I could grow cauliflower in a five gallon pot. And now we bring it back to the fertilizer, you want to add it at the very end of your planting because every time you water this fertilizer will now soak into the soil and feed your plant whereas if you mix it in it could have been at the bottom and then you're just washing it all the way.",
