  "text": "It's time to start this appointment within the CEDRIC webinar initiatives and actually the CEDRIC webinar initiatives that are from, let's say, a project which is the CEDRIC project that has been financed by the Inter-Recall Italia Austria and co-founded by the European Union. The CEDRIC project involves several entities as the ICGB, as coordinator, leading partner, then University of Udine, the Free University of Guazzano, the University of Innsbruck and then other, let's say, project partner like the CIC Group, FNB, the BioTreat and ERSA. The, basically, the title of the project is creating of a sustainable cross-border agro-ecosystem by leveraging root microbiome biodiversity and the main name of CEDRIC is to strengthen the microbiological biodiversity of areas and soils characterized by a poor or an altered microbial ecosystem. Basically, the main aim of the CEDRIC project is to develop and validate methods, let's say, concerning the root microbiome transplantation and the other, let's say, main aspects are related to the creation of a platform for agricultural, scientific and business stakeholder in order to promote the transnational and scientific knowledge to sustainable methods applicable in field. And also to develop the training program, training program and dissemination programs which are focused on the role of healthy microbiome in soil ecosystem and agricultural productivity and all the benefit associated with this aspect. So, let's say, related to this last point, we had, let's say, the task and the honor to develop this series of webinar which basically follow under three main, let's say, big topics which are the soil health and the biodiversity, the the green opulence for agriculture and the sustainability and science communication. And in particular the seminar we will have, we will hear today by Lucrezia Lamastra is within this last topic. In this table you can see, let's say, the program of the webinar we are going to, let's say, to give or to organize in the next future. And after the seminar of today given by, again, Lucrezia, the next appointment will be on the next 6th of February in which our, let's say, project partner, Sylvia will give a very interesting seminar about bio-stimulant. So, to introduce our today's seminar I would like also to introduce Lucrezia. Lucrezia Lamastra graduated in chemistry and pharmaceutical technology at the University of Turin in 2005 and she obtained a PhD degree in 2010 by, from the university, the Universit\u00e0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Piacenza. Currently she is associate professor in agricultural chemistry at the same university and during her career basically she developed a growing interest in sustainability and this led her to coordinate and participate in different nationally relevant projects. In particular over the last decades her research has been dedicated to examining the, let's say, the complex relationship within agriculture, food production, consumption and environmental sustainability and her activities has basically been focused on assessing the impact of water usage and climate change within the food production system. And to, let's say, to pursue her research objectives basically she applied multidisciplinary approach involving chemical analysis and environmental modeling and LCA methodology that has been basically employed to evaluate and to mitigate environmental impact providing valuable insights into announcing the sustainability of the food system. So before leaving the floor to Lucrezia I would like to make some, let's say, practical recommendations so I would like all the participants to invite all the participants to make sure that their microphone are muted during the presentation. And at the end of the presentation, the webinar we will have a question and answer session. And so if you have a question you can, let's say you can book your slot by raising the hand or by typing the question in the chat. And I would also like to remind you that the webinar is recorded and so the recording will be shared on the project website soon after the end of this event. So with this I stop sharing my screen and I leave the floor to Lucrezia. Okay, good morning to everyone. Thank you Yuri for introducing me, for inviting me to present today into this seminar. So I'm starting sharing my screen. So during this presentation I will give you also some questions to you in order to interact with so during the presentation and not only at the end. When Yuri and Maria invited me to presenting this seminar so I didn't know the audience. And I selected to be more general about the topic of my research that has Yuri introduced it related to the measure of sustainability in the Agri food sector. In the case in which my presentation is to basic you can stop me and we will move to the last slide in which I will go farther into the results of my research. But for me it's important also to introduce the topic in which we the background in which we developed the way in which we are able today to measure sustainability so let's pray to stop me if he is really too basic for you. So first of all, we have to introduce what is a sustainable agriculture in total slide you can see the definition provided by F. A. O. So sustainable agriculture is not only crossing the four and the three dimensions of sustainability environmental social and economics, but contributes also to all the four pillars of food security so availability, access, utilization and stability. As you can see here there are five key principles of sustainability for food and agriculture that are presented into the slides and our increased productivity, protecting the national resources, improve the life load and foster inclusive economic growth, and the resilience of people, communities and the systems and adapt to governance to the new challenges. But if now today in 2025 we are speaking about sustainability is probably because we are aware that we are not so sustainable today. So I started with a question. You have to take your phone and can't use your code in order to enter into the system. Okay, three people for people. Okay, I will wait at least 20 people to start. Okay. We start in order to avoid to this time. The first question. Is about the planetary boundaries identified by rocks from a total in 2009. Okay. Most of you answered correctly. One of the nine planetary boundaries identified by rocks from it was the loss of genetic diversity. The first was Monica. And the second question is about the current concentration of carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere. In the case of you answered correctly. So we move again to the lights in which as you can see here, we have a picture taken from the very famous publication of rocks from a tool in in 2009, in which they define it the safe operating space for one. And then we have Nikki setting nine planetary boundaries in 2009. Three of his nine planetary boundaries have been crossed and where the one about the emissions of carbon dioxide, the rate of biodiversity loss and the one about the nitrogen use the amount of nitrogen removed from the atmosphere. In this publication. They set the, the proposed boundary and also they measure the delivery in which we were 16 years ago, in respect to this proposed boundaries. And you can see some of them, like for instance the atmospheric areas are loading or the chemical pollution have been defined as important, but without having the proper way to measure them having a boundary and so without having a boundary it was also impossible to select. What is the current status in respect to this boundary. Some years after the same group published another work that is a little bit an update of the first work of a rock storm at all in which some the concept of planetary boundaries. The first published in 2009 has been improved introducing some more boundaries and then the line and again in this case that four of the nine planetary boundaries have been crossed. The additional one is the one about the land system change and again has been defined that climate change and biosphere integrity are to core boundaries to define a safe space for humanity. Considering that to measure climate change we have a lot of indicators. We can start defining considering goals that and one of the planetary boundaries of ready crossed is the one about the concentration of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, we can start discussing about the climate change. So as you probably know climate change is something of a natural that the humans are able to improve increasing the emissions of greenhouse gases. So this is taken from the last report of the international intergovernmental panel on climate change and in this case is underlining again that human activities. And through the emissions of greenhouse gases have caused global warming with global surface temperature reaching 1.1 Celsius degree above the level that we have before. This is just to have a little introduction. I have another question for you. It's something that is written into the report. And so why global surface temperature will continue. I put again the QR code. So the question is why global surface temperature will continue to increase. Until at least the mid-century in all the media. In this case we have a last answer, but most of them are the correct one. So this is one question based into some of the statements reported into the report I show before. So if we imagine scenarios in which emissions are reduced and this is why some of the greenhouse gases are very long lasting into the atmosphere. And so also if we stop today to emit some of them, we cannot completely stop our emissions. Of course, the fact cannot be mediated due to the lifetime of these gases into the atmosphere. So the question is about the difference between mitigation and adaptation in addressing climate change and mitigation focuses on reducing the causes of the climate change. And so the emissions of greenhouse gases while adaptation is to adapt to the effect of the climate change. So the ranking will be shown at the end. So as you can see in the slide mitigation is the aim of tackling the causes while adaptation is to reduce the effect. So I added this definition just because into my presentation also the one you made at the start. I wrote that I work to mitigate in some way or to find the best way to mitigate the effect of the climate change. And so the work we are doing is to reduce the emission of some gases, mainly greenhouse gases related to the agro for the chain. We move a little bit to some other topics. Here, just to have an idea of what is better to come back. I will show you the questions because I'm very. Okay. It's not about the statement of the cow's piracy documentary. Here we will see why it's not completely true with Britain and I move to a previous question that is this one. What is the contribution of agriculture to global greenhouse gas emissions. Okay. So what you can see here is written what is the contribution of agriculture to the global greenhouse gas emissions. While the other question was about the impact of the livestock sector. So if we move to the slides. What you can see into this slide. What is the contribution of agriculture forestry and land use to the global greenhouse gas emission. These are the results of some years ago. 2016 in which agriculture contributes to less than the 20% of the overall emissions into the right. And you can see how much are the emissions related to agriculture in Europe. And if you check in Europe, agriculture is contributing to less than the 10% of the overall emissions of greenhouse gases. So considering that livestock is part of the sector. So it's part of the. I'm not sure about I'm into a class and so we have also the. So as you can see here, agriculture accounts for the 20 more or less the 20% at a global level and the 10% at European level. So I think that livestock is part of the sector. It is impossible that and it was included into the second question. The first one I asked you to answer that contributes to the half of the emissions overall because life so can be the half of the emissions related to agriculture and not the half of the overall emissions. So somewhere information are not always the proper ones. If we move to the food sector, you can see into this slide that food does so the whole agri-food system not just agriculture can contribute and be slightly different considering different authors to the 26 or 30, 34% of the overall emissions. While these numbers are different from the previous one, because in this case we are considering not only the agricultural sector but also the following phases of the transformation, the transportation, the packaging, the cooking phase and so on. So from the 20% to the 30% considering the agri-food system and moreover we have to consider that before into the agricultural sector there was included not only the agricultural production related to the food production but also to other uses. So the agri-food system impacts more or less the 30% of our emissions. Okay, in this case we have a lot of answers but not always correct. The first one is the correct one. So methane, azure global warming potential, tent carbon dioxide, but lower than nitrogen oxide. So we will see into the following slide. Here, what are the global warming potential? So we have global warming potential to transform each one of the greenhouse gases into carbon dioxide equivalents. And this table is taken from the IPCC report and report for each one of the greenhouse gases. The global warming potential considering different time frames, so 20 years, 100 years and 500 years. And for the first time in the last report, so the sixth report, the global temperature potential have been introduced into this report. So global temperature potential are different from the global warming potential because they considered how much the temperature will change at the end of the period of time. But now the scientific community is not always agree in using GTP instead of global warming potential. Also because the modeling to obtain this value is different and is more complicated. And because we have to consider how much the climate system responds to increase the concentrations of greenhouse gases. And there are a few works in which GTP is used instead of GWP. What is the main difference? The main difference is about the methane emissions. As you can see into this table, if we consider global warming potential 100 and we compare the value to the one of global temperature potential 100, you can see that we have 27 for the global warming potential and 4.7 for the global temperature potential. What is the difference because methane has a very short lifetime into the atmosphere and so the effect into the increase of temperatures using the GTP model is that the greenhouse gases are probably differently estimated, giving us these different values. So methane is more powerful than carbon dioxide, less powerful than nitrous oxide. So the main greenhouse gases related to agriculture while the other greenhouse gases are more related to industrial uses because of refrigerants or forestinguishers. So molecules used more into the industries or into the distribution phase, the refrigerant phase and so on. And here is the slide in which we have the comparison between results obtained for Austrian-Catholic carcasses using two different matrix. So in this case not the GTP but the GVP star. GVP star is another matrix similar to the one of the GTP. The GTP is the one selected from the IPCC to be considered. GVP star is something of similar that consider differently the short-lived climate pollutants like methane for instance. And into the future probably we will find more works in which GVP star is used mainly into the livestock sector because as you probably know the methane emissions are due to the intake of fermentation and a different accounting of methane can give us different completely different results as you can see here in which using GVP star as you can see into the right we have a big reduction of the emissions due to the entire methane. But how can we measure the impact these numbers and these results like the one of the previous slide? How can we obtain the way in which we can obtain these results is considering the bull life cycle from the cradle to the grave. And now with some little example I will try to explain you why it is important to consider the bull life cycle and not only one of the phases or one of the indicators you have because I stress it now the importance of the greenhouse gas emissions but we will see one indicator is not enough to pretend to measure the sustainability. So the question was we can consider biofuel carbon neutral considering that the emissions of carbon dioxide we obtain after the combustion correspond exactly to the same amount of carbon dioxide has been stored during the carbon cycle into the plant. So do you have to answer to this question? We put again the chart. Okay. We can't avoid to consider all the practices we have before. So, of course, the emissions we have during the combustion correspond to the amount of carbon dioxide stored before into the plant. So this is true but to obtain these biofuels we have to produce them so we have to have to grow the crops to have bio refinery system in which for instance biofuels are obtained. And we have to have distribution system so we cannot consider them completely carbon neutral. And moreover, it is another point that is very important when doing life cycle assessment we cannot consider just one indicator. So we can get a lot of work in focus it just into the greenhouse gas emissions or the water footprint and so on but really to measure the sustainability to pretend to measure the sustainability of food or crops we need to consider more than one indicator. So for instance, in the case of biofuel we have also the release of nutrients for fertilizers we have other kind of inputs and inputs we can have related to the use of the production of biofuels. This is another example. This is taken from our works made in Sweden in Sweden in which they compare organic versus conventional crops considering this case with peace and considering what is the show into this picture, what is your opinion about organic agriculture. Now depends depends is the proper answer is my favorite answer. So as you can see here, we have other picturing other works in which conventional and organic cut brains have been compared and results can be very different considering different indicators. This is why one indicator is not enough. And moreover, another important things to be considered when doing a life cycle assessment is the selection of the functional unit. As you can see we have into the table table four into the right three different functional units. One is one tons. One is one actors and one other is 1000 Canadian dollar. So results can be different using different functional unit when doing a life cycle assessment we cannot consider the quantity providing the same quantity providing the same function. So what we have to consider what is the function of the of what we are analyzing in order to report the results related to the function and not to the quantity. So one ton can be can be useful in the moment in which we are comparing something that the current that in which the same quantity is able to provide the same function. But if we compare one ton of tomatoes with one ton of milk, the functions probably are not the same and so we cannot exactly compare just using the quantity different food products. So life cycle assessment consider the whole life cycle from cradle to the grave. We cannot avoid to consider what happened before and after and moreover consider a broad range of environmental issues. So using just one indicator is not enough to pretend to measure the sustainability of a production moreover is quantitative and based into a model that are based on proven causalities. Life cycle assessment is based on standards and entities standards for different life cycle in doing life cycle assessment we have to follow for different steps. The first one is going scope definition of following it by the inventory in which we collect data, the impact assessment in which we transform the data into the impact and at the end the interpretation. What is very critical is to select the functional unit as explained before because this is the reference of the study and we have to compare properly the function and not just the amount. Is it the last question for you? I will stop before the time. We have a lot of different answers. The proper one is the second one now because we cannot consider the function of food just to provide a certain amount of food because one kilogram of meat is different from one kilogram of food from a nutritional point of view. So we have to compare to different foods we have to compare the same nutritional content of this food. So this is why often it's difficult to evaluate the sustainability in the food sector. There are a lot of works also supported by the FAO to find the proper nutritional functional unit in order to have a common way to assess the sustainability into the food sector. Just to show you an application in a few minutes of how life cycle assessment can help us to assess sustainability in agriculture. I will present you some data obtained in a project funded by the Italian Ministry of the Environment in which my university has been involved since the start in 2010. So this program is called VIVA and it's based on four indicators. What has been our work into this project? Our work has been to develop four indicators specific for the wine sector that are in total slides are called in Italian about you can easily understand the translation, hair, water, vineyard and territory. So we developed the framework in which the sustainability of wine sector can be assessed. And not only one indicator but more than one and also into territory we added something related to economy and society because we have to remember that sustainability cannot be just environmental from an environmental point of view. After the evaluation, the wines that have the certification can show into the bottle, the label you can see into the right and scanning the QR code it is possible to see the results are obtained from the certified bottles. And understand what are the impacts for instance into the greenhouse gas emissions into the water scarcity into the vineyard due to the management of vineyard and also the ones related to the socio economic part of the sustainability using the territory indicators. These kind of instruments developed into the VIVA framework can also be used to compare again as we have seen before to different way to produce like for instance into this work we compare it again organic with conventional in this case, which culture. Again, results can be different considering different functional unit and the question is again what is the best functional unit in this case is better to consider the surface or the quantity of wine produced and considering that the wine is the product that at the end is actually sold. Results can be different considering different functional unit but also considering different indicators so often to have an answer is not so easy as we thought at the start because we have the instrument to measure but the instrument sometimes provides some results difficult to be understood. So we have to evaluate differently the different results provided. Here is another work in which we applied in this case the path methodology path is the methodology developed by the European Commission to assess the sustainability following the life cycle assessment approach. In this case we worked with different farms producing milk to produce grana padano and we compared the impacts of the permanent meadows farm we have into the Montovar district in Italy to the mountains farms that produces grana padano in Trentino. So the small plain farm and with the mountain small plain permanent meadows with the national average of farms producing milk. In this case the best results are the ones of the permanent meadows farm because if we consider a product like the milk what is very important is the feed production and the permanent meadows allowing this case to reduce the impact due to the self produced feed. And so in this case the results showed the best performance for this kind of farms. So this is another way in which life cycle assessment can be used into the agri-food sector. Another example is the one in which we tried to apply life cycle assessment approaches into the valuation of the circular economy systems because as you know to move from a linear system to a circular system is mandatory to be more sustainable. But often the way we found we find to be circular are more impacting than the normal way in which residues or waste are used like waste. So this is an example developed in a project in which we use the Hermetian luchens to transform fruit and vegetable waste into their biomass mainly made with fat and protein to transform them into energy. The energy production is through a pyrolysis plant in which biochar can be obtained and also the effect of biochar has been tested as a soil amendment and also as an instrument to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Results have been published related to the Emilia Romagna region into this paper. You can scan the QR code but I can send you all the references and really we tested also another possibility to use a black soldier fly not only to produce energy so to transform them into biofuel but also to use them directly to feed the energy. And also we tested other animals also if now considering the regulations we have in Europe and in Italy the use of a black soldier fly fed into the waste is not allowed to produce feed that can be used again to feed other animals. So we tested it is a way without can use it due to the regulations we have. Here you can see the results compared to the normal treatment of waste into the Emilia Romagna and into the left into the table and into the right into the graph the comparison of the different system we tested because we tested a different mix of waste. And also different efficiency due to the different conditions in which a black soldier fly can be can be used to transform them. The goal was to transform the fat contained into the black soldier fly into biofuel by doing a transit certification and as you can see into the right the best option is using high efficiency. Because we have a lower feed conversion bratsia so we are able to obtain more larvae using less the ingredient and using a mixed food. Residues in which not only vegetables but the introduction of other kind of ways that are added to improve the nutritional quality of the substrate provided to the larvae and in some of the indicators provided into the graph into the right. So these kind of transport mission is more sustainable than the production of biofuel from soybean. So it depends on the indicators we use but can be an opportunity to transform in some in some cases that the waste into something that can be used. But we have to be aware that sometimes we are improving the impact if in comparison to the normal treatment of waste into the Emilia Romagna. So these are just some examples of how life cycle assessment can help us in a solve the problem of sustainability into the agri-food system. So we can use it to obtain the most sustainable way to produce. We can use it into an eco design approach to design before doing the best way to do something or to produce something can be useful and I think it's very useful in designing circular system because always we think that something can be sustainable. But without having the proper instruments to measure the sustainability, we cannot say that the reuse or the recycling is always the most sustainable way to use the residues. So in conclusion, what is the life cycle assessment is a compass needed to address sustainability. Sustainability must be measured and not only declared because we agree we need to be sustainable. We know that at the moment we are completely unsustainable but to do something, we have to follow the results of some measures to find the proper way to be more sustainable. Life cycle assessment is based into the models. We developed a lot of models for instance about the proper way to measure the impact of pesticides into the environment. And these models must be updated over time considering the knowledge we are developing into this field. And often the best solution is a compromise between different results because it's very difficult to find a solution that is the best from all the perspective, but different kind of results must be integrated in order to have the best solution for the problem we have. I hope you enjoyed this presentation also if very basic but to explore better the opportunity of life cycle assessment. We will need more time. In the case in which you need something more or in the case in which you have some questions, I'm here to answer you and in the case in which you would like to write me, I can provide you my email and we can continue our discussion also by email. Okay, so thank you, Lucrezia for this very interesting seminar. So now the floor is open for questions so whoever has questions may raise the hand or write the type of the question in the chat and I will read it. I'm sure that the winner is Gianluca. Gianluca, so. I don't know if Gianluca is really brilliant, but I guess no. He's the winner. Okay, thank you. Followed by Maria and Alistango. My pleasure. Okay, so we have a question in the chat by Valentino. He thanked Lucrezia, he thank you for the, he thank Lucrezia for the presentation. And the question is what is your opinion on taking account of ecosystem services provided in a process. In agriculture when assessing LCA, some scientists have proposed to allocate the whole CO2 equivalent balance of the farm sharing it among main products and co-products as well. It has ecosystem services provided. So fertility could be one of these possible co-products to be taken into account in order to allocate the whole CO2 equivalent balance of the farm. Thank you again. Thank you for the question. Very interesting. As I mentioned before, when we define functional unit, when considering agriculture, there are a lot of functions that agriculture is providing that are not only the production of food. In the moment in which we shift from the production of food that we can introduce the accounting of all the other services provided by agriculture, like for instance, other ecosystem services. There are a lot that are growing literature into the accounting of ecosystem services using a life cycle assessment. The problem at the moment I'm seeing, this is just my opinion, is to have a consensus model that can be used in order to obtain standardized results. And moreover, another opportunity I'm seeing for agricultural production to include the benefit of agriculture into a life cycle assessment is to consider the car, as you probably mentioned also during your question, is to consider the carbon dioxide stock in agriculture. And so shifting from a conventional agriculture to conservatism one using carbon farming instead of other way to make agriculture. So something is changing. But at the moment I agree to consider all the other services provided by agriculture, like impact that can be positive or negative, must be measured before confirmed keys. But the current problem is that we haven't a consensus model. I think we will have because there are a lot of work in this direction and also policies are going into this direction. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Sorry, Valentino. Could you repeat? Sorry. Thanks again. Thank you again, Professor Lamasta for your explanations. Sorry for my technical difficulties on the internet connection. So, I mean, I'm not able to probably the probably my comments I gave right now. I didn't, didn't, didn't, didn't reach the, the platform. Again, thank you for the full explanation that goes all the, all the points that you mentioned are very interesting in sight in view of considering that option. Promoting the role of the culture in the environment conservation. Thank you again. Thank you. Thank you to Valentino. Now there's a question by a river in some areas. Yes. Yes. Thank you for this very interesting talk. I have a question concerning the different cattle raising systems that you have that you have shown. And it's a bit contradicting to that what I am teaching why I used to teach to my students that the cattle raising with concentrated feed maybe from from soybean to carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases because because of the microbiota in the room and so the room and microbrow does seems to be more targeted towards producing methane. If, if hay or brass is used as a as a feedstock. So, if the food is concentrated food feed is being used. Actually, I'm basing this on a study made in Italy. I don't recall who the authors were, but that was quite quite nicely showing the big difference in methane emissions by the room and microbiota. So, the, the bull life cycle. Mainly we can say that the carbon footprint of one liter of milk is divided into three main process contributing to the emissions that are the entire experimentation, the feed supply, the feed production and supply and the manure management. We estimated the methane emissions considering the guidelines of the IPCC and considering of course the nutritional, the nutritional content of the different feed. We analyzed them. So, we used a tier three approach in which we have a specific information about the different feed. The one obtained from insulated, but also the one obtained from a grassland. And we have probably an increase into the mid the entire experimentation. But what is reduced entities case is the production of the. So, if I share again the screen just to explain better what I'm trying to explain. The differences are very, very little. So, here you can see the national near face for national Italian representative farms. While into the right you have a permanent me those farm. As you can see, weighted and normalize the results are very similar for one liter of milk. What is different? If you calculated the percentage probably is the amount of self-produced feed that contribute considering that the permanent me does doesn't. Permanent me don't require a lot of work to be cropped the required less input. So in this case, permanent me those farm. Contributes as the same as the national Italian representative farms in which insulator used. And here the advantage is not in the phase of the inter fermentation, but in the phase in which we are producing feed. Okay. And moreover, you have to consider that this kind of farms into the month of a district are very particular because. Are we selected 70 farms to make this study, but they have a very high efficiency. Also if you're reducing the nutritional value of the feed provided them. So it's a very particular case in Italy, because as you can see for instance, mountain farms that use the same kind of feed that the same nutrition. Have higher impacts. So I'm F and PMF have the same kind of nutrition. Showing different results. So it's a particularity of this kind of permanent me those farm into the month of district that are able to combine high efficiency while using grassland grass products. And the advantages the reduction of the input due to the production feed them and the reduction into. Okay, yeah this corresponds then corresponds quite well with with that what I what I thought yeah. Okay. Thank you. So now it's time for the question of Rebecca. Hi. Thank you very much for your interesting talk for me where many new concepts and my question maybe silly but I have to do it since I work a long time with the annual idea which photosynthetic organisms. So you present some. Okay, hold a CO2 bio is biological produced for organisms and then fix it by photosynthetic organisms, entering the cycle, which understood, but then you show that is that CO2 produced by biofoil so for the industry is not taken by by the organic photosynthetic organisms. So I was wondering it from from the ignorance. Why is this CO2 is maybe related with the other. I don't know. I don't know why they are not composed in in the atmosphere or they are not available as CO2 in the atmosphere or why the photosynthetic organisms will not take that CO2. So I just feel my culture fits you to in organic CO2 and then they are capable to to fix this CO2. Do you know my question. No, no, no. You can help me to explain better. For instance that biogenic carbon dioxide is not taken into account into the assessment. In general, but for instance methane, biogenic methane is taken into account. Biogenic carbon dioxide and not. Okay, this is the basic into the life cycle assessment and then I presented you a consideration just to explain you to consider one phase is not enough because in them, for instance, the emissions during the combustion of biofuel but can be also would for instance, are not considered the emissions of carbon dioxide because they're considered biogenic and the amount emitted is considered equivalent to the amount that has been stored before into the plant structures used to produce the biofuel or wood for instance. I think you that we have a lot of other way to store and to use carbon dioxide at the moment, not considering into a life cycle assessment. For instance, I would like to do a work in which we are able to estimate them because it's another opportunity to completely understand the impact of agriculture without considering just the emissions we already know, but some benefits from which we have to know before that probably we know into the field but outside when someone else doing life cycle assessment that is that doesn't know how agriculture works. So, I think that we have not, have not an idea of this kind of effect. So, like the first question so we have to do something more to develop life cycle assessment related to agriculture considering that only the carbon dioxide emission by a genetic that is very easy to be understood and to be explained about also some other kind of way of developing the culture as to store carbon dioxide but also to provide other kind of services that can be very useful from an environmental point of view. Okay, thank you. Victoria. Oh, thank you. Thank you. I thank you look great say I mean for me was. I learned a lot and I like, and I think for many scientists like me or very, let's say fixed in one topic and genetics or some specific mechanism to listen to this kind of to the to your talk is is very important so my question is very general I mean I just like to have your feedback on what is the state and what is your belief of this. I mean I read I'm not an expert but I read about carbon capture by the soil. So the soil as we know today is the most biodiverse biodiverse, I don't know a niche or place on the planet. There's more microbes in on the earth and anything and it's where everything starts and also the earth is, we know it's so important for the one health concept human health starts from the soil so and I read about carbon capture from the soil. So the microbes can using carbonic anadases can fix CO2 or I don't know what is your belief of this is this too optimistic or is this realistic that in the future scientists can develop mechanism to fix CO2 and bring it to to the, and this can then be provided, you know, cementized or provided to plants or, or, or whatever. I really like to have your feedback. Thanks. Thank you. So I hope that our idea that is your idea is not too optimistic that so in the future we can have a, these opportunities to have a model consensus model to assess the keys, this kind of benefit. So, what I, what I think that the moment the soil is completely underestimated into the life cycle assessment approach because if you check all the most used 15 indicators about soil that is just land user. Okay, so I measure of the land user to produce something without any specific sub indicators to consider the quality of the soil. And so, okay, it is important to reduce the use of soil but we have also to the screen to separate different uses of soils because there are some uses that are real consumption and some others in which so is it is can be improved and can provide a lot of services. So, for instance, from the life cycle assessment approaches to footprints have been very commonly considered like carbon footprint and the water footprint, but no one about the quality of soil. So if soil is fundamental for agriculture for biodiversity for a lot of services that at the moment is completely underestimated into the life cycle assessment approach. I think that now we are moving to the carbon farming approach is something is changing. And I hope that in the future, more important to will be given to the soil. I think that now soil is underestimated also because this kind of approach the life cycle assessment born into the industry sector. So and after this has been translated into the agricultural sector. And so the moment we are adopting something that is born for other purposes. And now is the moment to develop a proper way to assess this kind of benefit or something like benefiting also using this approach. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, any more questions for Lucrezia from the audience. No, so I think we can thank Lucrezia for this interesting event. Thank you. Thank you to everyone for participating. My slides can be shared with all the present and as my contacts to so if you would like to go forward into this discussion I will be available to discuss further with you. Thank you. Thank you. And congratulations very nice presentation very clear. You're a very good speaker. Thank you. Thank you to be done. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, so thank you again Lucrezia and just before let's say closing the event I want to remind you again the next appointment of our webinar, which is on the 6th of February with the topic of by your steam alarm. So, thank you again for joining and for the disney. Thank you. Bye bye.",
