  "text": "Have you ever garden? Have you ever worked the soil? If you're thinking about doing that this season, planting a garden and cultivating a little farm on your property this spring, then I encourage you to do so because there is blessing in that. I think, well, I grew up on a farm, not a farm, I grew up on a couple of acres. And as a result of having a little bit of property, I grew up taking care of it, whether it was weed whacking or watering the plants or different projects that having land can provide kids coming of age. I was blessed in that, and I didn't really realize it at the time, but there were so many times because I had a little bit of land and I grew up in a Christian family that really taught the word of God. There were so many times when I was out in the yard getting my hands dirty that the spirit of God would be speaking to me and revealing things to me. And one of the reasons why that happens is because the Bible is an agrarian book. It's so wrapped up in that lifestyle, the agrarian lifestyle. Substance farming is when you have a family that lives off of the land. They don't even really make or produce more food than they can consume themselves. They don't really go to market necessarily. They just live off of the land and they have some animals and they have some different crops that they grow and they just work to eat and survive. Their sustenance comes from the land. So subsistence farming. Today, one quarter of the world's population or two billion people live off of less than five acres of land. Now, you would think after the Industrial Revolution and the urbanization of the world and all these people living in cities and having these high tech jobs, you'd think that that number might, I think that that number would be smaller. I was surprised to know that that a quarter of the world's population lives off of less than five acres of land. Now, I think that would be true at much higher percentages if you look at certain countries. It's over half of Africa is in this category of subsistence farming. Whereas in America, I think we have 1.3% of the population as professional farmers. 1.3%. And yet a quarter of the world is in the category of living off of a few acres of land. And so the reason why I bring this up is because God and his wisdom appeals to historically the majority of the world. And still to this day, a huge number of people who the word of God speaks to the ordinary common farmer is my point. There are so many spiritual insights and wisdom hidden in the everyday surroundings of the agrarian life that really can only be gleaned, no pun intended, but pun intended, can be gleaned when you're involved in that kind of work. And so if you're thinking about planting a garden, again, I would just encourage you to grow, even if it's growing a house plant or, or planting some tomatoes and, and trying your hand at that and, or maybe expanding your garden a little bit this year. As you are in the word, I believe that there will be spiritual insights for you in that process. Everything we do. God has spiritual insights for us, the spirit of God is with us wherever we go. And he is always constantly speaking to us and applying the word to our lives. But I think there's something, something special about the planting of seeds, the growing, the cultivating of the soil and the, and the trust that it takes to for that process to, to have its full effect the way God intended. So I just find that very interesting. If you want to take a little, a little study in Matthew chapter 13, versus 24 through 43, there's a, there's a few agrarian parables that have hidden spiritual truths and it's explicitly said that, that these things by Jesus are hidden in parables. For those who have an ear to listen. Well, you really can't understand what he's talking about if you don't have some sense of what it means to go from seed to produce. So anyway, Matthew chapter 13. Have a look at that one. Let's take a look at a few passages here. Just as an example in some edification for you this day. Second Corinthians nine six says, but this I say he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly and he who sows bound to flee will also reap bound to flee. And this is another example of how, of course, and in if you're a farmer and even if you don't farm you would you would understand this principle I think it's pretty simple. If you plant a lot of seeds. And you cultivate you water you put the right conditions together as best you can as a as a farmer. Then you will reap bound to flee. If you plant a little bit of seeds, then you will only reap a little bit of produce. You can't plant a little and expect a lot. You can plant a lot and expect a little I suppose because then you know something can go wrong. If there's famine or something like that or drought I mean, but you can't plant a little and expect a lot and so Paul is bringing this principle up to the Corinthians and then a grary in package and saying in a spiritual sense that we need to basically put our money where our treasure is we need to you know where our treasure is there a heart will be also when it comes to our possessions when it comes to our, our gifts or talents or resources. If we invest in the kingdom things, the eternal things. And there will be eternal fruit, but if we just get just give God a little bit. If we just so sparingly, then, then we can just expect the reward to be very sparing indeed. So again, an agrarian analogy there and second Corinthians. Here's a proverb. Honor the Lord with your possessions and with the first fruits of your increase. And as you reap a harvest in this in this illustration as you're reaping a harvest, take the first fruits and honor the Lord with them. So, you know, this is kind of the tithe principle that that I get my paycheck. And I just take before I spend a cent or a dollar. Right. I take the first the first tithe of that. And I just say, Lord, this is yours. I'm proving to you that my heart is honoring you by giving you the first fruits. Before I then spend a dollar on myself. This is it's all yours. And that's that honoring of the Lord that that's what the idea is behind the tithe. It's it's proof that you're not just giving lip service to God, but you're putting your money where your mouth is. And so there's a problem from chapter three verse nine. And then. And again, it's wrapped up in this agrarian first fruits, you know, if you, if you're growing, you don't just work all year and then you get your whole harvest, you're like, Oh, it's all mine, you know, it's this idea of like my heart. And I just thankful God that you made it rain that you took that seed and somehow it sprouted forth and brought forth a plant that produced whatever I'm growing, you know, apples or pears or berries or, you know, tomatoes or whatever it might be. And then first Corinthians three, I'll give you one more here. And then another one to the Corinthian church. Now he who plants and he who waters are one. And each one will receive his own reward according to his labor. And so that's a spiritual truth that now if you're if it's a family garden, right, or let's say you're in some co op you don't have enough land and so you're, you're doing some crop sharing or something with with an organization that has some, you know, community garden or something like that. You may not be the one who plants the sea you may not be the one who who waters it, your maybe your job was just to weed it, or your job was just to harvest it. But the idea here that Paul brings out is that each one who labors will receive his his or her reward, according to their labor it doesn't matter if you're planting. It doesn't matter if you're watering it doesn't matter if you're, if you're harvesting or if you're weeding. So all of these things are necessary parts of a good produce. And if you labor, then you receive your reward and in that there's a there's so much richness if you meditate on that that in the in the church, we all have different roles, right, as believers as brothers and sisters in Christ we don't have to compare our jobs to other people's jobs. We don't have to say oh well that person's really valuable and I'm not so valuable know it. It's all valuable, because God doesn't see things the way we do necessarily he doesn't measure things the way we measure them God often measures things opposite of the way we measure things. The rich and famous in God's eyes are often poor, right, and then in the opposite is true, the ones those who are poor are are rich. Right, this is the things these are the things that Jesus would say about the kingdom of God that he doesn't measure things the way we do and so when we compare to other people we're really doing ourselves a disservice, and we're inviting discouragement into our life. Keep your eyes fixed on him. Did you do what God gave you to do today. Did you honor him and all that you did. Did you trust him. Did you give of yourself to him. Then you're sewing, you're cultivating your, you know, Did you take an opportunity that God gave you, whether it be sharing the gospel, whether it be serving, whether it be going out of your way to listen to someone, even when you were in a hurry, whatever it might be. If you're sewing sparingly unto the Lord then you're going to benefit very sparingly from that but if you are sewing very generously then you will reap very generously in the age to come and so Again, there are so many things that the spirit of God say I didn't I grew up not really necessarily thinking that the spirit of God was speaking to me as a as a kid. I just thought oh this is kind of like in the Bible study. But you know what, that was the Holy Spirit teaching me as a young man. As I was out getting my hands dirty. Hey, Matt, it's kind of like this. You know, when you as you're pulling up those dandy lions or those star thistle. In California had a lot of star thistle where I was. But as you as you're pulling up these weeds. It's, I'm wanting to do this to your heart. I'm wanting to take those things out of your life that that don't belong there. They're going to do damage. It's going to choke out the blessings that I have for you. And so I'm weeding your life. And so it's a little painful sometimes. And these are the kinds of things that the spirit of God was was just one on one out there being discipled by by the spirit of Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit out in the field and so anyway, be blessed this spring. Should you find yourself planting and and cultivating and weeding and and all of the things that spring often bring so that your your garden might be bountiful when it comes time to harvest. Alright God bless you and until next time on",
