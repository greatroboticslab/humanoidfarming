Technology-Driven, People Focus Well, dollars per employee numbers might sound good, but when you're working with a team concept, you start in the service department, move up to your parts, everything else. If your parts and services doing a good job on it, your sales come, as salesmen, we get credit for it, but as sales, the other areas bring it up. We don't look at anything individually because we have to look at it from the standpoint of profitability for the whole dealership and giving the customer a fair price for a fair product. That's what we look at and when we was nominated for this, that wasn't even a thing. I didn't even know what it was per employee. We got into the fact that we didn't look at it that way because we're doing a lot of double-tasking around here. We have one mechanic. He does warranty work and things like that. We have a full-time service rider. We kind of duplex on that a little bit. I run the shop and I do the selling, so we're trying to take the revenue and make the dealership a very sound foundation and then we can expand after that.
