And it can tell you where there are trees, where there are crops, and we've worked with people like the US Department of Agriculture to identify which crops. You can tell from space what's growing by winot greens, the precise color that it is. We can also, we have other satellites that can tell us about plant health. So we have one instrument on the International Space Station called EcoStress that it measures temperature at this really, really high precision. And what it turns out, you can learn from that is when plants are water stressed. So when plants don't have enough water, they get a little bit hotter. So they get a fever and we can see that from space.",
