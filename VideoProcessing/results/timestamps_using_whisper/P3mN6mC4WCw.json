  "text": "Mechanization is more than just about machinery. It is the introduction of technology to agricultural production and other farming operations along the value chain. It has reshaped our agricultural landscape and the way we produce food. Throughout history, farmers have had to seek solutions to address global and everyday challenges. We have witnessed the progression from rudimentary manual tools to more advanced innovative tools and machinery. Sustainable agricultural mechanization has the potential to increase productivity, reduce hard labor, improve the use of natural resources and other inputs, mitigate climate change, decrease food loss and waste, and make the sector more attractive to youth. We have the opportunity to create a lasting impact, but sustainability must always be the driving force. Innovations and mechanization technologies need to be accessible to all and enable us to produce more with less. Together, we can shape a sustainable future for better production, better nutrition, a better environment, and a better life. Leaving no one behind.",
