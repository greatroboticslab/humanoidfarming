The average piece of produce travels 1500 miles is 10 days old. It's lost half of its nutritional value and half goes bad. For me, I think it's ridiculous to go to the grocery store to buy fresh food, but we just accept it. But I think when grocery stores first started selling fresh food, everyone thought it was ridiculous back then. So this is what, you know, it came up with and it was really to work with consumers to lead the transition to a more sustainable food system, giving them the experience of being a farmer and a caretaker.",
