Before purchasing any stock, you must get a property identification code, or PIC. Any new South Wales property carrying livestock is required by law to have a PIC. Yep, even if it's just one horse or a potty calf, you must have a PIC. Before loading and transporting stock, you must ensure they're correctly identified with a National Livestock Identification System, that is NLIS, TAG or device. All movements must be recorded on the NLIS database. Your local land services office can help you get the correct paperwork. To help protect our ag industry and keep markets open, you need to notify us local land services if you suspect or are aware of a range of livestock diseases. As a livestock owner, you also should have a solid understanding of pasture management and feeding programs during drought. There's some great information on the local land services and Department of Primary Industries websites. Until next time, cheers.",
