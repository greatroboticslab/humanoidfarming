  "text": "Welcome to Farm Vibe's Life. Did you know that figs aren't actually classified as a fruit? These are upside-down flowers, providing a rich source of nutrition. Hello dear friends and welcome again. Many of you may be familiar with the name figs, while some may have never heard of them before. The image below will display as follows. The fig scientifically known as Ficus carica is a fruit tree in the family Moraceae and is commonly grown in tropical and subtropical regions around the world. Fig trees do not flower in the same way as apple and peach trees. Their flowers bloom inside pear-shaped fruits, which then ripen into the delicious fruit we enjoy. In this video, we will delve into the cultivation of this plant in various countries, with a particular focus on the improved fig-growing techniques used in Japan. We will explore the methods of harvesting and processing figs in factories with a particular focus on drying techniques and the health benefits they provide. Let's find out. Fig trees can be propagated in a variety of ways. Normally, this plant is propagated by farmers, by grafting or cuttings. Cuttings are selected precisely about 20 to 30 centimetres long and 0.5 to 0.7 centimetres thick. The farmer carefully cuts and plants these cuttings in pots. Fig trees thrive in both indoor and outdoor environments. Spring is the ideal time for planting. Once your indoor fig tree begins to thrive, it's time to transfer the rooted cuttings to a larger pot. High-quality fertilisers for fig trees usually contain a balanced combination of macro and micro nutrients. When planting fig trees outdoors, choose a time in springs or early fall and make sure the tree receives full sun. When choosing a planting site, remember that fig trees have the ability to grow deep roots if given the right conditions. After three to four years of planting, the fig tree begins to bear fruit. Fig trees begin to flower and fruit in early May, continuing this cycle until the first frost. Some varieties bear fruit twice a year, once in spring or summer and again in fall. Figs are only harvested when fully ripe because they do not ripen further after picking, unlike many other fruits. The fruit should be brightly coloured and slightly soft to the touch. The pollination process of fig trees is extremely complex, characterized by a special relationship with a small species of bee called the fig bee. Typically, each species of fig tree is associated with a specific species of wasp that acts as a pollinator for the tree. The fig is not a true fruit, rather it is an inverted inflorescence, containing many small flowers contained within a closed structure. The female fig wasp flies into the inflorescence through a small hole, carrying pollen from another fig tree. While searching for a suitable location to lay eggs, the wasp accidentally pollinates the female flowers inside. After pollination, these flowers will turn into seeds and the entire structure will develop into a complete fig. The interdependent relationship between fig trees and wasps is important for the tree's reproduction and growth, as the presence of wasps is key to the formation and ripening of figs. The process of harvesting figs in Japan requires retention to detail and precision. Figs are harvested at peak ripeness to ensure the most delicate flavor and optimal nutritional benefits. Each fig is carefully inspected by workers and only large figs with bright yellow or red color are selected. Figs are carefully arranged in trays to ensure quality before being transported to the processing facility. Figs are collected and transported to processing facilities where they are processed into both fresh and dried products. Fresh figs are processed quickly to retain their delicious flavor and nutritional value. Dried fenced seeds, dried figs are maintained at a certain moisture level to retain nutrients while maintaining their natural content. Fresh figs typically have a soft center containing many crunchy seeds. This special texture makes them enjoyable to eat. Figs offer a delicious combination of natural sweetness, soluble fiber and many essential minerals. One important mineral worth noting especially for growing children and women is iron. Dried figs are made by drying the fruit in natural conditions usually by stacking them on wooden or plastic racks. They are rich in vitamins and minerals which offer significant benefits to people with nutrient deficiencies. Dried figs are rich in antioxidants that help slow down the aging process. Dried figs from Japan contain a variety of vitamins and minerals especially significant amounts of potassium and turcofarol. These nutrients play a key role in many of the health benefits associated with figs including improved digestion, stronger bones and a reduced risk of chronic diseases. Dried figs can be packaged in a variety of ways depending on the specific type and grade. A favorite treat is figs covered in premium chocolate providing a special confectionary experience. Figs are growing in popularity in Southeast Asia and Malaysia is leading the way with the largest commercial fig plantations in the region. The cultivation of figs in Southeast Asia has opened up countless creative opportunities with this wonderful fruit. Fig cultivation has made significant advances in both technological innovation and cultivation techniques. Japanese farmers have adopted modern agricultural methods to increase fig production focusing on both quantity and quality. Japan's climate characterized by distinct seasons creates the perfect environment for growing special fig trees. I really appreciate you taking the time to watch.
