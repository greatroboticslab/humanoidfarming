  "text": "Hi, welcome back to my suburban garden. I'm Sheila and today I want to talk about herbs in your veggie beds So there are benefits to planning herbs in your veggie beds Not having a separate herb bed, but actually Spreading them out into your veggie beds. For example Sage it repels bean beetles, so I'm gonna plant a couple of these in with my beans Chives are supposed to improve the texture and taste of your carrots Basil which I already have in with my tomatoes Supposedly improves the flavor of your tomatoes peppermint Lavender and oregano all Attract pollinators to your bed, but if they also repel Pests from your garden from your beds. So that's the benefit of Having herbs planted in your veggie beds Please take a second it only takes second to like this video and subscribe It really helps the channel.
