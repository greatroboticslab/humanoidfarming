  "text": "Good morning everybody. Thanks for being here. This is another seminar in quite a series that we have been organizing and actually I want to take the opportunity to thank Isabel for following up on the seminars. If you have any idea for your own to present or any speaker you think should come and give a seminar, you can always float the idea. Today we invited Lugdandova. Lugdandova is a very esteemed colleague which whom we have been working over the past years in a very fruitful collaboration between Simit and Simba staff. When you see some of the numbers about publications coming out of the long-term trial infrastructure, the long-term trials we have here in Mexico, part of those publications come from student collaborations that we have been doing together with Simba staff and Lugd's research team. What I always say is the uniqueness is Lugdandova has a lot of nice ideas, nice research tools that we don't have and we have the long-term trials that can actually be the background or that can generate the story through using those insights that are way more upstream than what we are doing. Lugdandova has a very long and recognized career. He started his work at the University of Leuven, then was quite some time active in Rotemstadt and finally landed in Mexico in Simba staff where he is still leading one of the most important research teams on carbon nitrogen cycling and recently micro organism processes but I'm sure he will explain that way better than I can do. So thank you and let's give a round of applause. Good morning, good morning and thanks for coming. Okay, that's the title of my talk. I mentioned at the bottom because if you read some of the earlier papers then people try to give certain characteristics to bacteria and I tried to show you that for instance they are copiotrophic, they are oligotrophic. I'm not too sure about that anymore. I think bacteria are much more flexible. I don't know if soil characteristics are important in that. It might be competition, it might be predators. I'm not sure. So this is a collaboration between different institutes, some younger researchers working in... We've already mentioned it's rather a good collaboration. I'm quite proud of it. We have now 31 published peer review manuscripts. We got 745 citations. Some of these citations come from some very important papers at Bramroad and we have an index of 14. So I'm quite pleased with this collaboration. We have quite a lot of other papers ready to submit. Okay, we know that agriculture practices affect yields and soil characteristics. We studied some of these Elbatan and Obrigon but I focus mostly pitfall in Elbatan. In soil characteristics, we have one problem in Elbatan, I mentioned it immediately. We got two replicated plots. So if you do an statistical analysis then you get problems because the variation is rather great. So often you see clear cut effects but they are not significant. So yeah, some of the problems. That's one of the commands of the last paper that we submit. Doesn't even know it is accepted but this is a command I often receive. I mean no, but I'm a bit worried about it because it returns and returns. That's why Obrigon is that if we want to get some soil samples and extract DNA, that becomes difficult and if we want to extract RNA then it's even more. Okay, we were expecting that these differences, especially organic matter, would have a large effect on carbon nitrogen immunization. This is a very simple representation of the aerobic incubation we do. We got some soil which have carbon dioxide and we measure in the soil mineral N and now recently we started to extract DNA to see what is happening there. Another command that I was not really aware of is that if you start to work with bacteria then you have non-parametric data. I've never, well, did a lot of research on soil characteristics, parametric but bacteria if you count they're non-parametric and again if you try to do some analysis then yeah, significant difference is rather difficult to obtain because non-parametric or more stringent if I can say it like that. Okay, so I said I would mention the problems we were encountering. These are some results of carbon and nitrogen immunization you see, not a lot of differences between your treatments, although you have a difference in carbon content and I compare that with Robbalk and Roppemstead where after how long was it, more than 160 years you really have a big difference in carbon immunization because your carbon content is extremely different. I just want to mention you know that maybe Jenkinson published a paper on microbiomass carbon, there's no replicator Robbalk. So if you look at the data on his original paper then there's no replicates there. Additionally he includes soil and you look at the line so but anyway I think a very important paper but I have some questions. Anyway, we didn't detect a big difference in carbon nitrogen immunization, we did some measurements also in the field, we did that quite a while ago and that was one of the problems we faced on some of his paper on carbon dioxide emissions, the nitrogen oxide emissions, the methane emissions that Review was pointing out you only have two replicates. Okay, conservation agriculture but okay you have these data, you have these differences, so what is the effect of these differences on microbial populations and this is a principle component analysis and it's a you try to get all your data on bacterial groups, you try to correlate them and whatever. So you get a separation between permanent beds and between conventional beds and what do you get in conventional beds you get copiotrophs, fresh organic material, consumer, they're degraded, they mineralize it. It's organisms that are nutrient depleted might be questionable as a word because normally it has more to do with nutrients than with organic material but also for organic material. So if there's a microbiologist and polygons using that because some people are very firm, So the agriculture practices do affect our microbial populations as I mentioned permanent beds they favor these groups which are oligotrophs that prefer nothing, this is the opposite, they prefer a nutrient rich, this should be reversed but anyway and then we have conventional beds where we get these organisms that prefer organic rich environments. Why? Because if you have conventional beds then you deal on top. Okay, sampling in 2012-2014 we'll get the same results, permanent beds preferred by oligotrophs preferred, they are favored and if you go to conventional practices, conventional, I always have questions is this for real? Do you have changes over time or my results correct? Because you always have this problem of technique and what do I mean by technique? When we did these first analysis we had clones, we had about 150 sequences of DNA and then we went to Piro which is about 100,000 sequences and now we go to Illumina and then we can talk about whatever you want 400 million, 200 million so the question is always there's an evolution between now. So what we start an experiment is here trying to solve samples over the year and we want to look at populations, we try to look at certain processes also because it's one of the critiques you can have on this work, it's very descriptive, descriptive, what this is all about, what you're really doing, what is the importance of all this and I will say we try to start with getting the techniques right and then we can start to focus on some questions we have. So I'll mention some questions at the end of my talk but we want to focus on on nitrification and functionality. Functionality of RNA from a soil is very difficult, if you look at literature you will find some papers on it but very little. Problem is soil conditions and we are very lucky that Aubregon we succeed in extracting RNA and Elbatan forget about it. So you check the literature, it's the same I mentioned bacteria because extracting or amplifying DNA from fungi is not so easy. Archea we can do it but it's a borderline so look at the literature, you will see some papers but if you try to compare because in El we published a paper on fungi in Sonora and microscopic Eucariota, there's nothing to compare it really. Funga it's okay you have some but microscopic Eucariota very little. Okay if we have the question about copiotrophs and not copiotrophs then my idea was we get organic material, if we get organic material available we'll get some copiotrophs. A rhizosphere is normally an organic carbon so what we are trying to do all of these two behaving in the rhizosphere there's a lot of organic carbon in the correct environments and also we apply organic material crop residue to the soil who's going to degrade that organic material. Okay this is recently recent and I haven't gone into all the details but we did we measure the population vegetative flowering grain building the bulk soil rhizosphere is this dynamics a bit and then again this another rather interesting development I always used to work with SAS and people convinced me that error is much better it is a magnificent tool but it takes some time first to adjust to it because SAS is very straightforward, error is a bit strange if you're not used to it another problem see with error I can do this this graph so well the results were obtained in RRI and then put it in Excel because I don't like the graphs but you have about six or seven packages that can do this and it's I get lost sometimes SAS is easy it's straightforward always the same but error all these biological techniques they don't exist and in error you've got all these updates well daily I think so my advice is people really want to want to work in bioinformatics go to error or fight them I don't know fight them because they're trying to convince me also to start working in fight them I don't know presumably I will end up doing it but anyway but we get we get some clear changes again in population in the rhizosphere so are they holds more or less there in error not to show if it will give better results but and this is also very recent although I think the program all this was there started to write it when we were in Oak Ridge they mentioned it this is where you got your bacteria identified with ribosomal DNA sorry and then you try to link these populations to functions and that is very interesting because otherwise you've got 600 or 1000 species what the hell what are they doing okay I know Basileus and I know Pseudomonas and I know aches and I know that but this this becomes interesting now I think they're developing it because RNA is not so easy to extract but I hope we can link this with RNA this is heat I think to but I said it's just I did it two days ago and then this is another experiment to firm these are all incubation over time so if you see these seven and fourteen normally we have about 260 250 data points and then you see here we added bean material and this is an amendot and then you see that the bean the population there's a shift in population the stories I apply organic material and there's a shift in my population okay as I said we can confirm but as always once you get some answers to what they define certain groups as being oligotrophs and certain groups being copiotrophs and then you you compare actinobacteria this group what is it micro coca sea and then you've got here gala sea and then you see these are favored by organic material you applied and the others not so the idea yeah it's not working so I think it would be rather difficult to say that one bacterial group has this characteristics I have to mention when we go to specious in bacteria then we talk about 97% of similitude similitude yeah we differ from chimpanzees I think 0 3% so what are we talking about what are we talking about really okay but we are aware of this problem but we should sometimes not forget it okay as I mentioned these groups are very easy to isolate so they're well described but in a soil they're normally not that important only 3% of them and then we got the other basilos of 5% so what is all the rest doing one of the other problems when we write these papers then normally we mentioned about 15 groups at the maximum and normally you found between 500 and 1000 generous so what all the rest is doing we don't know and we don't even want to talk about it because we would go to pay get a paper of I don't know how many pages but anyway so would you the question was would soil characteristics affect our behavior of certain groups when we apply organic materials so we apply organic material in one system which is conventional beds and permanent beds so we would hope that this group which is acid or bacteria II this is a very important group but we don't know actually what it is doing and then you see in permanent beds when you apply bean material their relative abundance increases when you apply to conventional bed is an effect of soil characteristics so we wanted to have some soil a bit more diverse to see how different bacterial groups respond to and this we used to a we used and this is quite nice so you get a complete separation of your different groups yeah one of the problems I have is with canonical correlations when I do a principal component analysis it's very nice I go to canonical and it's not so nice so my explanation is there's a factor defining this that I can't well I don't measure it or is it that it's important or it's interaction between my populations in the given environment but I mean I said I would mention the problems I see but okay I think we can and this is then in the different ecosystems now you have the chinam pie and the baton that's cocoa by bean material how are these groups respond to the material and then you see it's increasing why it consumes the organic material that's better well known but then you start to see these groups like oh I think I missed that one which is rather well known and normally it is a copiotrope however in this system in Texcoco when I apply organic material it participates in the degradation of the organic material and when I look at it by tongue not at all so conclusion these groups adapt themselves or they have the metabolic metabolic capacity but the environment the competition with other groups defines how they respond yeah so we we made a little which organisms we have it along the gradient so we apply here some organic material and we measured populations they're one they three they're seven fourteen twenty it's 56 and then you see the groups that are favored the relative abundance increase alomonas and if we go to batanda we see the normal basi loose and some stepdomesis also along the loss yeah but you see there are different groups that are favored by degradation I think I remember if I remember correctly T.T. said that bacteria and soil normally keep genetic capacity they don't shed so much of their capacity as you will see in the reactor or in my stomach you know there's a quick interchange of genes and so this is again three systems I apply immaterial and you get a shift in your population as I mentioned this is all very well very nice you've got beautiful BCRs and you say oh we've got a shift but but can we learn for all this first of all I think we can use the techniques to the specific questions and one of the specific questions we are trying to address now is an obregon it's a problem with that uh elimination uh plant emerges and plant stand decreased under dry sowing but not in wet conditions so we retreat them with the pesticides or herbicides or whatever insecticides fungi sites then so we assume it's a problem there with so I think with all these techniques we now have we try to look if it's really a biological problem we're facing okay um well that's not that difficult but this is not that easy uh due to soil conditions um there are some people who extract the metagenomics or where you pay a lot and extract all the dni and then you analyze everything um yeah it's rather cost costs a bit uh but then you need and I'll mention that later on then you need computer power and your knowledge to all these pieces of 300 or 100 dna spares to link them that's not that easy neither but anyway we're working on as I mentioned uh and then another study we started this to look at my populations why do we look at the related to trace gas emission greenhouse gas emission nitrous oxide why do we focus on nitrifiers and not on denitrification there are not that many so we try to focus on something that is rather easy to study additionally the genes or the yeah the proteins involved in the process are rather limited however for instance amoar which is ammonium monoxygenase or I thought there was one now there are already three different types so if you want to look at these things these processes you have to consider all the possible genes so we're looking at we are looking at permanent best conventional burned and then we have minus and plus and we want to measure this this is the first a preliminary experiment with ammonium to these different sites and what we when uh and what is applied in the field then you see that a lot of oxidation of ammonium so you have a rather vivid or active nitrifier population which is not that yeah okay we want to measure or we'll measure that we want to measure these gases we want to measure biomass we go for microbial structure nitrifiers this is not that complicated as I mentioned you already have three of them I don't know how many I have of these but then we want to uh if you consider 95 percent of the activity is normal activity of the organism it's not related to the process you're studying you've got a bit of a needle in the heart I think so it's so evident so we're trying to work on that um one of the things I haven't mentioned yet but I think um with all the changes in techniques we have uh when I mentioned it we started 150 clones then we went to 100 000 and now I don't know how many 200 million you need a bit of computer power and we're only starting uh with that so um we will start now since yesterday I think finally after two years of negotiating uh we can have a new option within the department which will focus on bioinformatics statistics and supercomputing one of the problems I see in statistics personally is uh time series I mean if you uh have a change over time how do you compare these populations what we normally do what Richard Webster always told me you just take the mean and you compare the mean and that will be enough and forget about all the rest uh but I think we need some uh some changes there supercomputers seem to to get your genome genome genome together uh bioinformatics there's a lot of dispute about the systems you've got your sequence and then you have different systems to verify or check or identify the organisms it belong to and so you have certain journals that say we want that system Europeans normally go for the european system and american system and uh yeah okay but anyway that's another of the questions we have and then another thing we will try to do is we did a lot of these experiments with organic material copiotrophs oligotrophs you want to get it all together it's about 20 experiments uh we want to compare and see if all these data we have uh some bit a bit of data mining see we can get something out of it okay that's where we are at the moment um I must admit as you can see this is not my work of a lot of people and I haven't mentioned them all but uh I would like to fight them um one of the advantages I think we for Mexico we have a lot of people that's for sure a lot of very enthusiastic people very capable people uh funding is not always that easy but okay we'll get along and we have no access always to those sophisticated equipment but okay these sequences we send them out to uh microgent Korea um I don't know if you've heard about the german group who now extract DNA from soil from uh yeah our ancestors and have you read about that that now they can extract DNA from soil because all DNA doesn't degrade and soil so you it is preserved uh so we if we look at the under talus where they walked uh yeah we can find traces of this DNA all they mention it uh the amount of soil you need to do this is not 20 grams like you do in the baton but a huge amount and what these sorry these Germans have they developed a robot uh so you can assess or process an enormous amount of what we have the people they have the robot we hope in 20 years time uh the robot will be cheap but uh all the rest will be rather expensive but anyway I would be very too for the field experiment I think what bram mentioned is uh is true uh it's a unique uh yeah unique experiment when I answer these questions I don't have to replicate I always say it's the only field experiment in the topics that I have access to okay there are two replicates but well maintained experiments for more than 25 years correct bram you don't find them so if you want to study these things I mean okay it might be useless I'm not sure what then you need something you can rely on it's well done because if you go into the field and we compare whatever the baton we compare uh forests the variation is huge enormous I don't know what they did so um I am I'm grateful and also when the money was brought uh there were more than willing to help me I um and that too simple stuff for the uh yeah infrastructure and of course conacid was very generous with funding us I think that's it yep thanks Luke and uh even that I was involved in in the work I still got some new ideas by seeing it presented like that so as always you keep us on our toes any questions from the from the audience please use the microphones because we have over I don't know how many people but several connected via the webinar so if you can use the microphone Ivan hi look hi very interesting I I think I might have missed when you collect your soil samples to do your extractions what depth or from what part of the soil are those soil samples we normally we normally work on the top soil layer why we do that is because we hope we have the biggest diversity I know there are papers published that you have to be careful with the proof I am well aware of that but it's it all has to do with where do you want to focus on if if I said 200 samples to analyze if I would go into profiles then I I get lost it's all it's all always trying to so that's 0 to 20 0 to 15 0 to 10 0 to 20 it depends it depends a bit yeah but normally it's 0 to 10 and then I don't know you could go back to the soil uh tests of the three different locations I don't know if I saw Tesco co with a ph of nine something or maybe it wasn't ph it went too fast uh is it too acidic acidic to alkaline but I think you have to test go cool it's this go cool maybe give some more details on yet this go cool the ph of nine is not here at the station right what this no the one at the bottom oh no no no oh sorry oh yes okay I have to explain this because you you have these differences in in El Baton we see a difference and so we see an effect of what we do on our population so to to stress to to go in an excess of variation we want to uh salt in the area it's a chinamba it's in touchy milko okay uh Texcoco uh you you got 9.4 which is not a lot because in Texcoco we have 10.5 but we wanted to not do to be too extreme you know what I mean that is Coco Lake right yeah it's a Texcoco Lake it's a lake yeah yeah and and you have a huge uh salinity also a lot of studies are on Texcoco uh that's why I included it so El Baton is the I think I'm right El Baton is a CA plot from the long-term drive chinamba yeah so Chivalko if I'm saying right and then is that Texcoco is it sorry sorry so yeah yeah sorry and one last question no no what's your view on these bioferylizers that are dealing with these bacteria and they're being inoculated in the seed etc yeah well this is not my my well it's personal but I'm not the only one who would say that I remember David Jenkinson saying that and I remember Martin Alexander saying that and I agree completely I think it would be very difficult there are two reasons first of all you have an equilibrium you have a system an equilibrium you apply something organisms second if you have a soil you apply it how are you going to apply it where you need it I can imagine you fertilize a seed and then you hope we did some experiments we did an experiment with parcels and it was fantastic it was the best we had an effect for one month on the roots and that was it I'm actually doing an experiment uh with mace uh with one of the farmers who has this brilliant system of bio fertilizer and and we sterilized his consortium and in the beginning the sterilized consortium gave better results than the consortium there's another reason why I'm very skeptical for this experiment we checked the literature check the literature and it tells you quite a lot where was it published which journals was published um I get very doubtful I remember in Leuven uh bram those rule and uh but it was car of lasak with asos pyrilum in brazil and they had a positive result so they published it and it could never repeat it uh so I am but I the experiment we're doing is we we using these techniques we have now to look more so we have this consortium we'll characterize it we'll see what's happening problem is always okay I'm working in greenhouse because if I do it in the field and again you know the problems in the field people do things you don't know uh one of the other that's the reason why I prefer to work with simit we started to work with some of the uh where is it uh yeah in uh wrote to I don't remember the name tepechi I don't remember the village and and you try to collaborate and then they call you and they say oh we fertilized yeah do you have sample I don't have it so you can't and and that's also one of the questions of reviews of why did you do it in greenhouse yeah I can't say I can't work in because they don't love it's not like Europe remember we measured some trace gases in Chiapas and sushi up us and we we left our pvc tubes in the field they stole them and we were communicating constantly with local people I yeah it's one of the reasons also I think field experiments are simit or brilliant and that we do some some some lab experiments but it's very difficult to justify to review who says yeah yeah yeah okay yeah just a comment we actually also have a field trial that's been going on for 20 years in san louis potosi at the any fab station so might be interesting also to do some investigation there they also evaluate conservation agriculture minimal village and conventional system and tour applications okay okay what what kind of soil is it so it's it's if we can extract RNA that common because it's rather no no no no no no no no it's it's it's not it's not even no sorry it's just it's not even to do with the type of soil it is it is at random we had in the beginning for instance in in el baton we sampled or you said you're trying to extract DNA you got nine replicates where you got treatments and all of a sudden once soil you can't extract it whatever you do now we optimize that and blah blah blah but uh it's it's you you you if you go to conferences or congresses there was one at brogdschweig uh last year in december where and then you hear to see the same questions DNA and all the problem RNA proteins that people huge amount of money dedicated to extract proteins because that's the final solution i mean DNA RNA and proteins but it's and they got money you know europe it's one million euros but you know what i mean it's these techniques are not yet what it should be but i think they're brilliant i love it i think simon for your comment and i actually think that several uh that they that several of the platforms that took some time to get them ready slowly are going to be ready to be put in in this kind of this kind of networks and taking advantage also of of thinking all the phd students that actually have been connected to the work and that i think that's something we have to reactivate also in the in the team to see how can we can there be a phd student working on something to see or um so definitely nela is is working on that ivan is working on attracting more students so i think that's how we can keep this kind of work going any more questions question over there somebody else no somebody online somebody online has a question now that i was recently following a seminar online i know how frustrated it is you want to say something and nobody remembers that you're actually hanging on your computer no one time two times last time no question look you had a question the last if you have a specific question in your face are more than willing to investigate it but the descriptive i think no because we've done it i think we should we should start use these techniques to really i have a problem here can i can i answer with my molecular biology i think so so if you have a question more than okay thank you very much uh look and i think this is a clear example of research research for impact through partnerships when i'm asked what is the value of the long-term trials i just show luke's first slide with i don't know i don't even remember more than 30 uh shared joint publications and uh h index of 14 and that usually helps to convince them more academically or oriented donors so luke thank you very much this has been a brilliant partnership and there's more to come in the future",
