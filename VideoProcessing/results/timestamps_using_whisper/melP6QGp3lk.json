  "text": "Welcome to an introduction to drip irrigation. This key farm element can be part of a sustainable farm system that considers conservation of natural resources, farm economic sustainability and produce safety. In the next few minutes, you will hear and see an overview of drip irrigation implementation for farm enhancement from a whole farm planning perspective. Installing a drip irrigation system may lower your costs and your food safety risk. There is also no doubt that installing irrigation systems also protects the farm income from the financial effects of drought. Drip irrigation, also called micro irrigation or trickle irrigation, provides a slow and steady source of water right on or below the soil surface. Drops of tiny streams move through emitters. Each emitter delivers a meter amount of water. Some drip systems are in line and some have detached emitters that can be placed along the drip lines. The water is distributed by these emitters and provide a consistent source of water across the bed. By keeping the foliage free of excess water, you can reduce the spread of plant disease. This system is not the best choice for crops that require frost or freeze protection or cooling which involves overhead delivery for maximum effectiveness. Applying the water directly to the root zone also reduces the potential of water to serve as a vehicle for human pathogen contamination to the edible portion of your crop. Since it is possible for soil insets or rodents to enter the irrigation system through broken lines, carefully inspect the system to keep the water supply safe. This system reduces your water uses so it can also save you money on your electric or water bill. Another advantage is the ability to apply chemicals through your irrigation lines. This helps keeps them from spreading on a windy day and potentially contaminating a public water source or a crop you don't intend to treat. Carefully managing fertilizers applications through drip irrigation and flushing the soil with water when necessary are important in a high tunnel since the building up of salts is possible with this system. Tools like flow meters to automate the delivery of precise amounts of water, timers and soil moisture sensors can help you monitor the use of your water safely and efficiently. The USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service can provide financial assistance for implementation of conservation practices through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program and the Conservation Stewardship Program. NRCS and Extension can also provide technical expertise to help. Implementing drip irrigation on your farm. Drip irrigation is a common way to conserve water, reduce plant disease, reduce food safety risks and reduce costs.",
