  "text": "First of all, thank you everyone for taking your time and becoming part of the webinar. This webinar is part of Partners in Prosperity's multilingual webinar series where we are trying to mobilize and spread awareness about water management, importance of water conservation and how to develop techniques where water can be managed well in agriculture. My name is Shreya Tashalma and I am working as a coordinator in policy impact with Partners in Prosperity. Now I will just introduce you to a project called VAPRO which we have been doing from last five years now. So under this water productivity project or VAPRO we are essentially trying to create aggregate value chains where the rice is produced using water efficient farming techniques and the procured rice is exported to market partners like Coop, Mars and LT Foods. Anyone who would like to know more about it can speak to me personally. Going ahead into the discussion, I will just introduce to our speakers. First we have Ms. Laoke Kokmans. Thank you so much Laoke for being part of the webinar. She is heading the global sustainable sourcing part of Mars food currently. She has been working in years of project management as well as I would ask you to kindly mute your videos. They are having nice feedback. She has been working in project management as well as developing sustainable sourcing strategies. Thank you Laoke for joining us. Dr. Kamal Vata has still not joined us. We cannot just say as of now. Moving to the next speaker we have Dr. Sudhir Yadav. Thank you so much Sudhir for being part of today's session. He is a senior scientist at IRRI, International Rice Research Institute. Currently he is leading the theme of environmentally sustainable methods in rice based systems. Then we have Mr. Raskesh Sharma. He is the director of the Central Water Commission, Ministry of Water Resources, River Development under River Development, Ganga Rajiv nation's government of India. And as he said his new presenter shall be his own and not necessarily representing the government or his department's opinions. Moving ahead with the discussion I will just give the lead to Mr. Sharma now and we will discuss the first question which is what is the importance of water in agriculture and how we can manage it. Dr. Sharma over to you. Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. Answer to the question what is the importance of water in agriculture. I would like to start from a little with a little perspective. At the time of independence our population was only 33 crores, 330 million. Now we are 1.3 billion. And the agriculture issue was such that at that time we were not finding it possible to feed our own people. Now we have done a lot of improvement, a lot of management issues, they are still left. Because you see what was correct at that time, the Green Revolution, now things have changed. Now we have become almost the population but we were then at that time. And there are some serious quality issues, quantity issues of water. Now to the question what is the importance of water in agriculture. Now India is such a country that whatever we have, whatever resources, whatever inputs we have at our disposal, we must leverage them for our benefit. And what do we have here is water. There are some countries which are quite water deficient. For example in Israel, the per unit water availability is less than 100. And we are having currently it is 1500 approximately. Mr. Shah, we can't hear you. Yes, some technical issue. Hello. Hello. Yes, yes, sir. We can hear you now. Okay. So whatever, what is the, coming back to the question, what is the importance of water in agriculture? Agriculture in agriculture water is very much important because it is one of the few resources which we have at our disposal. If we can leverage to feed up people to keep our country stable and prosperous and and all the rest. So we cannot straight away discount water and we cannot also leave aside the issues of environment about quality and all. So what we will really need is to have a multi-fiscate approach. We cannot, in my opinion, my personal opinion, we cannot straight away neglect our supply supply side, supply side results or supply side our answers and either we can neglect our demand side options. We have to manage it. We have to do a balancing act. So I think this is, this is how I would like to conclude is that we will have to manage it by making a very fine, a very delicate balance between our demand side solution and supply side solution. We cannot straight away be remain dependent upon one of them. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Sharma. Thank you so much for sharing your views. You're absolutely correct that how they should be balanced well maintained between how much we're demanding and how much we're producing against what resources are involved because often what's the debate is that are we really selling our crops or for that matter, rice or are we really selling water? So if you manage our water well, then of course I can be looked after. Thank you so much. I would request you to meet your video. Coming to the next question, which is again one of the very important questions is understanding the basics of what we're trying to do and what is sustainable agriculture really and right now today we have with us water and environment group from Uttarakhand who has done extensive work in developing water management techniques and we also have farmers in Haryana. We are trying to replicate this model. But before heading into them and listening to their questions and views, I would request Laokit to present her views on this second question. What is agriculture, what is sustainable agriculture and why do we need it? Thank you so much for the opportunity to share more about what is sustainable agriculture and why do we need it and maybe from the perspective of a global big company. I would like to share my screen that you need to give me permission Sharma. Okay, thank you. If you can see my screen please let me know. We can't see your screen. You cannot? Yeah, what did you share? If you can see it please let me know. We can't see your screen. Yes. You can? Yeah, perfect. Okay, excellent. Okay. So I work for Mars Foods. We are part of the big Mars Inc company and we are owners of the biggest global rice brands. And today I would like to share a little bit background like why sustainable rice becomes more and more important in countries like Europe, the US. But why it's also important for companies like Mars. First of all, as Mars family and company and we find it very important that we can make an impact. So it's important we can drive change. We can also have an impact for people, for planets. Can everyone go on mute please? Yeah, I think you're a good logger. Sorry, yeah. Thank you. And driving impact is key. Also we identified within Mars our top products and we can see that rice, which is using 40% of the world's irrigation available. As business we should act upon water reduction. So that's something we do. Yeah. Also why sustainable rice is important. It's also important that we can source basmati. It's growing. It's growing in Europe. It's growing in the States. People want to eat this. Frequent rice. So it's important we have weekend source from India. So it's important we can source quality and health safety rice. It's always number one. But we also think in the future. So also we want to source our basmati rice. So we need a long term supply. Well, if water. Equipment are dropping. We need to act upon this. We need to think in the future for that reason we are now partnering in the VAPRO program in. We really want to have a water stewardship approach. And we also have basmati rice in 10 years time. Even though we are very small of course. But for that reason we partnering with our suppliers, but we also very active in platforms as well like the sustainable rice platform. Yes. Another aspect like why is sustainability important. It's important for our own associates our own employees in Mars. And of course we also need to change it into into growth in the business. So for instance, what now you see is very important consumers. They want to know where is their food coming from. It's called the trust chain. They want to know where it's grown, where it's coming from. And we do this for instance by putting stories on the back of the pack. And we show how much water is saved by farmers that grow. Yeah, great basmati rice. So having this in mind, this is more like say the why, why it's so important that we work on sustainability. Thinking about the future. Yeah. Then as a business we have set goals. So we said we can't do it on our own. So we remember and take leadership in the rice platform. And I think that's that's also something we're now working on in India. We have plans maybe to set up a national chapter about sustainable rice platform. We also said we want to source rice from the sustainable rice platform standard. That's one way how you can measure that farms are growing sustainable rice, which is key. But we also say this is not enough. So we also say farmers, they need income. Otherwise, it cannot join a profit from any program. So we need to improve yields, have better access to finance. I think also let's say how farms can sell their products like straw. So we need to work on income and today's topic is about what are used. So in high water stress areas, we need to reduce the water use. And of course this is all linked to each other. We cannot only use. Okay, I think there's some technical issue. We can't show you properly. So we should do it. So partners, we should be in. Okay. Okay. Should I did you hear my previous slides about the goals? We could show it properly. Yeah. Should I do it again? Yeah, if you can't, that would be really nice. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So as a company, we have set goals. And first of all, we acknowledge we cannot do it on our own. So for that reason, we have joined the sustainable rise platform. Both the platform as well as adopting the rice standards. We also really supporting that in India, we set up a national chapter. So that actors can be united in advocating for sustainable rice. We in our goals, we don't only see it as. SRP is the only one solution. We also work on income and water use. So that means we need to work on better work capital for rice growers, increasing yields, lowering input costs. As well, we see it. We need to work on water stewardship. And all the goals, of course, are interlinked together. And something we should embed in a similar framework. Could you hear me now? Yeah, we are with you. Okay. Okay, good. Yeah. We can't do it on our own. So we very active with a lot of different partners we're having who know this context very well. And we work closely with our suppliers. We are very advocating that we work through Miller associations to really drive sector change. And maybe the final slides. What we always see that we need to, to think about the future long-term view. So we need to think how can we change the system. So our dream, our vision is Haryana should be an attractive area that we can source high quality basmati. Yeah, with sufficient water in the future. But that only starts with if rice farmers. And they are entrepreneurs. They think as entrepreneurs. So grow rice and weed in a system. And as well also farmers, they become stewards themselves of the environment. Yeah, they need this well functioning ag reserve system. So good governance should be there. There should be a good private sector supporting them. So what we do now we work with our partners on having a good rice value chain. We need to work on adoption of climate smart practices. And we need to improve the enabling environment. So the policy parts. Yeah, yeah. I would stop here and then give it to the next speaker. Yeah. Thank you. In fact, you raise very important points that says that farmers have to start working is what is the words really. However, my question really is as a farmer as someone who is directly working one field, when someone has to make a choice, they need to totally understand the business model. So when you say the farmers have to become entrepreneurs, they also have to find the utility of choosing what deficient techniques over the conventional farming techniques to have anything add to anything to add on that. But. Yeah, I so agree that the business case should be very clear. So we always see the income going hands in hands with water. So for instance, we work now on a pre finance model together with the rebel bank. So that farmers can do for instance laser leveling as a technique, which also will increase yields as well it will reduce water as well. So that's just one example. And as well we look at for instance how we can use the byproducts of rice for instance they sell the straw. So we always need to think through long it's a model as well. Yeah, yeah. Absolutely correct. Now I would like to open our floor to for questions to the farmers who are sitting directly in her in fact it is important that you raise the point of her in a because it is a center of the sport to drive. It's alone coming from Indiana of the whole of the country. So I would request our nightly in sitting in her in a public region to kindly open this video and maybe we can hear from what farmers have to say and. What is that? What is the importance of? Now give me a minute and try to translate and understand what. Yes, I think that's some confusion. Maybe I want to use the chat section so that we can read the question from that. Besides the question from the farmer is how can rain water be cleanser. How can rain water be cleanser? How can a farmer cleanser rain water? Thank you, Mr. Paritraji for your question. So lucky and Mr. Sharma who spoke a while back I would request anyone of you would you know who would like to take this question. I think Sharma Jake. Not with us anymore. So lucky for like to address this question with how rain water can be used. Actually I think Sudhir might be the best one to answer because he's more the water specialist of Erie. I can give my thoughts for collecting rain water. I better leave it to the more water specialist. Yeah. Dr. Sudhir if you would we can't hear you Dr. Sudhir if you can maybe try to unmute Dr. Sudhir we can't hear you. I think there's some. Can you hear me now? Yeah I'm so sorry we did see you. Yeah speaking to you. It's all technology. So thank you very much and I'm very glad to see you know all farmers and just to inform them. I'm also from Haryana so that's very kind of good moment to see people from my state. The question which has been asked and for farmer I'm sitting in Manila working for an international organization for rice. So the question which has been asked I think the question is not how to you know use rain water. I'm looking at the chat box question is how to help in raising the groundwater table. Which is kind of related question that so there's a two part first we need to understand why groundwater is going down. So that's that's first part and the second part is how we can help. So there has been a lot of research done by by universities by ICR center on how you can capture rain water and how that can be kind of linked to the aquifers. So the basically there has been work done by different centers where at the corner of your field they kind of install a bore well if you want to call it and that act as a water harvesting and the rain water goes directly to the aquifer. So the first part is that by that whatever runoff is happening that goes to your aquifer. But the more importantly thing is that the degree with which we can recharge the groundwater that is still less than the rate which we are extracting the water. So I think we need to also control the extraction part that how we will reduce our extraction so that the replacement rate can be reduced. So briefly I'll stop here. Thank you so much for sharing your views with us. And what you say is it's very important that how some techniques which has to be introduced on ground needs to be done. And just moving to the next question which we have from Uttarakhand is what techniques can be adopted in Rabi ground management where we are dependent on ground water sources. So if any of our speakers would like to answer this question I mean Dr. Sudhir since we knew all this was in rise I would again. Yes. So the question is not for rise that's for Rabi season and it's very very interesting that how we look from the system perspective not only from from rise or Rabi season. There has been a lot of work done in eastern India especially in eastern Uttar Pradesh especially they are I'm sure some of the farmers are familiar about dry seeded rice and then not for rise but then they go for early seeding. So this seeding of wheat to capture the residual soil moisture with this small decision about what we call window operation you can reduce one irrigation. So there is a lot of work going on how in eastern Uttar Pradesh basically we talk about you know two to three irrigation maximum two irrigation. So you can with system thinking if you can capture the residual moisture from rise starting early with rice with dry seeded rice and then capturing the residual moisture going with that's not in eastern UP but a lot of work in Punjab Haryana is going on using straw as a mulch. So with happy seeded lot of work is going on in Haryana but that's not much in Uttar Pradesh in Uttar Pradesh I think there is a lot of scope to go for early planting of wheat and using the residual moisture of rice rather than wasting it. Thank you so much Dr. Sudeep for telling us how the byproducts could also be used. We have a couple of questions coming over and we would like our speakers to answer them unfortunately we didn't have Dr. Bhattavidas. Nevertheless we could go forward and move into the third question. We would have these answers questions answered in the next session would close the question on session for now. And then we had to the third question of today's presentation which is how can technology be used in improvising agricultural practices. So Dr. Sudeep if you can enlighten us with your views. Sure and I think this will also help to address some of the questions which are coming which are indeed very interesting. So when we talk about how technology can be used in provide agriculture practices I think we need to think about what we mean by technologies. People in you know see technology from different perspectives. Technology can be per say kind of practical tools or the recommendation to kind of enabling tools to ease the decision making. And technology can be also in terms of catalyzing the adoption of improved practices. So it depends on how we define the technology and I'll briefly talk about all three. So when we say about technology so people generally say technology as something new a new product. Motions are coming like drip irrigations and and and the law of commencing about laser leveling. So it depends on what is our purpose is if our purpose is kind of applying the less irrigation water. Then we can go with the technology like laser leveling. So laser leveling will basically what will it will help that the amount of water which you apply whether you apply like five centimeter standing water 10 centimeter whatever you apply to reach to that level the water quantity required will be less. And I think at least in India there has been sufficient adoption of laser leveling a lot in Punjab Haryana. But now it's picking in eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar a lot and there is a clear visible benefit of laser leveling in terms of reducing the water and and increasing the yield. But then also if the technology like if you don't know if you want to reduce or you want to increase the interval between two irrigations. So how frequently you are applying irrigation and then the technology like alternate wetting and drying which is again quite quite famous now in in South Asia that you should have continuous flooding you can dry your field to to certain level and there's a simple tool to do that. But then we also talk about technology where you can reduce the amount of water but you can't reduce the frequency so it's a frequent application of water that is deep. So in deep we have a technology where the amount of water can be significantly reduced but you need to apply it like more or less daily because it meet the airport transportation demand. The point here is it depends on what is the what are the challenges in the region. Similarly when it's come to water it's not only water per se it's also energy in Punjab and Haryana it's most of the pumps are on on electricity as we go down in eastern side there is a lot of diesel operated pump and then it comes to like how we can reduce the energy footprints also and there are different solutions especially in the coastal regions there has been a lot of adoption of axial flow pump compared to centrifugal pump where your energy footprints can be significantly reduced or there has been a lot of projects now started by by government of India on solar power so it's kind of green energy using the green energy. This is one lens using irrigation or energy the other lens is in terms of improving the adaptation you know capacity of the farmer and in that one some of the farmer ask about water harvesting so basically if you if you can harvest the water that improve your you know capacity to adapt you know like if you are going through drought so you can apply supplementary irrigation and there is a lot of work done on on crop as business method like a dry city dry but if if you can allow me to share the screen. Sister sister can you hear me. Okay thank you. Can can you see my my screen. I think you are mute. So, I'm assuming that you are able to see. Yes, yes I'm able to see I'm sorry I've become to your screen. Yeah. Okay, can you see now. Not really we can see your screen. You need to click twice on like share and then you need to do more permission. I think you need to click twice and then. Yeah, let's see. Yeah, now we can. Okay, you can you can see. So, basically what it went to different screen so not sure this screen you are looking at. All right, let's let's. Okay, let's let's give it simple. So what I mean here that we generally as a as a researcher we generally open a lot of technology to farmers and sometime made them confused we sometimes we are very much technology driven and in real sense I think what farmer help on is making a decision that what what are the best way to make the decision what technology can be picked and technology know is not only about like following laser leveling or not the decision is whether laser leveling is required or not or after how many years laser leveling is required whether for your system. Is a good option so maybe you are getting enough rain you you target the system game. So there's a lot of work which is required in terms of helping farmer in decision making and lucky was talking about enabling environment and this is similar to that one that where you invest on building the capacity of the system that is also with policy lens but then now there are a lot of ICT IoT based tool which are very powerful in terms of picking the right technology which are suitable for a particular reason farmers in Haryana their questions are different than farmers in Uttar Pradesh and farmers in Bihar so we cannot fit one size to all and it's very very important that we we use now that the tools in terms of leaving it with farmers and then telling that this is best for you leaving with them to pick what is best for them because they are the kind of best people to understand the environment understand their challenge and I think what we can do is helping them in terms of exploring the capital area of technologies and telling them the pros and cons of different technologies. And then these tools can also help to catalyze the chains which are required. I can see that it's one more slide which is basically saying that we have technologies but and we know the stakeholder need but technology that generally doesn't reach the stakeholders and that's the gap which we need to fill that how how what kind of now tools we can develop so that we can reach as much as near to farmers. I'll stop here for now. Thank you so much. You're absolutely correct in how we have been. We do need to enable the farmers to make it in from choice and it and this enabling factor could have multiple values. One could be to give them the appropriate information of what are the kind of facilities available the kind of videos or just share the screen or even at the part of the government of what in terms of what kind of initiatives in the schemes are available for example subsidies. We have been involved in this part of enabling farmers by training them in various kinds of farm if you have water efficient farming techniques and one of which was water stewardship which was being done under our water productivity project. So Joe Tzna from our work and office is connected to us and we have three and four Jalsa keys who were the community persons but it can directly with the farmers on how they developed and also made sure that the farmers know what they're doing and also explaining them that how they can implement these from last many years so maybe we could hear how views and also hit directly from some of our Jalsa keys. If you would allow me. Joe Tzna can you hear us. Yes, yes, yes, yes, we would like to hear and just before heading into that we're really glad that we have partners from Pakistan joining us for the webinar. Who are implementing the water productivity project in Pakistan which we have been doing in India. So we would like to hear their views as well sometime and yeah Joe Tzna. Yeah, Joe Tzna if you can tell us about the experience of working within the community enabling the farmers and how Jalsa keys work directly on ground. Yes, Jalsa keys have been working in the water productivity project and they have been monitoring the water use in these technologies. Actually all these technologies have been demonstrated in the field areas as I a the booty and intercropping. So just like he stole boss to monitor the level of water and irrigation during the past three years and as the results we had analyzed it has been noticed that 25% of water savings has been 23 to 25% water saving has been experienced through these practices. So Jalsa keys other than this water monitoring part they have created water and environment groups in the region of the NANITAR district where our project is being is going on. So the water and environment main purpose is to monitor and maintain the water infrastructure and aware community members towards water use. Yeah, in fact, for everyone we have been successfully able to mobilize and train 4500 farmers in a project. And how this word of mouth works among the farmers community is that when someone will age or say a particular block is being trained or being told about what is happening. It's slowly spreads among the other farmers and again what Laoko was talking about that if you present them with a lucrative business model, which is that if they're producing water efficient or maybe SRP standards rise that can be easily exported and given at a good price. If I am correct, okay. Yes. Absolutely. Well, since we're done with the, what the speakers have to say we're still one question left I would request a battle. partners in Pakistan if they want to. And there's online questions as well like what are the low cost technology that can be adopted by farmers without even increasing costs. If you would like to go ahead into answers because it's. Here, and then we can add into questions. So Ali has joined us from Pakistan. I like a new heroes. He's among the. Gapro partners I think there's some technical error in the country. Anyway, let's go ahead. And take answers one questions one by one. So, can drip irrigation system be using body cultivation. That's something reoccurring question and I think Dr. So he would like to give your opinion. So, yes, definitely there has been a lot of work done of using drip, you know, in rice. I'm familiar with the work was done in Haryana also in Karnal. Work was done in Modi program also work was done. However, there's another question that can be kind of save water without additional investment, you know, so that's kind of the scenario that when it come to the paddock cultivation, there's initial investment with the drip and the technology is still kind of settling. I'm speaking on my perspective that from its it's definitely there is a research done but for adoption of farmer, it's still a bit expensive. So that now the many, many private companies are working on low cost drip irrigation system. But the adoption for drip is still low in very low in rice because they don't see kind of the output against the investment. So the marginal cost is very high while in a lot of rain fed area in Uttar Pradesh, we have found from there, they have started to use this low cost drip irrigation in the dry season for growing vegetables. And there's a like it's very high profitable system. So it all depends on as a technology, it's excellent. But when farmer pick a technology, it's not only from technology perspective, they look it from different lens. So and that this depends on the whole system that what kind of system you have. And then whether drip is a potential choice for you or not. Yeah, yeah. Of course, in fact, they have been we have been the project which will be working in Haryana. There have been discussions whether we could implement drip irrigation in paddy cultivation and see if it can work there. But we're also considering the factor that it has been done before but in different kinds of atmosphere and also the soil. And I'm skeptical about if the kind of soil will make any difference because hilly areas will be different in comparison to maybe areas like Haryana. So no, it depends on there are two different things. One is when you schedule irrigation and how you schedule irrigation, whether you use drip or you use flood, that is how when is interval and when will take care of soil type. So when in drip irrigation, you consider the evapotranspiration. So evaporation is from the soil transpiration is from the plants. So you consider that one and you schedule the irrigation. But my my simple kind of question or suggestion to farmers and I'm thinking more like a farmers being on up in Haryana like if farmers are at least some progressive farmer are starting to think for drip. So which means they are only thinking to dry their paddy field. If they can dry their paddy field with surface irrigation, they can save a lot. I'm not saying that you know, drip is good. It can further increase the saving. But in terms of what low hanging opportunity which we have with us is saving this water which we are pumping from the groundwater. And that is really really kind of alarming the situation in Punjab and Haryana. So first, I think the big message is that if they believe drip is good, that's mean rice can be grown as like other cereals like wheat. So they can change it in their surface irrigation system also and then it's a step change then they can adopt probably drip at later stage. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you Dr. Sudeer. And of course, what you said, definitely can be done. So this question which is a bit polluted with just giving the gist is really that what are the policy level initiatives that can guide water stewardship at a multi level so it can be implemented. And really what the question is trying to understand is what kind of policy changes required when water stewardship can be implemented very well in all like in regional setting in a state level setting or say a national and even international setting. If Lauki would like to comment and maybe later Dr. Sudeer would give his own opinion on it. So let's not let's say the expert of course in the policy part, because this is, I think maybe Shamu you even might be yourself able to answer. Of course, like having improved policies, having incentives for rice growers is essential. So I spoke earlier about the enabling environment. There are some changes in other regions where the government might have incentives for collecting rainwater for providing subsidies for using drip irrigation. That's one rule. Then of course, also policies in place where maybe there might be a restriction of farmers using water in Pakistan their debates whether actually water should be paid by farmers. So that depends on the context of course. Yeah, yeah. But since you are someone who can speak for the market, I would like to know your views and what capacity markets can influence the policy. What kind of changes can be done from your end? For example, the points raised before was how they can increase price when we are working with SRP or something. Yeah, so if we talk about premiums, as Mars, we need high quality basmati. So we always pay for a quality premium. If farmers, so that already helps farmers to increase their income. Then we of course, we work with our suppliers who have agronomists who provide coaching to farmers. So every two weeks, they will receive guidance how to better grow the rice, which also increased yields by 15%. Of course, we also work on improving, let's say, better markets. So market route to market, transport, lowering transport costs. And then of course, if they grow SRP rice, we won't expect we pay a premium like what they do in organics, which we would rather see by all the interventions that farmers can benefit by growing rice in a more sustainable way. Yeah. And if I can add to the lucky point in terms of incentivize farmers for kind of climate smart practices, one of the one of the debate which is going on is on the incentives to farmers for carbon credit, which has been already started in investment world, but in Asia it is not introduced. And there has been, and this is at macro level at country level and country hold different kind of funds. One is which they can access is green climate funds, which can be can circulate down for to provide additional incentive for reducing the water footprint and carbon footprint. So as you know that rice is one of the major source of methane emission. So it can be sometimes direct sometime indirect. So if they they use the water efficiently, they not only save water, but they also reduce the global warming potential. People of Haryana know that what is happening in Delhi in winter, you know, so there's a lot of work need to be done in terms of how we do how we improve that practices. But more importantly, what what is the pull mechanism and that I think we need to think out of the box to incentivize farmers through premium rice, sporting price, or through these new incentive mechanism of carbon footprint. Yeah, yeah. Thank you so much, Dr. Sudee for adding your reviews and of course methane emissions are very important side effects of global price and if we are contributing towards not generating that kind of an emission into the atmosphere considering Delhi is an India's pollution level that will be a good advantage in terms of the logical contribution from the farmers end. But that this consumption always comes to me as it from off from you know putting my feet in a farmer's shoe is that why is that everything but don't know me, why do I have to need to make all the difficult choices because essentially what matters to me is growing and just getting the better price. So if you would like to comment on that. I will now give you a few. I would not say it's always about the price it's more the what we say the more crop per acre so productivity that that's actually key one. Also what we see a lot in the system that a lot of rice growers are dependent on the middleman to have low to have loans to need to pre finance their input costs. And that actually is a huge burden on the on the final net income from rice. So we now might be working more on pre finance with which can reduce 20% of their financial of their input costs which are spent by paying 14 to 24% of taxes. So rather just having the premium discussions I would rather go in this route thinking about pre financing dependency on middleman and whether we can also play a role in this. I'm keen to hear because I know it's very challenging as a lot of rice growers also need middleman as they provide a bank, not only for agriculture but also for education and other other let's say loans as well. Yeah. Thank you. Okay, I think that I think one of the participants with us as Dr. said they've seen was directed at IC ID international organization for irrigation and drainage. Maybe he would he would be an expert person to add comments on how changes can be done at a policy level. Dr. said if you would like to add to a discussion. If you would unmute yourself you can hear you. Yes, Dr. said they can't hear you. Yeah. Maybe I don't want to spoil the party but this morning I was reading the newspaper and interestingly there is a study by if the international food policy research institute, which says that the crop burning in Haryana Punjab alone costs us $30 billion per year to the Indian economy. And I don't know. I think that's a very that's that's a number which is very close to the total agricultural exports of India. Basically the Punjab Haryana reason is not the ecological zone for rice farming. And it was introduced because of the background anger them, which provided sufficient water. So people says to the cash crops like the Basmati rice and which is an export commodity. So maybe I have been studying this problem for the last two three years. And it seems that Punjab and Haryana receives only 40% of the monsoon rain that the West Bengal and the north eastern part of India which are more suitable for rice farming. And I don't see any research which gives a direction that how we can grow flagrant rice like Basmati in the northeast parts of India, which receives adequate monsoon rainfall. And in the Punjab Haryana region, I'm not against technology. I mean, I'm an engineer myself. And the drip and all these things can always make the water use efficiency much higher. But should we not be practicing something which is ecro ecologically or ecologically sustainable in the long run? That's that's my question to the experts here. Of course, there is a need for improving improving the economy of farmers, improving their income. But are there other ways which we should we should think about or there are other options policy options, which can incentivize the shift in farming practices, making it more ecologically sustainable in the long run? Yes. Thank you, Dr. Sade for sharing your views. I know we are short of time, but we have two questions which are still left unanswered. If you could keep it on the table now. The first one is how can vice water stewardship affect the quality and quantity of the agricultural produce. So essentially what is the benefit of water stewardship? So if you would like to hear on it, if Dr. Sadeen would say some. So basically when we are seeing about whenever we talk about water saving, people sometimes take it as like we are cutting off significantly. It's there's a difference between water requirement of crop versus what applied to the crop. And they are basically all about the intelligence about like how much water need to be applied. I want to quickly also make the point about what Sadeen was saying that I also believe in terms of the whole window of operation, thinking about how you can make decision based on your ecological condition and based on your water availability. So you are the sum of the like I know the work which Mark's food is doing their best management practices that the climate smart practices which will not affect your quantity that may improve your quality, but they will definitely not affect your quality. So it's win-win situation which basically we are talking here rather than reducing quantity and quality. Yeah, absolutely. It makes also a lot of sense because if we are conserving water and managing water, not only are we making an ecologically better choice, but we're also in terms of the market making a better opportunity as raised by now Okay, that how premium is also being paid by companies and for that matter I know that Mars has been paying premiums, LT foods and other market leaders also paying premium for better maintained rice. Just this last question which is being left unanswered is what is whatever low cost technology is that can be adopted by farmers without increasing cost if Again, I think it depends on I always go back to that what are the what are the conditions rather than saying that this technology can be can fit very well to you. We have seen a very, very high impact and again, they was talking about this if we study and another if we study in eastern Uttar Pradesh where the early planting of wheat followed by early planting of sorry early planting of rice followed by early planting of wheat was able to make significant change in water productivity because they were using rain efficiently. So it's not always that you need to try a new rocket. It's it's sometime it's the decisions which you make around the production system. There are a series of technologies which can be adopted but again I would come back to that it all depends on what are the conditions and accordingly we can we can suggest the appropriate technology. Thank you so much Dr. Sudeep for sharing your time and your use with us. I think we just ending the webinars already 332 and due to some internet problem we also don't have a low key with us as of now. So first of all I would like to thank everyone for sharing their views and the participants from Hadyana, Uttarak and Pakistan and different parts of the country.",
