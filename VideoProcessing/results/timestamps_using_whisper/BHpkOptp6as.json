When we learned that, you know, you add fertility to the soil and you take care of the soil health, you grow bigger plants and that means that the plants are taking up more carbon out of the atmosphere and fixing it into their bodies, which is exactly what all the green energy folks are telling us is what we need to do, right, is to sequester more carbon.",
