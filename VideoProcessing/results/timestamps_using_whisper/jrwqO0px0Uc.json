  "text": "Welcome to Global Argo Commodities. We would like to take this opportunity to share with you brief insights on our global supply chain process, showing you how we bring pure and nutritious pulses to customers of India produced in U.S. farms. Once the harvesting is complete, our growers bring peas, lentils, and beans to our Chester Montana facility from their farm. We all know that farmers work hard, and they put their best of the best, i.e. 100%, in growing this unique high-quality pulse crops. Our job then is receive the same with care, process and pack them with care, and ship it with care. After being processed and packed at one of our U.S. facility, pulses get loaded in rail cars right at our production facility, and then it travels to the port in the United States. Once they arrive at the port, they are trans-loaded into containers and loaded into the steamship lines. Once they are on board of steamship lines, the first milestone of export step and compliance is complete, which involves more than 23 compliance processes from Food Safety to export compliance, which already has higher standards of expectation, and they are all being met with our each and every export shipment from the United States. Container then arrives other side of the ocean and goes through import clearance at the port of entry. Our product is cleared at port of import. Once it goes through their custom clearance process, it travels to temperature-controlled warehouse and thereby completing second check of food safety and import compliance standards of the country of import. From warehouse, our products travel to retail stores. Consumer can now enjoy our pure and nutritious premium pulses, which comes not only in unique double-zipped stand-up pouch, but also they are earth and environmental friendly and are recyclable. It's right for our pulses and our world. When you buy American Top-notch pulses, know that you are doing your part of contributing to the earth as growing pulses are not only good for soil and water saving, but also for human nutrition. The creation of sustainable, lifelong, unique global supply chain process of from U.S. farms to world market, all under one umbrella of network of partners, has resulted in receiving highest federal honor by our leadership team at the White House ceremony on the May 18th of the year 2015 with the U.S. President's E-Award for Excellence in making a significant contribution in five areas of our operation with innovation, measurable impact, sustainable impact, economic growth, and job creation. It requires combination of efforts and initiatives to make things happen in global supply chain, our pulse processing facility investment in Montana, U.S. state's investment in from-state lab to research activities, along with growers investment, U.S. agriculture system as a whole, U.S. logistics system, along with great infrastructure and the hard-working men and women behind these operations, our essential drivers of the American economy and American agriculture, in today's increasingly interconnected world. Not only ties between government and businesses have never been more important, but also commitment to look after our growers who are at the starting point of global supply chain. All of us here today share a common goal. We want to see the United States and the entire world co-generate sustainable prosperity and implement policies that create jobs and economic growth for our citizens and growers. But our governments cannot do this alone, as we all know. Partnership with private sector leaders, the people who actually build companies, make investments, and create jobs is essential to good policymaking. We need people like Global Argo Commodities and its great team, who are not only investing locally, but also globally. Not only they are thanking growers of America, but especially all stakeholders directly or indirectly, while inviting other stakeholders to be part of this joint mission to make a difference. To summarize, in this ongoing journey to make a difference, our time and energy are focused in this four areas. Respect the growers, support the communities, maximize value, develop market. Beans and pulses are a powerhouse of nutrition. They are among the oldest recorded crops in civilization and are an almost perfect food. In many cultures, they are a main form of nutritional sustenance, and with addition of a rice or grain form a complete protein during digestion. Beans and pulses are a vegetarian's best friend and foundation of modern diet. By eating pulses, you are also helping mother earth, because growing peas and beans takes a lot less water than almonds or dairy milk. Eating beans and pulses is an easy way to lower your carbon footprint. Eat more pulses and nourish your life. You can learn more about our work performed on both sides of the ocean at www.globalagco.com Learn about our consumer awareness efforts at www.pulsehealth.in and order your healthy pulses today online at www.americantopnotch.com You can enjoy our pure and nutritious AT&P pulses every day at your doorsteps anywhere in India.
