  "text": "Good afternoon. This is my name is Henry Neufeldt. I'm head of the Climate Change Unit at the World Agroforestry Center, ICRAF, in Nairobi, in Kenya. And I welcome you very much to this discussion forum organized by ICRAF together with FAO. And while we start going through a quick round of introductions, I hope that there will be more people coming in so that we take as much time as we can for discussions afterwards. The title of this session is called Using Climate Smart Technologies to Scale Up Climate Smart Agriculture and Forget the Practices. It's a bit of a tautology and I apologize. Climate Smart Agriculture has had quite a bit of a, let's say, it's been a very shiny kind of brand coming up. It's managed to unite sort of the development, the agriculture and the climate change communities under one brand. And in doing so, it's raised a lot of expectations. Term has been around for about four or five years. There are a couple of publications that have been put forward around climate smart agriculture, what it really is, what it could be, and still we lack, we still do lack a bit of an understanding of what it could actually do. And this session here is also meant to shed a bit of light on that question. There has been a global alliance for climate smart agriculture which was launched recently at the Climate Change Summit in September in New York. There was also, there's also an African alliance for climate smart agriculture and we will also talk about these two new institutions and what they can potentially deliver in resolving issues around food security, adaptation and mitigation. So let me just quickly introduce our speakers. First, we have Alexandre Maybeck who is a Senior Policy Officer on Agriculture, Environment and Climate Change in the Office of the Assistant Director in general within the FAO. Then our second keynote speaker is Todd Rosenstock who is an agroecologist with ICRAF and he investigates how smallholder agriculture affects the environment and society. And then we have panelists here sitting next to me. We have here, sorry, where is she? I'm sorry, I can't get the name right in Guenya. I think she's a manager for communications and knowledge at Fanarpan, the Food, Agriculture and Natural Resources Policy Analysis Network with 21 years of experience in policy research and advocacy. Then we have Martin Boilya, he's the head of the Comprehensive Agriculture, Africa Agriculture Development Program, CATUP, within NEPAD and finally, last but not least, Austin Thibu. He's been working as a Land Resources Conservation Officer at Malawi's Ministry of Agriculture Irrigation and Water for over 10 years and he's also the FAO focal point for economics and policy innovations for CSA in the EPEC program. And then we will have Richie Ahuja who's sitting here in front. He is an expert in business development strategies and spearheads, the Environmental Defense Fund's engagement in Asia. He will be repertoring, he will give us a short summary at the end of the session. So without losing any more time, I'm going to ask Alexandre to say a few words about what climate smart agriculture is, some backgrounds, opportunities and challenges. And then we'll hear what Todd has to say about climate smart agriculture, a panacea or a propaganda. Okay, please, Alexandre. So I will very briefly introduce or reintroduce for those of you who already know what climate smart agriculture is. The way we understand climate smart agriculture in FAO, which can be slightly different from some of the things that are around more and more. And just extremely briefly giving examples because examples is probably the best way to understand what climate smart agriculture could mean. So once again, I agree with you, you know, agriculture has to address a triple challenge, more food in quantity, quality and diversity everywhere for everyone, adapt to climate change and contribute to mitigate climate change. The important point I think is that this triple challenge has to be seen at various scales, global, local and household. And we always need to keep in mind the various scales when you look at systems and what can be their contributions to climate smart agriculture. Growing demand all over the world due also to diet changes, but especially in some countries and many of these countries which are already food insecure and which will be very, very important to the climate smart agriculture. And I think that's a good point. And I think that many of these countries which are already food insecure and which will be the most affected by climate change and globally worldwide FAO estimates that production has to increase by 60%. Very briefly, main effects of climate change on agriculture production, a decrease of production in certain areas, a change in the geography of production between countries and inside countries and also and especially an increased variability of production. So the impacts on food and nutrition security have been well described in the HLP report 2012 and now in the IPCC report recently released with impacts on the most vulnerable countries and the most vulnerable people mainly. And with impacts on food security and nutrition which are much more than just decreasing yields, decreasing yields and the consequences of decreasing yields, changes of the geography of production and so vulnerable countries having to import and price volatility and the combination of all these effects. So agriculture can also contribute to mitigate and the way we see it in FAO given the fact that agriculture has to produce more is to understand mitigation as a reduction of emissions per kilo of output. Globally having emissions increasing less than production and also enhanced agricultural soil carbon sinks which means sinks above and underground. So the concept has first been introduced in 2010. It's with the title of a brochure that FAO prepared for the Hague conference. One, so it's amazing how the word is now all over the place probably because this idea that we need to address various objectives at farm level, at country level and globally is really needed. And also one other important point about the climate smart culture approach is that it is not only practices or systems but also systems from an agronomic point of view but also the policies and institutions and the finance which are necessary to enable these changes. So it's really the three of them. To a certain extent, I don't know what is a climate smart technology. I'd rather think about climate smart systems. And when you try to take the three objectives together, food security, adaptation and mitigation, globally what we want to do is more resource efficient systems and more resilient systems. But be also careful to what we want to mean by resource efficient systems. It's not only more crop per drop, it's also more income per drop, more jobs per drop in the countries where agriculture is the main source of jobs and income for the population. Which means that it is very country local system specific. The way you imagine the technologies and the way they are integrated in a system. And globally what we think is that the trade offs are not really between food security and mitigation or food security and adaptation but rather between increasing resource efficiency and increasing resilience. And this is where you have to look at trade offs and synergies. An important point which is why I was insisting on the various levels in the system is that we need to increase the general resilience of food systems which means the physical resilience, environmental but also the economic and social resilience of the system. One of these dimensions being able to compensate for a certain time but not for a very long time. But for instance social protection can help farmers resist physical shock, avoid them selling all their livestock for instance and enable them to recover afterwards. But resilience has also to be seen at various levels each level being able to compensate for another. The resilience of a household depends on the fact also on the fact that they are diversified sources of income but also it can be compensated by social protection for instance. Trade can play a role to a certain extent provided that there is income. So that's why I insisting on the need to understand how the various systems relate one to another. Household to the farm, the farm to the landscape, the farm to the food chain and all of that constitutes various food systems. So really very quickly and you'll hear much more about it after me. Understanding climate smart agriculture has to be done on the ground in the field in real systems. So these are just examples of a brochure you'll found downstairs where we tried to look at the various dimensions of the impact of a technique. In other words and to come back to the title of my presentation, we believe that there are opportunities to have climate smart systems more efficient and more resilient. But the challenge is to be able to properly measure the various impacts of the techniques both environmentally, economically and socially and in various time frames. And these are very different according to the system. It's not the same if you introduce Uria deep placement in Bangladesh where jobs are very low-cost and you need more jobs. And in China for instance where labor is much more costly so you need mechanized systems. And the impact on food security will be totally different in the various systems. And very often what happens is that which is where climate smart agriculture makes a change, we've introduced a technology for a precise objective and we measure that precise objective. We have the baseline on water and we measure how water is used. Very often we don't have the impact on economics, on livelihoods, on income, on social issues, on gender sensitivity extra. So these are some cases where we have them. Sustainable grazing for better livelihoods in China. This is an interesting project because in the beginning it was introduced as a mitigation project to increase carbon sinks. But in fact it is totally transforming the systems and the livelihood of the people and it's much more of food security and adaptation project with our carbon finance component but it is this carbon finance component which began triggering the institutional changes. You'll hear probably more about this after one. Insisting also on the importance of genetic diversity just as an example of things that we need in order to be able to react to uncertainties. And this is another very important dimension of climate smart agriculture when we say increasing resilience we mean resilience to everything because we do not know exactly what are going to be the changes in 30 or 40 years in whatever area. Landscape approach is also a key one. I've already mentioned that one and I will stop here to leave the floor to my colleague. Thank you. So what I'm going to be talking about today is trying to answer, ooh it's cut off. Hopefully not all of the slides are like that. What I'll be talking about today is trying to answer this simple or somewhat complicated question. Climate smart agriculture or propaganda or panacea. And here in like this title slide this question is incredibly complicated especially for climate smart agriculture because with climate smart agriculture what we're talking about in many cases is multiple dimensions. We're talking about multiple practices here you can see it's agroforestry, intercropping, conservation agriculture, improved cook stoves as well as multiple outcomes. So we're looking at nutrition security, we're looking at poverty alleviation, we're looking at natural resource management. And so how do we even begin to think about and begin to analyze this type of complexity? I would tend that it's this type of complexity that is largely made that in helped spur the debate about whether or not climate smart agriculture can actually achieve some of its ambitions. And it's because of this we need to pull back from some of the sort of idiosyncratic case studies and try to get to the real big issues that we can then start to bring these topics to scale. So over the next about ten minutes or so I'm going to be telling you about the initial results from a meta-analysis that we've been conducting about specifically to try to answer the question of how do farm management practices affect food security at an adaptive capacity in mitigation? And so I was sort of inspired to take on this topic largely because I was seeing things like this in the news. The Global Alliance for CSA wants to reach 500 million smallholder farming households. The African CSA Alliance and the NEPAD Vision 25x25 want to reach 25 million households by 2025. This type of effort will require a Herculean change in how we as scientists and we as development practitioners actually implement agricultural development. And so but the real question here is what is the evidence base? All of this type of development initiatives is fundamentally based on the assumption that we have evidence for that improved practices CSA will improve food security, adaptive capacity and mitigation objectives well and also it's based on the fundamental assumption that we have some idea about the synergies and trade-offs between these different components. And so what have we been doing so far? We've been trying to make a sense of essentially what is a pile of disparate literature. And so we've been doing a meta-analysis and a systematic review of 65 practices and 15 indicators. And so when I say practices we're not talking about the aggregate level of agroforestry. We're talking about things that farmers actually implement on the ground. Liguminous and intercropped agroforestry, deep placement of urea. Things that farmers would actually need that you can analyze individually and then also aggregate back up. When I talk about indicators, these are indicators of food security, adaptive capacity or mitigation for food security. We're looking at four main indicator categories ranging from income, productivity and such in terms of adaptive capacity. Obviously this is the hardest one. We're thinking about things like soil quality. We're thinking about gender differentiated labor. We're thinking about nutrient use efficiency, water use efficiency and things like that. Mitigation is a little bit more straightforward. Carbons sequestration, greenhouse gas intensity and the like. And so what we've done is essentially we utilize discipline-oriented keyword searches in the Web of Science database. And we came up with 144,000 candidate papers. And with the help of a small team of masters level students including Helena who's in the audience here today, we went through all 144,000 papers and tried to see how they matched our inclusion criteria. So here we were interested in whether or not they had information and data on a CSA practice and a non-CSA control as well as whether or not they took place in a tropical developing country. So from that 144,000 we narrated and reading those abstracts we narrated down to about 16,000 papers. And those papers we then downloaded the full text and further analyzed them to see if they met our inclusion criteria. That left us with 6,000 papers in which we had to actually extract data from that we thought were relevant to answering our main question which is climate smart agriculture or panacea or propaganda or in other words what is the evidence based behind climate smart agriculture. So far we've extracted data on about 20% of that. And so I'll be talking about that. Based on the numbers that we've already extracted we presume that in the end this database which will be hopefully ready by the Montpellier CSA conference if not a little bit later on in the year will have about 120,000 individual data points in it. And so if we just start to map where the studies have taken place to see where and how and what information is available these are the studies that we have. This is a random sample from our 1200 studies that we've already looked at where they are actually located on the map. And these studies have, they're talking about at least one indicator relevant for food security, adaptive capacity or mitigation. You see that it's a pretty good global distribution. But if you look a little closer you also see that there is some geographic clustering that you see that in western Kenya and maybe around Accra and Ghana. There's actually quite a number of studies that are in a relatively small location. So what does that mean for when we're trying to scale climate smart agriculture? Well what it means is or what it suggests at this point is that we may have a biased data set that our information base may be inaccurate to be able to say that this type of practice will have this type of outcome in a new location. When we then go to studies that have two practices or two, that address two components of CSA like food security and adaptation in the same study, the size of the data set reduces dramatically. We basically lose 60% of the studies and so why is that important? That's important because what we know from about 50 years of agricultural research and agricultural for development research is that a lot of time interventions are place based. So we can't presume that the types of interventions and the types of outcomes that we might see in one location are going to be able to be extrapolated to another location quite easily and so these synergies and trade-offs may not actually be transmissible. And lastly if we look at studies where we have all three indicators, probably given this projector you might not even see any up there but there's seven dots. So we basically reduced it to less than 1% of the studies looked at all three components of CSA in the same study. And this is important simply because it greatly reduces our ability to characterize what is normally thought of within Climates-Mount Agriculture which are these triple wins, these win-win-wins. When we start to look at the data and actually use common meta analytical techniques, so this is the food security response across multiple indicators for six different practices at different aggregated levels. And that sounds a little complicated but let me go into a little bit more detail. And so, wrong one. So this is an effect size. So an effect size measures the relative effect of the treatment to the control and so anything to the right of that red line is a positive effect, anything to the left of that line is going to be a negative effect. If it crosses that line it's not significantly different than zero and you can, you may have positive or negative control or negative effects. And so basically what you see here is that there's not only a wide variability for any given practice, for instance in agroforestry, but there are some clear winners, the use of inorganic fertilizer seems to be quite positive, the use of increasing protein in livestock feeds as well. The interesting part is that in most cases people are talking about Climates-Mount Agriculture at a very aggregate level. And so we're talking about agroforestry as climate smart. Well, as you can see in these top two panels, once you start disaggregating the data from agroforestry to actually leguminous agroforestry, the actual effect changes. And so I would argue that you would need to actually begin to think about it in this more disaggregate level when you are identifying things as climate smart. And lastly let's look quickly at some synergies and some trade-offs. And so this is just the synergies and trade-offs for the adaptation of food security indicators that are in a 130 random sample of 130 studies. So as you can see there's only 55 comparisons in that 130 studies, so that's back to the about 60% decline that I mentioned earlier. And everything in the red box in the lower left-hand corner is where you don't want to be. This is lose-lose. So about 6% of the studies showed that there were lose-lose effects between adaptation and food security. And the opposite corner, in CataCornia, there's about 32% of them showed that there were actually synergies. So this is what everybody is saying is possible with climate smart agriculture. But equally important, 60% of the studies that we looked at, and granted it is a small data set at this point, shows that there's equal or more likely chance of actual trade-offs between adaptation and food security than there are synergies. And so while today I just really focused on a very small amount of our initial data, the emerging trends seem to be so more clear that there's geographic clustering of the studies which would suggest that we have challenges in actually extrapolating the data. There is a likelihood that we will see trade-offs as much as we would see synergies, as well as that there's large variability amongst and between and within individual practices. Thanks. Okay, thank you. So before we go to some questions, we'll have another round of panelists giving their sort of views on what they've just heard, also just making some statements in regard to, let's say, the Alliance here. So let's start off with Martin and then Lamie and Austin in that order, and I'll ask you to be fairly brief so that we have as much time as possible for questions and answers where you can sort of elaborate more on any issues you might want to raise. Okay, so Martin, do you want to kick us off please? Thank you very much. Okay, yes, Sweke. Thank you so much, Mandorita. Yes, I'm going to be very brief, and thank you so much to the two presentations. I think they do give us very good scope in terms of the discussion. Now, and I pick it up from the key messages out of the two presentations and I would say, is it possible looking at what we've just heard in terms of what is climate smart agriculture? Is it possible then or is it correct to say that in fact, climate smart agriculture is just any good agricultural practices? Anything that is actually good and underlined the word good is going to give us productivity, food security, is going to give us adaptation, is going to give us mitigation value. And sometimes when you look back into what we have described and what we've known as good agricultural farming, when we say climate smart agriculture, are we saying anything different? What is new in this? And I start by saying that yes, in fact there is something new, there is something different. One of the first important issues that in dealing with and talking about climate smart agriculture, we want to go beyond just the issue of securing productivity. So this is more than just productivity issue. There is something that is actually very, very clear about the threats that climate change, all the opportunities that climate change bring on the whole spectrum and space and productivity and on the food systems. So you're looking at the everything that we're doing in terms of farming practices or what you call agriculture and look at how far is it going to support enhancing ability to deal with the new emerging trends and threats opportunities that are very specific to the occurrence of climate change, climate variability. And this again is about understanding the actual risks which are actually going, are very localised, is appreciating the actual opportunities that you attribute to that climate change. The second point I want to make is that when you look at climate smart agriculture in terms of what is different and in terms of those practices, it's actually that it's something that is compelling beyond, we talk about holistic, comprehensive approaches, but in climate smart agriculture we are seeing a very practical compere to look at agriculture, to look at farming in a very, very integrated holistic. And I like what the moderator was saying in the beginning that is more than just climate smart technologies, but that we look at climate smart systems because it's about practices, it's about policies and institutions, as mentioned, resources, but it's also about managing the trade-offs in terms of different constituencies, but also the trade-offs in time and space. So what are we doing today? Vis-\u00e0-vis what are the needs, requirements of future scenario. And the last and third point in terms of the practices of climate smart agriculture is actually the value and the one issue about climate smart agriculture is actually how much it should bring back the value, the benefits into the local circumstances, both in terms of environmental resilience, social resilience, but today, especially when you look at Africa, the issues, how do we support the communities to harness their resources, land and water, in terms of increasing access to economic or expanding economic opportunities and actually enabling them to move in that spectrum towards prosperity. Thank you. Thank you very much, Martin. We now have Fabiola Munoz-Doidero, who is the Executive Director of the National Forest and Wildlife Service, here as well. It's a pity she couldn't make it to us a little earlier because she missed the presentations, but I'll give her the chance of listening to the respondents so then she can make something out of that, and we'll have more chances to hear afterwards. Okay, well, thank you very much for coming anyway. It's been great to have you. Lammy, please. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. When I was being introduced, they said that I'm working for an organization where we're working in a policy space. I would like to throw that into the discourse of climate smart agriculture. I listened to the presentations and I also listened to the presentations before this session yesterday. What I'm seeing as a missing link, it's the enabling environment that we all agree that it's part of what will make our efforts for climate smart agriculture to be successful. I just want to share with you the experience that just we had with our organization where we did some scoping studies in 15 countries in Africa, Southern Africa and East Africa to see how the countries are actually responding in terms of the climate smart agriculture debates and also climate change. What we are seeing is that the countries do recognize that climate change is there. They also respond to the calls for climate change and most of the discussions are hosted by the ministries of environment. What we have seen with the ministries of agriculture is that out of the 15 countries that we did the scoping studies, there were about four or five where they have policies that speak specifically to climate smart agriculture. So as we discuss, I would like us to look at how we can actually accelerate really for the countries to have the enabling environment that will complement what is happening on the ground. So we find these junctures that on the ground there are a lot of experiences, there are a lot of practices that is happening but there is a gap between what is being practiced and what the policies are saying. So as we discussed, we need to also accelerate on that front. Thank you very much, Lamine. That's a very important point and Alexander already mentioned it that we need to look at the technologies that are very important. Austin, please, just give us your thoughts. Thank you very much, moderator. From the introduction, I think I'm the most still-end panelist here. I am from the extension side of all these practices. So I will focus my comment on what it takes to scale up climate smart agricultural practices. I like the matrix that Todd presented. I think it's four-dimensional but as we go out in the field, the matrix could become hundred-dimensional. When we are working with the farming communities, the issues of productivity, the coming issues of costs, the issues of resource saving, environmental issues or indicators, and also the institutional indicators that we have discussed in the presentation from FAO. So when we are at that level, we must make sure that all those indicators are satisfied and that's the main challenge that we face. In climate smart agriculture, we have observed that those practices, they do respond to as many of those indicators. And my suggestion to the meta study that we are conducting under aircraft is that we should have our own beyond the three indicators to satisfy what the farming communities need or what they expect from these practices. And finally, I would like to suggest that we have quick policy briefs to our decision making people, the politicians that crisply presents what we expect or what we suggest are the winning solutions to the challenges that the farming communities are facing because of the effects of climate change. Thank you. Thank you, Austin. And that's very important for us to talk about the question of scaling up. I think we should hear more about that. It's one thing to know the benefits in terms of adaptation mitigation and food security, but then another question altogether might be how can we reach these millions of farmers that Todd was already mentioning. Fabiola, do you want to say a few words with regard to climate smart agriculture and potentially your own experience here out of the country? I don't know. Good afternoon to all of you. I have to replace the minister in another session, so I can't get to mine. But one advantage is that part of the information shared with you today I had already seen it in another presentation with the colleagues of ICRAF and with people from SIFOR and others that we have been working on. And one of the, I would like to comment on three particular issues about climate smart technologies for agriculture that we hope can become environmentally smart. The first is the recognition of traditional knowledge, which is one of the essential points. I think we are very far from the issue of technologies that have been used in the past and technologies that are being used today, but that actually don't reach the level of being assumed, for example, by those that we make decisions. So this recognition of traditional knowledge that rescues those technologies that are appropriate and those culturally appropriate practices are one of the key elements. And this I'm not only saying this as Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. This would also have to be, for example, in the investment systems with the Ministry of Economy, it would have to be in social projects with the Ministry of Rural Affairs and Social Inclusion. It's really important to have a public policy. The second element that I think that if we're talking about the same matrix that I've seen at some time and that has been presented now, there are a series of good practices and possibilities that could also be converted in public policy, but that sometimes in the State we don't have, let's see, one of the things that has been talked about, the connection with those who are doing research. There is a link that we haven't been able to change yet, which is how we convert the results of the research into something that informs the public policy better. And there I think we have to promote a more intercultural dialogue between those practices and the public policy that promotes this more intelligent agriculture in practical issues. The practical knowledge of those who have finally investigated, have managed to prove it, and that now we should adopt it. And the third topic, and now I'm going to use a session in which, the session for which I couldn't be here, a thing that is being talked about right now with ministers from other countries, is the importance of being able to incorporate other sectors that influence the issue of agriculture or forest management, that are not just the Ministry of Environment nor the Ministry of Agriculture. So if we really want to change agriculture in the country, we would have to incorporate other actors who are also decision makers and who define public policy and who are not the traditional ones. Precisely in this discussion in which we were one of the topics that were discussed, it was well, what does the Ministry of Justice have to do for example? In a discussion like this one, or what does the Ministry have to do for example, of social inclusion and in reality they have a lot to see, because to give you simply an idea in Peru if an agriculture or if a community, a small one goes to an area and so illegally puts that wood in a truck and takes it the first control position will stop and it will start the wood and probably, ah, sorry ok and probably will denounce it and they will decommission the product that has been illegally cut, which is wood. But if an farmer does exactly the same thing, he retires the forestry of a room like this and puts corn and sells the corn no one will stop it on the contrary, because it is an agricultural product although it comes from an area that is deforested. So if the Ministry of Justice for example, which dictates many rules linked to these issues do not understand that change in politics it is difficult that we can also get from there an entry to sanction not the one that is being so illegally only, but the one that is being an agriculture that is not the the current one and that has to do with a education issue, there are several that come in here, so I think there is a level of articulation of public policy that is not yet being enough worked to achieve instruments that allow this agriculture climatically intelligent. Ok, thank you so much. I have lost presentation also. I think you added a very important element and gave some more sort of depth to the question of what contributes to enabling environments from the political perspective and I think that was very useful for our audience here. So we have quite a bit of time for questions and then so I would like to take two or three questions at a time and then we will give our panel an opportunity to respond. I have Jonathan here in the back Yes sir number two and we will take one more afterwards What? Go ahead Jonathan. My name is Jonathan Cornelius a question actually for Fabiola Can you introduce yourself please not the institution Ok sorry Henry, this is Jonathan Cornelius I am regional coordinator for World Agriforage Center based here in Lima Ok, a question for Fabiola Fabiola your interesting remarks about the need to close the gap between research and policy yeah and coincidentally possibly in our institutions of the CGI are we spend a lot of time thinking about theories of change and how our research can change what happens to its intended or what can change what our intended users do in this case how our research can change policy what I would like to ask you as a as a implementer and former of policy is to what degree the ultimate end users of research also have to come back down the chain of impact themselves and somewhere meet the the scientists as they try increasingly to work forwards in the chain of impact hope I'm being clear what I'm trying to say is that as researchers we are being asked to be increasingly accountable for our research being implemented for example in changing policies so what is the role of policy makers in also coming back maybe towards researchers and for the two of us together to construct that impact that we all want thank you okay please yes sir and then the lady behind him as well thank you I'm Doug Boucher from the Union of Concerned Scientists my question is for Todd the graph you showed had what to me was a striking paradoxical result which is that a very large quite impressive metanalysis from the World Agroforestry Center showed that there was no significant effect of agroforestry but you're only talking about the effects on food security what were the significant variables that affected mitigation you mentioned Fabiola although you said 5 Fabiola you only mentioned 3 but I'm going to make a comment that I made in the previous room regarding the subject of climate-intelligent agriculture for everything we're seeing we need a much more integral process you mentioned it yourself the articulation of sectors the public policies traditional knowledge and that's where the question came whether they are climate-intelligent agriculture because we better not advance towards climate-intelligent economies and that's what it's all about or development models that are climate-intelligent and how would we do all that how would we push all that because at the end of the day I think that the way out is what we're living now let's start with Fabiola and then I'll pass it on to Todd and anybody else who wants to say something to any of the other questions please feel free okay Fabiola ok, on the first question of Jonathan if I didn't understand it well the question is how to achieve that we have the politicians who make decisions in institutions this approach with the researchers I think that on both sides on the side of the investigation and the side of those who make decisions we should have a little more humility I was two days three days maybe in an event in the Pentagon in a table and then I told you the same thing that I'm going to tell you now that I do think it's very important that the investigation helps us make decisions and that all the decisions that we take hopefully in the National Forest Service and the Federal Forestry of Peru we take them with a technical support and that one thing that I was worried about is that we have launched a little competition of positions we have recruited like 30% of those positions and we have only been able to have one investigator and then the investigators don't want to enter the State and that's a problem and of course one of the answers that I got in that room was how easy the issue to solve this problem is that the politicians practically stop existing and the scientists are decision makers and of course when you hear that kind of thing just like I had that same discussion I don't know if you know but I'm a lawyer and you can say what a lawyer does of the National Forest Service of a country because in Peru right now we are in a reform process and my specialty is the public policy and then one of the reforms that we have to be able to do is how it is linked precisely to generate institutionality to link the investigation in a simple way with the State, the public policy and then the first thing that I think we all have to do is learn to respect the role complementary of the others and not look at us under the shoulder neither the politicians, nor the investigators nor the economists hopefully we would for example, more economists more financials involved in these issues and I think we all need each other and that leads me to combine the intervention of Karina and Jonathan in this sense the answer we will have today is an urgent answer because we don't have much time to make accurate decisions and decisions will be more accurate while more research we have as support while more scientific support we have and then there the question is if we only stay in agriculture and I think not precisely the topic here is how we enter with the example that I gave you from the Ministry of Justice but also how we enter from education, health energy and mines we are all from all sectors and I think that is the most important potential of these two days of work which is that look at the landscape but not only in the geographical or physical landscape but in this landscape we have here if I ask you for example, how many economists are here how many economists are here two right? how many agronomist engineers go a little better five how many sociologists two, three how many lawyers and you know how many lawyers define public policy in our countries but how many invite us if each of you from your biologist professions how many biologists are there aha right? and how many researchers are there aha look at you if each of you proposes to adopt a lawyer imagine the revolution that we could do but that is part of understanding that the world has changed and that we all need today looking at agriculture outside forest management and outside green economy it is a mistake we need it and we can discredit and I am sure we will have differences but the door is open to sit on the table and that is the great advantage of a space like the COP and this landscape forum ok thanks for this passion and statement and I think you are totally right I am not going to talk about everything see see Todd why don't you just respond to Doug's question I think it is an important question Doug follow up great I appreciate that I fail to see the paradox mostly because I am a scientist and I report with the data say and so this is the analysis that we have done so far on the limited data set what you see and what you saw in that graph is the variability in agarous forestry systems that are included there there is border planting, there is inter crop there is legumes there is timber species and all of that which is why you see such a wide such a wide range in the effect and so I would presume that before the end of the analysis when we have included more data that we would see a different effect how large that effect positive or negative I am not I can't it is hard for me to predict right now but I think we have a meeting of the 1200 papers the mitigation effects we haven't looked at those data yet do you want to say something about the question that Jonathan raised in the context of science and policy I think you might be able to add a few words from your perspective maybe put it in the context of the climate smart agriculture alliance yes thank you indeed that is an interesting issue and it does come up all the time in fact in the Africa alliance one of the work stream we have identified where we are saying we need to make a difference it is on the policy we have one on the policy stream and we have one which we are calling technical support and this is the appreciation of the fact that and I think in Africa you can say the politicians are coming quite a long way in respecting data respecting evidence and beginning to talk about facts and figures and the problem is that these facts and figures data is not existing in the form in the manner that they can actually use it at the moment and that is the problem we have so the issue in terms of research is actually how we can move and actually move very rapidly not just in terms of technology development but also support the politicians to answer the questions they need to answer in terms of real with the evidence with the objectivity that is desired and one of the things we are looking at actually as a matter of approach is that when you talk about climate smart agriculture and looking at science it is a very open space there is a lot we need to know but it is also clear that the climate smart agriculture we are talking about in fact as implied from the various discussions is not the same as manufacturing a kind of laboratory and then take it out on the road to be used the climate smart agriculture is going to be developed in situ is going to emerge within the road that you are using it so it is how we move in terms of the approaches in terms of research tools in terms of the accountability of what research delivers to actually bring them into the field working with the farmers working with politicians working with communities and actually it is also because it is not just a technical issue it is actually the political economy and those things will be critical in making a climate smart agriculture image the way we want to see it we have mentioned actually working with the sea calves we are working with fara and we are saying also that we need in fact just as much political economy research as we are doing on the hardware on the actual agronomical and technological practices moderator if you allow me just one more point I wanted also to say that when you look at the discussions on climate smart agriculture everywhere even in this today's of course it is being emphasized in terms of the comprehensiveness the integrated nature of it the holistic aspects but it is also linking to research to understand that I think we have to be careful that we do not end up with a very perfect creation that is unimplementable and actually the excellency of the description of climate smart agriculture is not going to come out of a laboratory it is going to come out of real practices in the field and I want to end by saying in fact in that sense that is why we need to listen more from what the farmers are doing what communities are doing and actually understand that if it is not broken don't fix it brilliant ok I saw I had you sir then I saw you first and I don't know if you were there so I have you three please introduce yourself please can we get a microphone no I saw this gentleman first he was already raising his hand I'm sorry thank you Doug Brown with World Vision International my question specifically to Todd but I think Alexander might be able to help with it as well your data surprised me a little bit in a way it was but I think it is partly because it is a made analysis and of course you are looking at studies that were designed to measure food or productivity impacts or at resilience impacts but they may not have measured the other ones and so they are dropped out when you sort of start comparing to so there is a limitation there I guess but I was looking at the grid the quadra here where you have the win-wins the lose-lose and then the mixed ones and I'm just trying to wonder I know when in the FAO source book we know there is a lot of practices listed there but not all equally climate smart some score better on two or three dimensions and others do so I'm wondering if you can characterize what's in the upper right quadrant versus what's in the lower upper left versus the lower right and what practices are dropping down to those things versus the ones which are clear win-wins okay and yes sir please now you have to go over again I'm sorry I think about two minutes to share how we have achieved climate smart agriculture and benefited in India yes sir so if you would try to be very concise yeah and also try to be I take two minutes and try to frame a question as well later on but first I would like to congratulate Todd for bringing out a very precise analysis of what is happening and what benefits have accrued and if this taken further then the world community will benefit now climate smart agriculture we started in Gujarat India about ten years back and we called it as a new extension approach it is prior to agriculture season it takes place in all villages together 18,000 villages team is led by agriculture extension administration agriculture scientist input dealer and market people and they go and meet the farmers at their doorstep provide them information what crops they should grow in next season based on prevailing situation three inputs are provided to farmer one is soil health analysis which I mentioned in the last session that what crops their soil will sustain based on the weather parameters second is what is market demand for the crops which crops they should select based on the market and where the quality inputs are available this is backed by water conservation measure at village level which is funded by the government with community participation so not a drop of water goes out 70% of our area is rain fed focus is on women farmers and rural youth and rural youth are trained to identify what are micro enterprises possibilities based on local agriculture produce so it's a comprehensive approach takes place every year prior to agriculture season and what has happened in Gujarat India and which is now going on all over the country the soil health card approach and everything is that we had a minus 2% to plus 2% growth rate we have now reached 9% growth rate in 10 years at constant price so almost income of farmers have doubled and on par with non farm sector so if we follow this approach in a comprehensive manner there will be less social turmoil which are happening in many parts of world and people are trying to grab justice by brutality thank you okay thank you very much for this comment and I'm going to ask your intervention first please my name is Talindas Mtoonsi and I'm with Fana Pan my question is basically on coordination taking into account that CSA is at a global level and also we have got the CSA alliance at the African level how are the coordination modalities do we have an implementation framework where monitoring and evaluation framework is at a global level that resonates with other regions and we're following a bottom up approach in terms of coming up with those kinds of frameworks and the other question is on the CSA technologies do we have context specific CSA toolkit or technologies that we have to really say this is what we call climate smart agriculture always just the three indicators that we showed here that indicate on food distribution do we have practical context specific tool kits that are talking to different equotypes in the different regions that we are operating thank you thank you very much for this excellent question so what I would suggest is that Alexandre and Austin you could try to respond to the Indian gentlemen's point which I think was very context specific and I think it makes sense to sort of look at the question from a larger perspective is it transferable can it be done elsewhere you know what are the constraints and because we talk about systems that are context specific we need to make sure that they actually fit somewhere else and then Todd if you answer the Doug's question of course and Rami I don't know if you want to step in also looking at the questions of coordination potentially so Alexandre the first thing is that which is why I was saying that we're a bit an easy with this idea of climate smart technologies and climate smart practices because it is very context dependent it's ecosystem dependent but it's also socially dependent it depends how the communities are organized it depends how the policies are supporting it depends on the economics so from our perspective what we need is having more examples of what has worked or what has not worked with the various impacts and why it has worked or why it has not worked what what what is the context which is around the object the ultimate objective would be I don't know if it would be toolkits but information tools knowledge platforms colleague how you want it to be so we have a perspective where practitioners or actors at whatever level from governments, policy makers of development practitioners or farmers could go and have a look at situations which are as comparable as possible to theirs or one aspect of the situation this is this event is part of it the huge work done by Todd is an essential element of that but there is still a lot to be done but probably one the biggest from my perspective the biggest mistake to avoid would be to say oh that's a solution just implement it top down this doesn't wouldn't work and not only it wouldn't work but there is a risk of having wrong impacts in another dimension I think one of the important thing with climate climate is that we say in the beginning you have to look at the three things you do not necessarily need to address them at the same level the win-win-win thing is a myth maybe but you need to look at the three and you need to know what damage you are doing in another dimension when you want to do something and that's probably true for all natural resources issues or even development issues and maybe I'll and this probably is part of why the quarter and what so many trade off because it's not the same everywhere but probably you'll be more able to answer that one. Thank you very much I'll start from where Alexander has stopped on the two kids so now in some areas we are trying to draft some two kids some messages on climate smart agricultural practices I'll give an example the epic projects in Vietnam Zambian Malawi where we have looked at we have started looking at the trade off in terms of mitigation all those triple wins mitigation food security and adaptation and we have isolated some examples or some practices that are fitting within those win-win-win we are also doing some institutional mapping on how to move on or outscale these practices and we have we are also doing some policy harmonization I think my colleague indicated that in some areas or some regions we have a gap between the environmental sector and the agricultural sector from policy and institutional setup on how to handle the issue of agricultural practices that are climate smart from my colleague from India that's a very good example that he has indicated and I'm happy that a few months ago I was in Mahastra and I observed the same best practices only what they were calling the advisory services within Mahastra they were able to combine the agricultural budgets the hydrometh services the weather focus the available water for irrigation the onset of the rinse and the the prevailing economic and social conditions, the markets the agroecological conditions the soil fertility to precisely advise the farming community on how they can modify or improve their farming system and I really agree with him that it has really improved the productivity of the farmers but also the resilience of the farming system",
