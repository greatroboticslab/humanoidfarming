  "text": "Yeah, thanks for the introduction and thanks to the organizers for inviting me. It's really pleasure to be speaking here today Yeah, I'll be talking about the hidden forces on the ground soil biodiversity for agricultural production and environmental integrity so I think we all know that there's organisms living in the soil and It's actually a huge variety of creatures living there and they are all doing things so they are Eating organic matter. They're feeding on plant material. They're feeding on each other and They bury it through the soil. They poop in the soil. They eat each other's poop. So there's this whole complexity of things happening and Together these actions result in certain ecosystem functions and These ecosystem functions can result in ecosystem services that we as humans also depend on so Solid organisms are important for organic matter decomposition. For example, they can improve soil structure and water infiltration They can store nutrients release nutrients Yeah, improve plant nutrition provide pest control and so on However, it's been increasingly increasingly shown in recent years that with increasing land use intensification a lot of these organisms are actually negatively affected so they get reduced in their diversity and abundance and Can even go locally extinct in certain fields And now the big question is if we lose these organisms Do we also lose these important functions that we depend on or if we phrase it more positively? If we promote organisms and find ways to promote these organisms and soil can we actually improve our ecosystem functioning and get more sustainable cropping systems so to put this in a theoretical framework when we look at a Natural ecosystem we have usually relatively high plant diversity We have rich and diverse soil life and we have very efficient internal resource recycling processes that keep this system Alive over long time spans so it's a very sustainable system But it's not very productive in agricultural terms when we compare this to an intensive agricultural system we often have huge amount of external resource inputs you have crop monocultures and So life is not doing so well So we have less well developed internal resource recycling processes and we also have much more losses of nutrients for example To the groundwater or as gases emissions into the atmosphere So these systems are very productive, but they're not sustainable So ideally we want to combine aspects of both to create a sustainable system where we have less External inputs required we have an intermediate Diversity on the field and we have a rich and abundant soil life So we have very well developed resource recycling processes and little losses to the environment So we have a productive and sustainable system but first of all We we have to answer the question how important are these soil organisms actually for ecosystem functioning and To find that out I formed an experiment a couple years back in so-called lysimeters So lysimeters are basically big pots Placed in the outside and free air and each lysimeter can hold a soil volume of 230 liters We filled these lysimeters with sterilized soil and then added two different soil biological treatments one we called enhanced soil life treatment containing soil organisms smaller four millimeters and The other one was to reduce soil life treatment that only contains organisms smaller 11 micrometers. So basically microorganisms but nothing else These lysimeters have a hole in the bottom where the water running through the soil profile can be collected and later analyzed for nutrients and We also performed gas measurements of nitrous oxide and and to gas into the air to look at nutrient losses, so we planted a mace crop in these lysimeters and Let them grow to maturity. So they've got big mace plants as you would find it in the field And when we look at the data, so we see these dark bars are the enhanced soil life treatment and the light gray bars Is the reduced soil life treatment? What we found was that with reduced soil life crop yields When we're significantly lower and we found a similar pattern for nitrogen uptake and for phosphorus uptake the effects were strongest so actually it was More than half the phosphorus uptake with reduced soil life Looking at the nutrient losses. We found the opposite pattern. So with reduced soil life nitrogen leaching losses Went up massively and the same was the case for nitrous oxide emissions and important greenhouse gas and Also into another gas being emitted was massively increased So this study shows that soil organisms have a great potential to enhance the nutrient use efficiency and support crop growth in cropping systems, but it is a model system and actually most knowledge we have about soil biodiversity and how it affects Ecosystem functions is derived from such model systems that often use sterilized soil. So we have to re-add organisms and Yeah, we actually do not know how well these results transfer to the real world to an agricultural field So I was trying to get closer to that and get some some some answers in real-world settings I did a postdoc in California at UC Davis and There I went to 30 different field sites differing in management intensity So I selected 10 grassland sites and 10 more sustainable tomato rotations that received cover crops over the winter and Composed applications and then 10 intensive tomato rotations that only receive minimal fertilizers and synthetic pesticides and so on so I expected reduced abundance and diversity of soil organisms with increasing management intensity and So I went to all these sites and we Sampled and analyzed the soil communities and we also extracted soil cores from all these fields placed them in a greenhouse planted tomato crops there and Yeah, measured nutrient leaching losses and gas emissions and looked at crop yield also So when we look at the data for the soil communities obviously the grasslands on the left and Intensive systems on the right. So we found that with increasing management intensity Indeed most parameters for soil organisms showed a negative trend the more intensive the system was the less diverse and less abundant organisms there Then we related this data to some ecosystem functions that we measured. So here we see the relationship on the left with microbial biomass in the soil and Tomato yield we found a significantly positive relationship. So with more microbial biomass. We had higher tomato yields Similarly, we found for the more number totes we had in the soil. We also found higher crop yields Looking at nutrient leaching losses We found some relationship with the ratio of fungi to bacteria in the soil. So the higher this ratio was the lower the nitrogen leaching losses there which is something that has also been shown before and hypothesized that Fungi dominated system has a more close sustainable nutrient cycling compared to a bacteria dominated system So yeah, taking together this study could partly confirm what we found in a model system, which was very nice And then I performed a different study focusing on a bascula mycorrhizal fungi or short AMF We heard about mycorrhizal fungi before Savarina was managed mentioning them and Yeah These fungi form symbiotic relationships with the majority of land plants and including many major crops like maize wheat Potato tomato and so on and they are Mostly known for improving plant growth and nutrition. There are also other benefits that have been shown to be Provided by AMF. So the way this symbiosis works You see here microscopy picture of a plant root and the blue structures is the AMF structure and actually enter the plant roots even the plant root cells and Developed there then they spread a network of fungal hyphae Into the soil. So here we see the plant fruit and then we see these fine root structures Spreading out in the soil. So basically they extend the root system And you see that they are much finer than the plant roots so they can enter soil pores that the plant cannot access and then they take up nutrients from the soil and Give them to the plant the plant in turn From photosynthesis and gives carbon back to the fungus. So both partners benefit from this association So I did a postdoc then at UC Berkeley and there we looked at these mycorrhizal fungi in a long-term field trial The century experiment at Russell Ranch in Davis where since more than 25 years different cropping systems are compared And you were interested in the communities of mycorrhizal fungi in these systems and how they affect crop yield so we selected for management systems there and We planted two different Tomato plants in these systems. So one is a normal tomato plant called 76 are that forms regular associations with mycorrhizal fungi and then we had this tomato mutant called RMC that has a mutation that Prevents it from forming normal AMF association. So they only form. Yeah, they reduced associations with AMF So we planted them there and then we looked at tomato yields to basically find out Yeah, how yield is affected if we remove the mycorrhizal association from the crop and We see here the data for the biomass on the left-hand side on the crop yield dark bars are the normal tomato plants and the light gray bars are the mutant plants with reduced mycorrhizal colonization and we see some differences here depending on the cropping system but importantly we see that When we've removed mycorrhizal associations from the system we get up to a 30 percent decline in yields and Also, overall we found a positive correlation the more mycorrhizal we found in the plant roots the higher tomato yields where so I think this study also impressively shows that that soil organisms can Really or really do support agricultural yields and matter So to sum up these Studies we saw that soil organisms possess a great potential to increase crop yields and simultaneously reduce nutrient pollution to the environment and we could confirm These results in field settings so Soy life is a crucial factor for sustainable agriculture and substantially supports crop yields and Supporting your soil life is good for the environment good for the plants and good for you if you're a farmer So you have more money in your pocket and need less fertilizer for example So this is all very nice But we have to get this information out to the public and we don't have much time because soils Threatened so we lose soils globally at an alarming rate And there's like problems like soil compaction so a Salinization desertification and soil erosion through wind and water and also soil Sealing through human activities that are major problems and also harm soil life and Most people or the general public is maybe not really aware that soils harbor an entire below ground universe. So actually One quarter of the global biodiversity is found in soils and one teaspoon of soil contains more living organisms than we are humans on this planet So there we got this idea we we have to do something to spread the word about These facts and this is where the underpants come into play So we trying to make the soil life visible because it's very hard to see soil organisms who saw the presentation before So you need a microscope and also you yeah, it's hard to see them But we try to make so alive visible by making underpants Invisible because if you bury an underpand in the soil, it's cotton It will be decomposed by soil organisms and over time disappears So we started a citizen science project called the Weistung Unterhose in English It's a proof by underpants where we Wanted to bury underpants together with the Swiss population With the goal to raise the awareness about the importance of soils and also to perform some scientific assessments of soil biological activity and soil health across Switzerland and also we want to develop recommendations for best management practices to support soil life and I have to mention that we did not invent this idea of burying underpants so this was actually a group of farmers in Canada that started with this in 2015 and And it has already been done in several parts of the world currently. There's also project in Hungary going on and in Australia Yeah So how did we do it we put together a soil lab kit DIY soil lab kit so we Provided standardized underpants to all the participants We also included t-bags to look at the t-bag index which is a scientifically more established method to look at the composition processes and soil and so we Put these things in the package and shipped it to all participants and then they got instructions on how to bury the underpants then they take a soil sample which they ship back to our labs and they place the t-bags in the soil and each participant received two underpants so one will be Retrieved after one month the other one after two months And we also Together with this partner spot around we've developed an app where people can enter management data and information about the field where they bury the underpants and Can also upload pictures of the underpants And then they ship after the two months they ship the soil sample and the underpants back to us to Acroscope and we analyze them So we aimed for 1000 participants and actually all the available spots filled up before we officially announced the project that there was really a huge interest and We aimed for 50 percent farmers and 50 percent non-farmers being private gardeners or just regular people We we told them they can bury the underpants wherever they want can be in the forest can be in some Rural spaces in the city can be in their community garden in the rooftop garden or in agricultural fields And here you see a map from our webpage and everyone in each of these dots actually represents several Spots where underpants buried so you can zoom in and see all the details and look at pictures and Look at site information on our webpage, which is available in three Swiss national languages Yeah, then we had to go to raise the awareness and we had an event for the media for the start of the project And actually it was overwhelming how well this force picked up so we were in the media globally with this project in in Ghana in India China the US and so on and We also had several television features in Swiss and German television and Importantly all these media releases talked about that soils are alive So it's important and soils are threatened and we have to take care of them So they really got our message across which made us very happy We also put together a picture book about soil life called the jungle and soil but it's Only available in the German and French We think about releasing an English version. We'll see how that goes Yeah, it's actually very entertaining and interesting can learn a lot there and it's available in bookstores in Switzerland Germany Austria, or you can also directly order it through us can write an email then you get also a special price when you get it through us Yeah, and then there's still the scientific assessments to be made so the research questions We're trying to answer with this project our house soil biological activity distributed across Switzerland And is this biological activity linked to soil biodiversity? the soil quality crop yields and also how does management affect the soil biological activity and And Yeah, we have also want to assess whether underpens can really serve as a meaningful and easy to use indicator for soil health That everyone can use in their backyard or wherever they want because this method has never been scientifically Assessed so yeah, we really hope to get answers here how useful the underpens actually are So right now we're dealing with the samples. We have almost 900 soil samples 1600 underpants 10,000 teabags We have a subset of soil samples where we look at soil microbial diversity 800 questionnaires with site information management data So we are really busy in the lab right now So the underpants they are photographed and then with imaging software we determined amount of degradation of the underpants the teabags are weighed and Yeah, we hope to be able to make recommendations for for best management practices in spring of these years What we can tell already or what we have already is data that the citizens actually entered in the app so they could Assess how strongly the underpants were degraded So we see here the results of the one month so orange means the underpants are not very degraded green men means they're strongly degraded So what we see so far of the one month months there's less degradation than the two months and We see that there are no Large-scale spatial patterns, so Yeah, looking at the details will be interesting Hopefully so there's more to come if you're interested you can subscribe to our newsletter on our web page It's on the landing page. You have to scroll to the bottom to find it or you follow us on Facebook and Instagram Yeah, and with this I'm at the end so I Knowledge acknowledge people involved in this research and soil interactions group at the agro scope and my colleagues Project team of the underpants project People at UC Davis and Berkeley And I thank you for your attention Happy to take questions Thank you very much France for your talk and now we also know what how it was all conducted regarding the pants and Very inspiring you want to say yeah, maybe I'm start collecting some pants now from now on It's okay. I Will start right away with the question of Felix He's asking how was the soil soil sterilized and how was ensured that it was sterile We sterilize the soil with X-ray really irradiation. Sorry. There are these companies that provide the service mostly for medical equipment and Yeah, depending on the dose of the ready irradiation you can determine how how sterile the soil is Because there's always some bacteria that can survive such processes so we made sure that we did not have Fungi in the soil anymore no mycorrhizal fungi and Insects other pots and so on there might have been still some bacteria have been Sorry alive in the soil, but Yeah, but we Also saw in our control treatments that they were mostly free of mycorrhiza for example We had some contamination probably through the air because it was outside And for the greenhouse we often sterilize the soil with auto-claving Thank you very much Can you please stop sharing this screen? Yeah, I mean I love the biodiversity of the pants, but thank you Okay, next question will be by Landert using two tomato varieties introduce more differences than Equals minus AMF only so how do you know the yield differences are AMF based? so these This mutant is actually derived from this 76 hour wild type that we used so they are directly related and it should only be this one mutation that that Causes differences and mycorrhizal colonization and this Pair of wild type and mutant has been used and in several studies already. They have also been Tests planting them in sterile soil to look at growth differences without mycorrhiza and they show fairly similar similar growth Even in sterile soil Mm-hmm. Thank you the next question by Italia is how deep have you buried the panties and How do you account for the differences in land use because there is a huge difference in arable land and the heavily irrigated home garden Yeah, that's So first first part of the question we we buried the underpants vertically in the soil so that the the seam on the top Looks out of the soil surface So it was yeah, probably from zero to 15 20 centimeters They were buried in the soil and Yeah, of course, there's a huge variation and that's why we also tried with this app and question is to get as Detailed information as possible about what's happening on these field sites. Is it irrigated or not? How often is it irrigated which fertilizers do you use to your ply compost to your ply pesticides? Which crop is growing there and so on and With all this information we we hope to really get meaningful answers Mm-hmm. Thank you And how did you create the treatments with reduced and enhanced soil life and Maybe the first part of the other question of italia Yeah, so we we used Sivings basically so we sift the soil through four millimeters and Then we had an additional step in the greenhouse So we put the sift soil into sterile soil in the greenhouse and planted some plants in there and let them grow for three months to Yeah to let the soil organisms propagate in these pots and Yeah, and for the for the reduced soil life treatment we filtered the soil through 11 micrometer Filters and also added this to sterile soil in the greenhouse So we had both treatments growing in the greenhouse and in sterile substrate and only a small part of of the two Filtrates was added so we tried to really make sure that that Yeah, the difference are similar except for the different organisms present Okay, and another part of the question was where do you where do the microbes come from and how much did you apply? So we we went to a agricultural field like a pasture field here close to our research station from a farmer and Yeah, use just native soil organisms we found in that soil What was the second part of the question This I have to I'm already The second part well at one moment Yeah, how much did you apply I Yeah so we produced this inoculum in the greenhouse and Then I think we If I remember correctly it was about 10 percent of the soil volume in this lysimeters was Was the inoculum from the greenhouse Or maybe was 5% or so of the volume I'm not sure right now. I have to look it up Thank you a little interruption I want to remind everybody you don't have to do it now, but all the participants You have to refresh the browser because otherwise we will drop out by five. I mean maybe That will be maybe we will be finished by five But maybe it take a little bit longer be just that it's not like a really quick and so maybe you just refresh the browser When you have time within the next five minutes Okay, and I would continue with the questions Michaela she's asking is intensive cropping always combined with sped soil life or Is intensive range from overused like degraded soils from us to special used cropping systems with crop rotation and cover crops? Yeah, I Probably there's also intensively managed systems where soil life is doing well I think there's a lot of factors that play a role and it's always difficult to make these Generalizations and we also saw on the data that there's a huge variability And the data so some cropping systems are doing better than than others And I didn't don't remember the rest of the question Yes Or is it in intensive a range from over used to special use cropping systems with crop rotation and cover crops? That's like the second part of the Of the question Yeah, so I think probably if I understand correctly if there's like a gradient of Yeah soil So the health from from more sustainably to more intensively managed systems Which I would say yes, so you can't cannot really put them in categories So this is good. This is bad or the soil life is going bad good here and bad there so it's it's really a Gradient and it really depends on lots of details that we also don't understand at this point, I guess Okay, thank you R\u00fcther she's asking who paid about sending back soil samples tea bags and pans Participants or your organization? Yeah, actually the University of Syrac was kind enough to sponsor the shipment so we sent the packages already with a Return shipments label. They just have to had to put on the on the box And they could use the same box so we tried to make it really easy for the participants to return the shipments Another question by Marian which results would you think the Licinated trials had shown if also slurry had been added Yeah That's a difficult question. I don't I Don't know. I think I would guess that in general They would have probably gone in a similar direction But Yeah, yeah, I can't really say a lot about this Okay, and then was the question about this how the soil was sterilized and how was it ensured that it was sterile Yeah Yeah, but I answered this already right. Yeah, that's that's the thing like it because it was not So showed like that it was answered, but it was already Okay, I answered it. Yeah so Actually all questions in the chat Answered now. So The final question is, you know, it may be already what added to main take home messages So the one two things you want to share with us before you or we leave the participants by five We try Yeah, I think my main message is Make taking care of your soil a priority it's really the basis of human existence and then also of the functioning of planet Earth, so we really have to take care of the soil and Get away from only focusing on yields But really focusing on feeding the soil and keeping it healthy and alive so that we Can rely on them also in 100 years from now. Okay. Thank you very much. Wow. We are on time. Thank you France",
