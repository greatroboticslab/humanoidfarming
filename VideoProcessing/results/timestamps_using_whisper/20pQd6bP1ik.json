They did it by following their principles, by being the best and by being honest to their customers. DIS. Technology driven. People focus. Yeah, we push a really high used inventory turn to our dealerships. One of the ways we do it, well, very aggressive marketing. Weekly ads statewide. Our internet presence we try to push real hard. And once a year, at least once a year, we have a used equipment auction. We've been running used equipment auctions through our dealership for many, many years. It's a way of freeing up some capital and getting rid of the, you know, cleaning out the yard, make room for new stuff. We generally manage the auctions ourselves. We hire good auctioneers. We clerk them ourselves and cashier them ourselves. And so it takes some of the expense out. I like to control the advertising myself. After doing auctions so many years, kind of know what I think our market is. And overall, it gives us an opportunity to get a real good handle on what used equipment values are. Sometimes we lose money, sometimes we make money. That's all part of the deal here. But I'm a firm believer in the auction process.
