  "text": "In recent years, Cambodia, an agriculture-based economy, has seen worsening impacts of climate change, including intense rainfall, high temperatures and sea levels rise. Prey Veng province, for example, was hit by both floods and droughts in 2018, resulting in losses and damage of up to $16 million. The livelihoods of farmers are especially affected. The Asian Development Bank, with support from the pilot programme for climate resilience of climate investment funds, assisted the Royal Government of Cambodia to prepare the strategic programme for climate resilience consisting of seven investment projects and one technical assistance project to provide overarching support for the seven investment projects. Two investment projects relate to the agricultural sector, including the Climate Resilience Rice Commercialisation Sector Development Project. This project is helping farmers increase rice production in three largest rice-producing provinces, Baton Bang, Kampong Tom and Prey Veng, by rehabilitating and climate-proofing irrigation systems and other rural infrastructure. Specific engineering measures were integrated into the design of infrastructure to cope with more rapid flows of floodwater. The farmers are very happy to help us to grow rice. We are very happy to help them grow rice. We are very happy to help them grow rice. We are very happy to help them grow rice. The project also demonstrates the benefits from laser land levelling to conserve water and improve irrigation water use efficiency. We have been working on this project for five years. We have been working on this project for five years. We have been working on this project for five years. We have been working on this project for five years. We have been working on this project for five years. To assist farmers in reducing the climate risks associated with rice production, the project is pilot testing a weather-indexed crop insurance scheme in selected areas. The project is also improving the availability and quality of rice seed by developing a certification system that will result in a more resilient crop. The project also helps create more jobs for women. All in all, the project contributes to economic, social and environmental sustainability of rice farming in Cambodia.",
