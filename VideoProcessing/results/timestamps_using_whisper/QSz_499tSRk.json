  "text": "Yeah, so well my practitioner program six months project was an irrigation system inspired by nature that could really help us like solve like well I wanted to learn about how to use a better irrigation system. So first the table of context is like so i'm going to talk about the scuba fades discovery of acting creating. And evaluating insights and lessons and so we're gonna i'm going to talk about the process so it's like the past, the creation and development so. In the scooping face i'll talk about the challenge so the challenge is to create an irrigation system that can really adapt to the changes were globally facing like we're rising. Heads and more droughts, particularly in Spain where it's my project focus on Madrid in my village, so these irrigation system was principally for my grandma design so. For that I tried to see the functions so functions are like the micro climate that really out to regulate itself, the irrigation system that distribute the water and the adaptation so change within an environment. So for me, I really wanted to design something that was out to regulate it scalable and that use like friendly chemistry. So for the discover face. I started researching at many organisms, I started to look at the leaves veins where, if you can see if I zoom in, like I did some sketches of how the real like the leaf veins really are distributed and like also like to burn and. And also the aquifer, which is actually an aha moments, because I was in in the forest like near my house and then I started seeing like this kind of valleys. Small valleys where like the grass was like all year long almost cover in green grass, which is actually what I was looking for you know like to right try it to retain water at some areas that could really help me to understand how nature can. How nature created space where the water it's retained all year long. So, for that. For, well, for the leaf, I abstracted form, the two burn the process and the aquifer the system. So, at the abstract in phase, I started to abstract all these principles. And here also you can see like drawings. And. So for the leaves. It's like main point is the interconnected network that I applied to my design for the two burned. I am. I abstracted the concept of the process to retain water in in a container and for the aquifers I applied the principle of creating a layer system that could really retain water. Throughout any specific space. So, at the creative phase, I started to look back and to the main objectives that I had. So I didn't want to use plastic. Everywhere I go, I like there's all all types of plastic tubes that they are used in the gardening and they really are really damaged and when they are broken or anything they're just left there. So I really wanted to eradicate that to not use harmful chemicals and no electronics because that's also a really big problem. And I think it's for timers for watering timers like you use an electric device, but the e-waste is more like a more and more important issue that we're getting like nowadays. So for that for my inspiration process I started looking at looking at how in the past they did that because of course they had no plastic, not that many harmful chemicals and not electronics. So I looked at the past, and I saw that I discovered that in India, there was a strategy that they use clay pipes to design a system to irrigate the waters to irrigate like their lands. So I took inspiration of that. Also, another moments was when I realized that also I could learn a lot about bees. So I could learn about how the wax is also part of the roots to cover and protect from water loss and the panel structure, which are exegons which I will tell you later why is that important. So also the urban rift as I told you I wanted to create a container. So as for inspiration, as I was going to put a container in the garden, I thought, okay, maybe I can use that structure also to have other functionalities. So also these companies making like it's starting how we can create structures made of clay to be be receptive and have like all kinds of plants growing all around so you can also be habitual for birds, any plants and insects. And finally, I decided to create an app. And why because I thought like for design, I wanted to be it like to to bowl, you know, in nature, everything is evolving every time. And to have a design that could really fit in any context. I thought that it could be really interesting that if you had an app that could really share your insights and your improvements your, your ideas of innovation that you try them that you test them and then you you find that that it's really cool for your context, then you can share in an app. So that you can really help others which are in your similar context to apply those innovations in their design. So, well, this is the design itself. It's basically an Xagon like I told you I was going to tell you about the X-agons. So the shape is X-agons because the X-agons are the ones who can really be the ones who really fit in any area in any with any shape, you know, because the garden's hand had like really a lot of different shapes. So in order to have something that could really fit in any garden, I had to do something that was interconnected. So geometrical shapes that could be also modular that could really fit at any shape. I thought that like I just had a aha moments. I would like, yeah, the X-agons exactly. So these are also the pieces that compose the whole system so that you can really take the ones that you want and create the shape that you want. So this is just an example. So you can really make it like straight or just small like, you know, like a big area on the left and just a small area on the right. And here are the drawings for manufacturing so that really can use that to create and manufacture all your pieces at locally so that you don't really have to send the product to like maybe Australia, let's say. So I don't have to sell like sell the pieces, but instead I just share my drawings and there they can make it locally. So for the evaluating phase, I just review the key features of the design. So as the pipes mimic the aquifer layers. So as you can see like the bottom part is covered with wax. So that it creates like a really permeable layer for water to be stored in between another layer that it's above. So because it's a tube, of course, but you understand. And so the upper part is not covered with wax so that it really with the positive the material, the water really can get to the to the soul. And then also the idea is also for the crash or any plant roots to get to the to the pipes so that they really get the water that they need, instead of just watering the water in the plants for water that they might not need. So I also had an idea that for the container, it could also not just be like for store water, but to have like a filtration layers that could really mimic the rain and mountain so that they really get the water. The water that it's on the roots like in the pipes are really water that it's going through process of filtration that really creates more appropriate water for plants. So it doesn't come from the from the from our house and also as you can connect your, your, well the water that you get from the roof from the rain, you can add it to the roof so that you'd really don't need to use water like extra water so do you just connected there. And then, if you, if it's rains, it refills the container, but if it's really, really like a big drought, then you can manually just add some water. And well here is also the app so you can have an idea of what I meant. So we're going to have to wrap this up very soon. Okay. Yeah, thank you. Well, so the study. Well, I will pass to the king sites and lessons. So I love to have like this global view of how being by mimicry really assumes in and out one and again and again so that you really understand the whole process. So also the structure and methodology so that we follow a path, even though I can go back and forth, but there is a structure and the translation and we love this translation of how we can really abstract the principles of nature. So the future of my project, I really want to create a portfolio of my projects so that I can really like learn from them, and then teach others to to learn by mimicry. So my idea here is also like it's, it could be like a really workshop and activity for students or even like for a community to do for their own garden or even their own organic garden vegetables gardens. And yeah, I thought it could be like a really good for to create a project for the community to investigate. And then after that to teach them about bomb mimicry. So here are also my details my email, and I just wanted to thank you for the whole like process because I really enjoyed it so much, and just hope we can still work in on learn from nature. Well done. Wow, yeah. That was phenomenal.",
