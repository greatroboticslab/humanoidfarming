  "text": "I'm going to host welcome everybody. This is the last of six seminars that we organized as part of a webinar series on targeting and community networks and anti-poverty programs. And we're very happy to have Marcel Pauchon give the last seminar. Marcel was the first person to teach me about development economics way back when in Stanford and graduate school. So it's always great to see him. And he's going to share some of his work on mobilizing P2P diffusion in Bangladesh. Marcel, it's all yours. Thanks a lot. Well, it's a great pleasure to be talking to you guys. This is work with a joint work with Assad Islam, who I believe is attending. Abdul Malik, who also said he would be attending in Debayan Pakrashi. And it's a second paper we've done together about basically about how to promote the diffusion of agricultural technology in focusing on a specific technology called Systems of Rise Intensification, the SRI, which has the advantage and drawback that it doesn't include, it doesn't require additional input. So it's an advantage for all of us. Because we don't run into issues of people having liquidity constraints or things like that. But then the downside is that it's actually a difficult technology to master. And so people, the difficulty with this technology is how to train farmers in applying it. And so of course, you could try to train all the potential beneficiaries. Because if you don't know who's going to benefit from it, you can try to train everybody. But that's obviously going to be costly. And so with BRAC, we've been trying to, BRAC and Bangladesh, we've been trying to find ways of targeting beneficiaries, if you want. The farmers who would benefit from this innovation, of targeting them better. The first article we wrote about that, which we tried to get, we trained some farmers. And then we asked them to recommend, to refer, basically, all the farmers. They thought, would benefit from the training. So that was the first thing we did. That kind of worked and then really worked like the way we were expecting. We were expecting the referred trainees to be adopting, to be better adopters, basically. We basically better targeted. And that's not really what we found. So this time, we tried another approach, which has a long history in agricultural extension, which is basically based on the idea of a model farmer. But we tried to improve it, basically. So if you remember the model farmer, the extension agent comes to the village and says, I can't teach everybody. So I'm going to select some farmers who, I believe, are role models for others, who are also more receptive to innovation. And I'm going to train them. And then I'm going to hope that this will then naturally diffuse through a specific process through the local population. I'm sure there are more structured ways of doing it. But that's kind of a rough characterization of what the model farmer approach is. So what we tried to do here is we're going to try to start from that. And instead of hoping that these model farmers do viral marketing, basically, they basically become your champions, your marketing agents for your innovation, we're going to actually ask them to train two farmers. We're going to assign them these two farmers. We're going to say, OK, you're going to train Jack and Jill. These are the two trainees we were assigned to you. And you could try to do a good job of it. So that's the basic idea that we have. Our intervention is basically taking trainees, people who have received this one day course on SRI from BRAC. And we're going to assign them to other farmers who could have been trainees, could have been BRAC trainees. But we're going to say, well, what fraction of the effect of BRAC training can we achieve by asking these trainees to themselves teach other farmers? That's the logic. So we call them teacher trainees. Sometimes they call them teachers for short, but obviously they are not school teachers. They just ask to teach other farmers in our experiment. Can I ask a clarification question, please? Yeah, sure. So how much experience do these teacher trainees have with the technology before they're expected to train others? No. They don't have any. They don't have any. Experience with the technology. So you said experience. So they have received a one day training from BRAC. And then they are asked to, can you teach the instruction list that you have been told and taught about to these two other people? And people take a quiz. And so basically we're going to be comparing adoption between teacher trainees and trainees. And of course, we also have controlled farmers who didn't receive any training. We have control farmers in the treated villages where some people receive the training. We also have controlled farmers in villages where there was no training whatsoever. So I'll talk about that in a minute. But that's the way we're going to try to see whether this model transfers knowledge. So basically we're going to quiz the trainees, the teacher trainees, at the end on what they're supposed to be learning. And we're going to teach the students of these teacher trainees who did not receive the BRAC training. We're going to quiz them about their knowledge as well. And then we're going to see whether they have. We also have, we know that the average farmer who has not been trained does not know what SRI is in this particular part of the world. It's not like they would not naturally know what it is. And then we also look at adoption of the recommended practices later on, which is measured by BRAC. And then we also have an end-line survey where we measure agricultural outcomes, like profits and yields and so forth. So that's the basic idea. I'll go through the intervention in more detail in a minute. There are some villages we incentivize the teachers to, basically we thought maybe if we incentivize them, they would do a better job. So they incentivize to teach to the test. So basically they've already taken the test and they are told, well, you will test your students using the same quiz and then we'll give you an incentive if they answer the quiz questions well. So that's basically testing whether they can convey this key information about SRI to their students. And we hope that that knowledge then translates into a higher adoption. And then from the model farmer idea, this model farmer idea, so remember the key idea of that model was that this person was a role model for other farmers. And therefore the other farmers would want to copy him or her. So we thought, well, maybe we can emulate that as well. I mean here, so the way we did that is that we asked in baseline, we asked each two farmers in our sample to at most five other farmers in the list we're giving them whom they would regard as role models. Whom they would consider as sources of valuable information for agricultural technology. So that's the idea. And then basically in a way I'll explain, remember each teacher training gets two students assigned to him. They're all male. So and one of them is going to be someone who has nominated that farmer as a role model, who has listed him as a role model. And the other one is someone who has not nominated him as a role model. So that's the idea. And the idea is based on this model farmer idea is that it's a role model, therefore it's going to work better in terms of diffusing the innovation from teacher trainees to those farmers and nominated them to those farmers that regard them, regard a teacher trainee as a role model. So that's the key idea. And this is done through an algorithm I'll describe in a minute. So that's the basic idea of what we do. In terms of, and I'll explain the experiment in more detail, obviously, in terms of just to remind, I'm sure some of you already know what this system, perhaps even better than I do, what the system of rising intensification is. But my understanding of it is basically it's a set of different practices that have to do with transplanting, the way you do the transplanting, the data transplanting, and especially things like spacing, thinning, and the way you water the plant, the regularity of the water in the plant and so on. So this is basically they have to be basically spaced trailer apart from each other and there's going to be more thinning than what farmers would normally do. And as a result, these single plants that survive grow bigger and they get more grain. So that's the logic of SRI, that's why I understand it. Now, you can see there's no, these are all practices, there's no inputs required. So there's no purchased inputs that are related to adoption of SRI. So that means several things. It means things that, if it was a fertilizer or a new seed or a new pesticides or something, farmers could in principle go to the seller of this input and ask them, what should I use on my rice? How should I use it? How should I apply it? There's not such thing here. So we don't have to worry about contamination of our sample by some external agent who comes and gives them information about this technology. So that simplifies our work. It makes it reduces contamination from external actors or vendors in this case. It also means that you don't have to worry about externalities through input markets. I mean, if you introduce a new fertilizer, let's say, and there's a whole value chain that has to bring this fertilizer to the villages and only, you know, nobody, only you are the only one who wants to buy it. You know, chances are you're not gonna find it because the traders are not gonna find it useful to bring the fertilizer to the village just in the off chance that you might buy this one bag of fertilizer. So they're gonna be network externalities in the sense that, you know, the more people are buying it, the more it will make sense for sellers of agricultural inputs to stock it. And therefore you would have, and you would have more information, the other farmers will have more information as you get into this kind of system of externalities. So we don't have to worry that the problem with that is that that would break sub-vast. So, I mean, we're already looking at diffusion, which is something as very, already by nature, kind of breaks sub-vast somewhat. So we don't want more to worry about more violations of sub-vast that we have to. There'll be an effect on the quantity of inputs that they purchase. I'm wondering if you have to space out. You will look at that, but we're not introducing any new inputs. Yeah. But we'll look at that. Yeah. The main thing, though, is that it's, I would, people sometimes describe this technology as more labor intensive. It seems like, because the farmers have to go and visit the field sometimes more often, but really it's more management-intensive. They have to be more careful and they have to also change the way they were doing things, but they have to measure, they have to count how to thin properly and so on. So it's a little bit more scientific. And so as a result, it's a bit more demanding in terms of attention and care and a bit harder for the farmer to delegate. So that's a sense in which it's more demanding on the farmer. Well, that's the idea. So, but these things again means that if it's about management, it's not something that will diffuse naturally through observation. You can't just copy people, oh, he has a new iPhone I'm gonna have a new iPhone. You can't just copy people's behavior just by observing what they're doing. So you have to really be taught how to do it. So that's the idea of this. There's gonna be some diffusion happening and naturally, of course, people will talk, but it will come, the hope is that it all comes from the training that Bragg does and then the way that this diffuses then to students and perhaps then eventually to some other people in the village. As we'll see later, there's very good contamination across villages. So, again, confirming that people don't seem to know this technology before. Now, I'm not gonna spend too much on this slide, but there's obviously a very large approach on diffusion of innovation. Here I've picked a few papers that are more in the developer and economics literature, reasonably recent papers. So that is, of course, a much larger literature behind it, including, of course, in marketing because diffusion of new products is innovation. So there's going to be some large interest on that. There's so many but you're on SRI and basically the main message of this literature is that SRI is not for everyone. You need to be a dedicated farmer to benefit from it. If you're not up to snuff, let's say, you're just like somebody who does it because they can't earn an income from something else, you might not necessarily benefit from it because it's actually demanding in terms of understanding what's going on in the field. So that's the sense in which it's not a technology that we expect to benefit everyone and therefore it's a technology for which targeting is important. You have to be able to, you want to economize on the cost of training by focusing your training on people who will benefit from it. So that's the idea. Of course, there is also a larger literature on peer-to-pea transmission, which is what we are trying to achieve here. And of course, more generally on the role of social proximity in viral marketing. So I'm not gonna, these are just hand-picked, very small number of papers I'm citing here. So let me, if there are no more questions about, no questions about the setup, the context, I can delve into the, immediately delve into the experimental design. As I said, it's with BRAC. We've selected a hundred villages from these two districts, Ranghpur and Bagura in Bangladesh. And the way that BRAC works, as far as SRI is concerned, they go to these, when they arrive in a village, they start by identifying our 30 potential SRI adopters. And these are people who obviously have to grow rice, otherwise there's no point. And they have to be large enough, in other words, more than one decimal. I forgot exactly the, it's in the paper, but the lower limit, but they tried to find these intermediate farmers enough land that they grow to signal that they're actually farmers, not just gardeners, if you want. And they're also not too big. So they kind of live in this intermediate size. So they kind of generally poor people, but they are a little bit more focused on rice than some of the very small ones. And if the village is too big and they have more than 30, basically what they would end up doing, not necessarily here, but what they would end up doing is kind of, they say there's two groups of 30, and then they were like, one is the eastern part of the village, one of the western part of the village. But it's a densely populated country, so you get, sometimes you get large villages. So they would do that. So basically they, and that's how they proceed in their SRI training campaign. So we wanted to kind of, we didn't want to change that because we wanted to be policy relevant. We wanted whatever we introduced, whatever we find, we wanted this to be, you mean that you could slot it into the normal strategy, the normal practices of BRAC in the country. So that was the idea. And also we, because they're not stupid, they also want to save on, economize on, wasting training time on people who never, no, we hope that through that system, we, the 30 farmers, they identify probably farmers among whom the probability adoption is higher. It's not a hundred percent by any means, but it's higher. So that's the idea. So basically, let's focus on those people. And we're gonna be looking at the fusion among that group. We start with the baseline questionnaire on the household composition and farmer sets. It's a fairly light baseline. And then we assigned 60 villages to treatment and the 40 remaining was to control. In controls, there's no SRI BRAC intervention. And then in the treated villages, selected number of teacher trainees, farmers receive one day training in SRI. And of the 60 villages selected for treatment, there's 30 that are also assigned to an incentivized teacher treatment. A treatment whereby the teacher training is gaining a compensation for training students that depend on their performance in the quiz. While in the other 30 villages, the teacher trainee received a fixed compensation per student, the next to the teacher. And if you look at the, more precisely, what is the, how does this compensation constructed? Well, they get a fixed fee, if you want a participation fee of $300, a TACA of $4. And then in the incentivized treatment, they get 250 TACA additional per student at the end of the teaching week. And then another, they are given a week to train them, because I'm expecting them to be training them every day all the time. But you have to give them some time for them to meet. So that's the logic of it. And it don't wait too long to have no point. And then the incentivized treatment. Question? Yeah. How are the teacher trainees selected? I'm getting to that. It's the next, getting to that right away. Anyway, so that's the easy part, explaining this kind of incentives is basically you get a fixed amount and then you lose something every time the, your student answers the quiz wrongly. So now let's talk about the assignment rule. So as I explained earlier in the baseline in the treated villages, each farmer nominates up to five as role models, which is the opinion leaders of role models. And then we have these 30 farmers and then we have to assign them into four different roles, basically. Some are gonna be teachers, they're gonna receive the training. Some are going to be receiving nothing at all. They're gonna be the non-students. They're gonna be, they're gonna be able to look at, if you want, an incentivized, unorganized diffusion. And then we're gonna have the students and there are two types of students, the students who nominated. So remember, there are two students per teacher trainee, one who nominated a teacher trainee as a opinion leader or role model, and one who did not nominate that particular teacher trainee. So that's how it's, so they have to be assigned to these four groups. How do we do this? So we start by picking six teacher trainees. So those are gonna receive the black training. And this we did by dividing, so remember, once we get the five nominations per nominating farmer, per each of the 30 farmers, we can look at who they nominate. So maybe all of them nominate Albert. So then Albert would be nominated by, we'll have 29 nominations. And then maybe Dilip is gonna have 28 or something. So you get a sense of, and then some people will have none. But basically, we basically divide the 30 farmers into those that received above the median number of nominations and those that received less than the median number of nominations. And then among those above the median, we'd select four teacher trainees and the others we'd select two teacher trainees. So this is basically stratified sampling. We had a variable where we collected ourselves. It's known to us, we do sampling stratified. Okay, so they don't have the same, based on their observable characteristics and baseline, they get slightly different probabilities of being assigned to a particular treatment. So we'll have to correct for that when we, in a minute, because that stratified sampling, which is not pure randomization. Now what about the other 24 farmers? So then we have assigned these six people at random, the way they're explained. So you left with 24 farmers. We know we want 12 students and 12 non-students. And then we want six students who are matched with a teacher that they nominated and six students who are matched with somebody that did not dominate. So how do we do this? But we do this using an algorithm. This algorithm is a mechanistic. So it just basically, you can think of the algorithm as, you start by randomizing all the 30 farmers in the village. Then you, based on that sorting reshuffling of the farmers, you pick the first four who are above the median in terms of domination and the first two who are above the median, below the median in terms of domination. These are gonna be the teacher trainees. So now that you have the teacher trainees, you start looking among the 24 farmers for farmers who dominated them, farmers who did not dominate them. And so, and you go through the list, you go through the list of farmers in the order they've been shuffled. Until you finally have allocated the point. So the order in which they've been shuffled will determine the order in which they are considered by the algorithm to be assigned to a teacher or not. Does it make sense? So that means that- But Marcel, it still seems like it's not gonna be very random if for each of the teachers, you have to find one student who nominated them. Cause maybe for some of the teachers, there was only one or two students who nominated him, right? If I'm understanding the algorithm correctly. Yeah, yeah, but that's enough. That's okay. That's okay. Yeah. I don't think there is a village where we had the problem of selecting a teacher who was nominated by nobody. I don't think it happened because this is an issue that we raised at the beginning, but this didn't occur. So you always find that they've been nominated by this one person. One other question. I mean, when they are asked to nominate somebody as a role model, are they, you know, one criterion could be who do you think is gonna be the most successful in adopting the technology himself? The other is who is going to be the best teacher? And those two need not be the same. Sure. So what is your understanding of what they think of when they say role model? Well, I mean, you will see it actually, this has no effect. Okay, so we can talk about what they meant. Maybe they didn't mean anything, it's possible. But the wording was basically whom would you be, I mean, the wording is not, it's phrased in terms of agricultural technology. So who would you be going to for information about the new agricultural technology? That's the basic idea. Now it may be that they just go to their neighbor. So it may be that this person is not particularly knowledgeable about it, but that was the intention. The intention was to identify someone who was perceived as a more, at least by the student farmers, by perceived as someone who would be more authoritative. That was the intention. And so the idea was that if he's more authoritative, you probably will listen more to what he says, who might do better on the quiz. And you might also follow this person's example more, and therefore, if they adopt, you might adopt it as well. In fact, we're gonna be testing for those things in the paper. But before I go to that, to the more substantive issues of the paper, which are actually where the interesting stuff is, I need to basically address this issue of weights. I mean, clearly this algorithm generates different probabilities of being assigned to one of the four treatments for each of the 30 farmers. And so you might think, well, wait a minute. I mean, I know how to deal with this problem if it's stratified sampling, which is stratified sampling. I just look at the stratification ratio that I use, and I correct for that using weights. But here you say, well, wait a minute. I don't know, it's just the algorithm. It's a black box, but the thing is that the algorithm, you can reproduce it as many times as you want. You can reach a full of farmers right again. Reach a full of farmers right again, right again, right again. Right 500 times. Look at how, you know, of these 500 times, how many times does Albert get assigned to be a teacher and how much does Marcel get assigned to be a teacher? And that becomes your probability of assignment. The problem is going to be if there is somebody who's always assigned to be a teacher, somebody who's never assigned to be a teacher, then you think, well, wait a minute. Those people I can't compare because they, you know, they, I don't have people who are. So I will look at that. I'll have to check that this is not the case because those people that don't have to be taken out because they never, they have zero chance of, they can't construct a sampling weight for that. Right, it's infinite, zero. So that's, I'll get back to that in a minute, but that's the idea. But the main thing here is that it's got a rule-based determinist. Like a spec given a certain ordering of farmers in reshuffling of farmers, it follows a rule. And this rule is entirely based on things that we observe at baseline. Just like if you were doing certified sampling, you have some kind of baseline information on the people and then you're gonna organize your sampling based on that. So it's not about selection of unobservables. They're gonna be things that correlated with these observables for sure. But that's why we need to correct for sampling weights. So that's the idea. So as I said, we've got four types of treated farmers, two types of treated villages incentivized teacher and non-insertivized teacher. We only have one type of control farmers. And basically what we'll do is we compare, say teacher trainees to control farmers or teacher trainees to non-students or it's not, so that's what we're gonna be doing. So let's talk a little bit more about this assignment to treatment type. So remember, this assignment to treatment is under our full control. There's no self-selection whatsoever. We assign them is based on observables which we have at baseline. And it's based on an algorithm which we can use to replicate many times the assignment process. So that's the key. But basically we can, based on that, we can, as I've explained, we can reconstruct what the probability of being assigned to each of the four treatments would be for any particular, in fact, for any individual in the sample, they can do this individual by individual. And so that way we can recover the probabilities. So let me show you just how it works in practice. So let's say you have two populations that are treated and the control, the normal way of measuring the average treatment, if I could be just to look at the mean of the treatment and the mean of the control if they have been randomly assigned to it. And if there's no certification whatsoever, you just take the sample mean. Now, in our case, we can't do the sample mean. We're gonna, for the, so this is people assigned to a specific treatment. So we're going to basically use inverse probability weighting. That's something you already know. So, this is the probability that somebody would be assigned to this particular treatment. We normalize this by case, or which is the sum of these PI. So that you want to normalize because you want this thing that is saying the probabilities is one for everybody in a particular, you know, if you want this thing to be one over one. All right, so that cancels out and you back to the standard mean. Happy with that? You just standardize it, but you don't, you don't bias the mean above over. Marsha, I had a question. This all makes sense to me, but if you were going to re-weight to try to make it in some sense representative, then why don't you just randomize at the beginning and then you don't have to deal with the weights? I'm just curious about, you know, the decision to stratify in this way and then to re-weight it back to the random representatives. No, but no, but the, no, that is, why do you stratify a sample in any, any, you know, why do you ever stratify a sample? It's because you want to be able to compare to populations. In this case, we wanted to compare nominating and non-dominating. We wanted to compare teacher and the others and we wanted to be, and the big challenge was nominating and non-dominating because we don't control who's nominating who. So basically that's the way we ended up approaching it. Right, but the cost is you get a higher variance. I mean, the greater variance in the weights reduces power in some sense. So I can see the trade off, right? No, I understand, I agree with that. Yeah, I agree with that. But we're going to have enough power. So my interpretation is that you wanted to try to understand the mechanisms as well. And if you're trying to think about mechanisms, I mean, what I would be inclined to do is to, obviously heterogeneity, let's say that people vary in skill, which, and there's just essentially one kind of skill, you know, your better role model or not. And there's information about your skill that's in the population. So you ask people and, you know, to nominate people. So you try to illicit community information about skill. But you've got that fundamental heterogeneity and there could be a second order of heterogeneity, which is that the effectiveness of you as a teacher also depends on the skill of the student. So it could be math specific. So what you want to do is estimate, you know, for any pair of skills for the teacher and the student, you know, how effective is the transmission of diffusion going to be? So that's what you're going to try and back out. Then, you know, I presume that this design will get at that because you've randomized and then you've got a third dimension of randomization, which is the incentives for the teacher. Yeah, yeah, that's by village. So I guess you could have written down a model that would have rationalized the design, and all the effects that you want to isolate. I imagine that that's at the back of your mind. Yeah, it's at the back of the mind. I didn't, for this paper, we didn't write a model. I confess we didn't write a model. No, we just focused on the, yeah. We just didn't do it for this paper. And maybe I should have added, I mean, there's some discussion of that in the paper. And maybe I should have added some slides about that, but I thought I was just gonna talk you into it as I was going, I was presenting the different pieces of evidence I have. But you're right. So you write several points here. So there's one I remember, which is the, what about match specific gain? So remember, maybe you saw the paper I wrote with demo about that. These are kids who are assigned to do a course, a math course with one of the kid in a Chinese school. And so there we actually looked at the math specific gain. But then it was easier, much easier because everybody was in pairs. They were just assigned randomly by design to another person. There was no need for a matching algorithm like this. Like we did here, it was just basically randomized matching. And so there we could see whether, less able kid is matched with a more able kid whether the less able kid learns more. It turns out they do actually. And the more able kid doesn't seem to learn less. So that was actually a good result for that. So that's an example of, so I know, but here we're just gonna be looking at the average. So I'm not, I don't ambition to identify pay-wise because I don't have very, as you're right, I don't have very good identification there. So I don't want to make any statements about that. It's not that I don't think it's important it's just that I don't think I'm very strong terrain there. So rather avoid seeing that. I suspect you the way you stratified, you have the identification, but you may be not be having enough power. I don't know about that. But we'll see about power. I think we have power and we actually cluster standard errors at the village level. So we have a hundred villages, so it's fine. So I mean, it's not like we've been very conservative. I mean, you know, that's not, not for the average treatment effect, but for the heterogeneous treatment effects. We don't have heterogeneous treatment effects. I know, I know if you did, if you did what I was suggesting, write down a model and try to identify the heterogeneous treatment effects to understand the mechanism, you've maybe underpowered to estimate the heterogeneous treatment effects. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. So I understand, okay, but you're mainly talking about power for the average treatment effect, which is fine. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. That's very true. Okay, so I've explained this. You can also use the same, once you, since you recalibrate these means to be representative of the control village population, you can also compare them to each other. So once you have recalibrated them, you should compare that. So you can compare one group of treated with another group of treated. They've been, I've already explained this. I mean, the easiest way to explain how you recover the properties, the easiest way to understand it is that if you think that each person is a different X vector, so then you would run a bunch of simulations. I think we've run 500 simulations. So you would run, let's say first simulation, Dilip gets assigned to be a teacher. And so therefore it's one, zero, zero, zero. So that's one sample. And then in another simulation, he gets assigned to be a nominating student. So he's here and it is there. Okay, really to do this further times, some of them get frequencies, frequency. How often does Dilip get to be a teacher? Maybe a lot of times. So therefore he's gonna be, he's overrepresented, if you want, in the teacher population. So we're gonna want to wait his, to re-wait the teacher population so that he gets less weight. That's the idea. So that's how this is done here. All right. Now, the thing you have to worry, if you do that, the thing you have to worry is that people who never get assigned to a particular role because then as I said, they basically don't have a kind of comparable person. So this is not what we get. So these are basically these normalized probabilities, the weights that we are using and so they are first centered on one, which is the mean. And it doesn't even reach 0.5 and it doesn't go, there's a couple of observation above, couple of people above two, but very few. So basically the range of values of these weights is not crazy. It stays within a relatively narrow range. And so that means that the re-waiting we are doing is not insane. So it's not like one person is 99% of the time, always a teacher, and then you take his inverse sampling where he's gonna be one over 99. And so it's gonna be very large. No, it would be 99 over one. So it would be very small. Anyway, so you want to look to whether you have very large value, very small value, you see, don't have that. So that's actually quite a question. Balance, there are lots of tables about balance in the paper. They are only appendix balance across the different types of treatment. And there we don't find any problem with balance. Note that we do balance controlling for sampling weights and we also cluster standard errors by village. So we try to do this the same way we would perform the rest of the analysis. So this is the first table I have. These are just descriptives. And while I did more than the script, sorry, I have some tests. But the first part of the table, if you want the first half of the table, the top half is about perhaps the issues of possible interest. One is how do people score on the test whether the test has got, actually should be zero to one, to eight. The test has eight questions. So they could either answer them all wrong. I think she should say zero to eight or they could answer, I think nobody does that, but they could all answer all of them right. And the average is about seven. So they're pretty good at remembering what the correct answer is. This is in general. Not that we didn't ask these questions in the control villages, but we know from other observational data that they don't know much about the CERI. And this is just another variable we use as to whether they can answer the three main questions correctly and you get 88% of farmers who can treat farmers, in treat, not treat farmers, farmers in treated villages can do that. In terms of nomination, remember they could make up to five nominations. They actually make nearly all five of nominations. So it's very stable. We don't have to worry too much about some of them nominating one because he's the only one who matters and then some nominating five. Nearly everybody nominates five. So that helps us as well. And now we already have, I can already show you some of the average treatment effects or at least the means, the means in each of the samples. So I have the means in the control villages. These are the adoption variables that I have. This is just basically comparing control villages to treated villages. These are means, village level means. Of course I'm gonna be looking at more than that, but so the first variable is basically whether BRAC estimate that the farmer has adopted at least some of the practices of SRI. And in control villages by about 2 1\u20442% of the farmers in that village are estimated by BRAC has so basically less than one farmer while in treated villages about a third of the farmers. This is across the whole village. In terms of the proportion of land and of course that is massively significant. We have 3,000, I forgot to tell you the sample size, but we have 30 farmers times a hundred villages where you have 3,000 farmers altogether. So this kind of difference across 60 villages versus 40 villages, it's said to mean significant. Proportion of land is just a percentage of their cultivated acreage. That is on which SRI practices are followed. So that's there again, you see that in treated villages you get a much bigger proportion. These are the number of SRI principles adopted on the plot. In control villages actually they are recorded as adopting 1.4, that could just be that they by chance adopted one of those practices, but very few of them adopt more than one. So it's basically, it's a means, it looks like a high mean, but it's not the same practice that every farmer adopts. So they basically randomly adopted things without knowing that it's called SRI. Very few of them, this is very important, very few of them actually follow the transplanting rule which is about the age of the seedlings, very in control villages, very few of them follow the recommended distance between burn those, the places where they transplant the rice, but it's exactly quite a bit higher in treated villages, even though this still remains very low, but they still don't like to follow the age of the seedlings. So it's certainly not complete adoption. And then in terms of number of seedlings per bundle, you have a bit higher practice. This practice is already kind of somewhat there, even in control villages, but even there it's higher in treated villages. So that's in terms of practices, what actually did the, so that you see, it's not like you say, have you adopted this fertilizer? Meaning, have you used this fertilizer on any of your fields? Here you have a whole bunch of six main recommendations from SRI recommendation, and they basically, what is being tracked here are the main recommendations that they make. These are, this is the data that we have on agricultural performance at Endline. We have yield value of crop output, input costs, labor costs, total costs and profits. And here these are all in, so this is in kg per decimal, a decimal is a very small unit of land area used in Bangladesh. And these are Bangladesh, TACA per decimal. So these are in local currency. And you can see there are differences, like for instance, it's about 30, some TACA difference here. Here there's basically anything it's lower in terms of costs. It's the same in terms of labor costs on average, and it's the same in terms of total costs. So there's a little bit of a higher value of output. And so you get a little bit of higher imputed profit. Okay, so that's the, and these things are significant. There's also something significant. This is even that is significant, even though it's reasonably small. So these are all average comparisons. So now we haven't divided farmers in treated villages into the different treatment categories. So let's do that now. So here we've divided them into teacher training, nominating student, non-nominating student and non-student. These are the control means that I just showed you a minute ago. And these are the adoption levels. You can see immediately that, that the teacher trainees adopt a very high probability, about 70% of them, the dependent variable is, is things of value 100 if they adopt and zero if they don't adopt so that each coefficient is easily readable as a percentage point. And remember the baseline level of adoption is very small. So everybody here is significantly above that, that value. So they all quite significant. Once you, and then if you start looking at the rest of the table, you get lots of, lots of stars. So basically, you know, even here where even in control villages, is, you know, close to 18% of the farmers who follow this practice anyway, but then you get a much higher, much higher. These are, these are, you know, you have to add 18 to 17 to get how much a non-nominating student, how much she follows the number of seeding per bundle. That's the way to read the table. So that's the intercept if you want. Are these about just the plot on which they're doing it or the plots on which they're doing it? Is it a plot? So here, here, all the plots are included. So this is basically a regression that runs by plot. That's why there are more than 3000 observations because farmers could mention up to three plots. They collected information up to the three biggest plots. They collected information on that. And there's basically what the focus of the study is because BRAC is not gonna go and visit all your little tiny little thing. So they basically focus on up to three plots per farmer. And these tend to be the biggest ones and rice could typically be included. So that's okay. So that's the way it's done. So basically the lesson from this is that, yeah, with pretty good effect on all these practices and adoption as measured in a relatively generous way here compared to farmers in control villages. So that's the first lesson. And then if you look, well, these numbers are different. So what about this number compared to this one? What about this number compared to this one? So what about this number? So here we just basically using these regressions. So for the first colony, we use this regression and we just do these pairwise t-test. Is the coefficient of teacher trainee significantly different from the coefficient of nominating students? So basically we do these pairwise comparisons to see whether there's a difference in treatment effects. And you can see that when we compare teachers and students, you always get, these are p-values here. So we just report p-values, this is a test. And so basically they are more adopting than other people can see lots of zeros everywhere. There's zeros everywhere here. So teachers are clearly overwhelmingly adopting more SRI. In terms of the students, you can see that both students, the all of them is like also nearly all, there's one, two here, but other than that, they're pretty high, pretty low p-value. So high, get a high significant effect that they are more likely to adopt than non-students in treated villages. Okay, so it's not just that there was some kind of diffusion in the whole village and they benefited from it. It's that they basically de-factored, they were targeted by our intervention through a teacher trainee to receive a SRI instruction that actually made them more likely to adopt these SRI practices. There is the only place where it is, except for this one, which is borderline significant, I would say, everything else here is not significant. So basically this idea that we had, which is basically behind the model farmer logic, the idea that people would pay more attention if they are matched to somebody they look up to, somebody they regard as an opinion leader, as a source of valuable information. And so if this was the case, you know, being matched with the model farmer, somebody you regard as a model makes you more likely to adopt what they tell you to do, what they teach you, then you would expect this number, you would expect all these numbers to be positive and significant, they're all negative. Yeah, thankfully they are not significantly negative but they're all negative, except for this one, which is borderline significant. But Marcel, the teacher trainee has been nominated by somebody, right? They're all above median nominations. Isn't that? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. There's four above median and two below median. Okay, so is this coming from the above median or the below median or is it the same, no matter which? So what I'm trying to get at is, I think your interpretation was it doesn't, you don't have to be a model farmer. You're equally effective at disseminating, I think is what you were saying, but I'm saying that out of six, four were considered, model by a larger number of people, right? So I may not have nominated them, but my neighbor nominated them. So they're probably still pretty good. Yeah, it's a good idea, we could do that. We haven't done that, we could do that. We could compare, we could do that. That goes in the direction of what Dilip was mentioning earlier, basically looking at the, yes, we could also, I mean, we haven't done that. We, of course, we have the whole network of recommendations. So we could see with the extent, how much variation we have in centrality for, in degree centrality, in this case in centrality or even more sophisticated measure of centrality. Yeah, this is something we could do. Yeah, yeah, this is a good suggestion, thanks. Thank you. Um, okay, but in terms of being matched to somebody who didn't nominate doesn't seem to disenfranchise you here. So, but I see what you hear, what you are saying. And you say, well, maybe it's because, you know, what if you have been matched with somebody who was nominated by lots of people? Maybe that's what the role model would be. Okay, so for that, I need to document the fact that what is the variation in centrality? And because if there's not much variation in centrality, everybody mentions their five neighbors, and basically everybody's the same. There's no, there's no central. That is a good, yeah, it's a very good point. I will do that. We'll do that if we will add to the paper, thanks. Okay, so this is now, again, looking at the average, I have to be careful, we only have 15 minutes left. The average treatment on agricultural performance, these are now in log, because, you know, there's noise in the data, especially these values is always noise. So if you take log, it kind of dampens a little bit the upper tail and don't have to winds or ice and all that. So, the news is that in terms of yields, you get slightly higher yields. This is so basically 7% higher yield for teacher training, 4% for the 5% for the students. And in terms of profit, they get about 14, the teachers get about 14% high profit, 9% and 14% compared to the control. So there is some benefit that is achieved through that. It's not just that they learn to mimic what they've been told, they also actually benefit from that. So that's stupid news. So now we, so that's all about average treatment effect. So now I want to focus a little bit more about, I want to do a little bit more, I want to compare the students depending on whether their teacher is incentivized or not. So basically, this is the mean for unincentivized teachers and this is the mean, the additional increase in score in the quiz of students who have been assigned to an incentivized teacher training. And you can see there's a little bit significant or mindless significant improvement in a little bit stronger if you look as to whether they answered the three main questions correctly. So that means that incentivizing the teacher seems to have induced the teacher to do a slightly better job in teaching them to the test, of course, in teaching them to take the test. And this is whether, we also look as to whether it has an effect on the teachers. So basically, do the teachers do better on the test because they thought they know they had to teach the test. There we don't see, well, there's a positive, but coefficient here, but it's definitely not significant. And you can see that the teachers do in general very, very well on the test. So it looks like they were paying attention, knowing that they're going to be teachers, not doesn't really depend on them being incentivized. This is the effect of, or rather the absence of effect of, so you see that if you incentivize the teacher, the students do a little bit better on the test, does it translate in high adoption? The answer is no. So yeah, we have slightly, the point estimates are very small, the nothing is ever significant, and there is a very large relative to the coefficient. So basically there's no, that incentivization did not induce more adoption. And it also did not induce more adoption by the teachers. The reason why we worry about that is, is because in the other paper, the one we did on referrals, what we found is that the farmers who referred or the farmers, the other farmers kind of learned about that. They know that they've been referred, oh yeah, Marcel, you're referring me, okay. And then so Marcel suddenly decides, oh, now he's observing me, he knows that I referred him, so maybe I should put my money where my mouth is. So basically, I'd better adopt a little bit or pretend to adopt a little bit so that I don't completely, don't look completely silly to have recommended this person for training. Otherwise they would say, why did you send me something completely useful? So to do something completely useless, sorry. So that's why we just looked this to, they didn't do that here, they didn't do that. We did not induce excess adoption by teachers, by incentivizing them, which is something is good news. Now, so this is about incentivization, this is about the other treatment, whether you are assigned to a teacher that you dominated or not. So does it affect the performance of the student on the quiz? Well, there's a point estimate which is positive here, but it's definitely not significant. Same thing here, this is very small. So basically the answer is no, the fact that you are assigned to somebody you regard as, you listed as a role model, doesn't affect how much you learn from them, even on the quiz. And this is what happens on your adoption itself. If anything, there's one thing here that's negative, but which I kind of already saw before, borderline significant 10% level. But other than that, it's all negative. And so, let's just confirm what we already looked at before. What about mediation analysis? It's going into a bigger direction of heterogeneity analysis. So here basically we're gonna, we're gonna think about what could be the process by which the teacher is inducing adoption. Is it because he's transferring more knowledge and this knowledge is useful for adoption? Well, you have to know what the practices are before you can actually follow them and the measure is following that. Or is it that people follow the example? So basically, if the teacher is adopting and maybe you can take the trainees to the field or at least you can talk them through it on the field. So that's the, so to do that, basically we thought, well, why don't we put, so this is the incentivized teacher trainee. And then we thought, well, if it is, this is not, this is the quiz performance of it. Sorry. I think this is not a teacher's value, it's the student's value of the, so basically if the effect of, is, no, no, this is, okay, sorry, sorry. I got confused for a second. This is the effect on the students' performance in the quiz. This is the student and the quiz. And basically students whose teacher does better on the quiz also do better on the quiz. So basically there's some transmission of knowledge from the teacher to the student. So teachers who learn more, translate more to their students. Even controlling for the fact that the teacher may have been incentivized. So we control for that. So that here is a control. We're just looking whether the transmission is through, at least some of the transmission is through knowledge transmission. The teachers who learn more, transfer more to their students. And this is by nominate, the same thing by nomination status. So again, you know, this is also there. This is the effect of the quiz score on adoption. And so basically you look as to whether this has an effect on adoption as well. And so you get a couple significant terms there, but other than that, it seems to be pretty flat. And the same thing is reproduced if you compare nominating students, instead of comparing incentivized teacher-training students to non-incentivized teacher-training students. So basically what this says is that performance on the quiz score of the teacher just has some transmission to adoption, suggesting that knowledge is one of the channels of transmission. As you would expect, I mean, you would hope this is true, but now we have to look at the other thing, which is teaching by example. So here we're looking at the teacher's value of the corresponding adoption measure. So basically, are people more likely to adopt is if the teacher adopts? Are the people more likely to plant on a large proportion of their land if the teacher does that and so on? So basically we can see that in all these cases that these things are positive. The only exception being this one where teachers are already quite high start with. So there's not, perhaps a bit less variation there, but so what we find is that it's basically evidence that both channels are operating here. One is that if you are taught by a better teacher, someone who has paid more attention to the course knows more, you do, you adopt more. It's a channel of transmission. And you also know better on the quiz. And then the other thing is that if the teacher adopts, you seem to be more likely to follow his example. So these two things are there. So the last thing I'm gonna do in the three minutes I have, I should have stopped earlier, but so we also would like to know whether inviting trainees to be a teacher has an effect on their adoption. Not relative to their students, but relative to trainees who would not have received this task of training other students. So fortunately we have this other experiment we ran. It's also an RCT. And in that experiment, we have a whole batch of trainees who were randomly selected among the 30 farmers and we're only trained. They only receive the training. So we can kind of compare them to the teachers. So that's basically what we do in this first comparison here. And what you find is that, so P2P, the me is basically means that you were in the teacher training experiment and not in the other experiment. But what you find is that, so if the average adoption of the randomly selected trainees in the other experiment was 36%, then among our teacher training, we know it's like close to 70%. So it's basically 34% higher than that. Okay, so that's the idea. But basically what you get is that, inviting people to be teacher training makes them adopt more. And it doesn't necessarily do that for the, for the food. These other comparisons are not more significant, perhaps the surprise is that the student farmers, if you compare them to other trainees, they're not that, sometimes a little bit less, sometimes a bit more, but they're not massively different from people who actually receive the BRAC training, which I think is quite remarkable. These are people who have not seen any BRAC training agent. But they basically, all they have learned about is how to exercise from other farmers. And the adoption and behavior in more general is relative similar to people who in the other, in the other experiment, receive a training directly from BRAC. We do a small, back of the envelope cost benefit analysis, the details of the calculation side in the appendix, we estimate a social return of two points, basically you value the profits and so on, and compare it to the cost that we have incurred. And you get a 2.25 dollars per dollar invested in the program, which generates a rate of return, a social rate of return of 150%, which is not bad. It's lower than what we got in the other experiment, but the other experiment suggested that if you incentivize, if you push people, they tend to over adopt. So they basically, you induce them to experiment with the technology and then everything experimented, they discovered it's not for them, it's too difficult for them, and then they withdraw from the technology the year after we noticed that. So here by inducing more people to adopt, it's great we have induced lots of people to experiment, but as we said, SRI is not for everybody. And so as a result, maybe there's access, if you want access experimentation, you don't need to access, but you get lots of people to experiment who don't necessarily benefit from it, certainly not in the first year they try it. So that's the kind of the general lesson here. And maybe I should stop here. And if there's still time for questions, if people still have questions. We have any questions from the audience? So Marcelle, just to follow up on Dillip's earlier question, you don't really look at heterogeneity with respect to any characteristics of either the teachers or the students. No. And that because of lack of power or lack of data or lack of youth, or you think it's not really identified? It's probably due to perceived lack of patience for it by editors and referees. I think that's the, all you are picking winners, you go, you have 27 heterogeneity tests, you just report the one that gives you a big kick. And then in any case, it's not experimentally assigned and so on. So we try to, but I think that the, but you have given me some suggestion for, I really liked the suggestion earlier about looking at the nominations. I think it's a very good suggestion and we should do that in the paper because it really fits in the paper. It fits in the motivation of the paper and it's of course related to what Dilip was saying as well. So yeah. I had another sort of broader question here. It's, I mean, can you reject the story where there's this one kind of heterogeneity which is a skill and the nominations basically were a way to identify the most skilled farmers and the students themselves were selected by BRAC on the basis of something which I probably assume is related to forming skill. So you've already got a pre-selected, high-skilled farmers and then within them, you're selecting the most skilled and they just happen to be teachers. So can you reject the hypothesis that it's just about selection of skill, that all this teaching stuff is not doing anything? I mean, of course, there's some diffusion obviously, but basically, it's not nothing to do with skill in teaching or anything like that. I mean, it's just skill in picking up stuff that's now generally available in the village. No, but I mean, that's fine, but it's not true that we've only selected as teachers those that were the most skilled as measured by the number of nominations they received. We have four people among the... But it was biased in favor of the people with high nominations. So I think doing what Sujata was suggesting is a good idea is actually, why not just look at the number of nominations that you received and just look at how performance varied with that? That would be one way. Hey, yeah, I can do that. I can do that. But remember, in terms of the test itself, I mean, we have corrected for the stratification. So I don't think that's the... I don't think that is invalidating our results because we've thought about... No, it's a different interpretation. I'm just saying I'm not disputing the statistical validity of your results. It's just a question of what you think is sort of going on underneath whether teaching has anything to do with it. Yes. So in the first experiment, one with 182 or whatever villages where you didn't ask them to teach, but did you select them the same way? It was simpler because we were not trying too much. But okay, so... So in that experiment, the start is the same. We take 30... Brax shows up, picks their 30 farmers because that's the way they kind of line up farmers for SRI training. So they kind of identify them and then they keep them. Then they bring the training agent. So they train them in groups of 12. So basically, randomly selected 12 farmers of the 30 and assign them to the first training session. And then at the end of the training session, each of them was asked to... So they were 18 farmers left on the list. So before they left, they say, oh, before you leave, because they get paid their little stipend. So before you... Here's a list, pick a name on the list as to who would most benefit from the Brax training. So they basically look at the list and say, oh, okay, as I can see, Albert's on the list. So I'm gonna mention Albert. And then the next person comes and say, oh, I'm gonna mention Albert too. No, no, no, look, it's already been crossed. You can't mention Albert anymore if you mentioned someone else. Okay, I'm gonna mention two, just that. So they basically even mentioned someone else. Basically, then you can see the people who have been... So in that paper, we actually use that at order if you want to see... The bottom line is that they did not, they did not recommend on average. So remember, they recommend 12 people out of 18. So normally you should, you know, that the six worst farmers, at least able farmers, at least skilled farmers should have been dropped out of the list. So you should basically see that this selected sample of 12 out of 18 farmers should be better than the 12 randomly selected farmers. Right? Because the second sample is only 2 third of the 18 and they've been selected to be the more skilled farmers. So you should see that they are adopting more because they understand what's going on and they get more benefit from it. That's not what we find at all. So the reason I was asking, was I was wondering if that helps you answer Dilip's question about whether there's something about having to teach that makes you a better adopter yourself, but you can't actually answer that question because the way that these teachers, those guys were selected is different. It's random. They're not both being selected the same way and some get to teach and others don't get to teach. It's not as simple as that. Everybody could have been selected to teach. Everybody has a probability of being selected. If you are over 15 above medium, you have four out of 15 chances. If you are above the 15, you have two out of 15 chances. Everybody could be a teacher. And we correct for the probabilities of you being a teacher. Yeah, I do understand that. Okay. I think we're a little bit past time. So I'd like to thank myself. Very interesting presentation. And I'd like to thank, I also want to thank the staff at IEMS who have been coordinating the webinars for all six seminars. So that's Carla who's managing today, Carla Chan and Joey Chu, who's a manager at IEMS. I think it's been really well managed. So, you know, silent applause. And this was obviously a second best event in lieu of having a workshop in person. But I think it's been really valuable in the world of COVID to still be able to have some intellectual exchange and bring, you know, leading people working on common issues of interest. So I want to thank all the participants. Yeah, I appreciate it very much. You having me, I really enjoyed it. And thanks for the excellent comments. Thank you. Thank you, Marcelle. Goodbye, everyone. Bye.",
