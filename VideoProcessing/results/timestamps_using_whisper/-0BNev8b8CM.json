  "text": "The soil fertility testing market is set to exceed $2.4 billion by 2034, growing at a robust CAGR of 6.4%. Soil testing is crucial for assessing nutrient content, pH, and organic matter, helping farmers optimize crop yields. Soil fertility testing supports sustainable practices in agriculture, horticulture, and landscaping. By 2030, exponential growth is expected with the rise of AI and IoT in soil testing for real-time data. By 2034, advanced automated solutions will dominate, addressing global food security and climate change. Key drivers include the rise of organic markets requiring certified soil health and increasing food demand. Challenges like a lack of standardized testing procedures can impact soil data reliability and agricultural productivity. In the US, precision agriculture maximizes yields, while in China, modernization boosts demand for detailed soil analysis. Soil fertility testing is essential for sustainable farming and food security, paving the way for smarter agricultural practices.",
