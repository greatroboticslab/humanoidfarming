When the government came to power in 1986, it was giving out hand holes. The generation of hand holes has gone away now it is time to give out tractors. And if tractors can come to the district, now they have descended down to clans. Now what exactly do you expect? This is initiative for president Mus\u00e9veni to komashu reiza gurukaricha to make sure that people do mass production. Abiola Musuki, researchers captain of Dambogo clan in Kagadi District says there is need for government intervention in supervision and servicing of the firm equipment, so that it does not become a burden to farmers who need to change from subsistence to commercial agriculture. The communication is that to see how the machine is being used. to see how it is being serviced particularly because the machine that is going to be used for mechanization agricultural mechanization the goya has constant supervision, servicing and repairs so I request for government not to sit us Benad mumbere, sekt viewer of Mbogo clan, applauded government for giving them tractors. He asked the general community in Kagadi to embrace the opportunity so that they all benefit from the government programs. It's trying it's level best to make sure that everything is mechanized, especially in agriculture mechanization. We appreciate the opportunity given to us as the people of Kagadi district and the Fumambogo clan that have been able to get a try. This machine is not only for the Fumambogo clan, this machine is for everybody because for us we want every person who wants to practice agriculture to come and use it. I want to appreciate the effort of government for giving us this tractor and my appeal to the people of Kagadi is to make sure that we use it. Farmers and Fumambogo promise to utilize the equipment. Farmers, when the mechanical work is applied, the work becomes easier, more than manual work. That is what I am most assured of the people. Let us use this chance as people of Kagadi and around the Kagadi district. This becomes the third tractor in Kagadi district being distributed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Moll industry and Fisheries with the sole purpose of mechanizing agriculture to ensure economic transformation. The first batch of 26 tractors was distributed in the districts of Hoima, Masindi, Kakumiro, Kagadi, Chhenjojo, Chegegwa and Mwabende. Report compiled by Thomas Tumwewazi for the news.",
