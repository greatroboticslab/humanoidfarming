  "text": "A lot of folks keep asking about the hydraulic top link for the Summit tractor that we're using. This is something I got off of Amazon. So we'll post the link down below and also put a listing on our website so you know what one to get. We don't sell this ourselves. It's just something that actually another customer who had this tractor recommended to us, so I bought one too. One of the handiest things you can get to make adjustments on the fly with a greater blade of some kind or even hooking up to attachments. If you have a quick hitch, you can back right up to something, hook up to it, unhook it. It's just a breeze. I mean, if you have a rear remote on your tractor, like what the Summit has, spend a few hundred bucks, get a hydraulic top link, you won't regret it.",
