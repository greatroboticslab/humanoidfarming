This vegetable contains 17 different amino acids including the 9 essential amino acids which your body cannot produce on its own. It's low in fat and sugar, high in fiber and has several healthy vitamins and minerals. The most common mineral found in heart of palm is potassium. There are also an excellent source of protein which is very uncommon in vegetables.",
